She took the opportunity to call Maggie and schedule another session before thinking over the rest of her day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksonhad suggested she organize a small dinner party. Though their marriage was already public knowledge, politics dictated that certain people be told in a more private manner. In addition, in a couple of months, they would spend a week inLos Angeles, socializing with those who lived in the heart of the moviemaking world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving kept her ear to the ground, she had no problem preparing a list of invitees. By eleven, she had the wheels rolling and was beginning to feel a little more settled. This was work, she realized. Very delicate work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksonneeded these people to be willing to cooperate with him. Bonnie had antagonized a large number of them and the fallout had hit the beautiful manTaylorhad married. When the papers had ripped into him, not many in the business had come forward to defend him, still smarting from their brushes with his wife, and the coldnessJacksonhad cultivated to survive her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the day, she was wearing a satisfied smile, sure of her ability to be the partnerJackson needed. Flush with newfound confidence, she was waiting impatiently at the top of the driveway when her men arrived home\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; her brother had stayed late to try out for soccer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" she asked Nick as soon as he got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled slowly. \"They want me to be goalie. The coach said I had quick hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcited for him, she hugged his thin frame. \"Well done. Now get in there and shower, you muddy hooligan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he\u0027d run off, she turned toJackson. \"I\u0027m glad you talked me into letting him try out.\" When Nick had asked her to sign the permission slip, her instinct had been to refuse. What if he was hurt? Then she\u0027d glanced atJacksonand the look in his eyes had made her change her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad I talked you into marrying me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unexpected response made her very pleased with her Italian husband. She smiled, stood on her tiptoes, and leisurely kissed him. He deserved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flashbulb went off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, she jerked back.Jacksonimmediately shielded her with his body. But, before he could speak, she made a judgment call and moved around him. Though she hadn\u0027t wanted to be in his world, she now was and had to learn to deal with the repercussions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello.\" She smiled at the defiant man in front of them, wondering how he\u0027d evaded the fence alarms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to use that kissing picture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He held his camera protectively, obviously aware that he was trespassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t.\" Because paparazzi weren\u0027t known for their kindness, she asked, \"How about a deal?\" Feeling her husband\u0027s rising temper, she surreptitiously dug her elbow into his rock-hard stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you offering then?\" The photographer\u0027s accent was distinctly British.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We cooperate with you for photos and give you a quote. It would be an exclusive on our marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked atJackson. \"Good deal if you stick to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to surrender that whole roll of film.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you trust me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as far as I can throw you,\" she said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed her the film, a wary look in his eye. \"Do you want your husband looking like a murderer in thepics ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give us a moment.\" She turned and forcedJacksonto come with her until they were out of earshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked furious. \"What the hell are you doing bargaining with that vulture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see hurt in his eyes. These people had turned his pain into a spectator sport and here she was, consorting with them. She touched his arm. \"Whether we cooperate or not, they\u0027ll get pictures. This way, we have some control over the first impression people have of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Manipulate the media? Dangerous game.\" Yet, there was a spark of interest in his enigmatic eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The truthis, your status in the business means we have to exist in the limelight at times. We can fight the press and lose, or we can use them to our advantage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you suggest I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that he was taking her lead made her glow. Unbidden, she recalled her conclusion that her wild husband could be gentled, if not fought. She leaned up and straightened the collar of his black shirt. \"You look gorgeous\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; tall, dark and dangerous. Just act as you\u0027d do if you didn\u0027t want to eat a photographer for breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought he might have smiled. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching up, she unclipped her barrette and let her hair fall over her long-sleeved blue top. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey posed withJacksonwrapping his arms around her from behind. The photographer started snapping away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped him at shot ten. \"Enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you got any photos of Nick?\"Jacksonasked. Her heart jerked in panic. She hadn\u0027t even thought of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photographer\u0027s eyes shifted. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you use them, the deal is off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People want to know.\" It was a halfhearted attempt to justify himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone who uses Nick will find their life being made very difficult.\"Jackson\u0027s icy calm emphasized the threat. \"You know how this works. I can\u0027t stop you invading my life, but his is off-limits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man sighed butTaylorthought that he was happy enough. He yielded another roll of film. Ten minutes later, he had his quotes and was gone.Jacksonimmediately rang his security company and ordered them to check the fence alarms now! Then he hauled a surprisedTaylorto him and proceeded to kiss her senseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Nick went to bed that night,Taylortracked down her husband. He was in his study, staring at the front page of an old newspaper. She recognized it at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurious, she snatched the paper from him. \"Why are you hurting yourself like this?\" This piece of gutter journalism had blamed him forBonnie\u0027s death, implying that domestic violence had caused her suicidal depression. Eyes narrowed, she scanned the room and found other newspaper clippings in an open file box on his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I wonder if I could\u0027ve stopped her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing the file box, she walked over to the shredder in the corner and started feeding in paper. \"This is what I think of that ridiculous suggestion.\" She was so angry, her hands shook. God, she hated Bonnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat woman had hurtJacksonso much that he\u0027d probably never trust another woman enough to love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that she wanted the complications of love ... or did she? Did she want everything JacksonSantorini\u0027s heart was capable of feeling? Could she cope with such passion?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taylor, you don\u0027t know - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you put drugs in her hands? Did you find her a lover to cheat with?\" Her words were clipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInwardly, she was cursing the photographer who\u0027d resurrected the past with his mere presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth firmed. \"Don\u0027t go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finished shredding and swiveled around to face him, throwing the empty box aside. \"Why not? Let\u0027s have this out, right here, right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" He\u0027d never sounded more intimidating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See me? I\u0027m your wife now, not Bonnie!\" She slapped her hand against her chest. \"And I don\u0027t do secrets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want to know?\" Dressed in black, arms folded, he looked exactly what he was\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; a big, strong Italian male unused to taking orders from his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA male who\u0027d been betrayed by one wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir friendship had eased her way butTaylorknew that she couldn\u0027t expect total trust until she\u0027d earned it. But she refused to be the only one in this marriage who was starting to feel in over her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop acting like an enforcer for your famiglia and giving me a crick in my neck. Sit down.\" She walked around the desk and patted the back of his leather chair, expecting him to balk on principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her complete surprise, he obeyed. \"Satisfied?\" There was an edge to his voice. For some reason of his own, he was letting her dictate to him, but it obviously chafed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. This is better.\" Fighting his ability to distance himself, she perched on his lap, relieved when his arm encircled her waist. \"Why are you angry?\" She hated the way anger made him cold, hadn\u0027t realized until now just how dependent she\u0027d become on the attention he lavished on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re imagining it.\" He sounded irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksonwondered why he was allowing her to see his aggravation. He had no intention of revealing that he\u0027d found her practical response to the media a blow to his emotions. He\u0027d made this bargain with her and she was definitely keeping up her end of it. It was his problem that he hungered for more from his wife than practicality and logic. Damn this sudden vulnerability!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a tense moment of utter silence, she looked up and shoved at his shoulders. He held her tight, shocked at the blazing anger in her blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then keep your secrets, I don\u0027t care!\" Too late, he remembered his little wife\u0027s big temper. \"All I wanted to do was protect you and this is what I get in return!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtect him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A big, brooding man who doesn\u0027t appreciate me. Who doesn\u0027t care that I\u0027m just trying to keep the vultures happy so they don\u0027t peck at him! Who gets mad at me for noreason! \" She opened her mouth to continue and unable to think of how else to stop her tirade, he kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe refused to cooperate, wrenching her head away. \"No. Don\u0027t you kiss me when I\u0027m angry, Jackson Santorini ! You\u0027re not seducing me out of being annoyed with you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksonwas stunned speechless. No one had ever accused him of using sex to control. Then again, no one had ever wanted him with the passionate hunger of his wife. \" Cara mia.\" He was appeased by her confession of protectiveness. \"I did not know that was why you did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why else would I have done it? I was so worried for you, I didn\u0027t even think about Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had no reason to imagine they would sink low enough to exploit a child.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-to-pleasure/page-22.html","bookId":1881,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:23 PM"}
