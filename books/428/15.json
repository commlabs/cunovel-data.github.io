DEAN MEETS AN ADVENTUROUS YOUNG MAN.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Adin Dunham and his wife were surprised and dazzled by the brilliant prospects of their nephew. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did this Mr. Kirby really agree to pay you twenty-five dollars a month, Dean?\" asked the carpenter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, uncle, and he asked if it would be satisfactory.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It seems strange,\" mused Adin. \"Why, when I was your age I was workin\u0027 for fifty cents a week and my board.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I get board, too, Uncle Adin.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s a great offer. And you\u0027re a stranger to him too.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; he took me on Squire Bates\u0027s recommendation.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should have thought he\u0027d have wanted the place for his own boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Brandon would like to leave Waterford, but I don\u0027t believe he wants to work. It is all the better for me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t believe in boys being idle, but there\u0027s no99 call for Brandon Bates to work if he don\u0027t want to. The squire\u0027s rich enough.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then the carpenter\u0027s brow contracted in perplexity. He couldn\u0027t understand why a rich man should take what did not belong to him, and he had never got over the impression made on him on the day of the robbery by the long tusk-like teeth of the masked figure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Father,\" said Mrs. Dunham anxiously, \"do you think it\u0027s safe for a boy as young as Dean to go out into the world alone? He\u0027s only a child.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m almost sixteen, aunt,\" said Dean mortified.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 of the world.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Neither do you or I, wife, though we\u0027re both risin\u0027 sixty. Dean has got to take his chances. I hope this Kirby\u0027s a likely man. What does he look like, Dean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I don\u0027t fancy his appearance much,\" Dean admitted. \"He is very dark and sallow, and there\u0027s something queer about the eyes. But I suppose he can\u0027t help his looks.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Handsome is that handsome does,\" replied Mrs. Dunham. \"I\u0027ve heard tell that villains is sometimes very scrumptious in appearance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I guess he\u0027s all right, aunt. He didn\u0027t make himself, you know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish you hadn\u0027t got to go to New York alone, Dean. Don\u0027t you think Mr. Kirby\u0027d wait a day, and then you could go with him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I want to go alone, aunt. I hope I\u0027m smart enough to find my way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 100\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We\u0027ll trust him, wife,\" said Adin Dunham. \"He means we\u0027ll, and if he\u0027s keerful he\u0027ll come out all right.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At length the morning came for Dean\u0027s departure. He bade good-bye to the old folks, and walked proudly to the railroad station with a bundle of clothing under his arm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rather to his surprise he found Squire Bates at the little depot, walking up and down on the platform.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So you\u0027re starting, are you, Dean?\" said the squire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you\u0027ll do your duty by your employer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall try to do so, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have indorsed you, and he has taken you on my recommendation.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I ought to thank you for that, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I take it for granted that you will verify the good things I have said of you. If you don\u0027t—if you throw discredit on me and on your worthy uncle and aunt, why then—\" and he paused.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean listened to hear how he would end the sentence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then,\" resumed the squire, \"I honestly advise you to stay away, and not return to Waterford.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I won\u0027t come back unless I can come back with a good record,\" said Dean impetuously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A good resolution! Stick to it, my lad.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The train came up with a rush, and Dean got on board He was a little disturbed by the squire\u0027s parting words. Why should he harp so much on Dean\u0027s acting discreditably?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 101\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It almost seems as if he expected I would,\" soliloquized Dean. \"If I know myself, I know that I am honest, industrious and faithful. Mr. Kirby won\u0027t be disappointed in me, unless he is an unreasonable man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Waterford was about fifty miles from New York, and the journey consumed two hours. Dean was considerably interested in looking out of the window at the towns along the railroad. But besides this, he scanned the faces of the passengers around him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just behind him was a boy about his own age, who after a while leaned over and said, \"Come back here and sit with me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean was of a social disposition, and needed no second invitation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His new acquaintance was a pleasant-looking boy of sixteen, with dark hair and dark eyes, and a bright, alert look.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where are you going?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To New York.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you expect to stay there?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I am going to work for a gentleman whom I am to find at French\u0027s Hotel.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I know where that is.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you? Then you have the advantage of me. I was never in New York since I was a very little boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, it\u0027s easy enough to find it. We shall land at the Grand Central Depot. You can take a Fourth Avenue car in front of it, and it\u0027ll carry you right by French\u0027s Hotel.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 102\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is it far?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"About three miles, I guess.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s a good distance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It isn\u0027t much in the city. I didn\u0027t know you had a place. I was going to ask you to join me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why what are you going to do?\" Dean asked in some curiosity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You won\u0027t give me away, will you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I mean you won\u0027t tell my plans to any one?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not if you don\u0027t want me to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I\u0027m going out West,\" said the boy, nodding impressively.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are! Have you got friends there?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I\u0027m going in for a little excitement. I\u0027m going out West to hunt Indians!\" and the speaker eyed Dean to see how he was impressed by the declaration.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But what good is that going to do you?\" asked Dean, perplexed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, there\u0027ll be no end of excitement. It\u0027ll show what I am made of. I shouldn\u0027t wonder if some writer would make a story out of my adventures.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But suppose the Indians should hunt you?\" suggested Dean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I must take my chance of that,\" answered the boy loftily. \"If there wasn\u0027t any risk, there wouldn\u0027t be any excitement or glory.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are your folks willing you should go?\" queried Dean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; they don\u0027t know where I am. I left home on the sly.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 103\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Won\u0027t they worry about you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just at first, but I shall write to them when I am far enough away. They\u0027ll be proud enough of me, when they read about my exploits. Maybe there\u0027ll be a play written about me. When I get home I shouldn\u0027t mind going round, playing in it myself. Have you got any money?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, only my fare to New York and a quarter over.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then it would be no use for you to go with me. It\u0027ll take money to get out West, and to pay for a gun and ammunition. I shall get them at Chicago, I think.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you considerable money with you?\" Dean ventured to inquire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A little over a hundred dollars. You see I had that much in the Savings Bank. It\u0027s presents I\u0027ve got from different persons in the last five years. I drew it all out a day or two since, and decided to start out in search of glory.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think you ought to go without letting your folks know about it,\" said Dean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, they would oppose it, of course. They think I\u0027m a baby, but I\u0027m a year older than Daredevil Dick, the Young Hunter of the Rio Grande. I suppose you\u0027ve read about him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I never heard of him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I thought everybody had heard of him. I think I\u0027m smart enough to do as much as he did.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean learned that his young companion\u0027s name was Guy Gladstone, and that his father was born in104 England, but had come to America at an early age, and was a successful manufacturer. Guy would not tell him where his parents lived.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As their train ran into the depot, Guy said, \"I guess I\u0027ll go to French\u0027s with you and stay one night. I shan\u0027t remain in the city any longer for fear my friends will track me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81481.html","bookId":428,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:01 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:01 AM"}
