Can you hook me up with a race once this is done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place both of my hands on the car and lean over to inspect the engine. It’s not the original, which is good; otherwise, I’d hate doing anything to her. “If you’re looking for fast driving there’s a dragway in the southwestern part of the county. It opens next week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you race there?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” And I plan on spending a lot of time there over the next six weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isaiah.” Beth attempts to step in between us, but Logan angles himself so that she can’t. “That’s not why I brought him here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn insane glint strikes the guy’s eyes and all of a sudden, I feel a connection to him. A twitch of his lips shows he might be my kind of crazy. “How fast do the cars there go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some guys hit speeds of 120 mph in an eighth mile.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Beth stomps her foot. “No. I promised Ryan nothing crazy would happen. Logan, this is not why I brought you here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you hit those speeds?” He swats his hand at Beth as if she’s a fly, earning my respect. Most guys would be terrified of having their balls ripped off and handed to them for dismissing Beth like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not driving my car, I haven’t,” I answer honestly. But I hope to with Rachel’s car, and with mine, after a few modifications. “Speed can be bought. Just depends on how much you want to spend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan offers his hand. “I’m Logan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isaiah,” I say as we shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” mumbles Beth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMY ROOM IS PURPLE. THE walls, the throw rug over the white carpet, my comforter, my pillows, the floor-to-ceiling curtains—purple. Lavender really, but that’s just another way to say the word purple. I hate purple, but Mom doesn’t like green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in the middle of my four-poster bed and recount the money. Five hundred dollars. That’s what I have. Several pieces of jewelry rest on the pillow beside me. Those four pieces are the only ones I don’t think Mom would notice missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf my gowns weren’t in Mom’s closet, I could try selling those. While my mother can’t scrape up the ability to see who I am on the inside, she watches the outside like a hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone knocks. I flip the pillow over to hide the jewelry and wad the cash. The door opens and Ethan catches sight of the money right as I slam it into my jewelry box. He strides into my room and plops on the bed. The pillow shifts and I glance over to confirm the jewelry is still hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatcha doing?” he asks as he stares at the box full of cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buying a new part for your car?” Because in Ethan’s mind, it’s the only thing I would need cash for. After a lecture from my dad, Ethan knows I won’t put my car parts on the credit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. I’m paying off a psychopath. “Maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe and my brothers, we’re spoiled. Each of us has a credit card so we can buy whatever we desire, but that financial freedom also carries a burden. Dad meets with us each month and reviews our spending. Two years ago, when I’d spent too much on parts for my car, I wondered if the women tried in Salem for witchcraft sweated as much as I had. This afternoon, for a brief thirty seconds, I considered a cash advance on the card, but West had done that once and Dad was on his case within twenty-four hours. Turns out, Dad set certain alerts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need amnesty,” Ethan says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he does. “Tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burst of air rushes out of my mouth and moves my hair. “What if I have plans? It is Saturday night.” He and West always assume the social worst of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan’s face pales. “Do you? And if so, with who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I want to drive my car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls his eyes. “You can drive whenever you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan swings his feet off my bed. “You’re the best.” He pauses at the door frame. “By the way, what would you think of extending twin amnesty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick at the lint on my bed. “To how many?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother bobs his head as if he hasn’t already chosen a number. “Limitless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDread weighs on my chest. Ethan and West sometimes can be out all night and I’m not always that creative in the lies I spin to cover for them. “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sleep on it. And Rach.” The way he focuses on his sneakers makes the silence uncomfortable. Something that rarely happens between us. “I’m glad you’re helping Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rub the skin between my eyebrows, fighting any thoughts that could lead to anxiety. On the corner of my dresser, taunting me, is a speech I have to memorize by next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will...” He closes the door to my room and leans his back against it as if to lock everyone out or imprison me. “Will you tell Mom if you get sick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clutch a pillow to my chest. “Just leave me alone, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe you should talk to Mom and Dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then what?” I fling the pillow off the bed. “Mom freaks? Dad’s disappointed? You and West and Gavin and Jack get on me for being weak? No, thanks. Where was your pity when Jack laid into me the other night because I hadn’t said yes yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They wouldn’t have asked if they knew you still had panic attacks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgust weaves into my voice. “Look me in the eye and tell me that this family isn’t happier because I’m hiding what they can’t handle.” What I can’t handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I should tell them.” There’s an edge of seriousness to his tone that creates horror movie fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t.” I search for words. “You want Mom happy, just like everyone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but I keep thinking of you on that damn bathroom floor puking up your guts....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone vibrates, and my stupid heart stutters because there’s only one person who would call or text me—Isaiah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan eyes my cell. “Who’s texting you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my phone and try not to shake when I see Isaiah’s name. “West,” I lie. “He’s been having problems with his SUV because he forgot to change the oil again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Moron,” Ethan mutters then looks at me again. “Think about what I said. At least about the amnesty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” I struggle to keep my focus on my brother and not on the phone as Ethan leaves. If I don’t find a way to control my crazy emotions, Isaiah will only hurt me worse in six weeks when we pay Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeet me at the dragway at 7. My phone vibrates again with directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toss my cell across the bed and fall back onto my pillows with a loud huff. A demand. Not a request or even a please. A demand. Like he knows he’s all hot and mysterious and how I can’t stop obsessing over him. I shouldn’t go. I shouldn’t answer. I should stand my ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone vibrates again. With a sigh too dramatic to use without an audience, I kick the phone toward me. I read the words then smother a pillow over my face: bring your car gassed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I’m nothing more than a debt. Stupid, stupid me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy headlights flash across Isaiah as I park next to his black Mustang. With his back resting against his passenger door and his arms folded across his chest, he waits in the parking lot just like his texts said he would. The gravel beneath my tires cracks, and I hate the thought of rocks kicking up and hitting the paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inhale, then slowly release the air. I’m a debt. I mean nothing to him. I will not lose it. I will not yell. I will be calm and collected and everything other than the crashing emotions and anxiety brewing inside of me. He will not know that he hurt me. I may be weak, but I’m good at hiding how I really feel. Pretending he didn’t break my heart should be easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost tumble out of the car when the door swings open without my assistance. Isaiah offers a hand as if I need help. Because it’s a strange gesture and one that catches me off guard, I accept and then internally curse myself once his strong hand wraps around mine. Crap. I still like his hands on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closes my door, and the two of us stand there, holding hands, staring in silence. Well, almost silence; the sound of two engines simultaneously revving gains my attention. Isaiah smirks when I lean to the left to glimpse what’s behind the metal bleachers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis finger performs this swipe on the back of my hand that sends an electric shock through my body. The blaring lights from the dragway cast a shadow across Isaiah, and I shiver at how comfortable he appears in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a sweet sound,” he says referring to the engines, but all I hear is his deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug as if I don’t care, but yeah...that sound rocks, the engines and his voice. Take your hand back, Rach. He’s playing you. One of his fingers moves slowly against my skin again, and goose bumps rise on my arms. The annoying voice in my head repeats the warning, but I don’t listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t sure if you were coming.” He sounds both a little hurt and relieved. Good. I can’t contain the slight curve of my lips. I showed, but I also stood my ground by refusing to text back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You left your jacket at the garage. I’ve got it in the car, but it looks like you found another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that is sweet, but I’m still standing my ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Rachel,” he says with a smoothness that reminds me of silk. “Talk to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug again. Okay, I know, completely immature. I haven’t even played this game with my brothers in years, but Isaiah so deserves it. We’re business, he and I. I’m a debt. He wants to use my car so we can pay off Eric. Nowhere in that agreement does it indicate I have to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one swift motion, I find the courage to remove my hand and shove it into my coat pocket so Isaiah knows touching me is off-limits. It’s a warm night for January, upper fifties, yet I use my jacket as a shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. We’ll talk later.” He pulls on his bottom earring. “Let me show you the place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fall in step with him, and my eyes widen when I see the rows of cars looping around the metal bleachers, each waiting for their turn on the dragway. Mustangs, Camaros, Chargers, Novas, Chevelles, Corvettes. Oh, holy mother of God, the list is endless. All beautiful. All painted in reds or yellows or blacks or whites or blues or oranges—a glorious rainbow. All grumbling with the sounds of fantastic fast engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGathered under smaller streetlights, guys lean against their cars or stand in small groups and call out to Isaiah. He nods or says something in greeting. My world freezes when I notice the gorgeous black beauty near the front of the pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a 2004 Mustang Cobra,” I say. My head snaps to Isaiah, and I repeat what I said, emphasizing each word. “That is a 2004 Mustang Cobra.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licks his lips in a pathetic effort to conceal his smile. Yeah, whatever, I’m talking so he won, but who cares. That’s a 2004 Mustang Cobra. That is the car I have always dreamed of owning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know the guy who owns it,” he says. “Do you want a closer look?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crash-into-you-pushing-the-limits-3/page-25.html","bookId":2754,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM"}
