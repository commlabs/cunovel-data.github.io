Isaiah and I skipped this afternoon and went to Goodwill. Don’t you think it’s ironic that Goodwill has clothes for a private school? If you have money to go to a private school, you probably wouldn’t shop at Goodwill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth pops open with a million questions, but before I can ask any of them, Ethan appears by my side. “Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Abby,” she says. “And you are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ethan,” I answer. “He’s my twin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes dart between us. “You don’t look anything alike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a boy. She’s a girl. I sure as hell hope we don’t,” says Ethan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby flashes a daring smile. “I like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan ignores her statement. “How do you know Rachel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re friends,” she answers. “I go to that other rich school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widen as I understand. Blue-and-green uniform. Abby’s faking that she belongs in my world by pretending she goes to a school that is acceptable to my family. “Mason Academy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” she says. “That one. I’m new to town and met Rachel at the mall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat as Ethan automatically doesn’t buy anything that involves me and malls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parking lot,” adds Abby. “Mall parking lot. I had a flat. She helped. It was all serendipitous. I like bunnies. She likes bunnies. We totally clicked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan’s eyebrows furrow together as he assesses me. “You like bunnies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My brother dropped me off,” Abby continues, “because our school gets out before your school and you promised we could do girl stuff at your house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Abby,” I interrupt before she says anything else. “Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll meet you at home, Rach.” Ethan continues to eye Abby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Ethan safely in his car behind us and Abby in the passenger side, I let the questions flow. “What are you doing? How did you get here? What is going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you snort crack? Don’t answer. Isaiah said you lost your way out of the house past curfew. We bought these clothes, he dropped me off here, and ta-da...I’m your new best friend—private school–going, new in town, rich Abby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance in my rearview mirror. Ethan is hot on my tail. “I don’t get it. How is this supposed to help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Introduce me to your parents tonight and then I’ll invite you for a sleepover tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy entire body feels lighter. Isaiah thinks of everything. “Serendipitous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like it?” She waggles her eyebrows. “I learned it for today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 53\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOGAN HOVERS OVER THE ENGINE as I slide myself underneath. I’m changing the oil in my car, again. The engine’s been acting funny, and my gut tells me she’s close to overheating. The continued drag racing is aging my baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not feeling the cash flow tonight,” says Logan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, either.” The types of people we race do it for shits and giggles. Side bets are for those who feel cocky. Logan and I have kicked ass for two weekends straight. Tonight, we’ll have plenty of people who will race against us for bragging rights, but few will put up money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Explain bracket racing,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands hesitate as I work. Bracket racing. The thought has circled in my head. “They do it on Sundays. If you think you can hit an eighth mile in 10 seconds then you race against other cars that can do the same. Same rules apply at the line. You can’t go before the green, but they will give you a handicap. If the competition is a second faster than you, then you’ll get to leave a second faster. Whoever crosses the line first without breaking the green wins.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds fair enough,” says Logan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll out from underneath my car. “But if you say you can hit an eighth in 10 seconds and you take the finish line at 9.9 seconds, then you lose. You have to stay above 10 seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You pick your target, man. It’s like a game show. You pick the number you think you can take the finish line in without going over. If you go over that number, you lose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan scratches the back of his head. “That means we have to have an insane reaction time at the line and watch that we don’t go too fast, but fast enough to beat whoever we’re against all in a matter of seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the world got complicated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Always does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the draw?” says Logan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a pot for the first three finishers. The pot for a street car like mine isn’t worth the investment, but if we add a nitro system, then we could compete in a class where the money may be worth it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan gets that crazy glint in his eye anytime we discuss something that involves the cars going faster. “Then we should add a nitro system. I can’t think of anything holding you back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of us turn our heads to the sweet sound of Rachel’s Mustang pulling in. Sitting on the rolling board, I rest my arms on my bent knees and watch as my angel glides into the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan glances at her then me. “Think I discovered your issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” Nitro can be dangerous, and I don’t want the system in her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the used designer jeans and soft blue sweater we bought at the Goodwill, Abby looks like a completely different person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her brothers are hot. Annoying, but hot,” announces Abby. “Just saying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand, and Rachel weaves her arms around my neck. I kiss her lips. “Hey, angel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi.” Red touches her cheeks. Either because she hasn’t seen me in a week or because she’s staying the night with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look nice,” says Logan. Rachel and I turn to see Logan checking Abby out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I mention her brothers aren’t nearly as hot as you?” Abby flashes a sexy grin. She doesn’t release that smile often and flags shoot straight into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. Logan and Abby hooking up is not a good idea. She destroys guys and...I like Logan. “Logan, I forgot my seed money. Wanna come back with me to pick it up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss Rachel’s lips again. “Be back in a sec.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 54\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIDDLING WITH A WRENCH, I listen to Abby gush about my family. How insanely nice my parents are and how crazy it is that all of my brothers are good-looking. I’ll admit, I’m blessed. I have so much more than others, and on the outside my family is absolutely perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Rachel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head snaps up and Abby falls silent. My heart drums, and a cold sweat breaks out over my body, onto my palms. I swipe my hands against my jeans the moment I see the face that haunts my nightmares. “Eric.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strides into the garage as if he owns the place. His green army jacket engulfs his bony body. “Making new friends, Abby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby straightens beside me, and gone is the girl that I’ve come to know over the past couple of weeks. All emotion drains from her face and leaves a hardness that frightens me. “This isn’t your block, Eric. It belongs to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it belongs to the person you pay off to keep you and your family safe.” Eric makes a show of glancing over both of his shoulders before leaning into Abby. His nose nearly touches hers. “And I don’t see him here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t flinch. A creepy smile eases onto her face as she tosses her hair so she can stare him straight in the eye. “One phone call, Eric, and it’ll be raining fire and brimstone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I didn’t know better, I would have thought fear flashed in his eyes. “You’d let Isaiah be caught in the crosshairs? I don’t think so.” Eric switches his sights to me. “How’s it going with my money?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.” I rub my arms. The skin crawls as he invades my personal space. He’s so close that I smell his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Word on the street is that you might make deadline,” he breathes out as his eyes linger near my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross my arms, trying to hide what he’s focusing on. Adrenaline begins to leak into my bloodstream, and I silently pray for Isaiah to stride back into the door. Isaiah can fix this. He knows how to make me feel safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t let him get to you,” Abby says. “He’s like those damn annoying dogs always starved for attention and begging for scraps at the table. It’s best to pretend he doesn’t exist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch your mouth,” he mutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re pathetic and transparent. Isaiah won’t fall for your intimidation shit, which is why I’m guessing you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric tears his eyes away from Abby and this time stares at my lips. “How close are you really to paying me off? We could make a deal. You do something for me and I’ll provide a discount for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby appears at my side. “Step back, Eric.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirks. “Or what, Abby? You gonna jack up the prices on the drugs you sell? I’m aware of the service charge reserved only for me. You need to start rethinking your business practices.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head jerks and Abby falters. Our eyes meet and her calm, cold facade cracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric laughs. “She didn’t know that you’re a drug dealer, did she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Abby says nothing, Eric inches closer. I inch to the side, but Eric follows. Without thinking, I trapped myself against a wall. I don’t like how Eric looks at me. The panic begins to claw at my chest and I swallow. I need to stay in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you know that Isaiah is an addict? Uses like the rest of us street rats.” His eyes wander up, then down. “What kind of currency are you paying Isaiah to take on this debt? Not cash, I’m guessing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric raises his hand and all the air squeezes out of my lungs. I gasp right as he moves to touch my skin. He can’t touch me. I won’t let him. My hands thrust out and I push at his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger explodes in his dark, soulless eyes. He grabs my wrist, slamming it over my head into the concrete wall. I scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with my free hand I’m hitting and kicking and so is Abby and suddenly...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world spins, and I can’t find my bearings. There’s more yelling and more voices. Gravity overtakes me as I can’t inhale. Abby appears in front of me—dark eyes and hair. “Rachel!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby is free of Eric. We both are. I grab her, still struggling for air, and drag both of us as I stumble into the office. I need to make sure we’re safe—me and Abby. She’s my friend and I can’t leave her behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says things, things I don’t understand, and she strokes my hair while she talks. I can’t breathe. I can’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe disappears and in her place are gray storm clouds. “Breathe, angel. Come on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah. I wrap my arms around him, and he holds me—tightly. I listen to his heart: the steady beat, the steady pace, and within a few seconds I start to match his breathing. I inhale deeply one more time. “Isaiah.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crash-into-you-pushing-the-limits-3/page-41.html","bookId":2754,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM"}
