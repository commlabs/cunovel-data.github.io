She roared, her face contorted with anger. “Do not speak of her in my home!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She betrayed us all! She usurped Cneajna!” Elina declared. “She should be the one to die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He loved her best!” Ariana sobbed, sliding to the floor, her hands tangling in her hair. “He loved her more than us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCneajna grabbed the smallest vampire by her hair and wrenched her head back. “Do not say those words!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriana’s cries filled the crypt as Elina took a seductive step toward us. “Go back and kill her for us,” she whispered, her hands sliding over her nude body, her gaze provocative as it caught my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel her power pushing at my mind, trying to seize control of my thoughts, and make me her slave. I smiled, amused by her actions. I am immune to vampiric powers. The vampire cupped her breasts and licked her full lips, her eyes full of wanton promises. Not realizing I was not affected by the creature’s power, Magda threw her fire ball at Elina, forcing the vampire to spring back with a shriek. Collapsing at my feet, I knew Magda was spent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brides surged forward, sharp teeth bared, hands clawed. I drew out Lady Antoinetta’s rosary and the crypt exploded with bright light. The Brides screamed, twisting about, shielding their faces from the glory of the relic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheathing my sword, I quickly leaned down to lift Magda. She struggled to rise, drained of her power and strength. My arm about her waist, I heaved her to her feet as her arms slid around me. Her dark eyes strayed back to the silent, wilted form of Vlad Dracula.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should kill him,” she whispered, surrendering to my will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We cannot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting up the small rosary, burning with a fire that I did not truly understand, but was grateful for, I advanced on the three women cowering before us. They shrieked as I approached, scrambling back into the shadows. Tears of blood poured down the face of the beautiful princess as she bared her sharp teeth. The little one scrambled behind a pillar, crying out as the light touched her. The darker one retreated reluctantly, her long hair falling over her naked body as she raised a hand to shield her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrushing Magda against my side, I rushed across the chapel darting around the still burning coffin. I knew the Brides were following, for the relic remained illuminated in my grip. It would remain a light on our path until the Brides gave up their pursuit. I could sense them slinking along in the shadows as I reached the entrance to the stairwell. Pressing the beaded chain of the rosary into Magda’s hand I pushed her forward. Stumbling, she made her way up the stairs, the unearthly light illuminating her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to gaze back into the chapel as I drew my silver dagger. I knew the Brides would pursue us out of hunger and loyalty to their fallen master. The dying embers of the destroyed coffin illuminated the pale form of Princess Cneajna as she watched us attempt to escape. Tilting her head slightly, she let out a low cackle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaped back as the dark bride lashed out at me from above. I fell back on the stairs to witness her crawl along the ceiling. Her dark eyes glimmered with red fire as she bared her fangs and her long nails swept through the air above my head. I leaped to my feet, grabbed her long hair, and wrenched her down. My silver dagger sliced deep into her chest as she fell, her blood pouring out in a cold gush. It was not a killing blow, but it sent the vampire to her knees. She wailed in pain as she crumpled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetreating up the stairs, I watched as the little Bride threw herself over the fallen form of her sister. Princess Cneajna’s eyes flashed with dark rage as she began to move swiftly after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and ran up the darkened stairwell after Magda. Lord Astir had been clear. I was not to kill the vampire Brides, but I could prevent them from killing Magda or harming me. The light from above barely illuminated my way as I bound up the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think you can escape me?” Cneajna whispered from the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I do,” I responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel her power swelling and boiling up the stairwell behind me. Out of all the Brides, she was the strongest. According to her stature in the household, she would be the one to feed first. I was certain she had taken most of the blood from the gypsies they had managed to slaughter since their confinement had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the brush of her hand against my back. I whirled about with my dagger arcing to slice through her cold flesh, but it slid through empty air. Her arms seized me from behind as her fangs burrowed into my throat. I gritted my teeth against the agony of her bite as she drew in one long draught of my blood. Gagging, her mouth released me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poison!” she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGripping her arms tightly, I sharply bent forward, her body sliding over my head and hurtling downward. Her pale form was swallowed up by the darkness. I sprinted up the remaining stairs and burst into the long corridor. I was certain I was only a few steps before my pursuers. Magda was at the far end of the hall with her arm raised to use the rosary as a torchlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Behind you,” she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Run, Magda!” I shouted as I unsheathed my second dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinning about, I caught the smaller vampire with the blade, slicing deep into her throat. She shrieked, raked my face with her nails, and slid back into the shadows. Ignoring the burning pain of my wounded neck and face, I ran after Magda. I could hear the Brides racing along the walls and ceiling, hidden from my view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Magda, they are coming!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer scream echoed through the castle, and I stumbled through a darkened doorway before spotting the light of the rosary ahead. She was crouched in a corner, holding her hand up over her head as the two dark haired Brides skittered away from the light into the blackness looming in the rafters. Snagging Magda about the waist, I pulled her along as we plunged down the hallway that would lead us back to the kitchens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear the Brides scurrying along behind us, hoping we would falter, so they could attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is poison,” Cneajna’s voice slithered through the corridor. “Kill him, feast on the girl!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda faltered in her steps as I dragged her along. The Brides faded in and out of view, crouching in doorways, sliding up the walls, floating above us. I could feel Magda’s heart beating rapidly in her bosom. They were taunting us, attempting to terrify us, and despite my long years dealing with the undead, I felt fear well within me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew they could not kill me, but if they wounded me sufficiently, I could possibly be trapped here until I escaped. I had no inclination to find out how cruel the three women could be. I remembered far too well how their husband had tortured me for many weeks trying to determine if he could kill me. It was Astir who had freed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smallest Bride darted out of the gloom on her hands and feet and snapped her teeth at Magda’s ankle. Slamming my dagger down into Ariana’s neck, I pinned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda stumbled out of my grasp and fell against the thick curtains covering one window. The rosary blazed before her and I heard an anguished cry as Elina retreated. Before I could instruct her to open the curtains, Magda gripped the old, dusty fabric and drew it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight poured through the grimy glass into the corridor washing over me and the vampire at my feet. Dragging my dagger out Ariana’s flesh, I stepped back into the sunlight as she screamed in pain. Her skin blackened as she scrambled in a blind panic, trying to free herself from the rays of the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe princess dashed out of the dark, grabbed the girl, and dragged her away. Both were burning by the time they found refuge in the shadows dwelling further down the hallway. Collapsing together, the vampires screamed in anguish as Elina threw a tapestry over them to extinguish the fire racing over their bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding my daggers into their sheaths as I ran, I followed Magda into the kitchens. Though she was weak and panicked, she bravely led us to our freedom. Together, we fell through the doorway and collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flat stones of the courtyard were warm and comforting beneath my body. The pain of my wounds faded as I healed. Magda slowly rolled onto her back, her hands clutching the rosary to her chest as she gazed up at the soft clouds floating over the serene blue sky above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you let me kill him?” she asked, her voice trembling with exhaustion and emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The repercussions of his death would negatively affect the Countess far more than you could ever imagine,” I explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, truly. I vowed to protect her and I will. What she has done is...” I faltered as the image of Vlad’s shriveled body returned to my mind. Sitting up, I rested my elbows on my knees and took a deep breath. “What she has done could result in very dire consequences.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda’s dark eyes closed as her lips trembled. “We must help her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we shall.” I leaned over and laid my hand gently over hers. “I vow that I shall. Trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening her eyes, she focused her gaze upon my face. “I do, Adem. I do trust you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, we rose and departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetter to Astir from Adem continued...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...as you can see the situation is quite dire.
