Fending off boys was a new experience for her. She’d never stayed in one school long enough to connect with any would-be boyfriends. She leaned over to retie her shoelaces, trying to ignore Charlotte’s accusing glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she straightened, she noticed another familiar figure on the other side of the field, and her heart lifted. She waved at Ethan, but he didn’t seem to see her. Then she caught his expression. He was watching Thayer with fire in his eyes. Emma recoiled. She knew he was jealous of Thayer, but she had never seen him look so venomous before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ethan!” she yelled, but the crowd shifted and he disappeared from her line of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So which one of them are you bringing to my party in two Saturdays?” Charlotte asked with a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re having a party? Since when?” Madeline interrupted, fingering the collar of her T-shirt, which she’d cut into a boat neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since about an hour ago,” Charlotte said coyly. “I just found out my parents are going to Vegas that weekend. We can’t let an opportunity like that pass us by, can we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice,” Gabby whispered, reaching for her iPhone and starting to type. Lili followed suit. In twenty seconds, the whole school would know about it, thanks to their Twitter feeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m taking Ethan, obviously,” Emma said. She looked for him across the field again, hoping she’d just imagined the terrifying look he’d given Thayer. A headline popped into her mind, an old habit from the days of imagining herself an investigative journalist: Rumored Love Triangle Drives Teen Couple Apart; Details on Page 11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe referee blew his whistle, signaling the players to assemble in the middle of the field. Emma, Madeline, and Charlotte were with Mr. Mercer on the red team. Ethan joined them, giving Emma a kiss on her cheek. Laurel and Mrs. Mercer stood on the other side in blue, along with Nisha and Thayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going down!” Laurel screamed at Emma from across the field. Emma rolled her eyes good-naturedly. Not long ago, a threat like that from Laurel would have scared her, but she and Laurel were now on good terms. And Laurel definitely wasn’t Sutton’s murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, everyone,” Mr. Mercer said, tucking a yellow flag into his waistband and gesturing for the group to huddle. “Madeline, Charlotte, you girls flank us and keep those blues off our backs. After the snap, Sutton, you run downfield as fast as you can. I’ll pass it to you when it looks clear.” Then he squeezed her arm. “I’m glad you’re playing this year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma couldn’t keep the smile off her face. Since she’d discovered Mr. Mercer was her grandfather, she’d felt close to him, not just as Sutton but as herself. But then the usual guilt flooded back. He didn’t know her secret. And as much as she wanted to tell him, she couldn’t. She thought about the locket tightening around her throat at Charlotte’s house, the stage light that had crashed dangerously close to her head, all the times the murderer had warned her never to tell anyone. She couldn’t bear the thought of her grandfather being hurt—and if he knew the truth, his life would be in danger, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe referee blew the whistle again. Emma saw the ball snap back and bolted, weaving quickly in and out of blue cotton shirts. The Twitter Twins’ high voices chanted from the sidelines: “We’ve got beauty, we’ve got class, the other team can kiss our …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sutton!” Mr. Mercer cried, drowning out the rest of the cheer. Nisha was in front of him, trying to grab the flag from his belt, but he danced backward a few steps and threw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma’s body tensed as the ball hung in the air. It fell neatly into her arms, and she took off toward the goalpost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you think you’re going?” From the corner of her eye she saw Mrs. Mercer come her way. Her grandmother was surprisingly dexterous, limber from the hot yoga she did three times a week. Emma zigzagged around her and put on a burst of speed. Laurel joined the chase, and she and Mrs. Mercer flanked Emma as she pelted up the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma’s hair came loose from its knot and billowed behind her. I was pulled along by her speed, but I couldn’t feel the wind in my hair or the earth pushing away under my feet. I wondered how many times I’d gone to this tournament only to stand on the sidelines with my friends, complaining about the heat. Maybe I should have actually played once, just to experience it for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goalpost loomed in the distance, so close Emma could taste it. Suddenly, a pair of arms encircled her waist. She tumbled to the ground, the football rolling away from her. When she flipped to her back, Thayer’s face hovered over hers. “Gotcha,” he said softly, in the same feathery tone of voice he might use to say I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime stood still for a moment. Emma smelled the sweet grass, saw the light freckles on his cheeks. His face was so close to hers, she thought they might kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have given anything in that moment to be able to feel what Emma did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Thayer cried out as someone lifted him from behind. Emma looked around, confused, and saw Ethan shoving Thayer to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is flag football,” Ethan said angrily. “You’re going to hurt someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer pushed Ethan away. “Touch me again, man, and I’ll hurt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah, you going to knock me down like you did my girlfriend?” Ethan shoved him again, this time a little harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer took a few steps back. A dangerous grin broke over his face. “I’m going to enjoy kicking your ass,” he snarled. Then he lunged. Soon the two were a tangle of limbs and dirt thrashing around on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop it!” Emma cried, struggling to her feet. There was blood on Ethan’s cheek. Thayer’s shirt was torn at the collar. The referee’s whistle blasts kept breaking through the air uselessly. Spectators stood with their hands clapped over their mouths. People ran toward them, including Mr. Mercer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Break it up, boys!” he yelled. But only a few feet from the fight, a divot of grass snagged his foot. He went flying face-first into the turf, rolling a few feet before coming to a stop. A low groan of pain escaped his mouth. Ethan and Thayer stopped fighting and stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad!” Laurel screamed, dropping to his side. Emma and Mrs. Mercer were just behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Mercer let out another groan. Both of his shins were skinned, and blood trickled into the grass. He clutched his left knee, which had already swollen to twice its usual size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, man,” whispered Thayer, wiping his own blood from his purpling nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Mercer looked into the impotent crowd, her face pale. “Can someone help me get him to the car?” she asked firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer and Ethan scrambled to either side of Mr. Mercer. Between the two of them, they managed to get him unsteadily to his feet, guide him across the field, and angle him into the family SUV. Mr. Mercer groaned the whole way. Emma followed, her heart pounding loudly in her chest. She barely felt Madeline’s hand on her shoulder or heard Charlotte’s promises that he was going to be okay. She and Laurel climbed into the backseat, and Mrs. Mercer turned the ignition. No one spoke as they pulled out of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma turned and stared back at the parking lot. Ethan and Thayer stood several feet away from each other, looking sheepish. Ethan’s arms were crossed over his chest. Thayer rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still think they’re not fighting over you?” Laurel mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma didn’t answer. She didn’t want to be squabbled over like some medieval damsel. Maybe they’d learned their lesson since Mr. Mercer had been hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t count on it, I thought, remembering Thayer’s almost-kiss when he’d tackled my twin. The only way he’d stop fighting for me was to find out the truth—that I was dead and Emma was simply standing in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKARMA’S A BITCH, AND SO AM I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNews of the fight between Sutton’s two boyfriends was all over the school by Monday. Emma had to deflect constant questions about the quarrel, the details getting more exaggerated as the day wore on. Ethan had almost strangled Thayer to death. Thayer’s leg had miraculously healed, and he’d given Ethan a deadly kick to the groin. Thayer was going to hire a hit man from his shadowy past to finish Ethan off. Ethan now carried a gun to school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma tried to shrug off the stories, but they dogged her even when she got to tennis practice that afternoon. As she joined the rest of the team on the courts, girls kept asking her about it as though she’d literally been caught in the middle of the fight. “I heard that Ethan and Thayer are going to have a rematch on Friday,” Clara Hewlitt, a sophomore, said wistfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How very Clint Eastwood of them,” Emma joked. But she felt uneasy. She hadn’t said much to Ethan after the fight except to send him a few texts, yelling at him for being so rash. Ethan had apologized, as had Thayer. But Emma didn’t exactly like having the two of them fighting over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe late fall air was dry and hot, the sky a robin’s-egg blue beyond the mountains. The moon hung visible even in the afternoon, a pale disc in the cloudless sky. The courts were busy with girls warming up, adjusting ponytails and gossiping—probably about the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel nudged Emma. “Check out the new girl,” she giggled, thankfully changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma glanced up at the thin, elfin-looking girl standing a few feet away. Her long blond hair was swept back in lots of little braids, and she had about a dozen earrings in her earlobes, and silver rings shaped like ankhs and Wiccan spirals and Celtic crosses on every finger. While the other girls on the team were doing deep, athletic-looking stretches and exercises, this girl stood on one leg in some kind of yoga pose, her hands at her chest in prayer position. She hummed distractedly to herself as she lifted her arms in the air, balancing perfectly. Emma recognized Joni Mitchell’s “Free Man in Paris,” which Ursula, one of her old foster mothers, used to play nonstop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte snorted. “What’s she doing, balancing her chakras?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel laughed, and the girl’s eyes snapped open. She gazed at them as if she was seeing them through a deep mist and could just barely make them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be quiet, Charlotte, you’re disturbing the cosmic forces,” Laurel teased, slapping her friend lightly on the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma shifted her weight, a twinge of guilt gnawing at her. She’d been the new girl often enough in her life to know how hard it could be. She straightened her spine and strode across the court toward the strange girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractically everyone on the team stopped what they were doing. Nisha paused mid-push-up to follow Emma with her eyes. Clara, who’d been demonstrating a backhand grip to some low-ranked players, dropped her racket and openly stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t the first time Emma had been struck by the power of popularity. When Sutton Mercer talked, people listened. Sometimes that influence made Emma uncomfortable—she’d never had that kind of sway in her own life, and she’d been on the receiving end of the popular kids’ cruelty a few times herself. But now she had the opportunity to use her role as Sutton Mercer to do some good. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-hope-to-die-the-lying-game-5/page-4.html","bookId":2397,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:27 AM"}
