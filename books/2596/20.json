The drugs in their blood had played out on the walk back. Me at the desk but facing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her to change clothes. That short sequined dress was just too damned distracting. And we had some heavy matters to address immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious!\" she demanded. \"You\u0027re not honestly telling me what I can and cannot wear, you don\u0027t for one minute think I\u0027m going to listen to this, this is not the eighteenth century, baby. I don\u0027t know what castle you grew up in, but I assure you I don\u0027t change my mode of dress for feudal lords, no matter-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beloved Boss, could you not simply ask Mona to change her dress instead of telling her!\" said Quinn with restrained exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, what about that!\" she said, leaning forward, accentuating her cleavage swelling under the sequined band across her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mona, my darling,\" I said with perfect candor, \"ma ch¨¦rie, my beauty, please change into something less fetching. I find it hard to think, for you are so lovely in that dress. Forgive me. I lay my shameful omnisensual impulses at your feet. A tribute. I, having spent two centuries in the Blood, should possess a wisdom and restraint that makes such a request unnecessary, but alas, within my heart I feed a human flame that it may never completely go out, and it is the heat of this flame which distracts me now and renders me so powerless in your presence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe narrowed her eyes and puckered her brows. Exploring me as best she could for mockery. Finding none. Then her lower lip began to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you really help me find Morrigan?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t talk till you change the dress,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a bully and a tyrant!\" she said. \"You treat me like a child or a slut. I won\u0027t change it. Will you help me find Morrigan or not? Now make up your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the one who has to make up her mind. You act like a child and a slut. You have no dignity, no gravitas! No mercy! We have things to discuss before we get to the finding of Morrigan. You didn\u0027t behave very well last night. Now change your clothes, before I change them for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dare touch me!\" she said. \"You liked it well enough when every human being at that party turned to look at me. What don\u0027t you like about this dress now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it off!\" I said. \"It\u0027s needlessly distracting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you think you\u0027re going to preach to me about the way I behaved with my family. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just it, they\u0027re not simply your family now. There\u0027s infinitely more to it, and you know it. You\u0027re forfeiting your intelligence for cheap emotional outbursts. You abused your powers last night, your singular advantages. Now change that dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what are you going to do if I don\u0027t change it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were blazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was flabbergasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you forgotten that this is my flat?\" I said. \"That I am the one who has made you welcome here! That you exist because of me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, throw me out!\" she declared. Her whole face went red. She shot to her feet and leaned over me, her eyes on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I did last night after you left us and went away just because you were oh, so in love with Rowan! Oh, so very in love with La Doctor Dolorosa. Well, guess what! I read your books, your maudlin mawkish melancholy Vampire Chronicles, and I can see why your fledglings despise you! You treated Claudia like a doll just \u0027cause she had the body of a child! And what was that all about, making a child a vampire in the first place?-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it, how dare you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your own mother, you give her the Dark Gift, and then you try to stop her from cutting her long hair or wearing men\u0027s clothes, and this in the eighteenth century, when women have to go around looking like wedding cakes, you\u0027re an autocratic monster!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You insult me, you abuse me! If you don\u0027t stop-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I know why you\u0027re so fired up over Rowan, she\u0027s the first adult female other than your own mother who\u0027s ever caught your attention for more than five minutes, and Hello! Lestat Discovers The Opposite Sex! Yeah, females do come in grown-up sizes! And I happen to be one of them, and this is not the Garden of Eden, and I am not taking off this dress!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn got to his feet. \"Lestat, wait, please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out!\" I roared. I stood up. My heart was cut so deep I could hardly talk. I felt that stinging hurt again all over my skin, the hurt I\u0027d felt when Rowan had been railing at me at the Retreat House, an enervating, crippling pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of my house, you wretched little ingrate,\" I shouted, \"get out now before I throw you down the steps! You\u0027re a Power Slut, that\u0027s what you are, using every edge your sex or youth can give you, a moral lilliputian in grown-up shoes, a career adolescent, a professional child! You don\u0027t know the meaning of philosophical insight, or spiritual engagement, or true growth-. Out, out of here now, Heiress to the Mayfair Legacy, what a fiasco that must have been, go beat up on your mortal family at First Street, rave at them until you drive them out of their minds and they crack you over the head with their shovel and bury you alive in the backyard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lestat, I beg you-.\" Quinn put his hands out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too angry. \"Take her to Blackwood Farm!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s taking me anywhere!\" she cried. She ran out the door, hair whirling, sequins sparkling, slamming the door shut. Clatter down the iron steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn shook his head. He was in silent tears. \"This just shouldn\u0027t have happened,\" he whispered. \"It was entirely avoidable. You don\u0027t understand, she\u0027s not even accustomed to being out of a sickbed, to putting one foot in front of the other, to putting one word after another-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was inevitable,\" I said. I was shaking. \"It\u0027s why I gave her the Dark Gift instead of you, so the anger would come at me, don\u0027t you see? But how could she attack so violently the things that have happened to me! She has no moral modulation, no moral rhythm, no moral patience, no moral kindness. She\u0027s a pitiless little hellion! I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m saying. Go after her. She\u0027s so blatantly and arrogantly careless! Just go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, please,\" he said, \"don\u0027t let this be a split between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not between you and me,\" I said, \"no, never. Just go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear her sobs from the courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stormed out onto the balcony. \"You get off my property!\" I shouted down to her. She was glowing in the dark. \"Don\u0027t you dare stand there weeping in my courtyard. I won\u0027t have it! Get out!\" I came down the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fled from me down the carriageway. \"Quinn!\" she wailed. \"Quinn!\" as if I was murdering her. \"Quinn, Quinn,\" she squealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed against me as he passed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and went up the steps. I clung to the balcony railing for a long moment, forcing some calm upon myself, my hands trembling, but it did little good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I\u0027d closed the door I saw Julien out of the corner of my eye. I tried again to quell my pounding heart. I refused to tremble. I collected myself, eyes roving the ceiling, ready for the next cheap diatribe to be flung in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh bien,\" he said, going on in French, his arms folded, his dinner jacket very black against the damask striped wallpaper. \"You\u0027ve done a fine job, Monsieur, haven\u0027t you? You\u0027ve fallen deep in love with a mortal who\u0027ll never yield to you, only succeeding in driving a true rivet into her heart which her innocent husband won\u0027t fail to detect sooner or later. And now my innocent niece, whom you\u0027ve so cleverly brought over into your world, is running rampant through the streets with a boy lover who hasn\u0027t a clue as to how to comfort her or contain her mounting madness. You are a fine example of the Ancien R¨¦gime, Monsieur, oh, but I should be calling you Chevalier, should I not? Or, what precisely was your title, anyway? Was there something lower?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, and then slowly I smiled. I wasn\u0027t shaking too badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Les bourgeois have always disappointed me,\" I said gently. \"My father\u0027s title means nothing to me. That it means so much to you is tiresome. Why don\u0027t we let the matter drop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took my chair at the desk, caught the heel of my shoe on the rung and just looked at the ghost admiringly. Flawless white shirt. Patent leather shoes. Now, he knows how to dress, doesn\u0027t he? In my exhaustion and my grief for what had just taken place with Mona, I looked into his eyes and I prayed silently to Saint Juan Diego. What is there that can come of this that might be good?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" he asked. \"You\u0027ve come to be fond of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Stella?\" I asked. \"I want to see Stella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" he asked, arching his eyebrows and tipping his forehead slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to be alone,\" I said, \"as much as I give out. And I don\u0027t want to be alone at this moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lost his look of resolute superiority. Grim gaze. He\u0027d been a handsome man in his time, trim white curls, clever black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry to disappoint you,\" I said. \"But since you do go and come as you will, it seems I must get used to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I like what I do?\" he asked with sudden bitterness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you know much about what you do,\" I replied. \"Maybe we have that in common. I\u0027ve been hearing about you. Rather ominous things, it seems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlank expression, then a slow yield to appraisal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a skipping step in the hall, definitely a child skipping. And there she came into the room, in a snow white dress, with her white sox and her black Mary Janes, a darling girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Ducky, you have the most amazing digs,\" she said. \"I simply love your paintings. This is the first time I\u0027ve had a chance to look at them. I love the soft colors. I love the sailboats and all the agreeable people, people in lovely long dresses. There\u0027s a sweetness to these paintings. If I weren\u0027t a little girl, I\u0027d suspect that they soothe people\u0027s nerves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t claim to have chosen them myself,\" I replied, \"someone else did. But now and then I add one or more to the collection. I like the brighter, stronger colors. I like the greater, more savage force.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you intend to do about all this?\" asked Julien, plainly irritated by this exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart had begun to assume its normal rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About all what?\" I asked. \"And let me assure you that your mixing in it isn\u0027t a good omen, from what I\u0027ve learnt. Seems some of your mortal descendants believe you\u0027re doomed to failure in all your Earthly visitations, did you know that? It\u0027s a special curse visited upon you, apparently, or so I\u0027m told.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella had plopped into a Louis XV chair, her white dress going poof all around her. She looked up at Julien with alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do me a bitter injustice,\" he said coldly. \"You can\u0027t know my accomplishments. And only very few of my descendants know them either. Now let\u0027s get back to your present obligation. Certainly you don\u0027t intend to let my niece run rampant with the powers you\u0027ve given her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"I told you before,\" I said, \"that if you want her, you will have to tell her. Why are you so afraid of her? Or is it that she won\u0027t acknowledge you? That she\u0027s completely unreceptive? That she\u0027s off on a supernatural tear and you\u0027re small potatoes to her now, hmmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face became hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not fooling me, not for a moment,\" he said. \"You\u0027re cut to the quick by Mona\u0027s words, you\u0027re cut to the quick by Rowan, that you can\u0027t have her, no matter how much harm you try to do to her. You\u0027re paying for your sins. You\u0027re paying now as we speak. You\u0027re terrified you\u0027ll never see either of them again. And maybe you won\u0027t. And maybe if you do, they\u0027ll show you a defiance that will demoralize you even more truly than you\u0027re demoralized now. Come, Stella. Let\u0027s leave this mountebank to his nightmares. I tire of his company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oncle Julien, I don\u0027t want to leave!\" she said. \"These are new shoes and I love them. Besides, I find Lestat charming. Ducky, you must forgive Oncle Julien. Death has had the most oppressive effect upon him. When he was alive, he would never have said such things!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bounced to the floor, ran to me and threw her soft little arms around me and kissed my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, Lestat,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Au revoir, Stella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the room was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfectly empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, disconsolate and shuddering, and put my head down on my arm, as if I could go to sleep on my desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Maharet,\" I said, naming again our great ancestor, our mother, one who was for all I knew on the opposite side of the globe. \"Ah, Maharet, what have I done and what can I do? Help me! Let my voice reach you over the miles.\" I closed my eyes. Once again, I used the very strongest of my telepathic power. I have such need of you. I come to you ashamed of my failures. I come to you as the Brat Prince of the Blood Drinkers. I don\u0027t claim to be anything better or worse. Listen to me. Help me. Help me for the sake of others. I beg you. Hear my prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in this dark frame of mind, alone with this message, which engaged my soul completely, when I heard a step on the iron stairs outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy guard from the gate: \"It\u0027s Clem from Blackwood Farm out front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How in the world did he find this address?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027s looking for Quinn, says they need Quinn back there right away. Seems he\u0027s been up to the Mayfair house looking for Quinn and they sent him over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might as well hang out a tasteful neon sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I had an immediate and mundane use for my telepathy: scan the blocks around for the Dazzling Duo and relay this message to Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZap: nothing to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn and Mona were in a small caf¨¦ on Jackson Square, Mona sobbing into an immense heap of paper napkins, Quinn enfolding her and hiding her from the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGotcha. Tell Clem to meet me at Chartres and St. Ann. And please, Lestat, I beg you, come with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeet you at Blackwood Farm, sweet boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEh bien, so after the proper messages were conveyed to Clem, who was presiding over the choking, wheezing, seething limousine outside in the Rue Royale, at least I had a moment of stillness in which to think, and then a destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was NOT riding over the lake in the car with that unforgivable Valkyrie in her sequined chemise! I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould take to the clouds, thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat twinge of autumn again in my beloved heat. I didn\u0027t so much like it. I fretted the winter coming on. But what was all this to me with my broken heart, and illegitimate soul, and what had I done to Rowan with my furtive, disgraceful whispers? And Michael, that powerful and soft-spoken Michael, who had trusted me with his wife\u0027s heart, what had I done to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how could Mona say such hurtful things, how could she? And how could I have behaved so childishly in response?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my mind of all distractions and random images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain I spoke only to Maharet. Wherever you are, I need you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now came some artifice-to describe once more my needs without casting to the winds unnecessary details for every other immortal who might pick up my message and ponder the precise nature of what I sought. To find a tribe of tall beings, tender of bone, ancient, simple, tangled with my fledgling, unknown to the world of records, history and location essential to the sanity of those I love. Guidance. Mistakes I\u0027ve made with my fledgling, spiraling out of control. Give to me your wisdom, your keen hearing, your vision. Where are the tall creatures? I am your loyal subject. More or less. I send my love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould she answer? I didn\u0027t know. In all honesty (yeah, like all the rest of this is a pack of lies?), I had only once, years ago, called out to her for help, and she had not answered me. However, I\u0027d been guilty of the most ridiculous blunder at the time. I\u0027d switched bodies with a mortal, and been abandoned by him. Idiocy. I had to go after my own supernatural body and recover it. And on my own-well, almost on my own-I\u0027d found a solution to my problem. And so it had ended well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I had seen her since, this mysterious ancestor, when she did come to my aid of her own volition, and she had taken great pains with me. She\u0027d forgiven my ranting and raving and my temper. I\u0027d described her in my writings, and she had borne it. From me, she\u0027d borne many things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps she had heard me last night. Perhaps she would hear me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf nothing came of the call, I would try again. And again. And if her silence continued, I would call to others. I would enlist Marius, my sometime mentor, and wise Child of the Millennia. And if that failed, I would scan the Earth on my own for the Taltos, be they one or many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I had to make good on my promise to find the Taltos-for Michael and for Rowan, my precious\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan, even if Mona utterly deserted me, which was most likely the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I felt my heart shrinking. I had already somehow lost Mona. And soon Quinn would follow. And precisely how I\u0027d done it, I really didn\u0027t grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the back of my conscious was taking shape the horrid realization that a modern-minded fledgling was as complex as a nuclear reactor, a communications satellite, a Pentium 4 computer, a microwave oven, a cell phone and all the other intricate overarching newfangled creations I couldn\u0027t understand. Of course, it was all a matter of exploding sophistication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr mystification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVixen. I hated her. That\u0027s why I was crying my own blood tears, wasn\u0027t it? Well, there was nobody to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEh bien,it was on to Blackwood Farm, and as I ascended I prayed to Maharet. Maharet was my prayer of the winds all the way there. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10/page-20.html","bookId":2596,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM"}
