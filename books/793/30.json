{"id":10062,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. GILBERT’S PLANS.","content":"Gilbert left the house of Mrs. Briggs, not cast down, but with a full understanding of his situation. Until now he had had his guardian’s assistance, and, with the income from his position as office-boy, had felt no anxiety. Now, both had failed him, for the time at least, and he must shift for himself. Disaster develops the manhood in a boy as well as a man. So Gilbert did not indulge in any gloomy anticipations of starvation or pauperism. He never for a moment regretted his refusal to take money from Mrs. Briggs, offered as it had been in such a manner as to insult his self-respect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’d rather live on one meal a day,” he said to himself stoutly, “than humble myself to that woman.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 261When he re-entered his room he found his room-mate reading.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, Gilbert,” he said, “did you have a pleasant call?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So pleasant that I shall not call again in a hurry,” answered Gilbert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then Mrs. Briggs won’t give you any assistance?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes; but I have rejected it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Ingalls looked surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Did you not act unwisely?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Let me tell you just what passed between us, and you shall judge.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young man listened attentively. When Gilbert had finished his story, he said, emphatically, “You did just right. I should have done the same thing in your circumstances.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am glad you approve of my action. I couldn’t stoop to take money offered as charity.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then you have got to strike out for yourself, it seems?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, and I must settle to-night what I shall do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you made up your mind to anything?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 262“I was thinking about that as I walked home. To begin with, I will borrow money of you to pay Mrs. White, if you are still willing to lend it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will lend it to you with pleasure.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I think I had better leave this house, obtain a cheaper room, and board at a restaurant.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t think you can save much that way. Mrs. White is very reasonable in her charges.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I know that, but the probability is that I can’t pay her. I must be strictly economical. I am not sure but the best thing I can do is to go to the Newsboys’ Lodge.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Ingalls shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It would never do,” he said. “It would not suit a boy brought up as you have been.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t suppose it would; but I don’t expect to suit myself. That is not the question with me. I must do as I can.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then stay here. If you can’t pay your whole board at the week’s end I will make up the balance. I should have to pay more, at any rate, if I occupied the room alone.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 263Gilbert reflected a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are very kind, Mr. Ingalls,” he said, “and I will accept your offer, on one condition.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What is that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That you lend me the money, and I will repay it as soon as I am able.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I agree to that.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then I will stay, for a week or two at least. Now I want to ask your advice. I must find something to do at once.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wish there was a vacancy in our establishment.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I only want temporary employment. I expect Mr. Sands will take me back on his return.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I didn’t think of that. Have you thought of anything?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am going to try my luck as a newsboy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “As a newsboy! What will your friends, the Vivians, say?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know, and I can’t afford to care. I must get a living somehow for the next few days, and I would rather sell papers than black boots. In the afternoon I shall try to get a little baggage-smashing to do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 264“I admire your pluck, Gilbert,” said his room-mate. “Not many boys, brought up as you have been, would be willing to sell papers in the streets.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t pretend to like it,” said Gilbert; “but I would rather do it than sponge on others, or take money flung at me as alms. If you object to rooming with a common newsboy,” he added, smiling, “I suppose I must look for another boarding-place.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Wait till I give you notice to quit,” said Ingalls. “In the mean time I will do all I can to encourage you. I will buy a morning paper of you to-morrow morning. Where shall you stand?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Near the ‘Times’ building, I think. Don’t forget your promise now. If I have one customer engaged I shall sleep more soundly.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You can rely upon me. Have you got money enough to start yourself in business? If not, command my purse.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will borrow fifty cents, to make sure that I have enough. Now, as I must be up betimes and take an early breakfast, I think I will turn in.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 265“Good-night, then. I will stay up and read awhile longer.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He’s a plucky boy,” thought the young man. “He deserves to succeed, and I believe he will.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1888/54510.html","bookId":793,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:48:51 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:48:51 AM"}
