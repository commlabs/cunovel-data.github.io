Play-Doh kits. A Christmas tree that sang karaoke. Several other Christmas items. He must\u0027ve found the December issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the little crumpled picture of a Christmas tree I\u0027d found in Michael\u0027s cleaned-out room, two Saturday evenings ago, the last remnant of the sheet cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this what you do when you\u0027re not zapping aliens with your ray gun?\" I asked gently. \"You collect art?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael deliberated over an advertisement for an Erector set. \"My wish list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked as sleepy and grim as a late-night driver — no joy in his face, no indication that this toy-browsing was anything but deadly serious work. He started to cut out the Erector set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want all these things for Christmas?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his head in, rubbed his ear on his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mommy threw the old list away,\" he muttered. \"It wasn\u0027t invisible. I have to start over now. Daddy said, \u0027What would you rather have for Christmas — a lot of toys or a new home in San\u0027tonio? If you don\u0027t get it, you can put it on your wish list.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was strangely silent. A rustle of palm fronds outside the window. From the other bedroom, the faintest trickle of water from Ines\u0027 shower. I focused on Michael Brandon\u0027s little fingers as they worked. I tried to remember if Jem\u0027s hands had even been that tiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to know a secret?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael\u0027s scissors stopped snipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was younger,\" I said, \"my father died, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was. Laid out in front of a five-year-old. Way to go, Navarre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t as young as you,\" I amended. \"Not nearly. But it was very hard. For a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael\u0027s pale, inscrutable eyes stayed on me for a heartbeat, then drifted back to the hole he\u0027d cut in the magazine. \"I\u0027m making a wish list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. \"You want some privacy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pondered that. He\u0027d probably never had anybody ask him that question before. \"No,\" he decided. \"That\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, almost inaudibly, he added, \"Did you make a cave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"A very big one. Called California.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael scratched a chigger bite. His fingernails left red streaks against the pale skin of his ankle. His lower lip started to tremble. \"Daddy asked me what I wanted, and I said I wanted San\u0027tonio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished cutting another picture, flattened it on top of the other toy advertisements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m sorry,\" he whispered. \"Were you sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a minute to get my voice to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Michael,\" I said. \"Yeah, I was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled up one knee and rested his chin on it. He made the scissors do a one-bladed pirouette on his big toe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need more Christmas pictures, Tres,\" he decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s April,\" I croaked. Then I realized how little that would mean to Michael — how the last four months in San Antonio had been one hellish Christmas present this little boy wanted with all his heart to put back in the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More Christmas pictures,\" I repeated. \"Yeah. All right. Hand me a magazine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next thirty minutes, until his mother got out of the shower, Michael Brandon and I flipped through toy circulars, looking for things worth wishing for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal exam week at UTSA came too quickly. In all three of my classes, the students scrambled when they realized that there actually would be an evaluation for the term — that the chances of me getting blown away before grades were due were not as likely as they\u0027d once thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregory the Radish Boy led the grad seminar in a rousing discussion of Marie de France. We decided that maybe Bisclavret\u0027s wife had gotten a bad deal, but they kept asking why Marie de France had chosen to tell such a depressing tale and why Aaron Brandon and I liked to teach it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last class before the final, Morticia Addams and the two housewives brought casseroles to class. Sergeant Irwin brought some pastries and made a big deal out of handing me a purple-sugar pan dulce, telling me it was my medal for combat wounds in my first term. The sergeant pounded me on the shoulder and said he was damn proud to have had my class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Mitchell sat in the back, smiling, taking notes, sipping a Sprite one of the students had given him, while we went through some last-minute questions from the study guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the class broke up Mitchell offered to walk me back to my office. \"You\u0027re a hell of a teacher,\" Mitchell told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refused to blush. I looked straight down the hallway of yellow bolted panels, thinking about the corridor as it had been a few weeks ago, filled with FBI and bomb-squad men and police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should see me on semesters when I don\u0027t get shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell chuckled. As we walked he brought out some student evaluation forms, the kind they use to assess each class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I get that chance,\" he said. \"These reports are excellent — the dean was very pleased to see them after such a hard beginning to the term. There\u0027ve already been quite a few questions about your classes for next fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next fall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re interested, I hope? Same arrangement? Same hours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dividing my time with Erainya Manos? You\u0027re willing to have a part-time P.I. on staff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell laughed. \"Probably keep everybody honest when it comes to post-tenure review time, knowing I\u0027ve got my own investigator. Absolutely, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped at the door of my office. Mitchell patted me on the shoulder, grinned. His white sideburns inched back. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on board,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a future here, son. Unofficially speaking, I think you\u0027ll be around for some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My landlord and creditors will be happy to hear that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell patted me again, then said, \"I\u0027ll see you at the department party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned without waiting for an answer and went whistling down the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed up the office and got home around one, just in time to change for my next engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first Friday in May. Some friends and I had a date. I put on one of my new dress shirts, some slacks, and a tie I had been able to afford with my first paycheck from UTSA. My tie was a springtime explosion of rose on yellow. I looked in the mirror and wondered if there had always been a little streak of gray above my left ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround one-thirty, Erainya did her unsyncopated rap-ta-tap on the door. Jem and Michael burst in, followed by their mothers. The boys looked like miniature versions of me — slacks, white shirts, same rose-and-yellow ties, sawed off and hemmed to their sizes. They\u0027d insisted on their own ties when they\u0027d gone shopping with me a few days before. I told them we would look like a clown troupe if we went out in public together, but that just made them more determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya and Ines, mercifully, had chosen their own clothes. Erainya wore her standard black T-shirt dress, black sandals, a black leather purse that looked like an S\u0026amp;M mask. Her only concession to the May Festival atmosphere was a single red plastic bracelet on her wrist. It somehow looked more like the remnant of incarceration than a spring fashion statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes wore white slacks and a blue Guatemalan shirt that made her red hair glow like neon. She gave me a kiss on the cheek, then went to rein in Michael, who was helping Jem capture Robert Johnson from the top shelf of the closet — his normal hiding place from children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya came up and straightened my tie. \"You\u0027re how old? And you can\u0027t tie a tie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m new at this formal dress business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"So you going to grace us with your presence at the office one of these days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tuesday,\" I promised. \"Same day George\u0027ll be back. Things have just about settled down at UTSA. You close out the Brandon case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back and examined my outfit critically. \"They sent the check. It didn\u0027t bounce. Things are fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more death threats to the English department?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" She waved her hand. \"Not unless you keep dressing like this. No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem was raking Robert Johnson down the sleeves of my shirts. Michael was giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe granted the poor feline a reprieve and told the boys to come on to the car. As it turned out, Jem and Michael\u0027s new school was not going to be the one they\u0027d visited together three weeks before. During the course of the police investigation, one of Erainya\u0027s lawyer friends who was representing Ines had learned that both women were looking into private education for their sons. The lawyer had put in a good word at his daughter\u0027s school on the North Side, which just happened to be short on boys\u0027 enrollment for the fall. Lo and behold, Jem and Michael received acceptance letters and half-tuition scholarships a few days later, along with invitations to visit for the annual Spring Celebration to meet their future classmates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe school was just north of Loop 410 but it seemed a thousand miles from town — an isolated village of Spanish-style limestone buildings and courtyards and covered walkways nestled amid hundreds of acres of live oaks on the banks of Salado Creek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday the huge front lawn of the school was overrun with families and food booths. The trees were bedecked in ribbons. Hand-painted signs advertised Beanie Baby tosses, peppermint sticks in lemons, a dunking booth. In the breezeway by the theater, a junior school jazz band was foot-tapping their way through a tune that sounded like Miles Davis struck with baseball bats and strained through an organ grinder\u0027s box. Parents in suits and flowing white summer dresses floated along, smiles in place, tickets in hand, children in whirlwinds around them, faces painted like spiderwebs or rainbows. Within fifteen minutes of our arrival, Jem and Michael were tugged into a group of kindergartners and taught to play fishing-for-treats with a stick and a glittery sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya was pulled into a conversation with her lawyer/parent friend who wanted to introduce her to a state senator who might have some business for a good P.I. They walked off talking about the possibilities and eating Sno-Kones. Ines Brandon smiled at me nervously. \"What the hell are we doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretending to be rich,\" I said. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked along the periphery of the festival, trying our best to avoid little bodies. I glanced at Ines in her bright colors and tried to convince myself she really was the same woman I\u0027d met just a few weeks ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe bought two lemons with peppermint sticks and sat in the shade of a live oak. Jem was showing some kids a trick with a yo-yo. Michael was betting the other kids a carnival ticket each that Jem couldn\u0027t do it three times in a row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about this new Jem/Michael alliance,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes twirled her peppermint stick. Her lips were turning unnaturally red from the candy. \"Hardly fair to the rest of the kids in the world, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watched as Jem completed the third around-the-world/walk-the-dog combination with the yo-yo and Michael started collecting tickets, smiling for the first time I\u0027d ever seen. He suggested the other kids try double or nothing. The junior high band managed a drumroll and a horn crescendo, then unraveled into a very odd waltz arrangement of Glenn Miller\u0027s \"String of Pearls.\" I got the feeling it wasn\u0027t really supposed to be a waltz arrangement, but I wanted to give them the benefit of a doubt. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-49.html","bookId":2418,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
