You won\u0027t need me anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll be clean, Parker. No more corpses for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if I trust the system that far yet. Or that I\u0027ll be given the right substance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them said the obvious. That maybe he\u0027d be fucked over one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zondorae brothers wouldn\u0027t care, that was for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn uneasy thought came to mind: no one would care. There was no relatives to weep for his death. Except Clyde. And that was almost funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made Parker feel disassociated in his own skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gladly left the slimeball brothers behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeffrey moved through the various security corridors, using the embedded pulse-sensor disc behind his ear. The pulse-sensor ensured the doors opened just as he needed to pass through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeffrey thought of the mystery C-M digging the disc out of her own flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a little shiver, not easily spooked. I\u0027ve done some dastardly deeds in my time, he thought with a small smile, but self-mutilation was not one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes liberation exacted a price that few people were willing to pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir darling AFTD girl had paid in spades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe escaped the yawning mouth of the Graysheets like a birth gone wrong, the surrealism of his last mission chasing him like the return of Haley\u0027s comet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight on schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen- senior year\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff tried to never get caught alone in the halls. She was ashamed at the tremor that started when she drew nearer to her locker and clamped down on her irrational fear ruthlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat fucking Carson had made her afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich in turn made Tiff mad at herself and ashamed of her physical reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her shoes became hot Tiff tried to explain it away rationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what people did when weird shit went down and she was no different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that she was in the girl\u0027s washroom. There shouldn\u0027t have been anything to explain it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain was unbearable. It felt like someone had stuck her feet in an oven on broil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff tore off her shoes and threw them into the sink where she\u0027d just washed her hands and the pulse-activated sensor brought the water on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sneakers steamed inside the basin as the room temperature water sprayed over them. Her bare feet slowly cooled on the recycled quartz flooring of the school lavatory. They had reddened from the warmth of the ghost fire that had coated the shoes now smoldering in the basin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at her feet; the toenails were hot pink because Sophie had talked her into it. Tiff blinked, sucking in a shaky breath that was just shy of tearful and went to the door of the bathroom, peeking out into the empty hall. She needed to pull up her goddamned big girl panties. Like. Right. Now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one. Tiff let out another trembling, fear-drenched exhale, shame and anger mingling again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow she knew that Carson was cooking her shoes. They weren\u0027t babies anymore. Hamilton had a level of control that he hadn\u0027t possessed when they were freshmen. And she was a nothing but a two-point AFTD. Tiff swallowed past the lump in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he had a handle on shit now and Tiff was on his radar, the asshat. Tiff almost wished she hadn\u0027t yanked his chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped out of the safety of the threshold in a rookie move that made her want to kick her own ass later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff didn\u0027t check behind the bathroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere went the theory on her cleverness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t Carson though, it was Diego.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, that was worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey Mouth,\" he said, gripping her by the hood and hauling her back behind the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, Tiff drove her elbow into whatever was behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh!\" Diego grunted, relaxing her hold on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung and gave her hardest stomp on his foot. Unfortunately, Tiff was no longer wearing shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not as effective with a bare foot and then Carson was on her like a fly on shit. He lifted Tiff right off her feet. She swung her head back against him but he was ready for that move. He was a faster learner than she wanted him to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego came from the front and Tiff swore she had no breath. She could feel the darkness eating at the edges of her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff fought her fear and it was an ugly matter staying conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was scarier than hunting a murderer, than raising corpses with Caleb, or traveling to another world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jade came into the hall and saw the three of them in a dance of violence and she did what Tiff could never make herself do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade opened her mouth and screamed like a girl. A clear, high-pitched bell-like shriek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the most beautiful sound Tiff had ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost sobbed in relief even as Carson gave her a pinch that deadened her upper arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff gasped at the fresh pain that settled there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch her you... shitbag,\" Jade said in a low voice filled with rage, full of experience and Diego strode to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" Jade said, backing up a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff noted she looked very small next to the six-feet plus Diego.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or what- you prim little bitch? Ya gonna sick your corpse-humper boyfriend on me? He gonna dump you for a dead chick?\" he asked, giving an obscene hip gyration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade gave a circumspect look around for the adults that should be coming and Diego grabbed her by the hair. She yelped as Tiff gave a miserable scream of warning, \"Jade!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened to Smith drone on about our responsibilities to the dead. How they had been living once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I kinda got that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down at my beat up Timex and thought that Tiff had made a career out of the bathroom. She was probably trying to take extra time because we were going over review stuff beginning with: Cadaver-Manipulation Etiquette. She\u0027d be All About missing that lecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured I\u0027d just practice on Clyde with that. He sure let me know when I got it wrong. I chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy scalp began to tingle like ants were crawling across my head. It was a case of the creeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up straighter in my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. I didn\u0027t normally get those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Jade filled my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand shot up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creeps intensified and then my friend Worry crawled up my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith folded his arms across his chest. \"Yes, Mr. Hart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I be excused?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at Tiff\u0027s empty seat, then his eyes shifted to the pulse-clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like two students absent for lavatory trips... however, perhaps you can see what\u0027s taking Tiffany so long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"K, thanks.\" I hopped out of my seat smoothly and made my way to the restrooms. Just as I was thinking I\u0027d become paranoid, I felt the sensation of crawling insects grow horribly intense just before my hair felt like someone was pulling it out at the roots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think, I ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb!\" Jade shrieked in an agonized wail, her hair torn from her scalp, black strands trailing from Diego\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backhanded her, spilling her to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he jerked her up by her hair again she bit the hand that held her as hard as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitch!\" Diego seethed, dragging her behind him as he shook her until her teeth rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no,\" Tiff moaned, feeling guilty beyond anything she\u0027d ever known. She had defenses, Jade did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drag the bitches in here,\" Carson said, indicating the boys restroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff fought and was subdued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, she was not strong enough to get away and was soundlessly taken into the restroom with a bleeding Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw myself around the corner, my scalp throbbing like a banked fire and saw....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no people. It was the middle of the school day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and let everything else recede to a pinpoint, my sense of urgency had heightened, not quieted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe empty hallway didn\u0027t fool me for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heartbeat of the dead I located in about three seconds, they breathed out of sync with my searching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, faintly a beat of something else captured my seeking fingers. It was familiar somehow. But like a muscle that was seldom used it didn\u0027t last for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the whimper that alerted me instead of my paranormal sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoys\u0027 bathroom, I thought, taking three strides to the door and tearing it off its hinges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit, I thought upon witnessing the scene in front of me. Carson was on top of a beaten Tiff, his pants long gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran and things got fuzzy after that but he was beneath me moments later, my fist beating his nose into a bloody pulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was scary how naturally beating came to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb!\" Jade cried out in warning as Diego landed on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the advantage of surprise and rolled me over. He started whaling on me like I\u0027d just done to his buddy Carson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call to the dead left me as easily as a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what was coming but... gawd, Tiff... I couldn\u0027t think of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe consequence couldn\u0027t be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came. It was December but the black bears that laid low in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains had yet to bed down for the winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne had been crushed by a vehicle that day as twilight made the landscape flat and indiscernible. It was just outside the boundaries of my school, waiting for the road kill pick up crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater I would be told that it threw its body against the door to get to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slammed a free leg into Diego\u0027s chest and his fist glanced off my knee on his downstroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up on my knees in one motion with blood clouding my eyesight. My hand shot out in a stiff knuckle strike, taking him in the throat and he made a satisfying gagging choke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the bear lumbered into the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt saw me and went for Diego, swatting him with a huge paw. He arced, flying into one of the stall doors that was ajar and landing in the commode face down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect, I thought numbly, spitting out a spray of blood on the ground beside Carson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho had decided it was a swell idea to torch my bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil the second joined the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swiped blood out of my eyes and looked for the girls, letting my zombies take on Flame Boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego was out of commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade slammed into me the minute I stood and I took stock of her face. \"I didn\u0027t know,\" I said as the bears roared behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes you did, you came,\" she cried against my chest and my eyes swept the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was curled up in a corner, her clothes thrown into a pile on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no, I thought, not Tiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen burst into the boys\u0027 bathroom, took one look at Carson and a cooling water of nothingness flowed from her outstretched hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like someone had thrown a bucket of icewater on everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarson\u0027s fire stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bears turned to me, their eyes dead plums in their expressive faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZombies were hell on time lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb Hart,\" Chen said, eying the Wonder Twin Bears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In. My.

Gone was the lippy, sarcastic, fiercely brave girl that had tag-teamed my success with the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had Tiff gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t be this shell of a girl who kept her head down and clutched her pulse-reader in front of her like a shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn had tried, following her around until she turned on him and hissed, \"I don\u0027t need a bodyguard, Terran!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he\u0027d been punched. I\u0027ll never forget his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d looked at my best friend, his eyes thick with tears that no self-respecting guy would shed and he said, \"It\u0027s my fault.

Of course, Hamilton had a nice scar on his chest from my zombie bear. I\u0027d taken care of Diego later too.
