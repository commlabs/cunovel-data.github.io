Of course, if that’s what you want. I would just think that you would want to say a big thank-you to the folks who rescued you and be a credit to girls everywhere. But if you don’t want to, we’ll just cancel the pageant this year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, we’ll do it,” Miss Ohio said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLadybird smiled. “Terrific! Oh, I’m so happy. Don’t you worry, it’s going to be great,” Ladybird assured them with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?” Nicole asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow night,” Ladybird answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we could tell them all the stuff we’ve learned about eating grubs and safe sex and vaginas,” Tiara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetra grinned. “Tiara, you said the V word. Gimme five.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would blow their little minds, wouldn’t it?” Jennifer said with a smirk. “Hello, America. My new platform is Kicking Ass, Girl-Style.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My goodness, I don’t know what you girls are talking about, but it hurts my ears! So stop it,” Ladybird Hope chided. She put a hand to her heart. “You know what? America needs you girls. It’s no secret the world’s as messed up as a hockey game played on non-Zambonied ice right now. It needs you to smile and wave and remind us that we are a great nation full of pretty. And that we will not allow any threats to our pretty. No matter what.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen, Ladybird Hope leaned closer to the camera. The angle was not kind. There was a pronounced ridge in her top lip from too much filler. “Now. You Dreams have a nice lunch, and then I believe you need to go shopping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45Alexandra’s Clandestine Closet, the number-one lingerie store, whose most popular undergarment is the Bicycle Pump-assiereTM, a bra with built-in tires that can be pumped up to simulate any cup size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Lou’s throat hurt from screaming, but no one could hear her down in this cave near the ocean. She and Tane had been tied together and dangled from a hook, which was slowly lowering them over a piranha-filled tank. Below their feet, the ugly, sharp-toothed fish darted back and forth, waiting to take the two of them down to bones. The rope gave a jerk as it lowered another half inch. A piranha leapt, startling Mary Lou, who screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You all right?” Tane called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Those things creep me out. Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Other than being lowered to my death, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At least we’re together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True. But I wish you weren’t here. I wish it were just me and you were safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awww, so sweet!” The rope jerked again. “Aaaaahh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At least we’re getting a fancy, Greek mythology–style death. They could have just given us quick bullets to the head. Now we get to die in style,” Tane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was that supposed to be comforting? Because, no offense, it wasn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. I always hated those stories anyway. It’s like, any time a human tries to break out and take action for him-or herself, the gods punish that person. Like Prometheus — he brings Zeus’s fire back from the mountain. He enlightens mankind, and so they chain him to a rock and an eagle eats his liver every day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mom tried to get me to eat liver at Rita’s Cafeteria one time. I wrapped it in my napkin and flushed it down the toilet.” A piranha surfaced. It snapped its teeth. “Yikes. Okay. Need distraction. Tell me another story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Princess Andromeda was chained to a rock as a virgin sacrifice to stop Poseidon’s sea monster from devouring everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow. They really liked the rock-death thingy,” Mary Lou said. “What did she do wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing. Poseidon was punishing her mother for bragging about her daughter’s beauty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There we are with the braggy again,” Mary Lou said. “So, Andromeda didn’t even do anything wrong and she ended up in the ocean? Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They needed a virgin sacrifice. But then Perseus came and saved her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the pure girls get rescued.” Mary Lou felt something she didn’t let herself feel often: She was well and truly pissed off. “Why do girls have to be all pure and innocent and good? Why don’t guys have to be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No argument here. I always thought it was pretty silly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I weren’t about to die, I would totally rewrite that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I weren’t about to be eaten by piranhas, I would tell you that I love you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-queens/page-105.html","bookId":2717,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
