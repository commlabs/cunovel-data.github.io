Oh man.\" I reach over for a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So wait. That\u0027s it?\" She lights a joint, sucks in on it so deeply that half of it turns to ash. \"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m happy.\" I yawn. \"Just as long as you don\u0027t bring out that, um, leather harness and Sparky the giant butt plug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get off the bed and pull my jeans and Calvins up and move over to the window, where I lift a venetian blind. Down on Park, between 79th and 80th, is a black Jeep with two of Damien\u0027s goons sitting in it, reading the new issue of what looks like Interview with Drew Barrymore on the cover, and one looks like a black Woody Harrelson and the other like a white Damon Wayans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison knows what I\u0027m seeing and from the bed says, \"Don\u0027t worry, I have to meet Grant Hill for a drink at Mad.61. They\u0027ll follow and then you can escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flop onto the bed, flip on Nintendo, reach for the controls and start to play Super Mario Bros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien says that Julia Roberts is coming and so is Sandra Bullock,\" Alison says vacantly. \"Laura Leighton and Halle Berry and Dalton James.\" She takes another hit off the joint and hands it to me. \"I saw Elle Macpherson at the Anna Sui show and she says she\u0027ll be there for the dinner.\" She\u0027s flipping through a copy of Detour with Robert Downey, Jr., on the cover, legs spread, major crotch shot. \"Oh, and so is Scott Wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh, I\u0027m playing,\" I tell her. \"Yoshi\u0027s eaten four gold coins and he\u0027s trying to find the fifth. I need to concentrate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god, who gives a shit,\" Alison sighs. \"We\u0027re dealing with a fat midget who rides a dinosaur and saves his girlfriend from a pissed-off gorilla? Victor, get serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not his girlfriend. It\u0027s Princess Toadstool. And it\u0027s not a gorilla,\" I stress. \"It\u0027s Lemmy Koopa of the evil Koopa clan. And baby, as usual, you\u0027re missing the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please enlighten me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole point of Super Mario Bros. is that it mirrors life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m following.\" She checks her nails. \"God knows why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill or be killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time is running out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotcha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in the end, baby, you... are... alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" She stands up. \"Well, Victor, that really captures the spirit of our relationship, honey.\" She disappears into a closet bigger than the bedroom. \"If you had to be interviewed by Worth magazine on the topic of Damien\u0027s Nintendo stock, you\u0027d want to kill Yoshi too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess this is all just beyond the realm of your experience,\" I murmur. \"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing tonight for dinner?\" she calls out from the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Where\u0027s Damien?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Atlantic City. So the two of us can go out since I\u0027m sure Chloe is tres exhausted from all dat wittle modeling she had to do today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" I call back. \"I\u0027ve got to get to bed early. I\u0027m skipping dinner. I\u0027ve got to go over-oh shit-seating arrangements.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but baby, I want to go to Nobu tonight,\" she whines from the closet. \"I want a baby shrimp tempura roll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a baby shrimp tempura roll,\" I whine back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rings, the machine picks up, just new Portishead, then a beep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Alison, it\u0027s Chloe calling back.\" I roll my eyes. \"Amber and Shalom and I have to do something for Fashion TV at the Royalton and then I\u0027m having dinner with Victor at Bowery Bar at nine-thirty. I\u0027m so so tired... did shows all day. Okay, I guess you\u0027re not there. Talk to you soon-oh yeah, you have a pass backstage for Todd\u0027s show tomorrow. Bye-bye.\" The machine clicks off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence from the closet, then, low and laced with fury, \"Seating arrangements? You-have-to-go-to-bed-early?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t keep me in your penthouse,\" I say. \"I\u0027m going back to my plow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re having dinner with her?\" she screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, I had no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison walks out of the closet holding a Todd Oldham wraparound dress in front of her and waits for my reaction, showing it off: not-so-basic black-slash-beige, strapless, Navajo-inspired and neon quilted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a Todd Oldham, baby,\" I finally say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m wearing it tomorrow night.\" Pause. \"It\u0027s an original,\" she whispers seductively, eyes glittering. \"I\u0027m gonna make your little girlfriend look like shit!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-10.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
