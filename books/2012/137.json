You went and got us all to swear our souls to a damned god! This ain’t your first time as a Mortal Sword, is it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler wheeled on Stormy. ‘How should I know? It’s not like Fener reached down and patted me on the head, is it? And what about you, Adjutant ? You lied to the damned Empress!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did what Cartheron and Urko asked me to do!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You betrayed the Empire!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeda Sinn was laughing, but it was a cold, cruel laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth had gone white and had backed up a step, her eyes wide as she looked from Gesler to Stormy and back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinn said to Gesler. ‘That’s why you’ll be needed. But you won’t like it. Hah! You won’t like any of it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler made to advance on the girl but Stormy stepped into his path and shoved him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Will all of you stop it! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAranict’s shout halted everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwearing under his breath, Gesler turned away from Stormy’s challenging glare. ‘Prince, this ain’t what I was looking for. I wanted you to take overall command – you or Krughava. Gods, even that queen you talked about. I don’t want any of this.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The matter,’ said Brys, ‘has proved far more complicated than even I had thought. But I mean to hold to my agreement with the Adjunct. Nor do I expect Queen Abrastal to change her mind, either. Our royal titles are nothing but a product of circumstance. They confer no special talent or ability, and we are both aware of that. Mortal Sword Gesler, it is undeniable that you are in command of the most formidable army in this alliance, and as such, the full weight of command must fall on you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnarling, Stormy swung round and stamped back to the waiting K’Chain Che’Malle. The small hairy dog followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler shrugged. ‘We liked it the way we’d made it – gods, so long ago now. Hiding in some foul garrison in a smelly fishing village. We’d ducked down so far it looked like the world had forgotten us, and that was just how we wanted it. And now look at us. Gods below.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys cocked his head. ‘You have been with the Adjunct ever since that time?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not quite. We got pulled in with the Whirlwind – a mutiny. We blame the Imperial Historian, that’s who we blame. Never mind, none of it’s worth knowing – it’s just a sordid tale of us staggering and stumbling this way and that across half the damned world. We did nothing of note, except maybe staying alive, and see where it’s got us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If you and your friend are feeling so trapped,’ said Brys, ‘why not just leave? Did you not already call yourself and Stormy deserters?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wish I could. I really do. But we can’t, and we know it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But … why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler looked down abjectly at Grub. ‘Because,’ he whispered like a man condemned, ‘ she trusts us .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now didn’t that go well,’ said Aranict as they rode back towards the column at a slow trot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys regarded her. ‘There was considerable alarm in your voice, Aranict, when you so startled us all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where do gods come from, Brys? Do you know?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, unwilling to stir awake his memories of the seabed, the forgotten menhirs so bearded in slime. He had lost a lifetime wandering the muddy, wasted depths. I slept, and so wanted to sleep – for ever. And if this is not the death others find, it was the death that found me. Such weariness, I’d lost the will to drag myself free .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gesler and Stormy,’ said Aranict, ‘they are almost within reach.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m sorry, what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of godhood.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You speak of things Kuru Qan used to talk about. The ancient First Empire notion of ascendancy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Destriant spoke of fire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled to stay on the path she seemed to be taking. ‘The girl, Sinn …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAranict snorted. ‘Yes, her. Fire at its most destructive, at its most senseless – she could have burned us all to ash and given it not a moment’s thought. When you hold such power inside you, it burns away all that is human. You feel nothing. But Brys, you don’t understand – the Adjunct wants Sinn with them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As far away from her as possible? I don’t think Tavore would—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No no, that wasn’t her reason, Brys. It’s Gesler and Stormy.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-137.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
