{"id":24705,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER IV EUGENE DE BEAUHARNAIS","content":"\u0026nbsp;At the call of her \"little Charles\" as she called him, Madame Teutch came out of a little dining-room which opened upon the courtyard and entered the kitchen. \"Ah, there you are, thank God!\" she cried. \"Then the ogre did not eat you, poor little Tom Thumb!\" \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He was charming, on the contrary; and I don\u0027t believe that his teeth are as long as they say.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"God grant that you never feel them! But if I heard right, yours are the long ones. Come in here, and I will go call your future friend, who is working as usual, poor child!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the citizeness Teutch ran upstairs with a youthfulness which indicated an excess of exuberant force.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the meantime Charles examined the preparations for one of the most appetizing breakfasts that had ever been placed before him. He was diverted from his occupation by the sound of the door opening. It admitted the youth of whom the citizeness Teutch had spoken. He was a lad of fifteen, with black eyes and curly black hair which fell over his shoulders. His attire was elegant, and his linen of unusual whiteness. In spite of the efforts that had evidently been made to disguise it, everything in him betrayed the aristocrat. He approached Charles smilingly and held out his hand to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Our good hostess tells me, citizen,\" he said, \"that I am to have the pleasure of spending some time with you; and she added that you had promised to like me a little. I am very glad of that, for I am sure I shall become very much attached to you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And I, too,\" cried Charles, \"with all my heart.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Bravo, bravo!\" cried Madame Teutch, coming in at[Pg 32] this juncture. \"And now that you have greeted each other like two gentlemen—a very dangerous thing to do in these days—embrace each other like two comrades.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I ask nothing better,\" said Eugene; and Charles sprang into his arms.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two boys embraced with the cordiality and frankness of youth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now,\" continued the elder of the two, \"I know that your name is Charles; mine is Eugene. I hope that since we know each other\u0027s name there will be no more monsieur or citizen between us. Shall I set you the example? Will you come to table, my dear Charles? I am dying of hunger and I heard Madame Teutch say that you also had a good appetite.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Heigho!\" said Madame Teutch, \"how well that was said, my little Charles. These aristocrats, these aristocrats, they know what is right!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do not say such things, my dear Madame Teuton,\" said Eugene, laughing; \"a worthy inn like yours should lodge nothing but sans-culottes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In that case I should have to forget that I had the honor of lodging your worthy father, Monsieur Eugene; and, God knows, I pray night and morning for him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You may pray for my mother at the same time, good Madame Teutch,\" said the youth, wiping away a tear, \"for my sister Hortense writes me that she has been arrested and confined in the prison of the Carmelites. I received the letter, this morning.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My poor friend,\" said Charles.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How old is your sister?\" asked Madame Teutch.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ten.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Poor child! send for her to come to you at once; and we will take care of her. She can\u0027t stay alone in Paris.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thanks, Madame Teutch, thanks; but fortunately she is not alone. She is with my grandmother at our Chateau de la Ferté-Beauharnais. But here I have made you all sad, and I had resolved to keep this news to myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 33]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Monsieur Eugene,\" said Charles, \"when one has such notions one does not ask for people\u0027s friendship. Now, to punish you, you are to talk of nothing but your father and your mother and sister during all the breakfast.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two boys sat down at table, Madame Teutch remaining to serve them. The task imposed on Eugene was an easy one for him. He told his young friend that he was the last descendant of a noble family of Orléanais; that one of his ancestors, Guillaume de Beauharnais, had married Marguerite de Bourges in 1398; that another, Jean de Beauharnais, had been a witness at the trial of La Pucelle (Joan of Arc); that in 1764 their estate of la Ferté-Aurain had been elevated to a marquisate under the name of la Ferté-Beauharnais; that his uncle Fran?ois had emigrated in 1790, had become a major in the army of Condé, and had offered himself to the president of the Convention to defend the king. As for his father, who was at the present time under arrest on charge of conspiracy with the enemy, he had been born at Martinique, and there had married Mademoiselle Tascher de la Pagerie, and had brought her to France, where they had been received at court.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Elected to the States-General by the jurisdiction of Blois, he had, on the night of the 4th of August, been one of the first to favor the suppression of titles and privileges. Elected a secretary of the National Assembly, and a member of the military commission, he had, during the preparation of the Federation, worked eagerly at the levelling of the Champ de Mars, harnessed to the same cart as the Abbé Sièyes. Finally he had been detailed to the Army of the North as adjutant-general; he had commanded the camp of Soissons, refused the Ministry of War, and accepted the fatal command of the Army of the Rhine. The rest is known.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But it was when he spoke of the beauty, goodness, and grace of his mother that the youth was most eloquent; and he declared that he would now work all the more eagerly for the Marquis de Beauharnais, because in so doing he was also working for his good mother, Josephine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 34]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Charles, who felt a deep affection for his own parents, found infinite delight in listening to his young companion, and did not tire of asking him about his mother and sister. But in the midst of this conversation, a dull report shook the window-panes of the hotel, and was immediately followed by others.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The cannon! the cannon!\" cried Eugene, who was more accustomed to the sounds of war than his young companion. And leaping from his chair, he cried: \"Alarm! alarm! the city is attacked!\" Just then they heard the beating of drums in several directions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two youths ran to the door, where Madame Teutch had preceded them. There were already signs of great disturbance in the streets. Riders, dressed in different uniforms, crossed each other in all directions, probably carrying orders, while the townsfolk, armed with pikes, sabres, and pistols, were rushing toward the Haguenau gate, crying: \"Patriots, to arms! the enemy is upon us!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From moment to moment came the dull roar of the cannon, signalling better than the human voice could have done that the city was in danger, and its inhabitants had need to defend it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come to the ramparts, Charles!\" said Eugene, darting out into the street; \"and if we can\u0027t fight ourselves, we can at least watch the battle.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Charles caught his enthusiasm and followed his companion, who, more familiar than himself with the topography of the city, led him by the shortest way to the Haguenau gate. As they passed a gunsmith\u0027s shop, Eugene paused.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wait,\" said he, \"I have an idea.\" He entered the shop, and asked the master, \"Have you a good rifle?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" replied the latter, \"but it is dear.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How much?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Two hundred livres.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The youth drew a handful of paper money from his pocket and threw it on the counter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you ball and powder?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 35]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Give me some.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The gunsmith chose twenty balls that fitted the rifle, and weighed out a pound of powder which he put in a powder-flask, while Eugene counted out the two hundred livres in assignats, and six more for the powder and ball.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you know how to use a gun,\" Eugene asked Charles.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Alas! no,\" replied the boy, ashamed of his ignorance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never mind,\" said Eugene, laughing, \"I will fight for us both.\" And he hastened on toward the threatened spot, loading his rifle as he went.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the rest, it was curious to see how every one, no matter what his opinion, seemed fairly to spring upon the foe. From each gate came armed men; the magic cry, \"The enemy! the enemy!\" seemed to evoke defenders on the spot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Near the gate the crowd was so dense that Eugene saw he could never gain the rampart except by making a detour. He hastened to the right and soon found himself on that part of the rampart which was opposite Schiltigheim.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A great number of patriots were gathered here discharging their guns. Eugene had much difficulty in making his way to the front, but at last he succeeded, and Charles followed him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The road and the plain presented the appearance of a battlefield in the greatest confusion. French and Austrians were fighting pell-mell with indescribable fury. The enemy, in pursuit of a French corps which had been seized with one of those unaccountable panics which the ancients attributed to the fury of the gods, had almost succeeded in forcing an entrance into the city with the fleeing Frenchmen. The gates, shut just in time, had left part of the latter outside, and it was they who had turned with fury against their assailants, while the cannon thundered and the rifles cracked from the summit of the ramparts.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah!\" cried Eugene, waving his rifle, joyously, \"I knew a battle would be a fine sight!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 36]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just as he said this a ball passed between Charles and himself, cutting off one of his curls and making a hole in his hat; then it stretched in death a patriot who had stood just behind them. The wind of its passage blew upon the face of each.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! I know who it was. I saw him! I saw him!\" cried Charles.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who, who?\" asked Eugene.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There, that one there, the one who is tearing his cartridge in order to reload his gun.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wait! wait! Are you perfectly sure?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think so!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, then, look!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The youth fired. The dragoon\u0027s horse leaped forward; he had no doubt involuntarily put spurs to it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hit! hit!\" cried Eugene.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And, indeed, the dragoon tried to sling his musket into place, but in vain; the weapon soon slipped from his grasp. He put one hand to his side, and trying to guide his horse with the other endeavored to escape from the combat; but after a few steps he swayed backward and forward and then fell headlong to the ground. One of his feet caught in the stirrup, and the frightened horse set off at a gallop, dragging him along. The two boys followed him with their eyes for a moment, but both horse and rider soon disappeared in the smoke.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then the gates opened and the garrison marched forth with drums beating and bayonets levelled. It was the final effort of the patriots and the enemy had not expected it. The trumpets sounded the retreat, and the cavalry, scattered over the plain, formed together at the road, and galloped off toward Kilstett and Gambelheim. The cannon were fired awhile longer at the fugitives, but the rapidity of their retreat soon put them out of range.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two boys returned to the city exultant, Charles at having seen a battle, Eugene at having taken part in one.[Pg 37] Charles made Eugene promise that he would teach him to use the rifle which he handled so skilfully. And then, for the first time, did they learn the cause of this alarm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n General Eisemberg, an old German campaigner of the school of Luckner, who had waged a war of partisans with a certain success, had been charged by Pichegru with the defence of the advance-post of Bischwiller. Either through carelessness, or a desire to oppose Saint-Just, instead of taking the precautions directed by the representatives of the people, he had allowed his troops and himself to be surprised, and he and his staff had barely saved themselves by flight. At the foot of the walls, finding himself supported, he had turned, but too late; the alarm had been given in the city, and every one knew that the unfortunate officer might just as well die or let himself be taken prisoner, as to seek safety in a city where Saint-Just commanded. And in fact he had scarcely entered the gates before he, and all his staff, were arrested by order of the Representative of the People.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When they returned to the H?tel de la Lanterne, the two young friends found poor Madame Teutch in a state of the greatest anxiety. Eugene was beginning to be known in the town where he had spent a month, and some one had told her that the young fellow had been seen near the Haguenau gate with a rifle in his hand. At first she had not believed it, but when she saw him return with the rifle, she was seized with a retrospective terror that doubled the interest of Charles\u0027 story. The boy was as enthusiastic as a conscript who has just seen his first battle.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But all this enthusiasm did not make Charles forget that he was to dine with citizen Euloge Schneider at two o\u0027clock. At five minutes of two, having ascended the steps more slowly than he had descended them in the morning, he knocked at the little door to which they led.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3318/90762.html","bookId":398,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 3:43:15 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 3:43:15 PM"}
