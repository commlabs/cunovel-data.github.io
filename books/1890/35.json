Far warmer than December.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and imagined how it would happen. He would come around the corner, and I would see him there, waiting for me. We would run into each other\u0027s arms and finally kiss. The kiss I had wondered about many times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warm wind was gone as quickly as it had come, but I still felt something. Suddenly lips brushed against mine. My instinct was to open my eyes, but I didn’t. I let the kiss be frightening and exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands grabbed at my arms, pressing me into the pillar. Lips caressed and sucked, massaging mine slowly. The stranger’s tongue brushed lightly against my lips, as if asking permission to go farther. I could feel the intensity of his body against mine. He vibrated as if he wanted to go farther but forced himself to remain controlled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught a scent I would know anywhere and smiled against his face, still not opening my eyes, \"France?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Jacqueline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy arms shot up, wrapping around his neck. He lifted me up into his arms but pressed me against the ancient pillar. His body against mine was familiar, and yet, exciting and somehow new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue still never made its way into my mouth; he still teased with the kiss, regardless of the fact our bodies were begging for everything all at once. He stopped kissing and pressed his forehead against mine, breathing ragged breath against my chin, \"You aren’t disappointed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was odd but true, I was excited it was him. It was the sweetest thing he had ever done and it made him the person I wanted him to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put me down and took one of my hands in his. We were shaking with need and excitement but he did the unexpected. He led me to the door of the art gallery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paid and pulled me through the familiar surroundings. He pulled me to the picture with the guy staring into the reflection of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and stared at it, \"This is my favorite. I don’t see it the way everyone else does. I think he\u0027s looking at himself and seeing all the mistakes he\u0027s made and all the regrets in his life, and he\u0027s stuck there, trying to find the point where it all went wrong. He doesn’t see perfection, he sees regret and mistakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes filled with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at me, \"The day I left your parents’ house like a chicken shit after Phil proposed. That was the day it all went wrong. I should have walked out of that room, punched Phil, the douche, in the face, thrown his ring at your father and dragged you out of that house. I should have married you and made you happy every day. I think I\u0027ve been like this guy here, just stuck staring at the reflection and trying to find a way to fix it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lip quivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiped my tears, \"I am so sorry it took me so long, Jack.\" He got down on his knee, stunning me. He pulled something I never imagined from his pocket, \"I\u0027m not going to rush into a wedding and a relationship, I expect to win you over the right way. You deserve that. But I wanted to give you this as a symbol of my love.\" He handed me the deed to the vineyard in North Carolina. The paper shook in my hands. \"Sometimes you just need something good to happen to you. You\u0027re the good thing for me and I want to be your good thing.\" He reached up, drying my tears. I was frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, \"Stop doing that freezing up thing and say you love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped to my knees too, in front of him, \"I don’t deserve you. I should have said no to my father and Phil faster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned over, kissing my face, \"Jack, I always knew we\u0027d find our way here, eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffled and leaned into the kiss. \"You\u0027ve always been home, France. Always.\" I realized then, that home wasn’t so much a place as it was a feeling. I had never felt at home in my house. I had never felt at home in my life. But with him, I had always felt at home. The only time I ever truly slept was when I was with him. The safety wasn’t strength, it was the comfort of being loved and accepted, regardless of the flaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I will pay you back every dime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, \"Stop being a pain in the ass and come home with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Home.\" It was wherever he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow we always take the long way home, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my arms around his neck and let him lead me from the Gallery of Ancient Arts and out to the car he had waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the rush? We could stay overnight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"I have a playoff game in fourteen hours. It\u0027s eight and a half just to fly back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, \"You came here between games?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, \"Yeah, when me and Luce worked this out, we didn\u0027t take into account playoff games. Not smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, \"He told you about the meeting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked, \"I don’t want to talk, Jack. I wanna join the mile-high club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrinkled my nose, \"Ewwww.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the airport, I understood. He had Muriel\u0027s jet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I can\u0027t do that to her plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked, \"I was kidding. I need to sleep, and besides, me and you are on that celibacy kick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Yeah, right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"I\u0027m not kidding. We aren’t having sex until we are sure of where we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged him, \"I am sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed the top of my head, \"Don’t tempt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat next to him and snuggled into his arm and had the best sleep I\u0027d had in a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday - The End of May\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of Muriel and my mother cackling and telling stories, that I wouldn’t ever be able to drink away from my memories, had filled the air for hours. I was excited to see my mother so free. Muriel had been a terribly-good influence on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi looked haunted but gave me a fake smile. Suddenly she understood what heartbreak was. It was refreshing seeing her suffer. It was her first time really feeling something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce nudged me and pointed at the old barn, \"What\u0027s the plan for that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI beamed, \"Tasting bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stepped into the cool shade of the horrid old barn. Vines and webs made up the air around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you disappointed it wasn’t me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at him and bit my lip. He smiled, \"I knew you wouldn’t be. I saw how you looked at him. Did he tell you how it happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, looking around the old barn. It would make an interesting structure, once refinished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He came and gave me his blessing. He told me that I was the right choice for you and he would accept it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around, \"He said that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"He never meant it. He was sacrificing his happiness for yours. It was a big step for him. I told him that I was certain if he applied himself, he would make you far happier than I ever would or could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I will regret it the rest of my life, but I have never seen him this focused on something unselfish before. It\u0027s good for him to need to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winked, \"You set the bar pretty high for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, \"If you find he isn’t meeting that bar, you come find me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a hand out, \"Deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance came into the barn, \"Dude. What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce grinned at him, \"Just making arrangements for stealing your girlfriend’s heart after you go back to being a lazy slob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"Screw you guys.\" He wrapped an arm around my shoulders and kissed the top of my head, \"This barn is fucking creepy, Jack. I\u0027m going back into the sunshine. It looks like that movie The Ring in here.\" He shuddered and walked back out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce frowned but I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finished the tour of the grounds with a glass of wine in the small building currently used as a tasting room and restaurant. The old man, Mr. MacKenzie, poured me a glass of the cabernet. He smiled as I took the first sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, \"Plums and tobacco?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"Yes. Some people get a hint of black cherry but only the good palates can pick up the plum. It\u0027s fruitier than the French cab sauv but that is a new world taste. The grapes have reacted to the new world with a slightly fruitier taste. Still nice and dry though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"It\u0027s delicious. The mother grape skins went into this as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, \"She goes in every bottle, even if it\u0027s just a little. The tradition was taken from the old Valpolicella wines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Luce. He sipped and nodded, \"Very smart. It gives it an old-world flavor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. MacKenzie pointed at him, \"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom and Muriel took him my the arm, \"Show us the rest of the vineyard, Stanley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced. France laughed, \"Your mom and Muriel are like cougars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi wrinkled her nose, \"Oh gross. I don’t even want to think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance came and took my hand, leading me to the far side of the small room, \"Are you happy?\" His eyes were worried. I stood on my tiptoes, \"That isn’t a strong enough word for it.\" I brushed my lips against his softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, \"I love you, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce interrupted our kiss, \"I\u0027m taking Brandi back to the hotel. She is feeling the heat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at me and waved at Mike, \"See ya later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike waved. He looked down at me, \"I wish he was less awesome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and slapped his arm, \"You go through what he\u0027s been through and try to not come out either bitter and horrid or totally awesome. He was prepared to never play again and that’s when his father started to love him. That’s awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, \"You rich people are weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I agree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led me from the small building to the long, grassy trail. It led to the beach. We sat down in the sand and watched the waves. The warmth off the coast was amazing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-35.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
