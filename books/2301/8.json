{"id":94114,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door a crack. “I never gave you my address. How did you find me?” Since I was new in town and had a private phone number, I knew he hadn\u0027t found my name on the Web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze burned into mine. “Honey, I could find you ten feet down in the dark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look in his eyes, the heat in his voice, did funny things in the pit of my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to invite me in,” he asked, “or make me stand out here on the porch like some horny teenager?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStifling a laugh, I took a step backward. “Come on in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a peculiar shimmery sensation in the air around me as he crossed the threshold, only then remembering that a Vampire couldn\u0027t enter a home without an invitation from the owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael followed me into the living room. “Nice place,” he said, glancing around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed his gaze. The room wasn\u0027t anything fancy, but it was warm and cozy, from the braided rug in front of the hearth to the oil painting of a herd of wild horses running in the moonlight that hung over the mantel. A pair of red oak end tables flanked a high-backed sofa; a matching chair sat at an angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gestured at the couch. “Please, sit down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know if he expected me to sit beside him or not, but I took the chair. Sitting next to him while I was wearing a skimpy tank top and pajama bottoms seemed like a really bad idea. Picking up the remote, I switched off the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trying to think of something to say when Raphael sniffed the air, and then frowned. “Where have you been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone of his voice lifted the short hairs along my nape. “I haven\u0027t been anywhere, why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who were you with today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really don\u0027t think that\u0027s any of your business, is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Answer me, dammit! Who were you with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re not my father. I don\u0027t have to answer to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe uncoiled from the sofa and stood towering over me, his expression lethal. “Who were you with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at him, my mouth suddenly dry. “Just a guy who came into the bookstore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s his name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cagin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael\u0027s whole body grew taut. “What were you doing with him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn\u0027t doing anything. If you must know, he took me on a picnic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf possible, Raphael\u0027s black eyes grew even darker, narrowing to ominous slits. “You\u0027re dating a Were?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s not a Werewolf. I asked him if he was, and he said no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mild oath escaped Raphael\u0027s lips. He raked a hand through his hair, then resumed his place on the sofa. “Werewolves aren\u0027t the only Were-creatures. You know that, don\u0027t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are a number of Were-creatures,” he explained. “There are Were-leopards, Were-coyotes, Were-bears, Were-lions, and Were-tigers, to name only a few. Cagin is a Were-tiger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI envisioned Cagin with a mouth full of sharp teeth. The better to eat you with, my dear. “I didn\u0027t know. I mean, I had no idea.” But it explained the funny feeling I\u0027d had when I met him, and it made me wonder anew how I was able to discern Vampires and Were-creatures from other people. I\u0027d never been psychic or anything before. Or maybe I\u0027d just never had the chance to use my gift, if that\u0027s what it was, until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s a big difference between Werewolves and other Were-creatures,” Rafe went on. “The Were-tigers and such don\u0027t have to change when the moon is full.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So they\u0027re really just shape-shifters?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. They\u0027re born that way, not made. Most of them are harmless, but you never know when one will turn on you. And once a Were-creature gets a taste for human flesh, they\u0027re just as dangerous and vicious as the Werewolves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, where do the other Were-creatures stand in the war? Whose side are they on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Were-tigers are the only other Supernatural creatures involved. The rest have remained neutral so far.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are the Were-tigers involved?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They like to fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blew out a sigh, thinking I had been much happier before I knew Vampires and Were-creatures existed. It made me wonder what other monsters were lurking out there in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay away from Cagin,” Raphael said flatly. “You\u0027re not safe with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I\u0027m safe with you?” I tapped my fingertips on the arm of the chair. “Seems to me that it\u0027s just a case of choosing who I want to bite me, a Vampire or a Were-tiger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can\u0027t trust the Werewolves,” he said curtly. “You can\u0027t trust Cagin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do I know I can trust you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good point.” He gazed into the fireplace for several moments, then said, “I told myself I wouldn\u0027t see you again, that no good could come from it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why are you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look at me, his dark eyes intent upon my face. No other man had ever looked at me quite that way, as if every fiber of his being was focused solely on me. My breath seemed trapped in my throat as I waited for his answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because,” he said quietly, “I couldn\u0027t stay away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was so warm and filled with such desire, I was surprised I didn\u0027t melt on the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Raphael…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know how you feel. You\u0027re afraid to trust me, and I don\u0027t blame you. Hell, I don\u0027t trust myself sometimes, but…” He blew out a breath that seemed to come from the very depths of his soul. “If you won\u0027t be my lover, would you at least be my friend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to say. Raphael Cordova was eighty-five years old. He\u0027d been a dyed-in-the-wool Vampire for seventy-two of those years. Yet, at that moment, he sounded far younger than his years. Looking into his eyes, I saw the boy he must have been before his life was turned upside down. He probably hadn\u0027t had many friends, what with being tutored at home and all. And later, after he had been turned, it probably hadn\u0027t been any easier to find guys to hang out with. After all, not many thirteen-year-old kids were out on the town in the wee hours of the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was it like, sleeping during the day and being awake all night? What did you do for fun? Did you get to go out late at night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not as much as we wanted to.” A slow grin spread over his face. “Rane and I snuck out of the house a lot. Worried my Mom no end, the way we were always sneaking out. My dad was more lenient. He understood our need to explore the night, to learn what it meant to be what we had become, especially as we grew older.” He grunted softly, and I knew from his expression that he was remembering his past. “Rane and I got into some hellacious situations. There were a couple of times when we\u0027d have been in a world of hurt if our old man hadn\u0027t come to our rescue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of situations?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing too bad until we turned sixteen. It was about that time that we really started stretching our wings, so to speak, testing our powers, seeing how far we could go. One night we got into a brawl with a motorcycle gang. Those guys really knew how to fight,” he recalled with a wry grin, “but they were no match for a couple of teenage Vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The closest call we had was with a Vampire hunter. He trailed us one night. Being young and stupid and overconfident, we didn\u0027t pay any attention to him until he followed us into an alley that dead-ended against a six-story building. We were trying to decide whether to scale the building or turn and fight when he sprayed us with holy water. That stuff burns like hellfire. Some of it splashed in Rane\u0027s eyes, momentarily blinding him. While he was trying to shake it off, the hunter came after me. He had a silver dagger in one hand and a thick wooden stake in the other. If the old man hadn\u0027t shown up when he did…” Raphael shook his head. “I guess I wouldn\u0027t be here now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m glad your father found you in time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess it\u0027s pretty stupid of me to be telling you all this, isn\u0027t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t think so. Friends shouldn\u0027t have secrets from one another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me for a full thirty seconds, and then he smiled. “So I haven\u0027t scared you away for good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know. What does being your friend entail, exactly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever you want it to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean like being there when you\u0027re feeling blue, driving you to the airport, and listening when you need someone to talk to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty much,” he said with a melancholy smile, “except for driving me to the airport. So, what do you say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t resist the soulful expression in his dark eyes, or the barely suppressed note of hope in his voice. Here was a being with Supernatural powers, a man who could probably destroy me with a glance, and yet he wanted me to be his friend. How could I refuse? Besides, I didn\u0027t have any friends in Oak Hollow, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuck out my hand. “Hello, friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand, large and strong, engulfed mine. “Friends,” he murmured. “Forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForever. Here was a man who could promise me eternity and mean it. “So, friend,” I asked, “what do you want to do now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was slow and oh-so-sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind that!” I said. “We\u0027re friends, remember? Not lovers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still holding my hand. He squeezed it lightly. “You\u0027ll let me know if you change your mind about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” he said, releasing my hand, “do you want to watch a movie or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” Picking up the remote, I turned the screen on, then surfed through the channels until I found a movie neither of us had seen before. After a moment\u0027s hesitation, I joined Rafael on the sofa, careful to keep a respectable distance between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen might as well have been blank, the movie silent, for all that I got out of watching it. I couldn\u0027t concentrate on the plot, couldn\u0027t think of anything but the man sitting beside me. His presence filled the room; his masculine scent teased my nostrils. He rested one arm along the back of the sofa, his hand tantalizingly close to my nape. Even though we weren\u0027t touching, I was aware of every breath he took, every glance he slid in my direction. Every time he moved, I went still inside, waiting, wondering if he would reach for me. Friends , I thought. How could I be friends with a man who made me feel this way? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-8.html","bookId":2301,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM"}
