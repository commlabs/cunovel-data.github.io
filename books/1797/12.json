Was that what he was doing? Courting Verity? No, not quite. He wanted to learn her secrets, but that wasn\u0027t the same as wanting to marry the woman, for Christ\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas finished shaving and took his shower. By the time he was dressed and had water on the stove for instant coffee, the cabin was finally beginning to get warm. He made a mental note to see what he could do about the lousy heating system. He was supposed to be a handyperson, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if he didn\u0027t get the system fixed, it was going to be one long, chilly winter here by the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the winter would be far more comfortable if he moved in with his boss, Jonas told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fingered the earring in his pocket as he stood by the stove waiting for the water to boil. From the kitchen window he could see the light in Verity\u0027s bedroom window. She was up early, as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slow smile of satisfaction and anticipation edged his mouth. The gold circlet in his pocket felt warm to the touch, and the faint pulse of the earring\u0027s vibrations was full of promise. Just like Verity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity spent Monday morning taking inventory and planning menus for the week ahead. She would have to arrange for a delivery of rice and a few other staples, she noted. The supply of buckwheat was almost gone; her buckwheat crepes had proven quite popular. She sat at the desk in her tiny office and sipped coffee while she made lists, checked accounts, and paid bills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe work was fairly routine and she found herself thinking about other things while she wrote out checks and made notes. Mostly what she thought about was Jonas Quarrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity still didn\u0027t understand quite what had happened last night in the spa pool. True, she was twenty-eight years old and still a virgin, but she was far from naive. She had been kissed before and had derived moderate pleasure from the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what she had been discovering last night could hardly be described as moderate. It couldn\u0027t even be described as purely physical. Something more had been involved, something that went beyond the physical. On one level she felt vaguely alarmed, but on another, more immediate level, Verity was dangerously intrigued. She wondered how far things would have gone if Laura Griswald hadn\u0027t walked into the spa room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was very much afraid she knew the answer to that question, and her insides tightened at the knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything had felt so right when Jonas held her in his arms. After all these years of waiting and wondering, things had finally felt right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had felt right with the wrong man. It wasn\u0027t fair. Her father had warned her once that life was not always fair, she reflected. It was more of a crapshoot, he had explained. A game without any rules except those an individual made for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was just as well that Laura had interrupted matters, Verity decided as she put away the large check register. She needed time to think before she became any more involved with Jonas Quarrel. The last thing she wanted in her life was another drifter, even if he did know the secret of stirring her senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned thoughtfully, wondering if Jonas had gained any wrong impressions from what had happened last night. Then she told herself there was nothing to worry about. In all the ways that counted, she was the one in charge around here. If worst came to worst, she could always fire him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she comforted herself with that thought, the phone rang. Verity smiled wryly as she reached for the receiver. It didn\u0027t take much intuition to guess who would be calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Laura,\" Verity said without any preamble. \"The answers are, I don\u0027t know, no, and I doubt it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know what I was going to ask?\" Laura demanded ruefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to know where Jonas Quarrel came from, if he\u0027s already my lover, and if he isn\u0027t, will he be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take comfort in the \u0027I doubt it\u0027 answer. There\u0027s still hope,\" Laura shot back. \"You really did hire him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He showed up looking for a job on Friday afternoon. He arrived just as I was about to pick up the phone and yell for help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027s interesting, I\u0027ll grant you that. But as much as I\u0027d like to see you involved in a love affair, it\u0027s my duty to advise caution. These days a woman can\u0027t be too careful. Did you check his references?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know me, Laura, I always check references.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well? What did you learn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To summarize: He\u0027s an expert on Renaissance history and he\u0027s got a lot of experience washing dishes, tending bar, and bouncing drunks. He\u0027s drifted most of the way around the world earning a living with those job skills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have a bar and you don\u0027t get many drunks at the No Bull,\" Laura pointed out. \"Nor are you in the business of teaching Renaissance history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, but I do need a dishwasher. He\u0027s a hard worker, Laura.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looked more like a fast worker to me. I couldn\u0027t believe it when I walked into the spa last night and saw you wrapped around him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the back door open and close and knew Jonas was in the cafe kitchen. Her fingers tightened on the phone. \"Don\u0027t exaggerate. I was hardly wrapped around him. It was a simple kiss, Laura. Don\u0027t make too much out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? After three years of trying to match you up with a nice stockbroker or lawyer and getting nowhere for all my pains, you turn around and jump into a spa with your newest dishwasher and I\u0027m not supposed to make too much out of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity chuckled. \"You should be grateful and infinitely relieved, Laura. For three years you\u0027ve said my biggest problem was that I was too picky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your biggest problem is that you\u0027re going to spend your whole life looking for a man who has all your father\u0027s strengths and none of his weaknesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laura...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Common sense, which you usually have plenty of, should have told you by now that you\u0027re not going to find that combination in any normal male. You are too picky. Much too picky. But there\u0027s no need to go crazy now that you\u0027ve decided to be more reasonable in what you demand in a man. Let me find you someone interesting from my guest list for next weekend. Now, I\u0027ve got a nice doctor down here, age forty, and he\u0027s coming by himself. Probably divorced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or g*y.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. If he were g*y, he\u0027d probably be checking in with another man,\" Laura said thoughtfully. \"I think this doctor might be a viable candidate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Laura, I\u0027d love to chat about my problems but right now I\u0027ve got to go. I\u0027ve got a million things to do and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your dishwasher just walked through the door, right?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-12.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
