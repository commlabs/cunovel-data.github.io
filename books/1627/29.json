Shutup!” shouted Colon. “You\u0027re just- what the hell was that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey felt the sudden downdraught, saw the mist above them roll into coils that broke against the house walls. A blast of colder air swept along the street, and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was like something gliding past, up there somewhere,” said the sergeant. He froze. “Here, you don\u0027t think-?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We saw it killed, didn\u0027t we?” said Nobby urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We saw it vanish, ” said Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at one another, alone and damp in the mist-shrouded street. There could be anything up there. The imagination peopled the dank air with terrible apparitions. And what was worse was the knowledge that Nature might have done an even better job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah,” said Colon. “It was probably just some . . . some big wading bird. Or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn\u0027t there anything we should do?” said Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” said Nobby. “We should go away quickly. Remember Gaskin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it\u0027s another dragon,” said Carrot. “We should warn people and-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” said Sergeant Colon vehemently, “because, Ae, they wouldn\u0027t believe us and, Bee, we\u0027ve got a king now. \u0027S his job, dragons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“S\u0027right,” said Nobby. “He\u0027d probably be really angry. Dragons are probably, you know, royal animals. Like deer. A man could probably have his tridlins plucked just for thinking about killing one, when there\u0027s a king around.”[17]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Makes you glad you\u0027re common,” said Colon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Commoner,” corrected Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s not a very civic attitude-” Carrot began. He was interrupted by Errol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little dragon came trotting up the middle of the street, stumpy tail high, his eyes fixed on the clouds above him. He went right by the rank without giving them any attention at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s up with him?” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA clatter behind them introduced the Ramkin coach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Men?” said Vimes hesitantly, peering through the fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely,” said Sergeant Colon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you see a dragon go past? Apart from Errol?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, er,” said the sergeant, looking at the other two. “Sort of, sir. Possibly. It might of been.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then don\u0027t stand there like a lot of boobies,” said Lady Ramkin. “Get in! Plenty of room inside!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was. When it was built, the coach had probably been the marvel of the day, all plush and gilt and tasselled hangings. Time, neglect and the ripping out of the seats to allow its frequent use to transport dragons to shows had taken their toll, but it still reeked of privilege, style and, of course, dragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think you\u0027re doing?” said Colon, as it rattled off through the fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wavin\u0027,” said Nobby, gesturing graciously to the billows around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Disgusting, this sort of thing, really,” mused Sergeant Colon. “People goin\u0027 around in coaches like this when there\u0027s people with no roof to their heads.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s Lady Ramkin\u0027s coach,” said Nobby. “She\u0027s all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yes, but what about her ancestors, eh? You don\u0027t get big houses and carriages without grindin\u0027 the faces of the poor a bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re just annoyed because your missus has been embroidering crowns on her undies,” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s got nothing to do with it,” said Sergeant Colon indignantly. “I\u0027ve always been very firm on the rights of man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And dwarf,” said Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, right,” said the sergeant uncertainly. “But all this business about kings and lords, it\u0027s against basic human dignity. We\u0027re all born equal. It makes me sick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never heard you talk like this before, Frederick,” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Sergeant Colon to you, Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, Sergeant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fog itself was shaping up to be a real Ankh-Morpork autumn gumbo.* Vimes squinted through it as the droplets buckled down to a good day\u0027s work soaking him to the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can just make him out,” he said. “Turn left here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any ideas where we are?” said Lady Ramkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Business district somewhere,” said Vimes shortly. Errol\u0027s progress was slowing a bit. He kept looking up and whining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can\u0027t see a damn thing above us in the fog,” he said. “I wonder if-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fog, as if in acknowledgement, lit up. Ahead of them it blossomed like a chrysanthemum and made a noise like “whoomph”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, no,” moaned Vimes. “Not again!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a pea-souper, only much thicker, fishier, and with things in it you\u0027d probably rather not know about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are the Cups of Integrity well and truly suffused?” intoned Brother Watchtower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, suffused full well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Waters of the World, are they Abjured?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yea, abjured full mightily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have the Demons of Infinity been bound with many chains?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn,” said Brother Plasterer, “there\u0027s always something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Watchtower sagged. “Just once it would be nice if we could get the ancient and timeless rituals right, wouldn\u0027t it. You\u0027d better get on with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wouldn\u0027t it be quicker, Brother Watchtower, if I just did it twice next time?” said Brother Plasterer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Watchtower gave this some grudging consideration. It seemed reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” he said. “Now get back down there with the others. And you should call me Acting Supreme Grand Master, understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis did not meet with what he considered to be a proper and dignified reception among the brethren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No-one said anything to us about you being Acting Supreme Grand Master,” muttered Brother Doorkeeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that\u0027s all you know because I bloody well am because Supreme Grand Master asked me to open the Lodge on account of him being delayed with all this coronation work,” said Brother Watchtower haughtily. “If that doesn\u0027t make me Acting Supreme Grand bloody Master I\u0027d like to know what does, all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t see why,” muttered Brother Doorkeeper. “You don\u0027t have a grand title like that. You could just be called something like, well . . . Rituals Monitor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” said Brother Plasterer. “Don\u0027t see why you should give yourself airs. You ain\u0027t even been taught the ancient and mystic mysteries by monks, or anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve been hanging around for hours, too,” said Brother Doorkeeper. “That\u0027s not right. I thought we\u0027d get rewarded-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Watchtower realised that he was losing control. He tried wheedling diplomacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sure Supreme Grand Master will be along directly,” he said. \"Let\u0027s not spoil it all now, eh? Lads? Arranging that fight with the dragon and everything, getting it all off right, that was something, wasn\u0027t it? We\u0027ve been through a lot, right? It\u0027s worth waiting just a bit longer, okay?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe circle of robed and cowled figures shuffled in grudging agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fair enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you say so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began to creep over Brother Watchtower that something wasn\u0027t right, but he couldn\u0027t quite put a name to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh,” he said. “Brothers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey, too, shifted uneasily. Something in the room was setting their teeth on edge. There was an atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brothers,” repeated Brother Watchtower, trying to reassert himself, “we are all here, aren\u0027t we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a worried chorus of agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course we are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s the matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was again, a subtle wrongness about things that you couldn\u0027t quite put your finger on because your finger was too scared. But Brother Watchtower\u0027s troublesome thoughts were interrupted by a scrabbling sound on the roof. A few nubs of plaster dropped into the circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brothers?” repeated Brother Watchtower nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow there was one of those silent sounds, a long, buzzing silence of extreme concentration and just possibly the indrawing of breath into lungs the size of haystacks. The last rats of Brother Watchtower\u0027s self-confidence fled the sinking ship of courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brother Doorkeeper, if you could just unbolt the dread portal-” he quavered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no pain. There was no time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath strips away many things, especially when it arrives at a temperature hot enough to vaporise iron, and among them are your illusions. The immortal remains of Brother Watchtower watched the dragon flap away into the fog, and then looked down at the congealing puddle of stone, metal and miscellaneous trace elements that was all that remained of the secret headquarters. And of its occupants, he realised in the dispassionate way that is part of being dead. You go through your whole life and end up a smear swirling around like cream in a coffee cup. Whatever the gods\u0027 games were, they played them in a damn mysterious way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at the hooded figure beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We never intended this,” he said weakly. “Honestly. No offence. We just wanted what was due to us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA skeletal hand patted him on the shoulder, not unkindly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Death said, congratulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from the Supreme Grand Master, the only Elucidated Brother to be away at the time of the dragon was Brother Fingers. He\u0027d been sent out for some pizzas. Brother Fingers was always the one sent out for takeaway food. It was cheaper. He\u0027d never bothered to master the art of paying for things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the guards rolled up just behind Errol, Brother Fingers was standing with a stack of cardboard boxes in his hands and his mouth open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the dread portal should have been was a warm melted patch of assorted substances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my goodness,” said Lady Ramkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes slid down from the coach and tapped Brother Fingers on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, sir,” he said, “did you by any chance see what-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Brother Fingers turned towards him his face was the face of a man who has hang-glided over the entrance to Hell. He kept opening and shutting his mouth but no words were coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes tried again. The sheer terror frozen in Brother Fingers\u0027s expression was getting to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you would be so kind to accompany me to the Yard,” said Vimes, “I have reason to believe that you-” He hesitated. He wasn\u0027t entirely certain what it was that he had reason to believe. But the man was clearly guilty. You could tell just by looking at him. Not, perhaps, guilty of anything specific. Just guilty in general terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmmmmuh,” said Brother Fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Colon gently lifted the lid of the top box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you make of it, Sergeant?” said Vimes, stepping back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er. It looks like a Klatchian Hots with anchovies, sir,” said Sergeant Colon knowledgeably. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-29.html","bookId":1627,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM"}
