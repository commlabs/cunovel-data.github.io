There\u0027s such a thing as civilizational memory, and the human strata of the Kurian Order have been taught that only timely arrival of help from Kur stemmed the howling tide that threatened to wash away mankind in the red-number year of 2022. They instinctively know that without the protection of the towers, the screamers might return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who\u0027s heard the dive-bomber wail of a ravies victim in full cry has the unhappy privilege of hearing it repeated in nightmares for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course in the Freeholds, they know that ravies is just another Kurian trick up one of the sleeves of a determined and ruthless creature with more limbs than can be easily counted on a living specimen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFolk remedies abound, all of them nearly useless. A bucket of ice-cold water is said to distract a sufferer long enough for you to make an escape. If you suck a wound clean while chewing real mint gum mixed with pieces of pickled ginger, onion, and garlic, you\u0027ll never catch an infection from a bite. Pregnant women are naturally immune-this particular canard leads to all manner of bizarre remedies as others seek the mystic benefits, from drinking breast milk to pouring umbilical cord blood into a fresh wound. And, of course, that the only sure way to stop a ravies sufferer from getting at you is to shoot them in the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, anyone who\u0027s ever emptied a magazine into the center mass of an oncoming screamer knows that they go down and stay down when suffering sucking chest wounds, cardiac damage, or traumatic blood loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, the only facts absolutely known about ravies is that it is a disease that affects brain tissue and the nervous system. Sufferers don\u0027t feel any pain and are hyperaware, ravenous, and irritable, and if they are startled or provoked, they will try to rend and bite the source into submission and an easy meal. Heart rate and blood pressure both increase. Most brain-wave patterns decrease, save for the delta, the wave most associated with dreams, and beta, which increases during anxiety or intense concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany wonder why the Kurians, usually so careful with lives and the aura that might be harvested, allow whole populations to be reduced by the disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Valentine had two theories. One is that ravies encounters shocked and wore down professional military types-no one enjoys gunning down children and preteens who, under ideal conditions, could be easily kept away with a walking stick or a riot shield until they drop from exhaustion. It took David Valentine months to quit hearing the screams in his sleep following his first encounter with ravies near the Red River in 2065. The other is that sufferers were harvested like everyone else in the Kurian Order, with the disease simply adding flavor to the aura thanks to the unknown tortures of body and mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuck was right, as it turned out. There weren\u0027t many cases in town. As they switched vehicles for refueling from the trailer, only one more ravie attacked, and Frat brought her down with a clean head shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey prepared to leave the mill once there was full daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to try to keep moving to make it back to Fort Seng without another stop,\" Valentine told the assembled vehicle chiefs in the mill. \"We\u0027ll take on rescues of anyone alongside the road until the vehicles are at capacity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that dangerous, sir?\" Chieftain asked. \"They might be bit. And if we lose a vehicle, who\u0027ll end up walking if there\u0027s no excess capacity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about that kid?\" Silvertip put in. \"He\u0027s been bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in Boneyard, with his mother and Doc keeping an eye on him,\" Valentine said. \"At the moment he\u0027s not symptomatic, not even trembling, so the iodine may have got it or Southern Command\u0027s last year\u0027s vaccination may work against this strain. In any case, they\u0027ll keep him sedated. As for rescues, if we lose a vehicle, we\u0027ll travel overloaded and chance the fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne or two got the joke and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more thing: Let\u0027s break out the winter camouflage. We\u0027re still soldiers, and we still have eyes in the sky watching us and enemies to fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe winter camouflage was mostly old bedsheets and fancy table-cloths cut into ponchos, and extra felt that could be wrapped around your shins and tied with twine to create extrawarm gaiters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine changed the route order. Bushmaster would go first in order to clear drifts. Rover would follow, and then Boneyard and Chuckwagon brought up the rear. The two Southern Command Bears would ride in the Chuckwagon, as they\u0027d most likely be attacked from the rear by ravies running on foot-Valentine had never heard of a ravie driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wouldn\u0027t use the motorcycles at all, not with the snow and this strain of ravies that could leap the way they\u0027d seen at the mill gate. Longshot volunteered to ride in the open atop Bushmaster so she could stand up and look over drifts, but Valentine told her to keep warm out of the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they pulled out. Valentine chalked a rough mile marker of empty circles on one of the roof struts of Rover. Every ten miles, he\u0027d mark one off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they pulled out of Grand Junction and made it back to the old federal highway, he filled in the first of the twelve circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree circles filled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith room in Rover thanks to Mrs. O\u0027Coombe being in Boneyard, Brother Mark now rode shotgun and Boelnitz, desirous of keeping away from Stuck, crammed himself into the backmost seat. Valentine sat behind Habanero so he could consult his maps and speak into the driver\u0027s ear, Duvalier next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snowfall had stopped, but the wind still threw up enough snow to make visibility bad and kept the convoy to less than five miles an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy cloud cover made for gloomy thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything from the A-o-K on the radio?\" Valentine asked as Habanero worked buttons to tune it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. Got some CB, just some lady looking for her man. Says she\u0027s scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take her position and tell her we\u0027ll report her if we can get in touch with anyone,\" Valentine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Habanero spoke on the radio, Duvalier nudged in closer to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder if this is it for Kentucky, then. How widespread is the virus, do you think? Think they hit the Republics too?\" Duvalier asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s a tough new strain, seems a waste not to do as much damage as you can. Either way, Southern Command needs to know it\u0027s here. Any luck with the radio?\" Valentine asked Habanero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe atmospherics are just bad,\" Habanero said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, if this is it?\" Brother Mark said, balling his fists on the dash. \"Kentucky survived the ravies plague in 2022 when nobody knew what was happening. They\u0027ll survive this. People are more prepared for this sort of crisis now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine looked at mile markers on the truck top. \"Someone told me once that the Kurians were handling both sides of this war, and if they ever became really worried about us, they\u0027d just wipe us out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Mark sighed. \"Of all people, Valentine, I\u0027m surprised you would consider such nonsense. Why would they want the Freeholds? We run guns into the Kurian Zones, broadcast news, and give people a safe place to run to, if they get away. They can\u0027t want that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Valentine said. \"Having a war going on can be handy. You can blame shortages on it, deaths, tell folks that the reason the days of milk and honey are a long way off is because there\u0027s a war to be won first. And its a convenient place to send ambitious, restive men who might otherwise challenge Kur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Mark locked his knuckles against each other. \"I don\u0027t think so. Unless they are keeping it even from the Church. I rose fairly high before my soul fought back against my interest, and many times I handled communications for my Archon. I saw nothing to indicate that was true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they wouldn\u0027t trust such an important detail to written communications.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are five-year plenaries attended by a majority of Archons from around the world. None but the Archons attend. They depart with masses of facts and figures-not that the thick binders of data do them much good; you cannot trust the statistics of a functionary whose life depends on pleasing the boss with the totals in a report. But when the Archons return, there are sometimes a few promotions or a new Church construction project-ordinary activities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t mind dropping in on one of those and changing the agenda,\" Valentine said. He glanced at his map again. Two more miles and he could fill in another circle. \"Where are they held?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The location is held secret until the last minute. Probably because of vigorous, ambitious young men such as yourself with similar ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine always smiled inside at Brother Mark\u0027s description of him as a wet-behind-the-ears kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see. . . . Since I entered the Church it has been held at Paris, Cairo, Bahrain, Rome, and Rio de Janeiro. Not that there aren\u0027t important churchmen from Indonesia or middle Africa or the subcontinent; I believe the Archons simply like to see a few sights and shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey saw their share of sights on the drive, descending from the Mississippi plateau in central Kentucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine would rather not have seen any of them, and it took a while for him to forget them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the wind died down and it turned into a still winter day, they saw smudges on the horizon, barns and houses and whole blocks of towns burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey saw cars and trucks with doors torn off and windshields punched in, blood splattered on the upholstery and panels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe column passed huddled figures along the side of the road, sitting in meager shelter afforded by ruins of houses and ancient, rusted shells of cars and trucks. Many of them had frozen to death, fleeing God-knew-what blind in the night. When the column saw a figure floundering in the snow, waving its arms, they slowed and shouted. If it shouted back in English, they let them climb into the back of the Chuckwagon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf not . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarget practice, Chieftain called it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the ravies, the snow worked against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine tried to turn his mind off, not think about the future. The old Kurian trick might just work again. If that armored column massing outside Owensboro came into Kentucky and plunged into the heartland of the state-and the Kentucky Alliance-bringing order by killing off the diseased and dangerous, the Kur might just be hailed as heroes. At the very least they\u0027d have little difficulty seizing key road junctions, towns, and rail lines. The disease-ravaged A-o-K wouldn\u0027t be in any kind of shape to contest the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis own command would be hounded out of the state, and Southern Command, instead of having a quietly neutral bunch of legworm ranchers, would have a full-fledged enemy with access to some hard-to-stop cavalry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive circles filled in . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ve got a Kentucky contact, sir. Major Valentine, they\u0027re asking for you by name. You know somebody called Ankle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhn-Kha! Even Duvalier bolted awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine put on a pair of earphones and cursed when they wouldn\u0027t adjust fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard his friend\u0027s deep, slightly rubbery tones speaking: \" . . . very short of ammunition. Before I lost contact with friends in the Shenandoah, I was told they had military roadblocks in all the principal passes, and there were reports of aircraft flying in the mountains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you, Old Horse?\" Valentine asked, his throat tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My David, can it be that you are caught up in this too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid so. What\u0027s your status?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It goes . . . hard, my David. There are so few of us left. I sent some of the men away so they could see to their homes and families. I only hope I did not delay too long. We are-Well, best not to say too much over the radio. But a good-bye may be in order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Ahn-Kha, always quick to make light of burdens, to talk like this, it turned everything behind Valentine\u0027s stomach muscles into a solid block of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t draw attention to yourself. They seem to be drawn by light and noise,\" Valentine said. \"You haven\u0027t been bitten, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic came back, or maybe the Golden One was laughing and shaking the mike. \"Oh, yes, many times. Fortunately I seem to be immune. I wish I could say the same for the rest of my brave men. I will not say more. We have made some hard choices, hard decisions, and more hard decisions are coming. As you said, we too are aware that they are drawn to sudden sounds and sharp flashes and-\" His words were lost to static. Habanero adjusted the dial. \"We\u0027ve used blasting explosives to try to draw them up into the mountains, away from our populations. We have, perhaps, been too successful. One might walk across the throng using heads like paving stones. Excuse me, there is some commotion. I must sign off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck,\" Valentine said, wishing for once he had Sime\u0027s tongue for a phrase worthy of his old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine watched Boelnitz, an earpiece for the radio in one ear, writing furiously and transcribing the Grog\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s writing this passage? Pencil Boelnitz or Cooper Llewellyn?\" Valentine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Major. All I can do is try to be accurate about what I\u0027m hearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you\u0027re getting it right, sir. That\u0027s the hulking, hairy-handed killer I know,\" Valentine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoelnitz drew away, pencil trembling. Valentine realized he was snarling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven circles filled in . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were getting closer to the Ohio now. The land became less hilly and was filled with more old farms. Someone sprayed the column with gunfire as they passed. It caused no casualties, but Valentine wondered if the person shot because he or she suspected they were from the Northwest Ordnance, or if they shot because they suspected they were Southern Command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the hills, the drifts grew less and less and finally disappeared entirely. The snow hadn\u0027t been as heavy in this part of Kentucky. Valentine put Rover back at the head of the column, but the ice patches were still treacherous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Major, Doc says we should pull over,\" Habanero said, acknowledging a signal. Valentine had taken his headset off so he could think about Ahn-Kha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" But Valentine could guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants you to look at Rockaway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine didn\u0027t want to stop for anything. \"He\u0027s symptomatic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc just wants to pull over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine signaled for a stop. Everyone took the opportunity to get out and hit the honeybuckets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine went to the Boneyard. The nurse silently opened the rear hatch. A red-eyed Mrs. O\u0027Coombe nodded to him, her Bible stuck in her lap, a finger marking her place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Doc?\" Valentine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"He\u0027s symptomatic. Starting to shake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have him sedated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" the nurse said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the usual medical procedure for ravies?\" Valentine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc sighed. \"Ninety percent of the time, they\u0027re quietly eutha nized. Some are kept around to try various kinds of experimental medications. They don\u0027t feel pain, from what we can tell by brain-wave function and glandular response. Oh, and early cases are important for study to develop a vaccine. That\u0027s where the booster shots come from. Too bad he missed this last series, issue date October. We should have thought to bring some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to end this, Mister Valentine,\" Mrs. O\u0027Coombe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"End this?\" Valentine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t watch him suffer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not suffering, is he, Doc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc agreed, \"Not while the sedatives hold out. Even when they wear off, provided we can keep him in the bed, I\u0027m not sure suffering is the right word for what he\u0027ll be going through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine wondered how much of the patriotic, Bible-reading charity act of Mrs. O\u0027Coombe was real. With Keve Rockaway/ O\u0027Coombe dead, she\u0027d own the vast ranch her husband had built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any decision about your son\u0027s health I\u0027ll leave to the Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc said, \"I work for her ladyship, I\u0027ll remind you, Valentine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A rich woman outranks the Hippocratic oath?\" Valentine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Major,\" Doc said. \"Please. I\u0027m in no hurry. I\u0027m just wondering if I\u0027ll still have a job if I ever make it back to the Hooked O-C.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what you can, Doc,\" Valentine said. \"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more thing, Major,\" Doc said. He took out a little powder blue case. \"In my younger days, before I settled down to bring babies into the world and plaster broken bones and dig bullets out, I was a researcher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a perfectly ordinary piece of medical technology from fifty years back. Nowadays I use it for interesting butterfly pupae and leaves. It instantly freezes and preserves, like liquid nitrogen without all the fuss and bother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been taking samples of Keve\u0027s blood as the disease progressed to see how his body\u0027s fighting it, and to see just how the ravies virus is attacking and changing him. It could be useful to Southern Command in developing a serum for a vaccination.\" He handed the case to Valentine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get it back across the Mississippi as soon as I can,\" Valentine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. O\u0027Coombe caressed her son\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep an eye on her, Doc,\" Valentine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understood.\" Doc lowered his voice. \"In all honesty, Major, she does love her son. She loved all her sons. Deep down, I think she was really trying to get him back home, but make it his idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine stepped out of Boneyard. \"Hey, Major,\" he heard one of the Wolves call. \"There\u0027s a plane flying around north of here a few miles. Two-engine job. Looks kind of like it\u0027s circling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine wondered if the plane was part of Jack in the Box\u0027s operation. How did he fit in with the divine judgment of war, famine, disease, and death to Kentucky?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich reminded him. He called Frat over. \"Frat, how are you on a motorcycle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Decent, sir. I used one to get around in Kansas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to courier something important back to Fort Seng for us. And, if necessary, get it all the way back to the Mississippi-but that\u0027ll be for Colonel Lambert to decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to leave you in the middle of this mess,\" Frat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll do as I ask, Lieutenant. If you want to be addressed as captain in a week, that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain!\" Frat grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A platoon of Wolves this far outside Southern Command is supposed to have a captain in charge. I hope you\u0027ll be it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as easy as it sounds. But we should get a sample back to Southern Command as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey gave Stuck\u0027s big motorcycle to Frat. Frat grabbed his rifle and his bag and very carefully put Doc\u0027s sample freezer in a hard case. Doc added a final blood sample and a note before packing it on the bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine shook Frat\u0027s hand, and the young man tied a scarf around his face. \"I\u0027ll get it through, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine wondered just where that Ordnance armored column was. Their own vehicles would be simple target practice for a real-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frat, even if we don\u0027t get through, these blood samples need to. They\u0027re more important to Southern Command than everything in this convoy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understood, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the youth rumble off, trying not to think of his own misadventures as a courier. Maybe somewhere on the road Frat would meet another capable young teen, the way Valentine had long ago met Frat. Part of being in service was helping train talented young people to take your place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Frat had left, the plane had taken off too, flying back to the north-probably across the Ohio in just a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine tried to raise Fort Seng to inform Lambert that Frat was on the way, but he couldn\u0027t make contact. With one more thing to worry about, Valentine returned to Rover and put the convoy in motion again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See if you can find a road turning north,\" he told Habanero. \"I\u0027d like to see what that plane is up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like a flea market that broke up quick,\" Duvalier said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine wouldn\u0027t forget the sight of the body field as long as he lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as an old man he\u0027d remember details, be able to traverse the gentle slopes dotted with briar thickets, stepping from body to body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou had to choose route and footing if you didn\u0027t want to step on some child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudging from the injuries and old bloodstains on the bodies, these were ravies victims. Some had torn or missing clothes, and all had the haggard, thin-skinned look of someone in the grip of the raving madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What killed them, Doc?\" Valentine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My guess is some kind of nerve agent. That accounts for some of the grotesque posing. Whatever it was, it happened quickly.\" He knelt to look at a body. \"Notice anything funny about these?\" Doc asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing funny in this field,\" Duvalier said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange, then. Look at the ravies,\" Doc said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine had a tough time looking close. This was like peeping into a Nazi gas chamber. Though he felt a bit of a hypocrite; he would have turned the Bushmaster\u0027s cannon on them if they\u0027d been attacking his vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t-\" Duvalier said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hair,\" Doc said. \"Ears, chins, eyebrows, arm hair. Worse on the men than the women, but everyone but the kids are showing very rapid body hair growth. A side effect of this strain of ravies, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine let the doctor keep chattering. Valentine wondered where the pilot of the little twin-engined plane was now. Enjoying a cup of coffee at an airstrip, while his plane is being refueled?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think they really knew what was happening,\" Doc said. \"Ravies does cloud the mind a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves found something interesting, sir,\" Chieftain reported, looking at a deerskin-clad arm waving them over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vehicle tracks were easy to find and, sadly, easier to follow. They stood at the center of the field, in an empty space like a little doughnut hole surrounded by bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, they drove in, or the ravies found them here,\" Doc said. \"Then when the ravies were good and tight around the vehicle, those inside slaughtered them all in a matter of minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one was still twitching,\" Valentine said, looking at a victim who\u0027d left gouges in the turf. \"I think he tried to crawl toward the truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChieftain said, \"Maybe it was a field bakery van or a chuck wagon. Food, you think? Baskets of fresh bread hanging off it? They look hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ravies does that,\" Doc said. \"You get ravenous. It\u0027s a hard virus on the system. The body\u0027s usual defense mechanisms-fatigue, nausea-that discourage activity during hunger are overridden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine wondered what could attract such throngs of ravies, yet keep them from tearing whatever made those tracks to bits. His own column would probably have need of such a gimmick before they returned to Fort Seng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine circles filled in . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was the sun in their eyes as they drove west. Maybe it was error caused by driver fatigue. Maybe it was the speed. Valentine was anxious to move fast-there was less snow on the ground, and they had a chance to be back at Fort Seng that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dipped as they passed under a railroad bridge, much overgrown, and suddenly there were ravies on either side of them and the headlights of a big armored car before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t an equal contest. Rover folded against the old Brinks truck like a cardboard box hitting a steamroller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the stars began to fade from Valentine\u0027s eyes, he heard angelic strings playing. For a moment, he couldn\u0027t decide if he was hallucinating or ascending to a very unoriginal, badly lit, bare-bones heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine looked out the spiderwebbed window and saw tattered ravies all around, cocking their heads, milling, either working themselves up to an attack or calming down after one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw the big armored car, and it all came back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music was coming from the armored car. Chopin or someone like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine prodded Habanero, but it would take more than a friendly tap to revive him. He was impaled on the steering column like a butterfly on a pin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuvalier opened her door and fell out, still gripping her sword cane. Brother Mark seemed to be unconscious, blood masking his face, with a similar stain on the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine heard an engine roar, and the armored car backed up. He waited for it to rev up, roar forward, and crush what was left of Rover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his rifle out of its clip and climbed out. The least damaged of any of them, Boelnitz or whatever he called himself crawled forward and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoneyard came forward to their rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music suddenly died. A new tune struck up, a harsh number welcoming them to a jungle with plenty of fun and games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ravies didn\u0027t like the sound of the music. They began to spread away from the armored car in consternation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoneyard\u0027s driver came out of his cab. He slammed the door as he climbed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ravies heads turned, looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" Valentine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoneyard\u0027s driver put his gun to his shoulder and fired at the speaker atop the armored car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich showed initiative but not very good judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of teenage ravies came running, as though the spitting assault rifle was an ice cream truck\u0027s musical bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushmaster bumped off road and gave them covering fire, Silvertip at the turret ring with the 20mm cannon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike sand running out of an hourglass, more and more ravies sprang into violent motion, running toward the vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing to do about it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine went around behind Rover, set his rifle on the rear bumper, and began to fire into the ravies. Machine guns and cannon tore into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegular troops would have scattered or taken cover on the ground. Not these men, women, and children. Most of them went for the Bushmaster: It was the biggest and-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chuckwagon,\" Duvalier shouted in Valentine\u0027s ear, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mass of ravies hit Bushmaster like an incoming tsunami. They tipped it, perhaps by accident, in their fury to get at the noisy guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine pulled Brother Mark out of Rover and threw him over his shoulder in a fireman\u0027s carry. A ravie with a mustache gone mad sprang around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uungh!\" Duvalier grunted as she opened the ravie from rib to hip point with her sword. She spun and took a child\u0027s head off behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckwagon pulled up next to Boneyard, forming a V by having the front bumpers just meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave them, leave them!\" Mrs. O\u0027Coombe shouted to the Boneyard\u0027s driver. \"Get me out of here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilvertip extracted himself from Bushmaster\u0027s cupola. But he\u0027d left an arm behind, crushed against the autocannon. He tottered a few steps toward the tattered crowd beating at the driver\u0027s front window, studded leather fist raised, and toppled face forward into the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine set down Brother Mark between the two big trucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought down three approaching ravies, clicked on empty, and changed magazines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was still fighting around Bushmaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLongshot climbed out one of the side doors, now a top hatch on the prostrate APC. Her bike was strapped there. All she had to do was untie it and right it. Valentine watched, astonished, as she gunned the engine, laid a streak of rubber with the back tire as the front stayed braked. She released and shot along the armored side of the Bushmaster, flew off its front, and knocked a ravie down as she landed. Sending up a rooster tail of snow, she tore off east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That coward,\" Mrs. O\u0027Coombe sputtered. \"There were wounded in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure tottered out from around the back of Bushmaster, looking like a doomed beetle covered by biting army ants. Bee staggered under the weight of a dozen men, women, and children. She shrugged one off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Valentine had left for the Type Three was Quickwood bullets. He loaded and used them, sighting carefully and picking two off of Bee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBee writhed, throwing off a few, breaking another with a punch, crushing a head, removing an arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were too many, clawing and biting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBee dropped under the weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine saw her agonized face through the mass of legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine lined up his Type Three, ready to put a bullet in her head. Bee opened her mouth-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo bite an ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine only hoped he could end with such courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the bayonet, mes enfants. It\u0027s nothing but shot, Valentine thought, quoting one of the heroes of the Legion he\u0027d read of thanks to the headquarters library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine had never used a rifle bayonet for anything but opening cans since training. But he extended the one on the Type Three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine charged, yelling, his vision going red in fury and despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ravies bared their teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine threw himself into them, lunging and wrenching and clubbing. A hand like a steel claw grabbed his arm, and he responded by giving way to the pull, throwing himself into the opponent. He clubbed the butt of his gun into the ravie\u0027s face again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother lunge and he lifted a young man off Bee like a kebab on his bayonet skewer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noticed Duvalier next to him, slashing like mad, killing anything that approached her like a bug zapper firing cold steel bolts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got Bee\u0027s arm around his shoulder and dragged her up. She managed to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA storm of gunfire cut down the ravies in his way back to the V between Boneyard and Chuckwagon. Stuck stood atop the Bushmaster, firing his assault shotgun. Chieftain stood at his back, removing fingers and hands from ravies trying to climb atop the wreck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine realized he was bleeding but he felt no pain, fighting madness coursing through his nervous system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled into the Boneyard, almost carrying Bee, rifle dangling by its sling and .45 pistol in his hand now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Graawg,\" Bee said, tears in her good eye, the other socket a gory pulp, pointing to bloody divots in her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc, you got a shot or something you can give her?\" Valentine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll fix her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine waved Stuck over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, wounded inside!\" he shouted, gesturing at the Bushmaster beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emptied the shotgun into the remaining ravies all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePkew!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red blossom appeared in Stuck\u0027s shoulder, and he toppled off the APC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine looked back at the musical armored car. A rifle barrel projected from a rivet-trimmed slot in the front passenger-side window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see the grinning faces of the driver and gunner behind their armored glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chieftain, take out those fuckers!\" Valentine shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bear nodded and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuck, despite the rifle wound, was still swinging. He had a knife in each hand and used them like meathooks, plunging the blades in and pulling his opponents off their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a piece of me? There\u0027s plenty left, you assholes! Reapers and Grogs left enough for yas!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuck led the remaining ravies down the road, shouting and gesticulating even as his steps grew more and more erratic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Stuck attracted ravie attention, Chieftain was dragging something away from the Bushmaster. Valentine realized it was the 20mm cannon. The big Bear, hair bristling up like a cockatiel\u0027s, righted it, braced it with his legs, and pointed it at the armored car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine looked at the armored car. The faces in the cabin weren\u0027t smiling anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrack! Krack! Krack! Krack! Krack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thick glass of the armored car had five holes with little auras of cracks all around, and blood splattered about on the inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still the music played on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine-covered in quick-and-dirty bandages and iodine, injected with Mrs. O\u0027Coombe\u0027s expensive Boneyard antibiotics, and feeling like he\u0027d been taken apart and put together by a drunk tinker-investigated the musical armored car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back door was unlocked. After the cannon fire had killed the men in the cab, whoever was back there ran off into the growing dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a lot of dials and switches and electronic equipment, a screen and a controller for a camera at the back, and a blinking little box that one of the Wolves told him held all the music the system played in digital form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the music was soothing light classical, according to the computer-literate Wolf. \"I guess they were attracting those Woolies by playing calming music,\" the Wolf said, giving this strain of ravies a name that was soon in wide use both officially and unofficially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must soothe them,\" Doc said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And attract them at the same time. Must have been what they used to gather them . . . so the plane could spray them. That\u0027s how they killed them off,\" Valentine said, words finally catching up to his guesswork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fiddled until they had music playing and put some gentle Mozart up. A few ravies, wandering back from their final encounter with Stuck, shuffled up to the truck to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine gave orders that they weren\u0027t to be harmed. More important, they weren\u0027t to be disturbed by any aggravating noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were prevented from engaging in further speculation by the arrival of a company from the Fort Seng battalion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were on bikes, Captain Nilay Patel wobbling unevenly at their head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cavalry\u0027s a little late to the rescue,\" Valentine said with an effort. He had at least three bloody ravies bites, bound up in stinging iodine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cavalry is having a hard time biking on melting ice,\" Patel said. \"It\u0027s Colonel Lambert\u0027s idea, sir. We were leading a party of civilians out of Owensboro with the full battalion in field gear. There\u0027s a whole Northwest Ordnance column of trucks and motorcycle infantry and light armor getting set to cross the bridge where you got that Kurian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you were heading toward them or away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to keep as quiet as possible as we got away, obviously, sir. That fury on a motorcycle came roaring up and said you\u0027d had some difficulty. Colonel Lambert sent me back for you and Captain Ediyak ahead with the dependents, and then organized the rest into a Mike Force to support either if we ran into trouble. She\u0027s a better than fair tactician, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get the bicycles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We found them in a warehouse in Owensboro. Ownership seemed to be a matter of some dispute, as they were meant for transport to a purchaser in the Ordnance, but said trader was in no mood to fulfill his end with ravies in town. Colonel Lambert made him a generous purchase offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" Valentine asked, but he suspected he knew Lambert\u0027s bid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could ride along with the rest of the civilians, provided the bikes came as well.\" Patel looked at the stuporous ravies gathered around the musical truck. \"What are we going to do with this lot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give them back to the people who created them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An excellent idea, sir, but just how do we do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to need some noise, Patel. A whole lot of noise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure that can be arranged. Music or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have three vocalists in mind,\" Valentine said. \"My radio\u0027s wrecked. Can you put me in touch with Fort Seng?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey cleaned out the armored car\u0027s cab and brought the engine to life. Valentine put Ma at the wheel, as she understood both the armored car\u0027s controls and the volume and direction controls on the loudspeakers. Valentine had them turn down the road toward Owensboro. According to Patel, the city had been hard hit by ravies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBee with her Grog gun, the techie Wolf, Boelnitz for the sake of his story, and Chieftain just in case rode in back. Valentine road shotgun, squeezed onto the seat with Duvalier, who was clinging to him like a limpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried about those bites,\" she said. \"First sign of trembling, you go into handcuffs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine wondered if the bites were taking their toll. He was so very tired. But he had to see this through before he succumbed to either exhaustion or the disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed through the beltline of the city and drove among the Woolies like wary naturalists intruding on a family of gorillas. They thronged thicker and thicker around the armored car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuspicious, bloodshot eyes glared at them. Nostrils flared as the Woolies took in their scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little more soothing music,\" Valentine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa fiddled with her thumb, rolling it back and forth across the ancient, electrical-taped device. Harsh, synthesized music blared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Woolies startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music hushed, stopped. A big Woolie, his mouth ringed by a brown smear of dried blood like a child\u0027s misadventure with lipstick, lurched toward the speaker, head cocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa said something under her breath-Valentine had no attention to spare for anyone but the big Woolie-and a soothing cello backed by violins started up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speakers ratcheted up, filling the main street with noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore Woolies emerged from alleys and doorways, some dragging dead dogs or more gruesome bits of fodder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They like that,\" Duvalier said, peering out a firing slot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like the Pied Piper,\" Valentine said. \"Now to teach Hamelin a lesson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon his followers filled two lanes and the verge to either side of the highway leading out of Owensboro and to the east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found a slight hill from which they could see the bridge and watch the fireworks. Valentine signaled Ma to stop the soothing music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine\u0027s trio of iron throats opened up. Guinevere, Igraine, and Morganna began to sing, and their notes fell upon the highway in brilliant flash and thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ravies ran toward the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There go the Woolies!\" one of the artillery observers reported over the radio. The Wolf\u0027s moniker had spread quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forces of the Northwest Ordnance had removed their barricades and some of the fencing to allow the invasion force to rumble across the bridge, its formation undisturbed. The Woolies found no resistance to their rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic struck the soldiers of Ohio\u0027s elite force. Immunization or no, an inoculation wasn\u0027t proof against one\u0027s injection arm being yanked out of its socket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine, having seen the destruction visited on Kentucky, rejoiced at like medicine being distributed among the \"relief\" forces parked in a long file along the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the drone of an engine. A plane hove into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bee!\" Valentine said. He formed his hands into wings and had them crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBee grinned from among her bandages, licked a bullet, and slid it into her big Grog gun. She put the gun to her shoulder and raised the barrel to the sky, as though it were a flag. The barrel began to descend as smoothly as a fine watch hand, lining up with the approaching plane, which had turned to pass directly over the bridge so that its flight path matched the north-south span.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a two-engine plane. She\u0027d have to be quick to take out both as it passed over the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane dove, seeming to head straight for them. It hadn\u0027t started sprinkling its nerve agent yet, not wanting to lay it on their own forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBee brought the gun barrel down, down, down, humming to herself. She fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane didn\u0027t so much as wobble. It continued its pass, remorseless. Valentine waited for the fine spray of nerve agent that would lock up heart and limb-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane shot over their heads, wingtips still, level as a board, engines roaring and flaps down, following a perfect five-degree decline to hit and skip and cartwheel into the woods of Kentucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine heard firing from the other side of the bridge. A gasoline explosion lit up the low winter clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine tried to tell himself that he was killing two birds with one stone, not slaughtering civilians to confuse a military offensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what the editorial in the Clarion would be,\" Boelnitz said. \"Southern Command Uses Bioweapons in Indiana Massacre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine was inclined to agree: both that they\u0027d use the headline and that the headline was true. But you had to give the enemy whatever flavor of hell they gave you. \"Of course, you could add some picturesque color thanks to your firsthand experiences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell with them,\" Boelnitz said. \"You know, the publisher used to tell me, \u0027It\u0027s always more complicated than a headline.\u0027 That\u0027s only so much bovine scat one can tolerate. Our headline here is pretty easy. \u0027Victory.\u0027 They should have offered, instead of threatened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope we can remember that,\" Valentine said. \"You know, Llwellyn or Boelnitz or whatever you want to call yourself, Kentucky could use a newspaper. It\u0027s one of the building blocks of a civilization. What do you say? Want to bring the first amendment back to Kentucky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoelnitz smiled. \"I have a feeling that as long as you\u0027re here, there\u0027ll be no end of stories.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/winter-duty-vampire-earth-8/page-13.html","bookId":2589,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:23 PM"}
