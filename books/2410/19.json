Something very close, probably one letter off: With fumbling fingers, Sanders pushed L-E-L. The screen stayed blank: he had no number stored for that combination. L-E-M. No number stored. L-E-S. No number stored. L-E-V.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBingo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrinted across the little screen was:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLEVIN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a phone number for John Levin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders had called John Levin\u0027s answering machine that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Levin called. He said it was important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll bet he did, Sanders thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered now, with sudden clarity, the exact sequence of events in Meredith\u0027s office. He had been talking on the phone and she said, \"Forget that phone,\" and pushed his hand down as she started kissing him. He had dropped the phone on the windowsill as they kissed, and left it there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater on, when he left Meredith\u0027s office, buttoning his shirt, he had picked up the cellular phone from the sill, but by then it was dead. Which could only mean that it had remained constantly on for almost an hour. It had remained on during the entire incident with Meredith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the car, when Adele finished the call, .she hung the phone back in the cradle, She didn\u0027t press the END button, so the phone line stayed open, and their entire conversation was recorded on the persona answering machine. Fifteen minutes of jokes and personal commentary, all recorded on his answering machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Sanders\u0027s phone had been dead because the line stayed open. The whole conversation had been recorded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in the parking lot, he quickly dialed John Levin\u0027s number. Fernandez got out of the car and came over to him. \"What\u0027s going on?\" Fernandez said. \"Are we going to lunch, or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Just a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call went through. A click of the pickup, then a man\u0027s voice: `John Levin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`John, it\u0027s Tom Sanders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hey there, Tom boy!\" Levin burst out laughing. \"My man! Are you having a red-hot sex life these days, or what? I tell you, Tom, my ears were burning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders said, \"Was it recorded?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Jesus Christ, Tom, you better believe it. I came in Tuesday morning to check my messages, and I tell you, it went on for half an hour, I mean-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever said married life was dull-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John. Listen. Did you keep it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. Levin stopped laughing. \"Tom, what do you think I am, a pervert? Of course I kept it. I played it for the whole office. They loved it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John. Seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevin sighed. \"Yeah. I kept it. It sounded like you might be having a little trouble, and . . . I don\u0027t know. Anyway, I kept it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Where is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here on my desk,\" Levin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John, I want that tape. Now listen to me: this is what I want you to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving in the car, Fernandez said, \"I\u0027m waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders said, \"There\u0027s a tape of the whole meeting with Meredith. It was all recorded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" \"It was an accident. I was talking to an answering machine,\" he said, \"and when Meredith started kissing me, I put the phone down but didn\u0027t end the call. So the phone stayed connected to the answering machine. And everything we said went right onto the answering machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot damn,\" Alan said, slapping the steering wheel as he drove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is an audio tape?\" Fernandez said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" \"Good quality?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. We\u0027ll see. John\u0027s bringing it to lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFernandez rubbed her hands together. \"I feel better already.\" \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"Because if it\u0027s any good at all, we can really draw blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Levin, florid and jovial, pushed away his plate and drained the last of his beer. \"Now that\u0027s what I call a meal. Excellent halibut.\" Levin weighed nearly three hundred pounds, and his belly pressed up against the edge of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were sitting in a booth in the back room of McCormick and Schmick\u0027s on First Avenue. The restaurant was noisy, filled with the lunchtime business crowd. Fernandez pressed the headphones to her ears as she listened to the tape on a Walkman. She had been listening intently for more than half an hour, making notes on a yellow legal pad, her food still uneaten. Finally she got up. \"I have to make a call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevin glanced at Fernandez\u0027s plate. \"Uh . . . do you want that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFernandez shook her head, and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevin grinned. \"Waste not, want not,\" he said, and pulled the plate in front of him. He began to eat. \"So Tom, are you in shit or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deep shit,\" Sanders said. He stirred a cappuccino. He hadn\u0027t been able to eat lunch. He watched Levin wolf down great bites of mashed potatoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured that,\" Levin said. \"Jack Kerry over at Aldus called me this morning and said you were suing the company because you refused to jump some woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kerry is an asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The worst,\" Levin nodded. \"The absolute worst. But what can you do? After Connie Walsh\u0027s column this morning, everybody\u0027s been trying to figure out who Mr. Piggy is.\" Levin took another huge bite of food. \"But how\u0027d she get the story in the first place? I mean, she\u0027s the one who broke it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders said, \"Maybe you told her, John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\" Levin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had the tape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevin frowned. \"You keep this up, Tom, you\u0027re going to piss me off\" He shook his head. \"No, you ask me, it was a woman who told her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What woman knew? Only Meredith, and she wouldn\u0027t tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet you anything it\u0027ll turn out to be a woman,\" Levin said. \"If you ever find out-which I doubt.\" He chewed thoughtfully. \"Swordfish is a little rubbery. I think we should tell the waiter.\" He looked around the room. \"Uh, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a guy standing over there, hopping from one foot to the other. I think maybe you know him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders looked over his shoulder. Bob Garvin was standing by the bar, looking at him expectantly. Phil Blackburn stood a few paces behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" Sanders said, and he got up from the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin shook hands with Sanders. \"Tom. Good to see you. How are you holding up with all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay,\" Sanders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, good.\" Garvin placed his hand in a fatherly way on Sanders\u0027s shoulder. \"It\u0027s nice to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to see you too, Bob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin said, \"There\u0027s a quiet place in the corner over there. I asked them for a couple of cappuccinos. We can talk for a minute. Is that okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine,\" Sanders said. He was well acquainted with the profane, angry Garvin. This cautious, polite Garvin made him uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in the corner of the bar. Garvin settled into his chair and faced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Tom. We go way back, you and I\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those damn trips to Seoul, eating that crappy food, and your ass hurting like hell. You remember all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, those were the days,\" Garvin said. He was watching Sanders carefully. \"Anyway, Tom, we know each other, so I\u0027m not going to bullshit you. Let me just put all the cards on the table,\" Garvin said. \"We\u0027ve got a problem here, and it\u0027s got to be solved before it turns into a real mess for everybody. I want to appeal to your better judgment about how we proceed from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My better judgment?\" Sanders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Garvin said. \"I\u0027d like to look at this thing from all sides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many sides are there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are at least two,\" Garvin said, with a smile. \"Look, Tom. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s no secret that I\u0027ve supported Meredith inside our company. I\u0027ve always believed that she\u0027s got talent and the kind of executive vision that we want for the future. I\u0027ve never seen her do anything before that would suggest otherwise. I know she\u0027s only human, but she\u0027s very talented and I support her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now perhaps in this case . . . perhaps it is true that she\u0027s made a mistake. I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders said nothing. He just waited, staring at Garvin\u0027s face. Garvin was doing a convincing impression of an open-minded man. Sanders didn\u0027t buy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact, let\u0027s say she has,\" Garvin said. \"Let\u0027s say she did make a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did, Bob,\" Sanders said, firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Let\u0027s say she did. An error of judgment, let\u0027s call it. An overstepping of bounds. The point is, Tom, faced with a situation like this, I still strongly support her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she\u0027s a woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that have to do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, women in business have traditionally been excluded from executive positions, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith hasn\u0027t been excluded,\" Sanders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after all,\" Garvin said, \"she\u0027s young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not that young,\" Sanders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure she is. She\u0027s practically a college kid. She just got her MBA a couple of years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bob,\" Sanders said. \"Meredith Johnson\u0027s thirty-five. She\u0027s not a kid at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin did not seem to hear that. He looked at Sanders sympathetically. \"Tom, I can understand that you were disappointed about the job,\" he said. \"And I can understand that in your eyes, Meredith made a mistake in the way she approached you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t approach me, Bob. She jumped me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin showed a flash of irritation. \"You\u0027re no kid either, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, I\u0027m not,\" Sanders said. \"But I am her employee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I know she holds you in the highest regard,\" Garvin said, settling back in his chair. \"As does everybody in the company, Tom. You\u0027re vital to our future. You know it, I know it. I want to keep our team together. And I keep coming back to the idea that we have to make allowances for women. We have to cut them a little slack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re not talking about women,\" Sanders said. \"We\u0027re talking about one particular woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Torn-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if a man had done what she did, you wouldn\u0027t be talking about cutting him slack. You\u0027d fire him, and throw him out on his ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s the problem,\" Sanders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin said, \"I\u0027m not sure I follow you there, Tom.\" His tone carried a warning: Garvin didn\u0027t like being disagreed with. Over the years, as his company grew in wealth and success, Garvin had grown accustomed to deference. Now, approaching retirement, he expected obedience and agreement. \"We have an obligation to attain equality,\" Garvin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. But equality means no special breaks,\" Sanders said. \"Equality means treating people the same. You\u0027re asking for inequality toward Meredith, because you won\u0027t do what you would do to a man-fire him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin sighed. \"If it was a clear case, Tom, I would. But I understand this particular situation isn\u0027t so clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders considered telling him about the tape. Something made him hold back. He said, \"I think it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there are always differences of opinion on these matters,\" Garvin said, leaning across the bar. \"That\u0027s a fact, isn\u0027t it? Always a difference of opinion. Tom. Look: what did she do that was so bad? I mean, really. She made a pass? Fine. You could have decided it was flattering. She\u0027s a beautiful woman, after all. There are worse things that could happen. A beautiful woman puts her hand on your knee. Or you could have just said, no thank you. You could have handled it any number of ways. You\u0027re a grown-up. But this . . . vindictiveness. Tom. I have to tell you. I\u0027m surprised at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders said, \"Bob, she broke the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That really remains to be seen, doesn\u0027t it?\" Garvin said. \"You can throw open your personal life for a jury to inspect, if that\u0027s what you want to do. I wouldn\u0027t want to do it, myself. And I don\u0027t see that it helps anybody to take this into court. It\u0027s a no-win situation, all around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to go to court, Tom.\" Garvin\u0027s eyes were narrow, dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just don\u0027t.\" Garvin took a deep breath. \"Look. Let\u0027s stay on track here. I\u0027ve talked to Meredith. She feels as I do, that this thing has gotten out of hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m talking to you now, too. Because my hope, Tom, is that we can put this to rest, and go back to the way things were now hear me out, please go back to the way things were, before this unfortunate misunderstanding happened. You stay at your job, Meredith stays at hers. You two continue to work together like civilized adults. You move forward and build the company, take it public, and everybody makes a pile of money a year down the line. What\u0027s wrong with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders felt something like relief, and a sense of normalcy returning. He longed to escape from the lawyers and from the tension of the last three days. To sink back into the way things were seemed as appealing as a warm bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, look at it this way, Tom. Right after this thing happened on Monday night, nobody blew the whistle. You didn\u0027t call anybody. Meredith didn\u0027t call anybody. I think you both wanted this thing to go away. Then there was an unfortunate mix-up the next day, and an argument that needn\u0027t have happened. If you\u0027d been on time for the meeting, if you and Meredith had been in sync on the story, none of this would have happened. You two would still be working together, and whatever happened between you would remain your private business. Instead, we have this. It\u0027s all a big mistake, really. So why not just forget it and go forward? And get rich. Tom? What\u0027s wrong with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Sanders said, finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except it won\u0027t work,\" Sanders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen answers flashed through his mind: Because she\u0027s not competent. Because she\u0027s a snake. Because she\u0027s a corporate player, all image, and this is a technical division that has to get out the product. Because she\u0027s a liar. Because I have no respect for her. Because she\u0027ll do it again. Because she has no respect for me. Because you\u0027re not treating me fairly. Because she\u0027s your pet. Because you chose her over me. Because . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things have gone too far,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin stared at him. \"Things can go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Bob. They can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin leaned forward. His voice dropped. \"Listen you little feringi pissant. I know exactly what\u0027s going on here. I took you in when you didn\u0027t know bulkogi from bullshit. I gave you your start, I gave you help, I gave you opportunities, all along the line. Now you want to play rough? Fine. You want to see the shit come down? Just fucking wait, Tom.\" He stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders said, \"Bob, you\u0027ve never been willing to listen to reason on the subject of Meredith Johnson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you think 1 have a problem with Meredith?\" Garvin laughed harshly. \"Listen, Tom: she was your girlfriend, but she was smart and independent, and you couldn\u0027t handle her. You were pissed when she dropped you. And now, all these years later, you\u0027re going to pay her back. That\u0027s what this is about. It has nothing to do with business ethics or breaking the law or sexual harassment or any other damned thing. It\u0027s personal, and it\u0027s petty. And you\u0027re so full of shit your eyes are brown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he stalked out of the restaurant, pushing angrily past Blackburn. Blackburn remained behind for a moment, staring at Sanders, and then hurried after his boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Sanders walked back to his table, he passed a booth with several guys from Microsoft, including two major assholes from systems programming. Someone made a snorting pig sound. \"Hey Mr. Piggy,\" said a low voice. \"Suwee! Suwee!\" \"Couldn\u0027t get it up, huh?\" Sanders walked on a few paces, then turned back. \"Hey, guys,\" he said. \"At least I\u0027m not bending over and grabbing my ankles in latenight meetings with-\" and he named a Programming head at Microsoft. They all roared with laughter. \"Whoa ho!\" \"Mr. Piggy speaks!\" \"Oink oink.\" Sanders said, \"What\u0027re you guys doing in town, anyway? They run short on K-Y jelly in Redmond?\" \"Whoa!\" \"The Piggy is pissed!\" They were doubled over, laughing like college kids. They had a big pitcher of beer on the table. One of them said, \"If Meredith Johnson pulled off her pants for me, I sure wouldn\u0027t call the police about it.\" \"No way, Jose!\" \"Service with a smile!\" \"Hard charger!\" \"Ladies first!\" \"Ka-jung! Ka-jung!\" They pounded the table, laughing. Sanders walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the restaurant, Garvin paced back and forth angrily on the pavement. Blackburn stood with the phone at his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is that fucking car?\" Garvin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Bob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Bob. I\u0027m trying to get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ Almighty, the simplest things. Can\u0027t even get the fucking cars to work right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he had to go to the bathroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? How long does that take? Goddamn Sanders. Could you believe him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I couldn\u0027t, Bob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t understand. He won\u0027t deal with me on this. And I\u0027m bending over backward here. I offer him his job back, I offer him his stock back, I offer him everything. And what does he do? Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not a team player, Bob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got that right. And he\u0027s not willing to meet us. We\u0027ve got to get him to come to the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes we do, Bob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not feeling it,\" Garvin said. \"That\u0027s the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The story ran this morning. It can\u0027t have made him happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027s not feeling it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin paced again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s the car,\" Blackburn said, pointing down the street. The Lincoln sedan was driving toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally,\" Garvin said. \"Now look, Phil. I\u0027m tired of wasting time on Sanders. We tried being nice, and it didn\u0027t work. That\u0027s the long and the short of it. So what are we going to do, to make him feel it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been thinking about that,\" Phil said. \"What\u0027s Sanders doing? I mean really doing? He\u0027s smearing Meredith, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t hesitate to smear her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sure as hell didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s not true, what he\u0027s saying about her. But the thing about a smear is that it doesn\u0027t have to be true. It just has to be something people are willing to believe is true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So maybe Sanders needs to see what that feels like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what feels like? What\u0027re you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackburn stared thoughtfully at the approaching car. \"I think that Tom\u0027s a violent man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh hell,\" Garvin said, \"he\u0027s not. I\u0027ve known him for years. He\u0027s a pussycat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Blackburn said, rubbing his nose. \"I disagree. I think he\u0027s violent. He was a football player in college, he\u0027s a rough-and-tumble sort of guy. Plays football on the company team, knocks people around. He has a violent streak. Most men do, after all. Men are violent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of shit is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you have to admit, he was violent to Meredith,\" Blackburn continued. \"Shouting. Yelling. Pushing her. Knocking her over. Sex and violence. A man out of control. He\u0027s much bigger than she is. Just stand them side by side, anybody can see the difference. He\u0027s much bigger. Much stronger. All you have to do is look, and you see he is a violent abusive man. That nice exterior is just a cover. Sanders is one of those men who take out their hostility by beating up defenseless women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin was silent. He squinted at Blackburn. \"You\u0027ll never make this fly._\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody in their right mind\u0027ll buy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackburn said, \"I think somebody will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody,\" Blackburn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car pulled up to the curb. Garvin opened the door. \"Well, all I know,\" he said, \"is that we need to get him to negotiate. We need to apply pressure to bring him to the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackburn said, \"I think that can be arranged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarvin nodded. \"It\u0027s in your hands, Phil. Just make sure it happens.\" He got in the car. Blackburn got in the car after Garvin. Garvin said to the driver, \"Where the fuck have you been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed shut. The car drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders drove with Fernandez in Alan\u0027s car back to the mediation center. Fernandez listened to Sanders\u0027s report of the conversation with Garvin, shaking her head. \"You never should have seen him alone. He couldn\u0027t have behaved that way if I was there. Did he really say you have to make allowances for women?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s noble of him. He\u0027s found a virtuous reason why we should protect a harasser. It\u0027s a nice touch. Everyone should sit back and allow her to break the law because she\u0027s a woman. Very nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders felt stronger hearing her words. The conversation with Garvin had rattled him. He knew that Fernandez was working on him, building him back up, but it worked anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole conversation is ridiculous,\" Fernandez said. \"And then he threatened you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it. It\u0027s just bluster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" she said. `Just talk. But at least now you know why they say men just don\u0027t get it. Garvin gave you the same lines that every corporate guy has been giving for years: Look at it from the harasser\u0027s point of view. What did they do that was so wrong. Let bygones be bygones. Everybody just go back to work. We\u0027ll be one big happy family again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Incredible,\" Alan said, driving the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is, in this day and age,\" Fernandez said. \"You can\u0027t pull that stuff anymore. How old is Garvin, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost sixty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That helps explain it. But Blackburn should have told him it\u0027s completely unacceptable. According to the law, Garvin really _ doesn\u0027t have any choice. At a minimum, he has to transfer Johnson, not you. And almost certainly, he should fire her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he will,\" Sanders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course he won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s his favorite,\" Sanders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More to the point, she\u0027s his vice president,\" Fernandez said. She stared out the window as they went up the hill toward the mediation center. \"You have to realize, all these decisions are about power. Sexual harassment is about power, and so is the company\u0027s resistance to dealing with it. Power protects power. And once a woman gets up in the power structure, she\u0027ll be protected by the structure, the same as a man. It\u0027s like the way doctors won\u0027t testify against other doctors. It doesn\u0027t matter if the doctor is a man or a woman. Doctors just don\u0027t want to testify against other doctors. Period. And corporate executives don\u0027t want to investigate claims against other executives, male or female.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s just that women haven\u0027t had these jobs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But they\u0027re starting to get them now. And now they can be as unfair as any man ever was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Female chauvinist sows,\" Alan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you start,\" Fernandez said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him the figures,\" Alan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What figures?\" Sanders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About five percent of sexual harassment claims are brought by men against women. It\u0027s a relatively small figure. But then, only five percent of corporate supervisors are women. So the figures suggest that women executives harass men in the same proportion as men harass women. And as more women get corporate jobs, the percentage of claims by men is going up. Because the fact is, harassment is a power issue. And power is neither male nor female. Whoever is behind the desk has the opportunity to abuse power. And women will take advantage as often as men. A case in point being the delightful Ms. Johnson. And her boss isn\u0027t firing her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Garvin says it\u0027s because the situation isn\u0027t clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say that tape is pretty damn clear,\" Fernandez said. She frowned. \"Did you tell him about the tape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-19.html","bookId":2410,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:47 AM"}
