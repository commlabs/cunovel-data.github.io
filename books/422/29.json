On the river-plain they met\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Where many a goodly pavilion the squires by this had set.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So soon as Hagen of Troneg beheld them from far away,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In knightly-courteous fashion unto his lords did he say:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now, warriors battle-eager, leap each man down from the selle,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And go ye forward to meet them which be come to greet you well.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A warrior company cometh; full well be they known unto me;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thanes battle-eager and stalwart from the Amals’ land they be;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 235}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the Hero of Bern is their leader, and their courage is high in the fray.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ye shall nowise scorn the service they proffer to you this day.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then sprang to the earth from the saddle, even as was meet and right,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dietrich, and there with their captain were many a squire and knight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forward to that guest-greeting they strode to the hero-band,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in kindliest wise they welcomed the men of Burgundia-land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So now when the noble Dietrich beheld them drawing nigh,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gladness and sorrow within him strove for the mastery[11].\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well knew he the deadly secret: a grief was their journey to him;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But he weened that Rüdiger knew it, and had told of the peril grim.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Welcome, my lords! O Gunther and Giselher, welcome be ye!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gernot and Hagen, welcome!

\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the Prince of Bern made answer: “What other can be my tale\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Save this, that morning by morning I hear her weep and wail—\n\u003c/div\u003e

warriors battle-keen.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So on to the court went riding that bold Burgundian band,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bearing themselves right proudly after the wont of their land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then many a valiant warrior of the Huns watched eagerly\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the coming of Hagen of Troneg, what manner of man should he be.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Known long since was the story to all folk, how that his hand\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had dealt unto Siegfried the death-stab, to the King of the Nether Land,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of all stark knights the strongest, the lord of Kriemhild the Queen:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Therefore the expectation of men to behold him was keen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mighty of mould was the hero, as the soothfast songs declare,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Exceeding broad in the shoulders and deep of chest, and his hair\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By this was a sable silvered; sinewy, long of limb,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As a king was he stately in going, and his face as death was grim.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then all the thanes Burgundian into hostels did they bring;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the train of the squires of Gunther were sundered far from the King.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was done by the Queen’s devising, for the hate that to him she bare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Slain ere long in their hostels all those henchmen were.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dankwart the brother of Hagen was marshal of all that train,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to him did the King commit them, charging him once and again\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To do his utmost endeavour for supplying of all their need;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he laboured with willing spirit, and served with diligent heed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 237}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forth came the fair Queen Kriemhild with a goodly company.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With falsely-feignèd kindness those Niblungs greeted she.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Giselher her brother did she kiss, and she clasped his hand:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Hagen of Troneg saw it, he tightened his helmet-band.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good sooth, after such a welcome,” Hagen cried, “there is need\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the battle-eager warriors should take to themselves good heed!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The greeting of prince and of liegeman is here no whit the same.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I wot, on an evil journey to this high-tide we came!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She answered, “To him be welcome who joyeth to see thy face!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For thy friendship’s sake is accorded here no greeting’s grace.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This tell to me, what dost thou bring me from Worms beyond the Rhine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That unto me so welcome should be this presence of thine?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What new thing shall this be, quotha!” spake Hagen scornfully,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That these good knights Burgundian should be bringers of gifts unto thee?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had I known that thou wert so grasping—I am rich enow, I wot,—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A gift unto thee of my bounty to the Hunland had I brought.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thy gifts!—thou answer the question I ask of thee this day:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Hoard, the Niblung Treasure—where have ye thrust it away?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That at least was mine own possession, well dost thou understand!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That should ye have brought to its owner unto King Etzel’s land.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of a truth, my lady Kriemhild, full many a day hath passed\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Since the gold of the Niblung Treasure of me was beholden last.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Under the Rhine-river waters by command of my lords was it drowned:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There must it stay of a surety till the Trumpet of Doom shall sound.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the Queen made bitter answer: “I trowed that so it would be!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of his spoil has the thief brought hither little enow unto me,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Though the gold was mine own possession, erewhile of me controlled!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the gold and its lord have I suffered anguish manifold.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The Fiend a gift do I bring thee!” cried Hagen in savage scorn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “’Tis enough for me that I carry the shield on mine arm that is borne,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the harness about my body, and mine helm bright-glittering,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the sword at my side—they suffice me: nothing to thee do I bring.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 238}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) “Nay, never think thou,” she answered, “that it is for the gold I care.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I need not to stint my bounty, enough have I and to spare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the murderer, twice a robber, who hath stol’n from my

warriors all:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It fits not that ye bear weapons here in the royal hall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Commit them to me, ye heroes, and well will I ward them for you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of a truth,” made answer Hagen, “that will we never do!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I crave not the honour, O gracious child of a princely line,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That thou to thy place of safety bear any weapon of mine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nor shield, nor battle-harness—queen, well I wot,

Kriemhild cried.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For what cause now of my brother and of Hagen is this denied\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That I have their shields in my keeping?
