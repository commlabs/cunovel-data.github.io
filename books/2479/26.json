There would be four murders on his head, and how could he live with that and not go insane? He remembered what Burt had said about Train, back in the cafe: He ets \" , 9 a round the swamp.

The sun was up strong and hot now, golden light streaming through the trees. A movement caught his attention, and he saw a moccasin undulating smoothly across the surface. He watched it until it disappeared into the shadows. It seemed to Dan that in this swamp the human reptiles were the ones to be feared most of all. He lifted his forearm and stared at his snake tattoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, a long time ago, he had been a brave man.

I figure not to rock the boat, ay?\" He smiled; it was a painful sight. The smile quickly faded. \"If he don\u0027t,find \u0027em, I figure, he don\u0027t get killed. He was a good fella. Few days ago fisherman find Jack\u0027s boat on Lake Tambour.

She had come so far, with so much at stake. But now she knew what the important thing was. She said, \"Help them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a faint smile; he\u0027d known what she was going to decide. \"You need to stay here.

He found extra magazines for the rifles and clips for the automatic and put them in a faded old backpack, which Arden was given charge of. Dan took the Browning and the pistol. Train got a plastic jug of filtered water from the galley, slung the Rugees strap around his shoulder, and said, \"We go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the houseboat and Train led them to the vine-covered floating structure next to the pier. He slid open a door. \"Here she sets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Dan said, stunned by what he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting inside was Train\u0027s second boat. It was painted navy gray, the paint job relatively fresh except for patches of rust at the waterline. It resembled a smaller version of a commercial tug, but it was leaner and meaner, its squat pilothouse set closer to the prow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe craft was about fifty feet long, and thirteen feet high at its tallest point, a tight squeeze in the oil-smelling, musty boathouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had not the gentle charm of an infant, but the armor-plated threat of a brute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the machine-gun mounts and the mortar had been removed and other\u0027civilian modifications made to the radar mast, Dan recognized it as a Swift-type river patrol boat, the same kind of vessel Train had crewed aboard on the deadly waterways of Vietnam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My baby,\" Train said with a sly grin. \"Let the good times Reptilian The sun had risen on a small aluminum rowboat in the middle of a muddy pond. In that rowboat Flint and Pelvis sat facing each other, linked by the short chain between their cuffed wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt seven o\u0027clock the temperature was approaching eightyfour degrees and the air steamed with humidity. Flint\u0027s shirt and suit jacket had been stripped off him, Clint\u0027s arm drooping lethargically from the pale, sweat-sparkling chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeads of moisture glistened on Flint\u0027s hollow-eyed face, his head bowed. Across from him, Pelvis still wore his wig backward, his clothes sweat-drenched, his eyes swollen and forlorn. Dried blood covered the split sausage of his bottom lip, one of his lower teeth gone and another knocked crooked, tendrils of crusty blood stuck to his chin. His breathing was slow and harsh, sweat dripping from the end of his nose into a puddle between his mud-bleached suedes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething brushed against the boat\u0027s hull and made the craft lazily turn around its anchor chain. Flint lifted his head to watch a five-foot-long alligator drift past, its snout pushing through the foul brown water. A second alligator, this one maybe three feet in length, cruised past the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cat-green eyes and ridged skull of a third had surfaced less than six feet from the rowboat. Two more, each fourtooters, lay motionless side by side just beyond the silent watcher. Flint had counted nine alligators at any one time, but there might be others asleep on the bottom. He couldn\u0027t tell one from the- other, except for their obvious size differences, so he really didn\u0027t know how many lurked in the sludgy pond. Still, they were quiet monsters. Occasionally two or three would bump together in their back-and-forth \u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"ed81ad\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/a\u003e driftings and there might be an instant\u0027s outburst of thrashing anger, but then everything would calm down again but for the rocking of the boat and the thudding hearts of the men in it. Flint figured the ariptors were prisoners here just as he and Pelvis were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pond looked to be sixty-five feet across, from one side of a half-submerged, rusty barbed-wire fence to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the alligator corral\u0027s heavily bohed gate was a pier where two cigarette speedboats-both of them painted dark, nonreflective green-were Wed, along with the larger workboat Flint had seen unloading the reptiles at the Vermilion marina. Eight feet of the pier was built out over the corral, and at its end stood a bolted-down electric winch Flint figured was used to hoist the alligators up onto the workboat\u0027s deck. During the thirty-minute journey to this place in one of the speedboats, Monty had gleefully ripped the jacket and shirt off Flint\u0027s back and taken the derringer\u0027s holster. Then, when they\u0027d reached their destination, Doc and the others had debated for a few minutes, what to do with them until \"he\"-whoever \"hell waswoke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir current situation had been dreamed up by Doc, who got Mitch to row them in the aluminum skiff through the corral\u0027s gate while Monty had followed in a second rowboat. There had been much hilarity from a group of men watching on the pier as Mitch had thrown a concrete brick anchor over the side and then got into the boat with Monty, leaving Flint and Pelvis at the end of their chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe party had gone on for a while-\"Hey, freak! Why don\u0027t you and Elvis get out of that boat and cool yourselves off?\"-but the men had drifted away as the sun had come up. Flint understood why; the novelty had faded, and they\u0027d known how hot it was going to get out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery so often Mitch, Monty, or some other\u0027bastard would stroll out to the pier\u0027s end to take a look and throw a remark at them that included the words \"freak\" or \"motherfuckers,\" then they would go away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Pelvis had been smashed in the mouth, he\u0027d not spoken a single word. Flint realized he must be in shock. Monty had taken Mama with him, and the last time the bearded sonofabitch had come out to check on them, the little bulldog wasn\u0027t in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint could smell meat cooking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing burned was more like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pier continued on past the boats to a bizarre sight: a large suburban ranch house with cream-colored walls, perched on wooden pilings over the water. The place looked as if it had been lifted up off the\u0027mowed green lawn of the perfect American town, helicoptered in, and set down to be the envy of the neighborhood. There was a circular swimming pool with its own redwood deck, one of those \"aboveground\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epools sold in kits; here the pool was not above ground, but on a platform above swamp. On the pool\u0027s deck was a rack of barbells, a weight bench, and a stationary cycle. Next to it was another large deck shaded by a blue-and-white-striped canvas awning, and on the far side of the house the platform supported a television satellite dish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther walkways went off from the main platform, connecting the house to three other smaller wooden structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCables snaked from one of them to the house and the satellite dish, so Flint reasoned it stored the power generator. Though the alligator corral, the pier, and the swimming pool were out under the full sun, most of the house was shaded by moss-draped trees. Around the house and the corral and everything else the swamp still held green dominion. Flint could see a bayou winding into the swamp beyond the farthermost of the three outbuildings, and there were red buoys floating in it to mark deeper passage for the workboat\u0027s hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis survey of the area had also found a wooden watchtower, about forty feet high, all but hidden amid the trees at the bayou\u0027s entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp top, under a green-painted cupola, a man sat in a lawn chair reading a magazine, a rifle propped against the railing beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery few minutes he would stand up and scan all directions through a pair of binoculars, then he would sit down again and return to his reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We,\" Flint said hoarsely, \"are in deep shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelvis didn\u0027t speak; he just sat there and kept sweating, hir, eyes unfocused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eisley?
