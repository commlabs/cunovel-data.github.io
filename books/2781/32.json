{"id":87757,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\u003cp\u003eShe is over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a two-week window in which I’ll be nothing. I won’t be a student. I won’t be a teacher. I’ll be a twenty-one-year-old college graduate. I’ve thought about walking straight over to Lake’s house today to tell her how much I love her, even though I’m technically still a teacher, considering the contract I have with the junior high. Not even that would stop me if it weren’t for the way she reacted to me last month with so much indifference. She seemed to have accepted our fate, and it was good to see her handling everything so well, as much as it hurt. The last thing I want to do, or need to do, is pull her back down with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, this is going to be the hardest two weeks of my life. I need to keep my distance from her, that’s a fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the audience begins clapping, I snap back to reality. I’m supposed to be judging tonight, but I haven’t heard a single word any of the performers have said. I hold up the standard 9.0 on my scorecard without even looking up at the stage. I don’t even want to be here tonight. In fact, I don’t want to be anywhere tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the scores are tallied, the emcee begins to announce the winners. I lean back in my seat and close my eyes, hoping the night goes fast. I just want to go home and get to bed so graduation will come and go tomorrow. I don’t know why I’m dreading it. Probably because I’ll be the only person there who couldn’t find enough people to give my graduation tickets to. The average person never gets enough tickets for graduation. I have too many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would like to perform a piece I wrote.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerk up in my seat at the sound of her voice, the sudden movement almost causing my chair to flip backward. She’s standing on the stage, holding the microphone. The guy next to me laughs along with the rest of the crowd once they realize she’s interrupting the night’s schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Check this chick out,” he says, nudging me with his elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of her paralyzes me. I’m pretty sure I forgot how to breathe. I’m pretty sure I’m about to die. What the hell is she doing? I watch intently as she brings the microphone back to her lips. “I know this isn’t standard protocol, but it’s an emergency,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughter from the audience causes her eyes to widen and she spins around to look for the emcee. She’s scared. Whatever she’s doing, it’s completely out of character for her. The emcee nudges her to face the front of the room again. I take a deep breath, silently willing her to keep calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe places the microphone back in its stand and lowers it to her height. She closes her eyes and inhales when the guy next to me yells, “Three dollars!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could punch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flick open and she shoves her hand into her pocket, pulling out money to hand to the emcee. After he takes the money, she prepares herself again. “My piece is called—” The emcee interrupts her, tapping her on the shoulder. She shoots him an irritated glance. I expel a deep breath, becoming just as irritated by all the interruptions. She takes the change from him and shoves it back into her pocket, then hisses something at him that makes him retreat off the stage. She turns back toward the audience and her eyes scan the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has to know I’m here. What the hell is she doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My piece is called Schooled,” she says into the microphone. I swallow the lump in my throat. If I wanted to move at this point, my body would fail me. I’m completely frozen as I watch her take several deep breaths, then begin her piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got schooled this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy my little brother . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby The Avett Brothers . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby my mother, my best friend, my teacher, my father,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boy that I’m seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably in love with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got so schooled this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy a nine-year-old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe taught me that it’s okay to live life\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea little backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how to laugh\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt what you would think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got schooled this year\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy a band\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey taught me how to find that feeling of feeling again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey taught me how to decide what to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd go be it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got schooled this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy a cancer patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe taught me so much.

She’s not up there anymore. I spin around and see her making her way toward the exit in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell am I doing just sitting here? She’s waiting on me to acknowledge everything she just said, and I’m sitting here frozen like an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up when the judges to the right of me hold up their scorecards. Three of them gave her a nine, the other an 8.5. I round the front of the table and flip the scores on all of their cards to tens. The points may not be the point, but her poetry kicked ass. “She gets tens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around and jump onto the stage. I grab the microphone out of the emcee’s hands and he rolls his eyes, throwing his hands up in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not again,” he says, defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spot her as soon as she swings the doors open to step outside. “That’s not a good idea,” I say into the microphone. She stops in her tracks, then slowly turns around to face the stage. “You shouldn’t leave before you get your scores.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at the judges’ table, then back to me. When she makes eye contact, she smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip the microphone, hell bent on performing the piece I wrote for her, but the magnetic pull to jump off the stage and take her in my arms is overwhelming. I stand firm, wanting her to hear what I have to say first. “I’d like to perform a piece,” I say, looking at the emcee. “It’s an emergency.” He nods and takes a few steps back. I turn around to face Lake again. She’s standing in the center of the room now, staring up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three dollars,” someone yells from the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. I pat my pockets, realizing I left my wallet in my car. “I don’t have any cash,” I say to the emcee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes shift to Lake and mine follow. She pulls out the two dollars in change from her fee and walks to the stage, slapping it down in front of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still a dollar short,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus! It’s one freaking dollar!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence in the room is interrupted as several chairs slide from under their tables. People from all over the floor walk toward the stage, surrounding Lake as they throw dollar bills onto the stage. Everyone quickly makes their way back to their seats and Lake eyes the money, dumbfounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” the emcee says, taking in the pile of cash at my feet. “I guess that covers it. What’s the name of your piece, Will?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at Lake and smile right back at her. “Better than third.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes a few steps back from the stage and waits for me to begin.
