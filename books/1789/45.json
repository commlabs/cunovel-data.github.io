Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin, you shouldn\u0027t get your wife upset. She\u0027s pregnant, for God\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at her, Nathan. Does she look upset to you? She looks damned guilty to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra let her husband see her exasperation. Nathan winked at her when she walked back to the settee. She folded her hands together and frowned at her husband. \"You better not get angry, Colin. Our baby might become upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re not upset, are you, sweetheart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patted the cushion next to him. She sat down and smoothed her gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the floor. He stared at her. \"They\u0027re inside the ship, aren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s inside the ship?\" Nathan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The stock certificates,\" Colin answered. \"Alesandra, I asked you a question. Please answer me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they\u0027re inside the ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief fairly overwhelmed him. He was so damned happy the certificates hadn\u0027t been sold to a stranger he wanted to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint blush crept up Alesandra\u0027s face. \"How did you do it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they in my name? I never thought to ask Dreyson that question. Do I own them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they in Nathan\u0027s name then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited a long minute for her to confess. She remained stubbornly silent. Nathan was thoroughly puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to talk to the owner, Alesandra, to see if he might wish to sell the stocks back to us. I won\u0027t use intimidation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The owner can\u0027t talk to you, Nathan, and it really isn\u0027t legally possible for you to purchase the stocksâ€”not now anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to look at her husband. \"I will admit I did interfere just a bit, husband, but I would remind you that you were being very mule-headed about my inheritance at the time and I had to resort to a bit of trickery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like your father,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she agreed. \"Like my father. He wouldn\u0027t be angry with me. Are you?\" she asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin couldn\u0027t help but notice that his wife didn\u0027t appear to be overly concerned about that possibility. She smiled, a radiant smile that made his breath catch in the back of his throat. She was definitely going to drive him crazy one of these days, and he couldn\u0027t imagine anything more wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned down and kissed her. \"Go and say good-bye to Sara. Then you and I are going home to our castle. My leg needs some of your pampering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin, that\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever heard you mention your leg,\" Nathan interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not nearly as sensitive anymore. The ache in his leg did save our lives, after all. If the throbbing hadn\u0027t awakened him, he might not have heard Morgan. Mother Superior told me there was a reason for everything. I believe she was right. Perhaps the shark took a bite out of your leg so you would be able to save me and our son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m having a son?\" Colin asked, smiling over how matter-of-fact Alesandra sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, I believe so,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin rolled his eyes heavenward. \"Have you named him yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sparkle came back into her eyes. \"We should call him Dolphin or Dragon. Both names are appropriate. He is, after all, his father\u0027s son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra left the room to the sound of her husband\u0027s laughter. She patted her swollen middle and whispered, \"When you\u0027re smiling at me and showing your gentle side, I\u0027ll think of you as my dolphin, and when you\u0027re angry because you aren\u0027t getting your way, I\u0027ll know you\u0027ve turned into my dragon. I\u0027ll love you with all my heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s she whispering about?\" Nathan asked Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men watched Alesandra until she turned and started up the steps. \"She\u0027s talking to my son,\" Colin confessed. \"She seems to think he hears her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan laughed. He\u0027d never heard of anything so absurd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin stood up and went to the mantel. He found the latch cleverly concealed by a trapdoor fashioned into the side of the ship and opened it. The stock certificates were rolled into a tube and tied with a pink ribbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan watched him pull the papers out, unroll them, and read the name of the owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Colin burst into laughter. Nathan bounded to his feet. His curiosity was killing him. \"Who owns them, Colin? Give me the name and I\u0027ll talk to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alesandra said the owner wouldn\u0027t talk to you,\" Colin replied. \"She was right about that. You\u0027re going to have to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long?\" Nathan demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin handed his partner the certificates. \"Until your daughter learns how to speak, I imagine. They\u0027re all in Joanna\u0027s name, Nathan. Neither one of us can buy the stock back. We\u0027re both named as joint executors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan was astonished. \"But how did she know? The stock was sold before she even met Sara or Joanna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave me your daughter\u0027s name in your letter,\" Colin reminded his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan sat down. A slow smile settled on his face. The company was safe from intruders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going, Colin?\" he called out when his partner walked out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home to my castle,\" Colin said. \"With my princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started up the steps to collect his wife. The sound of her laughter reached him and he paused to let her joy wash over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe princess had tamed the dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dragon was still the victor. He\u0027d captured a princess\u0027s love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was content. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-45.html","bookId":1789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM"}
