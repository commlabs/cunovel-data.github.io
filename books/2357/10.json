Why did I say that? There was no reason to let Adam know how often she had thought about him in the past few months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to tell you I thought you handled the Abraham Wilson case brilliantly. You deserved to win it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" He\u0027s going to hang up, Jennifer thought. I\u0027ll never see him again. He\u0027s probably too busy with his harem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Adam Warner was saying, \"I was wondering if you\u0027d care to have dinner with me one evening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen hate overeager girls. \"What about tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer heard the smile in his voice. \"I\u0027m afraid my first free night is Friday. Are you busy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She had almost said, Of course not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I pick you up at your place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer thought about her dreary little apartment with its lumpy sofa, the ironing board set up in a corner. \"It might be easier if we met somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like the food at Lutece?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I tell you after I\u0027ve eaten there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"How\u0027s eight o\u0027clock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight o\u0027clock is lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLovely. Jennifer replaced the receiver and sat there in a glow of euphoria. This is ridiculous, she thought. He\u0027s probably married and has two dozen children. Almost the first thing Jennifer had noticed about Adam when they had had dinner was that he was not wearing a wedding ring. Inconclusive evidence, she thought wryly. There definitely should be a law forcing all husbands to wear wedding rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey walked into the office. \"How\u0027s the master attorney?\" He looked at her more closely. \"You look like you just swallowed a client.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer hesitated, then said, \"Ken, would you run a check on someone for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked over to her desk, picked up a pad and pencil. \"Shoot. Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to say Adam\u0027s name, then stopped, feeling like a fool. What business had she prying into Adam Warner\u0027s private life? For God\u0027s sake, she told herself, all he did is ask you to have dinner with him, not marry him. \"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen put the pencil down. \"Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ken - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam Warner. His name is Adam Warner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen looked at her in surprise. \"Hell, you don\u0027t need me to run a check on him. Just read the newspapers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey flopped into a chair across from Jennifer and steepled his fingers together. \"Let me see. He\u0027s a partner in Needham, Finch, Pierce and Warner; Harvard Law School; comes from a rich socialite family; in his middle thirties - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked at him curiously. \"How do you know so much about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked. \"I have friends in high places. There\u0027s a rumor they\u0027re going to run Mr. Warner for the United States Senate. There\u0027s even a little presidential ground swell going on. He\u0027s got what they call charisma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe certainly has, Jennifer thought. She tried to make her next question sound casual. \"What about his personal life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey looked at her oddly. \"He\u0027s married to the daughter of an ex-Secretary of the Navy. She\u0027s the niece of Stewart Needham, Warner\u0027s law partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s heart sank. So that was that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen was watching her, puzzled. \"Why this sudden interest in Adam Warner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong after Ken Bailey had left, Jennifer sat there thinking about Adam. He asked me to dinner as a professional courtesy. He wants to congratulate me. But he\u0027s already done that over the telephone. Who cares why? I\u0027m going to see him again. I wonder whether he\u0027ll remember to mention he has a wife. Of course not. Well, I\u0027ll have dinner with Adam on Friday night and that will be the end of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate that afternoon, Jennifer received a telephone call from Peabody \u0026amp; Peabody. It was from the senior partner himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been meaning to get around to this for some time,\" he said. \"I wondered if you and I might have lunch soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis casual tone did not deceive Jennifer. She was sure the idea of having lunch with her had not occurred to him until after he had read about the Abraham Wilson decision. He certainly did not want to meet with her to discuss serving subpoenas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about tomorrow?\" he suggested. \"My club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey met for lunch the following day. The senior Peabody was a pale, prissy man, an older version of his son. His vest failed to conceal a slight paunch. Jennifer liked the father just as little as she had liked the son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have an opening for a bright young trial attorney in our firm, Miss Parker. We can offer you fifteen thousand dollars a year to start with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer sat there listening to him, thinking how much that offer would have meant to her a year earlier when she had desperately needed a job, needed someone who believed in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was saying, \"I\u0027m sure that within a few years there would be room for a partnership for you in our firm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen thousand dollars a year and a partnership. Jennifer thought about the little office she shared with Ken, and her tiny, shabby four-flight walk-up apartment with its fake fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Peabody was taking her silence for acquiescence. \"Good. We\u0027d like you to begin as soon as possible. Perhaps you could start Monday. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Well, if Monday\u0027s not convenient for you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, no, I can\u0027t take your offer, Mr. Peabody,\" Jennifer said, and amazed herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" There was a pause. \"Perhaps we could start you at twenty thousand dollars a year.\" He saw the expression on her face. \"Or twenty-five thousand. Why don\u0027t you think it over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve thought it over. I\u0027m going to stay in business for myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clients were beginning to come. Not a great many and not very affluent, but they were clients. The office was becoming too small for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning after Jennifer had kept two clients waiting outside in the hallway while she was dealing with a third, Ken said, \"This isn\u0027t going to work. You\u0027re going to have to move out of here and get yourself a decent office uptown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer nodded. \"I know. I\u0027ve been thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen busied himself with some papers so that he did not have to meet her eyes. \"I\u0027ll miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about? You have to go with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for the words to sink in. He looked up and a broad grin creased his freckled face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go with you?\" He glanced around the cramped, windowless room. \"And give up all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following week, Jennifer and Ken Bailey moved into larger offices in the five hundred block on Fifth Avenue. The new quarters were simply furnished and consisted of three small rooms: one for Jennifer, one for Ken and one for a secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secretary they hired was a young girl named Cynthia Ellman fresh out of New York University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There won\u0027t be a lot for you to do for a while,\" Jennifer apologized, \"but things will pick up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know they will, Miss Parker.\" There was heroine worship in the girl\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wants to be like me, Jennifer thought. God forbid!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey walked in and said, \"Hey, I get lonely in that big office all by myself. How about dinner and the theater tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I - \" She was tired and had some briefs to read, but Ken was her best friend and she could not refuse him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went to see Applause, and Jennifer enjoyed it tremendously. Lauren Bacall was totally captivating. Jennifer and Ken had supper afterward at Sardi\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had ordered, Ken said, \"I have two tickets for the ballet Friday night. I thought we might - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer said, \"I\u0027m sorry, Ken. I\u0027m busy Friday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" His voice was curiously flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom time to time, Jennifer would find Ken staring at her when he thought he was unobserved, and there was an expression on his face that Jennifer found hard to define. She knew Ken was lonely, although he never talked about any of his friends and never discussed his personal life. She could not forget what Otto had told her, and she wondered whether Ken himself knew what he wanted out of life. She wished that there were some way she could help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to Jennifer that Friday was never going to arrive. As her dinner date with Adam Warner drew closer, Jennifer found it more and more difficult to concentrate on business. She found herself thinking about Adam constantly. She knew she was being ridiculous. She had seen the man only once in her life, and yet she was unable to get him out of her mind. She tried to rationalize by telling herself that it was because he had saved her when she was facing disbarment proceedings, and then had sent her clients. That was true, but Jennifer knew it was more than that. It was something she could not explain, even to herself. It was a feeling she had never had before, an attraction she had never felt for any other man. She wondered what Adam Warner\u0027s wife was like. She was undoubtedly one of the chosen women who, every Wednesday, walked through the red door at Elizabeth Arden\u0027s for a day of head-to-toe pampering. She would be sleek and sophisticated, with the polished aura of the wealthy socialite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the magic Friday morning at ten o\u0027clock, Jennifer made an appointment with a new Italian hairdresser Cynthia had told her all the models were going to. At ten-thirty, Jennifer called to cancel it. At eleven, she rescheduled the appointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey invited Jennifer to lunch, but she was too nervous to eat anything. Instead, she went shopping at Bendel\u0027s, where she bought a short, dark green chiffon dress that matched her eyes, a pair of slender brown pumps and a matching purse. She knew she was far over her budget, but she could not seem to stop herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe passed the perfume department on the way out, and on an insane impulse bought a bottle of Joy perfume. It was insane because the man was married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer left the office at five o\u0027clock and went home to change. She spent two hours bathing and dressing for Adam, and when she was finished she studied herself critically in the mirror. Then she defiantly combed out her carefully coiffured hair and tied it back with a green ribbon. That\u0027s better, she thought. I\u0027m a lawyer going to have dinner with another lawyer. But when she closed the door she left behind a faint fragrance of rose and jasmine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLutece was nothing like what Jennifer had expected. A French tricolor flew above the entrance of the small town house. Inside, a narrow hall led to a small bar and beyond was a sunroom, bright and gay, with porch wicker and plaid tablecloths. Jennifer was met at the door by the owner, Andre Soltner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m meeting Mr. Adam Warner. I think I\u0027m a little early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved Jennifer toward the small bar. \"Would you care for a drink while you are waiting, Miss Parker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be nice,\" Jennifer said. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll send a waiter over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer took a seat and amused herself watching the bejeweled and mink-draped women arriving with their escorts. Jennifer had read and heard about Lutece. It was reputed to be Jacqueline Kennedy\u0027s favorite restaurant and to have excellent food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA distinguished-looking gray-haired man walked up to Jennifer and said, \"Mind if I join you for a moment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer stiffened. \"I\u0027m waiting for someone,\" she began. \"He should be here - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and sat down. \"This isn\u0027t a pickup, Miss Parker.\" Jennifer looked at him in surprise, unable to place him. \"I\u0027m Lee Browning, of Holland and Browning.\" It was one of the most prestigious law firms in New York. \"I just wanted to congratulate you on the way you handled the Wilson trial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mr. Browning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You took a big chance. It was a no-win case.\" He studied her a moment. \"The rule is, when you\u0027re on the wrong side of a no-win case, make sure it\u0027s one where there\u0027s no publicity involved. The trick is to spotlight the winners and kick the losers under the rug. You fooled a lot of us. Have you ordered a drink yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I - ?\" He beckoned to a waiter. \"Victor, bring us a bottle of champagne, would you? Dom Perignon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right away, Mr. Browning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer smiled. \"Are you trying to impress me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed aloud. \"I\u0027m trying to hire you. I imagine you\u0027ve been getting a lot of offers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our firm deals mostly in corporate work, Miss Parker, but some of our more affluent clients frequently get carried away and have need of a criminal defense attorney. I think we could make you a very attractive proposal. Would you care to stop by my office and discuss it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mr. Browning. I\u0027m really flattered, but I just moved into my own offices. I\u0027m hoping it will work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a long look. \"It will work out.\" He raised his eyes as someone approached and got to his feet and held out his hand. \"Adam, how are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked up and Adam Warner was standing there shaking hands with Lee Browning. Jennifer\u0027s heart began to beat faster and she could feel her face flush. Idiot schoolgirl!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam Warner looked at Jennifer and Browning and said, \"You two know each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were just beginning to get acquainted,\" Lee Browning said easily. \"You arrived a little too soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or just in time.\" He took Jennifer\u0027s arm. \"Better luck next time, Lee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain came up to Adam. \"Would you like your table now, Mr. Warner, or would you like to have a drink at the bar first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take a table, Henri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had been seated, Jennifer looked around the room and recognized half a dozen celebrities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This place is like a Who\u0027s Who,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam looked at her. \"It is now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer felt herself blush again. Stop it, you fool. She wondered how many other girls Adam Warner had brought here while his wife was sitting at home, waiting for him. She wondered if any of them ever learned that he was married, or whether he always managed to keep that a secret from them. Well, she had an advantage. You\u0027re going to be in for a surprise, Mr. Warner, Jennifer thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ordered drinks and dinner and busied themselves making small talk. Jennifer let Adam do most of the talking. He was witty and charming, but she was armored against his charm. It was not easy. She found herself smiling at his anecdotes, laughing at his stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt won\u0027t do him any good, Jennifer told herself. She was not looking for a fling. The specter of her mother haunted her. There was a deep passion within Jennifer that she was afraid to explore, afraid to release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were having dessert and Adam still had not said one word that could be misconstrued. Jennifer had been building up her defenses for nothing, fending off an attack that had never materialized, and she felt like a fool. She wondered what Adam would have said if he had known what she had been thinking all evening. Jennifer smiled at her own vanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never got a chance to thank you for the clients you sent me,\" Jennifer said. \"I did telephone you a few times, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Adam hesitated, then added awkwardly, \"I didn\u0027t want to return your phone calls.\" Jennifer looked at him in surprise. \"I was afraid to,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there it was. He had taken her by surprise, caught her off guard, but his meaning was unmistakable. Jennifer knew what was coming next. And she did not want him to say it. She did not want him to be like all the others, the married men who pretended they were single. She despised them and she did not want to despise this man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam said quietly, \"Jennifer, I want you to know I\u0027m married.\" She sat there staring at him, her mouth open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I should have told you sooner.\" He smiled wryly. \"Well, there really was no sooner, was there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer was filled with a strange confusion. \"Why - why did you ask me to dinner, Adam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I had to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything began to seem unreal to Jennifer. It was as though she were being pulled under by some giant tidal wave. She sat there listening to Adam saying all the things he felt, and she knew that every word was true. She knew because she felt the same way. She wanted him to stop before he said too much. She wanted him to go on and say more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I\u0027m not offending you,\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sudden shyness about him that shook Jennifer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam, I - I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her and even though they had not touched, it was as if she were in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer said shakily, \"Tell me about your wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary Beth and I have been married fifteen years. We have no children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She - we decided not to have any. We were both very young when we got married. I had known her a long time. Our families were neighbors at a summer place we had in Maine. When she was eighteen, her parents were killed in a plane crash. Mary Beth was almost insane with grief. She was all alone. I - we got married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe married her out of pity and he\u0027s too much of a gentleman to say so, Jennifer thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a wonderful woman. We\u0027ve always had a very good relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was telling Jennifer more than she wanted to know, more than she could handle. Every instinct in her warned her to get away, to flee. In the past she had easily been able to cope with the married men who had tried to become involved with her, but Jennifer knew instinctively that this was different. If she ever let herself fall in love with this man, there would be no way out.
