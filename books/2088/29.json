{"id":89617,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs I was leaving, a pile of books on the counter caught my eye. Since they were the shape and size of textbooks and Tina did not strike me as the textbook type, I was curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollege algebra, biology, and intro to Indian studies. Before I even opened her notebook and peeked at the course list, I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina had been in Cadotte\u0027s class. How was that for a coincidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the rest of my shift driving around, handling the usual. Speeding, reckless driving, bloody bar fight - all in a night\u0027s work. I could deal with them in my sleep, which was lucky, since I was pretty damn distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories swirled though my mind, little things and big, followed by questions. By the time I got off and went home, I was a mess. Had I been screwing a werewolf? Thank goodness we\u0027d used protection. I certainly didn\u0027t want any puppies -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or would that be cubs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my way up the stairs to my apartment I started to giggle; then I couldn\u0027t stop. I passed my landlord, Mr. Murphy. Still snickering, I nodded in lieu of hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s so funny?\" He smiled along with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Puppies,\" I managed between desperate attempts to catch my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile disappeared immediately. \"You know there are no dogs allowed in this building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help it; I erupted with laughter. Waving good-bye, I escaped into my apartment. This was all just too ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside, however, I sobered. As much as I hated the concept of woo-woo, I couldn\u0027t deny that something weird was going on in Miniwa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly fools ignored the evidence, and I liked to think of myself as one step above a fool, at the very least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down and listed all that I knew to be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren Larson bitten by a wolf. Loses her mind and rips out the throat of her principal. Despite her having her brains blown out, both she and the principal disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evidence gathered from the scene of the Larson accident vanishes from the evidence room of the Miniwa police station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone breaks into Cadotte\u0027s office and ransacks the place, taking nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel Gerard bitten. Rabies vaccine administered. Dies of as yet undetermined causes, with strange changes in the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina Wilson turns up missing. But the key to her apartment is found next to a wolf bonfire in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch the shadow of a man become the shadow of a wolf on the wall of a cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting back, I chewed my lip and examined the evidence, none of which made much sense. However, when I combined facts and fantasy a clearer picture emerged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously Clyde had not used silver on Karen Larson. Hence her ability and that of her principal to get up and walk out of the morgue. Or perhaps her change had merely been delayed as Mandenauer had predicted and she\u0027d run out of the place on all fours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disappearance of the evidence from the police station indicated the involvement of the department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut who?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ransacking of Cadotte\u0027s office led me to believe someone had been searching for the totem. But why had they been searching there? Again, police involvement was indicated -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;unless someone was following me. Also a possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I believed Mandenauer\u0027s claim that the rabies vaccine had killed Mel, then there could be something to his theory of lycanthropy. If Mel had had rabies, he should have been cured, not killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I believed Mandenauer that far, why not go the entire way and buy into a Nazi werewolf army? I wouldn\u0027t put it past them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo who was a werewolf and who wasn\u0027t? It was impossible to tell, unless I shot everyone with silver. I wasn\u0027t willing to do that. Yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight filled the room. I should be in bed, but 1 wasn\u0027t the least bit tired. I got out of my uniform and into my swimming suit. Then I tossed what passed as a purse for me -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a small plastic makeup case sans makeup, with just enough room for a few personal necessities, my keys and my ID -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;into a gym bag along with a towel, some water, my gun of course, the totem -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I wasn\u0027t letting the thing out of my sight -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and headed for my pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed the exercise. I needed the release. I needed the peace of my own special place just to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheoretically I should be safe -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it was broad daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later as I swam back and forth, back and forth, across the pond I pondered some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho could I trust? Mandenauer said no one, but he could be nuts for all I knew. I certainly didn\u0027t trust him. No more than I trusted Cadotte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes, I remembered the big, sleek black wolf I\u0027d encountered the first night I\u0027d hunted with Man-denauer. The way the animal had moved reminded me of Cadotte. Or maybe it was the other way around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swam until my head stopped spinning, pushing myself until all I could think about was the next stroke, the next kick. The sun was warm first on my back, then on my face. Peace settled into my soul. This was what I had come here for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I couldn\u0027t drag myself any farther, I crawled out of the water and sat on the bank, trailing my toes along the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of nature surrounded me -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;bees buzzing, birds twittering. A frog splashed into the pond on the far side. A fish flipped its tail in the center. I rooted around in my bag for my water, tilted my head, drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the forest went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed what was left in my mouth, but my tongue was still dry. I lowered my head, and my eyes scanned the tree line just as he stepped out of the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was as naked as he\u0027d been the first time I\u0027d seen him. As he walked across the meadow separating us, the birds started to sing again. A crow swooped nearly down to his head, then up to the treetops. He didn\u0027t notice. His gaze was focused on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him walk and was reminded again of the wolf. Loose hips, long strides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned with a sudden memory. His hip. The night I\u0027d met him he\u0027d had a nasty bruise there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain I experienced the mythical click in my head of a puzzle piece. I\u0027d forgotten about the bruise, since it bore no relationship to anything. Unless you considered a wolf could become a man. And what if that wolf had just been tapped by the bumper of a great big SUV? Would the man then bear the bruise?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping my eyes on Cadotte, I let my hand slide over to my gun. He stopped several feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want to see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m seeing quite a bit of you. Where\u0027re your clothes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced down, blinked as if he was as surprised to see all of him as I was. \"I was working out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You work out in the buff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swept my free hand down my body to indicate my perfectly modest one-piece swimming suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I was practicing my tai chi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ripple of lean muscle beneath his skin, the shine of the sun across his belly, his shoulders, his hair, was making me forget I should probably shoot him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that what you were doing the night we met?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow convenient. Too bad I wasn\u0027t buying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were practicing at four in the morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he\u0027d been chasing -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;something -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;through the woods and been hit by a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know where I was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t. I called.\" He looked away as if embarrassed. \"All your numbers. When you didn\u0027t answer I thought you might be here. So I walked over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the trees, gauged the direction and distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You walked five miles naked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you I\u0027d walk a hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was acting strange -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;too nervous and shy for Ca-dotte. What was the matter with him? Was I right in my assumption? And if so, what was I going to do about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t give me a chance to think. Suddenly he was moving toward me and my gun was pointed at his chest. He froze, lifted his eyes from the barrel to my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a werewolf, Cadotte?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened. He was either very good at feigning surprise or truly surprised. \"Yesterday you called me insane for suggesting there were such things in the world. Today you accuse me of being one. Tough day at the office, dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that was more like him. I smiled. \"You have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to tell me about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to answer my question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why in hell would I tell you about them if I were one of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not an answer. That\u0027s another question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte and Mandenauer had more in common than I would have thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, \"I am not a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you\u0027d tell me if you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good point.\" He flicked a finger at the gun. \"Now what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could shoot you and see if you die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take Door Number Two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to laugh. I wanted to put down the gun and make love in the sun. I wanted to believe that the only man who\u0027d ever made me scream and writhe and want him over and over and over again wasn\u0027t a werewolf - so I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have seen surrender in my face, because he began to walk toward me again. I lowered the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw back his head, howled like a wolf, and charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so shocked I just sat there, expecting to die. He did a cannonball into the pond and drenched me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for his head to surface. Instead, something wound around my ankle and yanked. My shriek became a gurgle as I sucked pond water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could have drowned me. He could have done anything and I couldn\u0027t have stopped him. My gun was on the bank. I was at his mercy. I didn\u0027t mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we even surfaced his mouth was on mine, the heat a contrast to the coolness of the water. His tongue tickled my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe broke past the surface and into the sun. I tore my mouth free and breathed deeply. He took the opportunity to run his lips down my neck and lick the water from the tops of my breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNear the middle he could stand; I could not. But he held my head above water with his hands at my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with the howl?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolf clan.\" He shrugged. \"I do it sometimes for fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fun. Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis idea of fun and mine were worlds apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you ever swim in the nude?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanna try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t give me a chance to answer, just slipped the straps off my shoulders and yanked. The suit stuck at my hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as easy as it looks, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and gave another mighty tug. Suddenly my swimming suit was gone. Really gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Give that back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, lost it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"You mean -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. Bottom of the pond. Good riddance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my favorite suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No offense, but it\u0027s butt ugly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because my butt\u0027s ugly. The suit covered it nicely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands slid from my hips to my ass. \"Your butt isn\u0027t ugly. There isn\u0027t anything ugly about you. I\u0027m going to buy you a new suit. One that suits you.\" He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you amuse yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted, then plunged into me in one smooth thrust. I squeaked in surprise and clutched his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, wait.\" But he was rocking against me, not pulling out, just rocking. Slow, deep, pushing against a part of me so rarely touched before. There was something I had to do, but I couldn\u0027t think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" he murmured against my breasts. Soft kisses, gentle licks, and a tiny, soft nibble on the nipple. \"That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Puppies,\" I muttered, and shoved him away with all my strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no delusions that he couldn\u0027t keep me right where he wanted me. He was stronger than I was. But he let me go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Puppies? Is that some new form of curse word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh. Yeah. I\u0027m trying to cut down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for me again and I slid out of his reach. \"What\u0027s the matter, Jessie? You can\u0027t actually think I\u0027m a werewolf. You don\u0027t believe in them, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. I didn\u0027t believe in woo-woo. There was another explanation for all that had happened, everything I\u0027d seen. If I kept on searching, I\u0027d find it. The world was black-and-white. Had to be. I didn\u0027t know how to deal with it any other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I\u0027d been thinking, he\u0027d gotten close again. Damn, he was fast -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;by land and by sea. His hand slid around my waist and he pulled me to him. \"Talk to me.\" He nuzzled my neck, took a bit of my skin into his mouth, and sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis erection pressed against me. My legs widened, wrapped around his hips. Damn, I was doing it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protection,\" I managed. \"I don\u0027t have anything with me and I can bet you don\u0027t, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cursed and the word wasn\u0027t puppies. Our foreheads touched as he sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. I\u0027ve never been irresponsible. Not once. But you make me crazy, Jessie. I see you and all I can think about is being inside of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to prove the point, his penis shifted and pulsed against me. I groaned. His hands clenched at my hips, and I tensed, prepared to get physical if he tried anything again without a condom. He\u0027d never had sex without one, and neither had I, which took care of one worry. Puppies aside. Luckily all he did was lift me out of the water and onto the bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slight breeze played along my wet, naked skin and I shivered. I groped for my towel, but his hand wrapped around my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\" His fingers tightened. He wasn\u0027t hurting me, but I let the towel go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the bank. He stood in the water. His mouth was level with my hips, which gave me an interesting idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lie back,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh, great minds do think alike. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-29.html","bookId":2088,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM"}
