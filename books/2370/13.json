The first to call was Sam Meadows, a coworker and close friend of Mark\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly! My God. I can\u0027t believe it! I-I don\u0027t know what to say, I\u0027m just devastated. Every time I turn around, I expect to see Mark there. Kelly-is there anything I can do for you?\" \"No, thank you, Sam.\" \"Let\u0027s stay in touch. I want to be of help in any way I can? After that came a dozen calls from Mark\u0027s friends, and from models Kelly worked with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill Lerner, the head of the modeling agency, telephoned. He offered his condolences, then said, \"Kelly, I realize this is not the appropriate time, but I think that getting back to work might be good for you right now. Our phone has been ringing off the hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen do you think you\u0027ll be ready to go to work?\" \"When Mark comes back to me.\" And she dropped the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAND NOW THE phone was ringing again. Finally Kelly picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Harris?\" Was she still Mrs. Harris? There was no Mr. Harris anymore, but she would always, always be Mark\u0027s wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said firmly, \"This is Mrs. Mark Harris.\" \"This is Tanner Kingsley\u0027s office.\" The man Mark works-worked for. \"Yes?\" \"Mr. Kingsley would appreciate it if you could come and see him in Manhattan. He would like to have a meeting with you at the company headquarters. Are you free?\" Kelly was free. She had told the agency to cancel all her bookings. But she was surprised. Why does Tanner Kingsley want to see me? \"Yes.\" \"Will it be convenient for you to leave Paris on Friday?\" Nothing would ever be convenient again. \"Friday. All right.\" \"Good. There will be a United Airlines ticket waiting for you at Charles de Gaulle airport.\" He gave her the flight number. \"A car will meet you in New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMARK HAD SPOKEN to Kelly about Tanner Kingsley. Mark had met with him and thought he was a genius and a wonderful man to work for. Perhaps we could share some memories of Mark. The thought cheered her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngel came running in and jumped onto her lap. Kelly hugged her. \"What am I going to do with you while I\u0027m away? Mama would take you with her, but I\u0027m only going to be gone a few days.\" Suddenly, Kelly knew who would take care of the puppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKELLY WALKED DOWN the stairs to the building concierge\u0027s office. Workmen were installing a new elevator, and Kelly winced every time she passed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe superintendent of the building, Philippe Cendre, was a tall, attractive man with a warm personality, and his wife and daughter had always gone out of their way to be helpful. When they had heard the news about Mark, they had been devastated. Mark\u0027s funeral had been held at the Pere-Lachaise Cemetery, and Kelly had invited the Cendre family to attend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly approached Philippe\u0027s apartment door and knocked. When Philippe opened the door, Kelly said, \"I have a favor to ask of you.\" \"Come in. Anything you wish, Madame Harris.\" \"I have to go to New York for three or four days. I wonder if you would mind taking care of Angel while I\u0027m gone.\" \"Mind? Ana Maria and I would love it.\" \"Thank you. I would appreciate it.\" \"And I promise to do everything I can to spoil her.\" Kelly smiled. \"Too late. I\u0027ve already spoiled her.\" \"When do you plan to leave?\" \"Friday.\" \"Very well. I will see to everything. Did I tell you that my daughter has been accepted at the Sorbonne?\" \"No. That\u0027s wonderful. You must be very proud.\" \"I am. She starts in two weeks. We\u0027re all very excited. It\u0027s a dream come true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFRIDAY MORNING KELLY took Angel down to Philippe Cendre\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly handed the concierge some paper bags. \"Here\u0027s Angel\u0027s favorite food and some toys for her to play-\" Philippe stepped back, and behind him Kelly saw a pile of dog toys on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly laughed. \"Angel, you\u0027re in good hands.\" She gave the puppy a final hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-bye, Angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you so much, Philippe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eON THE MORNING Kelly was leaving, Nicole Paradis, the receptionist at the fancy apartment building, was standing at the door to say good-bye. An ebullient gray-haired woman, she was so tiny that when she was seated behind her desk, only the top of her head was visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at Kelly and said, \"We will miss you, madame. Please hurry back to us.\" Kelly took her hand. \"Thank you. I\u0027ll be back soon, Nicole.\" And, minutes later, she was on her way to the airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Charles de Gaulle airport was crowded beyond belief, as always. It was a surrealistic maze of ticket counters, shops, restaurants, stairways, and giant escalators crawling up and down like prehistoric monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kelly arrived, the airport manager escorted her to a private lounge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty-five minutes later, her flight was announced. As Kelly started toward the boarding gate, a woman standing nearby watched her go through the gate. The moment Kelly was out of sight, the woman picked up her cell phone and made a call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKELLY SAT in her airplane seat, thinking about Mark, oblivious to the fact that most of the men and women in the cabin were covertly staring at her. What was Mark doing on the observation deck of the Eiffel Tower at midnight? Who was he going to meet? And why? And the worst question of all-Why would Mark commit suicide? We were so happy together. We loved each other so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t believe he killed himself. Not Mark?not Mark?not Mark. She closed her eyes and let her thoughts drift back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT WAS THEIR first date. She had dressed for the evening in a prim black skirt and a high-necked white blouse so that Mark would not get the idea that she was trying to tempt him in any way. This was just going to be a casual, congenial evening. Kelly found that she was nervous. Because of the unspeakable thing that had happened to her when she was a child, Kelly had not socialized with any men except for business reasons or obligatory charity events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark isn\u0027t really a date, Kelly kept telling herself. He and I are just going to be friends. He can be my escort around town, and there won\u0027t be any romantic complications. Even as she was thinking it, the doorbell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly took a hopeful breath and opened the door. Mark stood there, smiling, holding a box and a paper bag. He was wearing an ill-fitting gray suit, a green shirt, a bright red tie, and brown shoes. Kelly almost laughed aloud. The fact that Mark had no sense of style was somehow endearing. She had known too many men whose egos were involved in how elegant they thought they looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in,\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I\u0027m not late.\" \"No, not at all.\" He was twenty-five minutes early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark handed Kelly the box. \"This is for you.\" It was a five-pound box of chocolates. Over the years Kelly had been offered diamonds and furs and penthouses, but never chocolates. Exactly what every model needs, she thought, amused. Kelly smiled. \"Thank you.\" Mark held out the bag. \"And these are treats for Angel.\" As if on cue, Angel came bouncing into the room and ran up to Mark, her tail wagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark picked Angel up and petted her. \"She remembers me.\" \"I really want to thank you for her,\" Kelly said. \"She\u0027s a wonderful companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never had one before.\" Mark looked at Kelly, and his eyes said it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE EVENING WENT unexpectedly well. Mark was a charming companion, and Kelly was touched by how obviously thrilled he was to be with her. He was intelligent and easy to talk to, and the time went by more quickly than Kelly had anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the evening, Mark said, \"I hope we can do this again.\" \"Yes. I would like that.\" \"What\u0027s your favorite thing to do, Kelly?\" \"I enjoy soccer games. Do you like soccer?\" A blank look came over Mark\u0027s face. \"Oh-er-yes. I-I love it.\" He\u0027s such a poor liar, Kelly thought. A mischievous idea came into her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a championship game Saturday night. Would you like to go?\" Mark swallowed and said weakly, \"Sure. Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN THE EVENING was over and they arrived back at Kelly\u0027s apartment building, Kelly found herself tensing. This was always the moment for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about a good-night kiss??\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy don\u0027t I come in for a bit, and we\u0027ll have a nightcap?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t want to spend the night alone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFighting off the pawing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they reached Kelly\u0027s door, Mark looked at her and said, \"Do you know what I first noticed about you, Kelly?\" Kelly held her breath. Here it comes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have a great ass?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love your boobs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d like to have your long legs wrapped around my neck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Kelly said icily. \"What did you first notice?\" \"The pain in your eyes.\" And before she could reply, Mark said, \"Good night.\" And Kelly watched him leave. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-13.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
