He wasn’t scaring me and I wasn’t going to get anything more out of him. I didn’t need him anymore, not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he could get in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put him out with a good, clean shot to the jaw. It landed right and I got vibrations all the way up my arm to the shoulder. He sagged and went limp. I lowered him back into the chair, folded his hands in his lap for laughs. Then I opened the door and slipped through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secretary was sitting in her swivel chair. I winked at her and she smiled her metallic smile at me. I wanted to reach over and pinch the place where her sweater bulged. I suppressed the impulse. I had enough problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE WAS A DRUGSTORE on the corner of Madison and 36th with a raft of phone booths. I ducked into an empty one, switched on the overhead fan, and dialed Centre Street. I asked the cop who answered to give me Jerry Gunther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m in a rush,” I told him. “Just want some fast information. Know anything about a man named Abe Zucker?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know the name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a second. Lemme think…Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s an old-timer,” Jerry said. “Was mixed up in everything big. Junk, numbers, women. He was one of the boys who managed to stay out of the papers, not just out of jail. But he was big.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s he doing now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing he talks about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing at all,” Jerry said. “He doesn’t have to, Ed. He did what they’ve all been doing, made the money illegally and then sank it into legitimate business. He owns a piece of three hotels in Miami Beach and a couple of points in one of the big Vegas casinos. Plus God knows what else. I remember him now, Ed. I saw him once years ago—we had him up on the carpet for something. But that’s ancient history now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he in New York?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who knows, Ed. He’s clean and nobody cares about him anymore. I think he’s got a big place somewhere in Jersey. I wouldn’t swear to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That all you wanted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the time being,” I said. “I may have something for you later on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got off the phone, went to the counter, and picked up a couple of dollars worth of small change and a fresh pouch of tobacco. I had to wait for a booth—some fat old lady ducked into mine and she had enough dimes in front of her to talk all day and all night. Another booth emptied and I grabbed it. I dropped a fortune in silver into the phone and called the Continental agency in Cleveland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a few minutes before I was connected with the op I’d talked to before. I didn’t remember his name, and that had slowed things down. But I managed to get him on the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“London,” I said. “You did a job for me yesterday. Remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember, Mr. London.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. I want the same thing but in depth. I want you to check out Jack Blake and his magic shop. Find out what kind of business the shop was doing, what scale Blake was living on, if he was spending more than he was earning, everything. Run a line on his daughter. Find out what you can about her. Not just a surface job. The works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When do you want it, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yesterday,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what you mean.” I checked my watch—it was a shade past noon. “When can you have it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hard to say. Two hours, three hours, four hours—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me an outside time. I don’t know where I’ll be. I want to be able to call you and find out what you’ve got.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought a moment. “Call between five and six,” he said. “We’ll have the works by then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat left me with five or six hours to kill. I didn’t want to go back to my apartment. A man’s home is his castle, but mine might very well be under siege by now. Carr was undoubtedly conscious and undoubtedly sending up a hue and cry, shrieking mightily for the bloody scalp of some private eye named London. For the next five or six hours I wanted to get away from the world. My own place seemed like a ridiculous place to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI settled on a movie. I sat in the balcony of a 42nd Street movie house, puffed on my pipe, munched popcorn, and watched Ma Barker’s Killer Brood and Baby Face Nelson. I saw both pictures twice, and if you think that’s a pleasant way to spend an afternoon, it’s only because you’ve never tried it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was five when I left the show. I had a quick dinner at a cafeteria and used their phone to make another call to Cleveland. My op was on hand and he told me everything I wanted to know. I listened quietly, thoughtfully. At the end he said he would send me a bill and I told him that was fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing was fine, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed in the phone booth, sitting, thinking. I made two more calls, local ones. I talked a little, listened a little, hung up. I went on sitting in that booth until a stern-faced man came over and rapped on the door. I apologized to him and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was dying outside, dropping behind the Jersey mud flats. The air was still too warm. I walked for a block or two, checking now and then to see if anybody was following me. Nobody was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the way things can sneak up behind you from out of nowhere and slip you a rabbit punch. I thought about the way you can walk around wearing blinders, and then you can take the blinders off and still not believe what you see. But you see it, and sooner or later it sinks in and your world falls apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hailed a cab and took a ride to a certain posh apartment house. I walked past a doorman, into an elevator. I rode up in silence. I got out and went to a door. I stood in front of it for a long time. Finally, I rang…I waited…I rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never looked better. Even nude, with a white sheet under that flawless full-blown body and a pillow beneath that ash blond head, she had never looked better wearing a skirt and sweater. She flowed toward me like a hot river and she came into my arms and stayed there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let her kiss me. I ran my hands over her back, felt the firmness of her body, and I waited for something to happen inside me, something I was afraid of: a shadow of response, a flicker of desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt never came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Ed,” she was saying. “I was so worried. You didn’t call me all day. I was afraid. I thought something had happened to you; I didn’t know what to think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tried calling you. You weren’t at your apartment. I must have called you a dozen times but you weren’t there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I wasn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned coy, twisting in my arms and looking up at me. “You weren’t with another girl, were you? I’ll scratch her eyes out, Ed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she turned kittenish again, burrowing her head in my chest and making little sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands on her shoulders. I pushed, gently, easing her away. She looked at me, a question in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey must have heard the slap in Canarsie. I hit her that hard, open-palmed, my hand against the side of her face. She stumbled and went down, started to get up, tripped, fell, then finally scrambled to her feet again. Her eyes said she didn’t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You dirty little liar,” I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ed—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up. I know the whole bit now, Rhona. All of it, from top to bottom. I got some of it here and some of it there and figured out the rest myself. It didn’t take too much thinking on my part. It was all there. All I had to do was look for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ed, for heaven’s sake—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit down.” She looked at me, thought it over, plopped down on the orange couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack Blake,” I said, pacing like a caged tiger. “He was a card sharp, all right. And he stopped being a card sharp. Not to go straight, though. Just to change his line of work. He stopped cheating at cards but he found other ways to cheat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He opened a magic shop. It was a front, nothing more. I had a detective agency in Cleveland check the place out. Oh, the store was completely open and aboveboard, all right. Only the place ran at one hell of a loss. Blake never made a nickel out of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted a drink. Courvoisier, a lot of it, straight and in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So the shop lost money,” I continued, “and Blake lived high off the hog. A big house out in Shaker Heights. Trips to Vegas and Hawaii. You don’t pull that kind of money out of a successful magic shop, let alone a losing proposition like the one on Euclid Avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So Blake had another source of income. It’s not hard to figure out what it was, Rhona. The record of deposits to Jack Blake’s checking account makes it obvious. The two of you were working a string of blackmail dodges. You were on a dozen different payrolls for anywhere from a hundred to five hundred bucks a month. It was a sweet little setup. And you weren’t his daughter, either. That was another little lie, wasn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t be serious—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hell I can’t. Jack Blake was never married. He never had a wife and he never had a kid. You were his mistress and his partner. His private whore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to get up. She saw my eyes, and she must have guessed what I would do to her the minute she got to her feet. So she stayed where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His private whore.” I liked the sound of it. “And his partner. The two of you were doing fine. Then you got hold of something that made all the little swindles look like small potatoes in comparison. You latched on to the prize pigeon of them all. You hooked a man named Abe Zucker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath. “Five months ago Miltie Klugsman got in touch with Blake and told him he had the goods on Zucker. Zucker’s been straight for years so he must have had something big on him, a rap the statute of limitations wouldn’t cover. Something like murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t much matter what it was. It was too big for Klugsman and he was scared to work it on his own. He knew Blake was doing a land-office business in blackmail. They worked out a split. Klugsman couldn’t have done too well with it—his widow isn’t exactly living in style. But that’s how it went. Klugsman held on to the evidence and Blake set up the blackmail gambit and Zucker paid. There was a healthy deposit to your father’s—pardon me, your keeper’s account five months ago. The first payment from Zucker was something like ten thousand dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zucker must have thought it was a one-shot deal. When it happened a second time he figured out that it would be cheaper to arrange an accident for Blake than to pay him that kind of money for any length of time. And that was the end of Jack Blake, at least as far as this world is concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You told that part of it straight enough, Rhona. A few thugs went to Cleveland and beat Jack Blake to death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another deep breath and looked at her, all prim and proper on the bright orange couch, all schoolgirl-lovely in green sweater and black skirt, and I tried to make myself believe it. It was true, all of it. But it still seemed impossible. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-night-stands-and-lost-weekends/page-41.html","bookId":2318,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM"}
