{"id":83719,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You said he wanted to meet me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he did. He still does. But things between us have changed while you\u0027ve been away. We\u0027ve reconnected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReconnected. That translates into one thing: she\u0027s sleeping with him again and judging from that stupid grin on her face, she couldn\u0027t be happier about it. \"What about his wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see that she doesn\u0027t care much for me asking about Mrs. Beckett. \"He doesn\u0027t love her. He might have very early in their marriage, but that was a lifetime ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s why he\u0027s married to her instead of you. \"And I guess he always loved us and it was agony pretending we didn\u0027t exist for the past twenty-three years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m being a total bitch and I should stop. I\u0027m certain I\u0027d be as big a fool if Jack Henry showed up in my life years down the road. It probably wouldn\u0027t matter to me if he was married. I\u0027m sure I\u0027d crawl into his bed if he asked me to. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mom. That was a terrible thing for me to say. I\u0027m really happy for you. I hope he gives you everything you\u0027ve wanted all these years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur conversation is one-sided. I listen to her go on and on about my father, as though she\u0027s my best friend from high school talking about her boyfriend. It\u0027s uncomfortable. I don\u0027t want to hear about my mom doing a married man—or any man at all—even if he is my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never once mentions Australia, so I don\u0027t, either. This is just another fine example of the way my mom puts herself before everyone—except him. He will always come first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed her to act like a mother today—to listen and guide me—but as usual, I\u0027m playing the role of her confidante. And it hurts. \"You know what, Mom? I\u0027m really exhausted after my flight. Can you take me to my apartment and we\u0027ll talk about this later?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she doesn\u0027t wait until later to talk about him. She continues telling me things I don\u0027t want to know about their relationship and I stare out the window trying to drown out the things she\u0027s saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone alerts me to a text message. Addison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Make it home ok?*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly thumb a reply as I ignore the things my mom is saying about my dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*On way to apt now*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s almost no delay in Addison\u0027s response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Love U. Call if U need anything.*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I should\u0027ve gone home with her instead of coming back to Nashville. I\u0027m definitely rethinking that decision as Jolie goes on and on about her affair with Jake Beckett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*U2 \u0026amp; I will. But I\u0027m ok.*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t resist adding that last part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom helps me with my luggage and I immediately notice how stagnant the apartment smells. I\u0027ll need to open windows tomorrow and air the place out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, Jolie doesn\u0027t stick around. I\u0027ve heard way more than I want to about her and my sperm donor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut the door after she leaves and the clicking sound of the deadbolt confirms I\u0027m completely alone. I lean against the door and look around. Nothing has changed. The brown leather sofa is right where we left it pushed against the wall. The beige carpet still looks freshly vacuumed. But one thing has changed—I\u0027m not the same person I was when I was here last. I had no idea what it was to desperately love or to be devastatingly hurt. Now, I know both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know how long I stand there with my back pressed against the front door. It could\u0027ve been seconds, or maybe hours. Elements of time are indistinguishable in the dark place I\u0027ve entered without Jack Henry in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point, I become a pathetic pile on the floor, my cheek pressed against the cold ceramic tile. I squeeze the tip of my nose because it\u0027s freezing and I shiver against the cold March wind blowing through the open space at the bottom of the doorjamb. I sit up to look out the window. It\u0027s getting dark, so it\u0027s only going to get colder as the sun goes down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI switch on the heat but decide the best way to warm up is a shower. I turn the water to full-blast hot and the bathroom quickly fills with steam. I adjust the temperature and step under the warmth pelting down. It feels good against my weary body but does nothing to ease my mind. All I can think about is each and every time Jack Henry was in the shower with me. I remember the way he made me feel when he worshipped my body. I\u0027m desperate to feel that way again but I never will. And I don\u0027t know how I\u0027ll deal with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finish showering, I dress in one of Jack Henry\u0027s T-shirts that I stole—the one he was wearing before we went to bed together for the last time. I bring it to my nose and inhale deeply. I fall into bed because exhaustion has become my master. I will spend the night alone for the first time in more than two months. It\u0027s a strange feeling, and I don\u0027t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Henry would\u0027ve already gone to bed without me for the first time. I can\u0027t keep myself from wondering if he missed me as he lay next to my empty spot. Did he wake and reach for me before he remembered I was no longer there? I wish I knew if he lost any sleep over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the tears coming and I can do nothing to hold them back. I\u0027m alone so there\u0027s no reason to try. A scream threatens to burst from my throat. I bury a pillow over my face to muffle it because I don\u0027t want to alarm the neighbors. I kick my legs against my mattress like an irate toddler. I\u0027d be admitted to the loony bin if anyone were to witness my mad fit. But it needs to come out. I\u0027m in so much agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could\u0027ve asked me to stay but he didn\u0027t. I told him I loved him and he couldn\u0027t say it back. That\u0027s because it would\u0027ve been a lie, and pretending is one thing we didn\u0027t do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help myself. It\u0027s one lie I wouldn\u0027t have minded at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack McLaclan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo brunettes. I can never see another one without thinking of her. Laurelyn has ruined all of them for me. Forever. And she\u0027s ruined me as well. That\u0027s why I\u0027m drunk off my arse in this hotel bar. I have to be if I\u0027m going to do the only thing that might make losing her less painful. Find number fourteen, take her upstairs, and fuck her until I drive Laurelyn out of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was plastered five shots ago, so now I\u0027m on shot number oblivion. I toss it back and slam the glass on the counter. \"Another.\" The bartender gives me a sideways glance as he\u0027s deciding if he\u0027ll cut me off, so I reach into my wallet and drop a fat bill for him. \"I said another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around on the barstool to begin my search. I have the hotel room. All I need now is a woman who doesn\u0027t recognize me. Number fourteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan the room like I always do and begin by taking inventory. I see a few decent-looking blonds, maybe a redhead or two, but none of them hold a candle to her. No one ever will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve lost the only thing that ever made me feel alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thoughts drift to the place in my head where only Laurelyn resides, so I don\u0027t notice when someone takes the seat next to me. I\u0027m brought out of my trance when I hear her voice. \"Waiting on someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to the voice\u0027s owner and see an attractive blond with chin-length hair set in loose curls, her bright blue eyes displaying no recognition of who I am. Probably midthirties. Maybe closer to forty and dressed like a professional in a sheath dress and fitted jacket. She\u0027s just my usual type. Before Laurelyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"No one in particular. Just here to find a little company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles. \"Me too. Maybe we can keep each other company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I\u0027m drunk, I have no reason to think I\u0027m going to put this out there in an appealing manner. I don\u0027t know. Maybe I want to fuck it up so she\u0027ll blow me off. \"I\u0027m not your normal kind of company. I have very specific requirements for the women I date. The first of which is that I won\u0027t tell you my real name and I don\u0027t want to know yours. Honestly, I really only want to fuck and have a little fun for a few weeks and then I never want to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait for the slap or for her to get up and leave, but neither happens. \"My, my. Aren\u0027t we a direct one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say what\u0027s on my mind because I don\u0027t have time for silly games.\" Isn\u0027t that what I told Laurelyn after she asked me if I was missing my filter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? Really? She\u0027s saying okay to that shit? \"You\u0027re up for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. You\u0027re hot and I need a distraction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A distraction from what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man I love.\" She glances down at her drink as she sloshes it around. \"He doesn\u0027t feel the same. What\u0027s your deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t talk about the one I love with another woman, especially not one I\u0027m about to have meaningless sex with. Even I know that\u0027s not right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No deal. I\u0027m just not into commitment or contact after I\u0027m finished with a woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I respect your honesty.\" She swallows the last of her girly drink. \"You want to go upstairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\" I throw back my shot and get up from the stool. I\u0027m a little unstable so she reaches out to steady me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI work to get myself straight so I don\u0027t blow this because it\u0027s what I need. It\u0027s what I have to do to get her out of my mind. \"Yeah. I\u0027m good. We don\u0027t have to stop for a room. I\u0027ve already got one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ride the elevator to the third floor. I\u0027m shocked I\u0027m able to find the room because I\u0027m so wasted. She has to take the keycard to open the door because I\u0027m too uncoordinated to slide it in and pull it out. Let\u0027s hope that doesn\u0027t apply to my cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe go into the room together and I play tag with the walls before falling backward onto the bed. I close my eyes for what feels like a second and when I open them again, the nameless blond has stripped down to her knickers and bra and is straddling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches behind to unfasten her bra and then takes my hands and puts them on her breasts. They look good, but even drunk, I still know they\u0027re fake because they don\u0027t feel anything like Laurelyn\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! I can\u0027t even get her out of my head when I have two palms full of tits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans down to kiss me and I turn my head so that her mouth lands on my jaw. She makes no haste in trailing kisses down my neck. I shut my eyes because I don\u0027t want to look at her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-2.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
