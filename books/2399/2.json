They didn’t even know what I was talking about!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help but explode into laughter. Char follows suit, and then Mads, and the three of us are suddenly a giggling mess. Laurel stands above us looking forlorn. She turns to Thayer with that doe-eyed expression she always has for him. Laurel has had a crush on Thayer forever. “They tricked me,” she whines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer’s playful, flirty expression shifts into one of annoyance. He shakes his head. “You guys are horrible. When are you going to grow up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says it loudly, so that the whole pool can hear. A gasp doesn’t rise up in the crowd, but there might as well be one. Everyone turns and stares. Mads blinks as if he’s slapped her. Charlotte raises her eyebrows. I try my hardest not to alter my expression, but it’s almost impossible. Before any of us can say anything, Thayer waves his hand dismissively, links his arm through Laurel’s, and stalks off toward the diving board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, everyone at the pool goes back to what they were doing. But neither I nor my friends can speak. It’s one thing for me to put the other two down, and occasionally, when she’s feeling feisty, Char has even gotten some good jabs in at me that I’ve let slide. But someone’s little brother dissing us? Not cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Charlotte sets down her glass. “What is up with your brother, Mads?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline shakes her head. “He was voted MVP at soccer camp. I guess he thinks he’s something now.” She makes a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is something else, all right,” I murmur. I try to sound annoyed—which I am, of course. But I feel some other things, too. Things I don’t want to admit to myself. It’s probably the sun. Maybe someone spiked my drink. But as I watch Thayer sauntering off with Laurel, grinning lazily at every girl in his path, I feel the distinct rumblings of an emotion that hasn’t hit me in a long, long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJealousy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUP FOR A CHALLENGE, DOWN FOR THE DEED\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s the thing about me and parties: Even the ones I don’t want to go to I have to look smoking hot for. As in, the hottest girl there—that’s how I keep my status, after all. But on Sunday, as Mads and I scour the racks at Jolie, our favorite boutique, the pickings are so slim I’m considering shoplifting a Missoni scarf or two in protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place is packed, too, so maybe that has something to do with it. All three of us are frustrated—Madeline’s on her second walk-through of the floor, and Charlotte’s stuck in the dressing room wrestling with the slit sleeves on a yellow silk Elizabeth and James minidress. I eye a row of candy-colored Butter nail polish bottles on the glass-top display table. The turquoise has possibilities. A gawky brunette in a lime-green sundress and gladiator sandals looks like she’s considering approaching the display, but a glare from me sends her back toward the wall of belts instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI deftly sweep the turquoise polish from the table into my gray Miu Miu satchel. Done and done. No one even looked my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh,” Madeline groans from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to face her as though nothing is amiss. “What is it?” I ask, scanning the store for something that would go nicely with my new acquisition. Rows of pastel tops sway on hanging racks like wearable meringue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thayer,” Madeline says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffen slightly. “What’d baby brother do now?” I ask, sifting idly through a bunch of bangle bracelets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He just texted to ask if I was going to Nisha’s party,” Madeline says, in a horrified voice that suggests he’d just texted to ask her if she was planning to shave her head. “Can you believe him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChar, who has just emerged from the dressing room with the yellow dress slung over her arm, gapes at us. “But he’s only a sophomore!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously.” Madeline shakes her head at her phone as if Thayer can see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, he asked if you were going as if you hadn’t already been invited?” I sputter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline nods. “As if he’s the cool one, not me.” Then she points at a bracelet I’ve picked up from the table. “I love that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s yours.” I wink at her, and she widens her eyes back, grinning, knowing what I’m going to do. But my mind isn’t really on the five-finger discount. It’s on Thayer 2.0. Who is this guy? Unbidden, the image of his chiseled abs and defined calves floats in my mind. I force myself to push it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He definitely thinks he’s the man since coming back from soccer camp, huh?” I say. “Like he’s the only guy who’s ever played a sport before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline rolls her eyes. “Thayer had some kind of crazy transformation while he was away. Suddenly he thinks he’s a sex god or something. Apparently he had a serious girlfriend while he was there. She was super into him, and now she won’t stop calling. He claims she’s stalking him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” Charlotte says as she sashays toward the register. “I’m sure he doesn’t mind being stalked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, but I’m not so sure about that myself. Thayer used to be so quiet—at least, that’s what I thought of him. But it’s starting to seem like I had the wrong idea about Thayer all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Charlotte winds around the racks, she plucks up a La Perla bra-and-panties set and adds it to her pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“La Perla?” The corners of my mouth twitch. “Planning a hot night with Garrett?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte’s cheeks flare a bright pink, but she doesn’t deny it. As the salesclerk rings up the purchase, I slide the bracelet up my sleeve, easy as that. Then I look at Madeline. “So Thayer isn’t into Stalker Girl, then?” I try to sound nonchalant, like I don’t really care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline leans against the counter. “I don’t know what their deal was this summer, but I definitely don’t think he’s into her anymore,” she says, eyeing me. “Honestly? I think he might have a crush on you, Sutton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel an unexpected little zing in my stomach. Then I freeze, trying to suppress my reaction. “Aw, how cute,” I say teasingly. “But Sutton Mercer doesn’t do younger guys. Thayer should know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends nod and turn away, but my heart is pounding. Yes, I’ve known Thayer liked me before, but suddenly it feels different. Only, am I insane? Thayer might be hot now, but … he’s still Thayer. Madeline’s younger brother. Laurel’s best friend. Quiet. Sensitive. The opposite of me. Thayer’s the guy who’s spent hours at our house on weekends, playing cards—cards!—with Laurel the Lame, the guy who sneaks over late nights to hang out in our backyard shed that we’d made over into a quasi-clubhouse. He’s a kid. Not in my league.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, a hazy memory flits through my mind: last summer, Thayer and Laurel passed through the kitchen while I sat at our round oak table, thumbing my iPad. I barely glanced up at them as Laurel opened the refrigerator and pulled out a tall glass pitcher of iced tea. But that didn’t stop her from approaching me brightly. Her ponytail swung like the pendulum of a clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want some?” she offered, hopeful and perky. I barely mumbled an acknowledgment, ignoring her hurt expression. I felt Thayer watching me, but it just annoyed me back then. When I looked up, his hazel eyes were trained on me, as though he could see what I was thinking and was disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitched, and he turned away silently. I’d glared at him as he and Laurel went outside toward the clubhouse, wondering what that look had been for. Did he think I needed to be nicer or something? Who was he to tell me what to do? And why, most of all, did I care what he thought of me? But the look stuck with me for days. Maybe Thayer had been challenging my authority for a while now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the register opening brings me back to Jolie. I shrug, brushing the moment off me like a used towel. The salesclerk hands Charlotte her shopping bag, crisp and sharply edged. Charlotte smiles and we make our way toward the exit. Suddenly, she stops in her tracks, a slow grin spreading across her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys, I have the best idea,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline and I look at her, and she leans in conspiratorially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if we prank Thayer?” Her eyes gleam. “For the Lying Game.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline’s mouth turns up at the corners, amused. “How?” she asks, waving her hand in an I’m listening gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte runs her free hand through her auburn waves. “So, Sutton would never go for Thayer in a million years, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” I say quickly. Maybe too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, what if we make it seem like she likes him? Sutton pretends that she’s totally into him, and then when he falls on his knees professing undying love—preferably in a highly public place—we all pop out and surprise him, telling him it was a huge joke!” She practically bounces on her heels from excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline bites her lip, contemplating. “It would definitely take him down a few pegs,” she agrees. “Which he deserves, especially after calling us out like that at the pool.” Her eyes light up as she warms to the plan. “I like it. But what about you, Sutton? Do you want to do it? Do you think you could reel Thayer in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arch an eyebrow at her. “Who do you think you’re talking to?” It’s a silly question. Reeling unsuspecting guys in is Lying Game 101. And I’m the best at it. “But, I mean, he is your brother,” I continue, considering. “Are you sure you want to crush him so badly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline puts her hands on her narrow hips. “Look, you don’t need to demolish him two hundred percent or anything like that, but … yeah. He has it coming. You saw how cocky he’s gotten lately. And it’s not just annoying me—it’s driving my father crazy, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes darken, and she turns away. Char and I exchange a look. We all know about Mr. Vega’s temper, which seems to flare up for the stupidest reasons. I wouldn’t want to get on that man’s bad side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe step through the exit of the shop into the blazing heat of August in Tucson. I raise my arm and offer the salesclerk a wave, bangle falling down my sleeve and dancing on my wrist. She smiles back, preoccupied, her dirty blond hair falling in a shiny curtain over her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling triumphant, I turn to the girls. “I’m in,” I decide. “I’m always down for a challenge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFAIR PLAY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, my two friends and I walk the grounds of the annual Pima County Summer Fair on the west side of town. Mosquitoes, plentiful because of this summer’s particularly wet monsoon season, flit around us, and fire-flies flicker. The greasy smell of funnel cake clings to our clothes and makes our mouths water, even though we wouldn’t dare order one. As the pirate-ship ride to our left gets going, the passengers start to scream excitedly. You’d never get me on that thing. My mom always says county fair rides are held together by bubble gum and duct tape and little else. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-lie-the-lying-game-0/page-2.html","bookId":2399,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:15 AM"}
