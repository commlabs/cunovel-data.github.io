His personal news service had picked up Sullivan\u0027s announcement that he was going into solo practice, and informed him via his computer first thing this morning. Immediately he\u0027d called Voss and Portero. Somehow his brother had got wind and showed up as well. Not that Ellis would contribute anything. Not that Mercer cared. He was too baffled, too pissed to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe it!\" he went on. \"Is the man crazy? Has he suddenly become a crusader? What\u0027s gotten into him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbel Voss cleared his throat. \"An infusion of cash, it appears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quarter mil was deposited to his sim defense fund two days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer was stunned. \"A quarter - how do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoss glanced at the security chief. \"Mr. Portero\u0027s people have been monitoring the fund.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero\u0027s people...Mercer knew Voss didn\u0027t mean the SimGen security department Portero headed.Portero\u0027s people\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- SIRG. No one referred to them by name. They were elsewhere, far off the SimGen campus, and Mercer wasn\u0027t the least bit surprised that SIRG had devoted a small part of its vast resources to keeping an eye on Patrick Sullivan\u0027s activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shivered ever so slightly at the thought of being the object of that cold scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027d give that kind of money to a small-town ambulance chaser?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That boy\u0027s no rube. He was ready and waitin with an injunction when Beacon Ridge tried to trade some of its sims to another club. And he had another ready in record time when we issued that recall on them. He\u0027s anticipated us at every turn. He may be an opportunist, but he\u0027s a smart one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. He got lucky. But where did the money come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cashier\u0027s check,\" Voss said. \"That\u0027s all I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" Mercer said, cracking his knuckles in frustration. \"So we can\u0027t trace it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we can,\" Portero said, speaking for the first time. \"And we did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer stared at the security chief, standing there in his dark suit with his hands tucked behind his back, straight as a board, like some parade ground tin soldier waiting to be inspected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you say so in the first place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer thought he sensed an instant of hesitation in Portero but couldn\u0027t be sure. He doubted this man had an uncertain cell in his body...and yet, he\u0027d seen something flash across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are looking into an unexpected aspect of the situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The purchaser of the cashier\u0027s check was a Ms. Romy Cadman. You may remember the name: She led the OPRR inspection team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer stiffened. \"OPRR? You don\u0027t think - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoss shook his head. \"OPRR\u0027s budget just barely covers its expenses. Even if it had the surplus it wouldn\u0027t jeopardize its funding by getting involved in something like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she independently wealthy?\" Mercer said, feeling his unease growing by the second. \"Where\u0027d she get that kind of money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She lives modestly on a modest income,\" Portero said flatly. \"She purchased the check with cash. That is all we know - so far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quarter of a million in cash. And probably more where that came from. Someone out there wanted Sullivan to succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain that sense of malevolent convergence through which he could almost hear the gears of some giant piece of machinery starting to turn...an engine of destruction. But whose engine? Whose destruction?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like this,\" Mercer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither do my people,\" Portero said. \"We\u0027re going to handle matters from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning what?\" Ellis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer glanced at his brother. Their eyes met. On this they could agree; neither of them was comfortable with the way Portero\u0027s people handled problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning this situation is spinning out of control. Your attempt to stop Sullivan failed. Now it\u0027s our turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now wait a minute,\" Voss said, both chins jiggling as he hauled his bulk out of the chair. \"Wait just one damn minute. Don\u0027t you folks say another word until I\u0027m on the right side of that door. I don\u0027t need to hear this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hustled across the gray carpet and let himself out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the door closed Ellis turned to Portero. \"You\u0027re not planning to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No plans have been finalized, but direct action will be taken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Ellis said, rising. \"I\u0027m not going to sit by while you and your people pull more of your dirty tricks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no choice, I\u0027m afraid,\" Portero said without changing his inflection. \"The matter is out of your hands. Sullivan has proven smarter and more stubborn than anyone anticipated. Even though the chance that his suit will set a precedent is remote, the mere possibility that he might succeed is unacceptable. My people have decided to stop him now, before he uses the courtroom to plant himself in the national consciousness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God!\" Ellis moaned, shutting his eyes. \"Why did we ever become involved with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero didn\u0027t answer. No answer was needed. But here again, for the second time in as many minutes\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- a rare occurrence, to be sure - Mercer could agree with his brother. He wished at times like these that they\u0027d found another way to finance their start-up back in the seventies. But he knew that when he settled down later and was able to regain his perspective, this feeling would pass, and once again he\u0027d appreciate how SimGen never could have achieved its current dominance without SIRG\u0027s help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero said, \"We also intend to learn the source of the Cadman woman\u0027s money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not your concern.\" And again a flash of something in Portero\u0027s ebony eyes, almost like regret this time. \"But we will know.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-23.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
