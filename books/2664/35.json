Isabel was a tigress. Em had been a kitten. The sunset to the sunrise. Opposites in every way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Women survive childbirth daily, Grayson. Women far less spirited than our Isabel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was true, there could be no denying it. But while his mind spoke reason, his heart knew only the unreasonableness of love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I were to lose her,” Gerard said, his tone anguished, “I do not know what would become of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seems to me, you are already well on your way to losing her. Would it not be better to take the risk and chance keeping her, than to do nothing and lose her for certain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe logic of that statement was undeniable. Gerard knew that if he did not bend in this, he would lose Pel. Her distress today had made that abundantly clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Trenton rise and turned to face him. “Before you go, Trenton, may I beg the use of your carriage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No need. Bella took mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” The dead weight of apprehension settled in Gerard’s stomach. Had his fear caused Isabel to forsake everything that belonged to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was hitched and ready in the drive. No, don’t ask. It is a long story, and you had best be off if you hope to make it back to London before sunrise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord and Lady Hammond?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are blissfully unaware of any unpleasantness. With minor effort you can keep it that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding his agreement, Gerard straightened and mentally began the preparations he needed to excuse himself and his wife from the party without arousing undue suspicions. “Thank you, Trenton,” he said gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just fix what has gone awry. I want Bella happy. That is all the thanks I require.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerard judged the distance to the second floor window of his London residence, leaned back, and took aim with a pebble. He waited until he heard the small but satisfying tink, before drawing his arm back and throwing another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky was beginning to lighten, turning the dark charcoal gray to a pale pink. He was reminded of another morning, and another window. But the goal he sought was the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took several hits before he achieved the desired result—the sash lifted and Pel thrust her sleep-mussed head out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing, Grayson?” she asked in that low, throaty tone he adored. “I warn you, I am not in the mood to recite Shakespeare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank God for that,” he said with a hesitant laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, she had vivid remembrances of that morning, too. There was hope in that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an audible sigh she settled into the window seat and arched a brow in silent query. No surprise to Isabel to find a man tossing things to win her attention. The whole of her adult life, men had been trying to gain entry to her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, her body was promised to his bed, for the rest of her life. The pleasure the thought gave him spread rapidly through his body and warmed his blood. Then he chilled just as swiftly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the rising sun revealed her beloved face, he saw that her sherry-colored eyes were sad, and the tip of her nose was red. She had cried herself to sleep by the look of it, and it was entirely his fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isabel.” His voice was a raw plea. “Let me in. It’s cold out here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer wary expression turned to one even more guarded. Leaning farther out the window, her unbound tresses drifted over a shoulder bared by her loosely belted dressing gown. From the soft sway of her full breasts he knew she was naked beneath. The effect that knowledge had on him was as predictable as the sunrise. “Is there some reason you cannot enter?” she asked. “Last I queried, this was your home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not the manse, Pel,” he clarified. “Your heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please. Let me explain. Let me make things right between us. I need to make things right between us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gerard,” she breathed, so softly he barely heard his name drift down upon the chilly morning breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you desperately, Isabel. I cannot live without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand came up and covered trembling lips. He stepped closer to the house, every cell in his body reaching out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I pledge my troth to you, my wife. Not for my needs, as I did before, but for yours. You have given me so much—friendship, laughter, acceptance. You have never judged me or chastised. When I did not know who I was, you cared for me anyway. When I make love to you, I am content and I wish for nothing else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gerard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name, spoken in her broken voice, struck deeply. “Will you let me in?” he implored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to give all that I am to you. Including children, should we be so blessed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was silent for so long he grew dizzy from holding his breath. “I agree to talk. Nothing more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lungs burned. “If you still love me, we can manage the rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer arm extended out to him. “Come up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning on his heel, Gerard ran to the door and then up the stairs, the desperate need to be with his wife riding him hard. But when he entered their rooms, he drew up short. The sight that greeted him was home, despite the tension that crackled between him and Pel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fire lay banked in the marble-framed hearth, ivory satin tented the ceiling, and Isabel stood before the window, her lush curves draped in deep red silk. It was an excellent color for his wife, whose lush flamboyance needed a bold setting. And this room, where they had spent so many hours talking and laughing, was an excellent setting for a new beginning. Here, they would conquer the inner demons that strove to drive them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve missed you,” he said softly. “When you are not beside me, I feel very alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I missed you, too,” she admitted, swallowing hard. “But then, I wonder if I ever really had you. I think, perhaps, Emily still holds a part of you captive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As Pelham holds you captive?” He shrugged out of his great coat, and then his coat, taking his time because he noted how warily she watched him. Turning his head, his gaze met Pelham’s in the portrait. “You and I both made poor choices for ourselves earlier in life, and we are both scarred by them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, perhaps we are each ruined in our own way,” she said wearily, moving to her favorite chaise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I refuse to believe that. There is a reason for everything.” Gerard tossed his waistcoat across the back of a gilded chair and crouched before the fire, stoking it and throwing on more coal until heat began to fill the room. “I’m certain that had I not known Emily, I would not be able to appreciate you as I do. I would not have had the comparison required to recognize how perfect you are for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted softly. “You only thought I was perfect when you assumed I had forsaken motherhood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you,” he continued, ignoring her. “I doubt you would find my uncontrollable passion for you to be so welcome had you not been wooed with calculated seduction by Pelham.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence that greeted him was rife with possibilities. He felt the spark of hope he’d tucked close to his heart expand into a blaze to match the one in the hearth before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood. “However, I think it is time to reduce this marriage of four into a more intimate union of two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to face her, he found her sitting upright on the chaise, her face pale and beautiful, her eyes welling with tears. Her fingers were laced so tightly together they were white, and he went to her, sat at her feet, and warmed her icy hands with his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at me, Pel.” When she met his gaze, he offered a smile. “Let’s make another bargain, shall we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A bargain?” One finely arched brow rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I agree to start anew with you. In every way. I will not burden our love with guilt from the past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Nothing held back, I swear it. In return, you will take down that portrait. You will agree to believe that you are perfection itself. That there is nothing—” His voice broke, forcing him to close his eyes and take a shuddering breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParting the ends of her gown, Gerard nuzzled his cheek against the satin skin of her thigh and breathed in her scent, calming the emotion that overwhelmed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers drifted into his hair, stroking the roots, loving him silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is nothing I would change about you, Isabel,” he whispered, drinking in the sight of the mature beauty and inner strength that made her who she was. Unique and priceless. “Most especially not your age. Only an experienced woman could manage a man as overbearing as I can be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gerard.” She slid down beside him, and pulled him to her breast. There, she held him to her heart. “I suppose I should expect that any time you throw stones at my window, it is a herald to how drastically my life is about to change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you should.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wicked rogue.” Her lips curved against his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, but I am your wicked rogue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” She laughed softly. “That’s true. You are far different from the man I married, but your wickedness is one thing that, thankfully, did not change. You are just exactly the way I want you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved, cradling her spine as he lowered her to the floor. “I want you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabel gazed up at him, her hair a banner of fire, her skin as pale as ivory where it was revealed by the parted edges of her gown. His dark hand brushed aside the intruding material, revealing the full breasts and ripe curves he worshipped. He shoved his hand into his pocket and withdrew the ruby ring he had purchased for her. With shaking fingers, Gerard slipped it into place, kissing the stone before turning her hand and pressing his lips against her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat swept across his skin like a hot breeze, nerve endings tingling to acute awareness, his mouth watering. Bending his head, he licked the softness of one nipple and then the other, parting his lips more fully and drawing her into his mouth. His eyes slid closed, his blood growing sluggish with desire and love, as he drank in her taste with long, deep pulls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes…” she breathed, when he bit gently down on the hardened crest, relishing as always the fierce need he had to devour her whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved languidly, in no rush. Every touch, caress, and murmur was a promise made. To forsake all others. To love one another, trust one another, and leave the past behind. Theirs was a union made for all the wrong reasons, but in the end it was one that could not have been more right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClothing fell away until their skin touched everywhere and he cupped her thigh and opened her, sinking the hard length of his cock into tight hot depths. Joining them more fully than the golden bands they wore ever could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerard lifted his head and watched Isabel’s face as he pumped deep into her. Her soft whimper filled the air, made his balls draw up, made his arms shake as he supported his weight. She tossed her head restlessly, her heels in his back, her nails in his forearms. The fiery skeins of her dark hair were spread across the Aubusson rug, releasing the heady scent that intoxicated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, how he loved this. He doubted he would ever have his fill of the sight of her helpless to her desire or the feel of her cunt so tight and slick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sweet Isabel,” he crooned, freed for the first time from the desperation that had marked their past encounters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gerard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned. His name was a tactile caress when spoken in that throaty voice. Lowering over her, he pressed his mouth to hers, drinking in her gasps as he worked her with his cock in exactly the way she liked, stroking her with long, deep, slow drives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh God!” she gasped, her depths rippling around him, her back arching in the throes of climax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you,” he breathed, his mouth to her ear, his chest pressed to hers. Then he followed her, shuddering, spilling his seed in a rush of longing, giving her the promise of the life they would create together with boundless joy in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met him stroke for stroke, his match in every way. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stranger-i-married-historical-2/page-35.html","bookId":2664,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:22 AM"}
