I sigh, \"It hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls me into his arms, rubbing my butt gently, \"Come on. I\u0027ll give you a butt massage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shove him away, \"No. I can tell you\u0027re all sweaty and red. You didn’t relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs my arm, knowing I hate that and plants a kiss on my lips. I can feel the challenging smile on his lips, \"Come relax with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"That’s not relaxing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs and wraps his arm around me, pulling the horse to the pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna gives me a sad look; she\u0027s talking to Mitch but I can see something is wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up with Anna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"She\u0027s been having cramps all day. She thinks she\u0027s going to lose the baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words trigger something in my mind, \"Bed rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Bed rest. My mom was scared she was losing me; the doctors put her on bed rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns, \"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You get the horse and I\u0027ll get the pregnant, crazy woman into bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swats me on the butt. I growl but it just makes his eyes flash with humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly limping, I make it over to her and point at the house, \"Come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take her hand and pull her inside. She tries to pull back but I don’t relent. My butt is killing me, my legs are exhausted, and I\u0027m moody and hungry. I get to the back rooms and pull her into the one that she sleeps in alone. I close the door and point at the bed, \"Bed rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispers, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Bed rest. My mom was sure she was losing me and the doctors put her on bed rest. You had the infection, you shouldn’t even be able to have babies. You need to stay on bed rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face drops, \"Em, I\u0027ll go nuts in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"You have to choose, baby or sanity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicks her boots off and climbs into the bed. She frowns, \"I need books. That Da Vinci one was good, but I\u0027m out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I\u0027ll get books. You sit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrinkles her nose, \"How long do I have to stay in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"I don’t know. I guess until you feel normal again. Lay back so then the baby can\u0027t fall out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs and curls up on the bed. I can see she\u0027s exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kick my boots off too and climb onto the bed with her. She grimaces, \"You smell like horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin, \"Yeah, well I had a shower yesterday at Star\u0027s, so I should smell like the lavender shampoo they\u0027re making there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes bug open, \"The hot water is back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moans in a wheezy whisper, \"Oh, man. I need a hot shower. I made Nan heat me water on the fire and pour it on me, but it wasn’t the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes, \"It was amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispers against my face, \"You ever miss the breeder farm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens. I glance back to see Sarah. I laugh, \"Speaking of missing the breeder farms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah kicks her shoes off and climbs on the bed with us. \"Will said you were back.\" She curls in between me and Anna. \"I don’t miss the farms, I miss the cook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and close my eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t dream, I sleep completely peacefully. When I wake, I\u0027m next to Will. I open my eyes to see him staring at me. He must have moved me in the night. He runs a hand down my cheek. I smile and close my eyes again. He wraps an arm around me, pulling me into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You smell good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moan, \"Mmmm, I had a shower at Star\u0027s. She knew Bernie had kept a bunch of solar panel stuff in the metal bunker under the house. The H.E.M.P. didn’t ruin it. She had to get something called an inverter fixed and then have it all hooked up. I didn’t think she\u0027d be able to do it, but she did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have power?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes a whistle sound, \"That’s dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my eyes, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"Baby, we never want to have more than anyone else. We don’t want to have the things they don’t. If we have just enough to live, then no one is going to come and attack us and try to take it. People see power and then they want to rule.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s going to get sheriffs and law enforcement. Maybe if they have some hangings or shootings, the bad people will stay away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"Not smart. Marshall was smart, how he did it. The camp and retreat were based entirely upon the group being a council and us only ever having what we needed. We were never the target of bandits or raids. We had a good population but not too much stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel myself nodding off again, \"It\u0027s sad we can\u0027t ever have anything ever again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sleep through the night, waking to Leo shifting on the bed. Will is wrapped around me totally and Leo is on my feet. I wrestle out from under them both and climb out of bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy legs are better and my butt doesn’t hurt anymore. There is definitely a perk to being me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull on my boots and Will\u0027s long-sleeve shirt. It smells like him, his stink that, for whatever reason, I like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stroll out into the kitchen. Nan smiles, \"Hey, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes dart to the right, \"They caught someone on the property this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the door and think about what Will and I had talked about. I strap my holsters to my thighs and walk out of the house, \"Just one person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch gives me a look from across the gravel yard. I see a young man with long, dark hair. His dirty face is thin and tired looking. When he sees me, his eyes get trapped, staring at the guns on my legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sling my bow and quiver over my shoulder and crunch my way to where Mitch is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Found us a friend in the woods. The guards caught him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the dark eyes of the young man and nod, \"Execute him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch\u0027s jaw drops, \"He could help around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"This isn’t a work camp; we don’t keep slaves.\" I walk to the guy, wiping my hand down the dirt on his face, \"This dirt was rubbed on. I bet he followed us yesterday. He\u0027s a scout.\" I lift his lip, discovering perfect, white teeth. I give Mitch a look, \"Take him behind the barn. I\u0027ll execute him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch scowls, \"Em, you don’t want to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab the arm of the guy from Mitch, \"I\u0027ll do it myself then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy\u0027s mouth opens, \"Fine, fine. She\u0027s right. I\u0027m a scout. We fled from the city; we knew where the retreat was. It was on a map. Please, I\u0027m a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrow, \"You’re twenty—how could you be a doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes search mine for compassion. I know he\u0027s going to come up empty. He flinches at my cold stare, \"I was apprenticing under some of the doctors in the city. I was learning to be a breeder doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes are crystal clear, like mine and Star\u0027s, \"You\u0027re a Gen baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrow for a second but he doesn’t say anything. His lips press together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach up, grabbing his shirt, \"ARE YOU?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"YES!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerk him back and release him, \"Shit.\" I look at Mitch, \"He\u0027s my brother, but he\u0027s from the city. Send scouts into the woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy’s eyes get nervous when I say it. He makes a face and then smiles, \"You\u0027re Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab his thick arm and drag him to the barn and point at the bunker in the floor, giving Mitch a deadly look, \"Open that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch gives me a look but he does it. I push my new brother down into the hole and slam the lip. His green-blue eyes are the last thing I see of his face. I click the latch on the bunker and run my hands over my face, \"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic is filling me. My father might be in the woods, or at Bernie\u0027s. Of course he would know where the retreat was and where Bernie lived. I slap my forehead, \"Stupid, stupid, stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch grabs my arm, \"Em, chill out. It\u0027s one guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No. The city burned; they have nowhere to go. They’ve never been out here in the wild. They know where we\u0027ve set up camp and villages. They had a room filled with maps. They know where we live.\" I can hear the panic in my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point down at the lid covered in hay, \"That is not a scout—it\u0027s a test. Test to see how fast we respond, how we act, and what kind of place we are, so they know what they need to take this from us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch puts his hands on my arms, \"Calm down. Your crazy is showing. This is one guy, one doctor. You could beat him up, he doesn’t stand a chance here. Stay calm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and nod, \"Okay. But I want pairs into the woods, finding them. I know there are more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Okay. Me, you, and Leo will be one pair, okay? We\u0027ll do the perimeter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go to whistle for him but Will opens the kitchen door, giving me and Mitch a weird look. Leo leaves the kitchen, sauntering to me. He sniffs the door to the bunker and growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step out of Mitch\u0027s arms and point at the bunker door, \"A scout from the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill closes his eyes, \"Shit.\" He points to the field, \"We need scouting parties out. I want pairs to do a five-mile hike. Me, Em, and Leo will take one route. Mitch…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him off, \"Will, me and Mitch are going together. You need to rest; me and him can run this perimeter with Leo fast. You need to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes dart between me and Mitch. He nods and walks back into the house, slamming the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch sighs, \"He thinks shit is going on, doesn’t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"That’s not so important right now. Let\u0027s do this and I\u0027ll talk to him afterwards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch laughs, \"This is your first boyfriend isn’t it? Go talk to him now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to. I don’t want to see the angry look on his face, or even worse, the pathetic one. I hate that look. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-29.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
