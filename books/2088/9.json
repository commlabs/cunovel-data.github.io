{"id":89597,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eI deposited Mandenauer at the Eagle\u0027s Nest. \"Let us know if you need anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned in through the passenger window and studied me more closely than I liked. \"What if I need an assistant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pulse quickened at the thought of hunting the wolf or wolves, but I knew better than to appear eager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the quickest way to lose what I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it up with Clyde.\" I shifted into reverse and Mandenauer withdrew his head from the window before he lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was setting as I ambled back toward town. We\u0027d been in the woods longer than I\u0027d thought, which was usually the case. Hours ceased to have meaning when you were walking through the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps that was why I spent so much time there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my watch, half-expecting the thing to have stopped when I entered the trees near Cadotte\u0027s cottage. Of course it hadn\u0027t. Time had marched on even as I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach rumbled. I thought about what I might have in my refrigerator at home, and knew it was the usual. Squat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reached the Sportsman\u0027s Bar and Grill, I turned off the highway and went inside. A cheeseburger and soda later I went home. Darkness had descended completely while I was eating. I had three hours before my shift started at eleven. I could have savored another cola in the Sportsman, which was what I usually did when I ate there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut tonight the patrons, as well as the owner, the bartender, and the waitresses, had been full of questions about what was rotten in Miniwa. I\u0027d answered them as best I could without really telling them anything they didn\u0027t already know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were nervous, though, and they made me nervous. So I left after one long, tall glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNights like these brought home to me the pathetic nature of my life. I had no friends but Zee, and I\u0027d see her soon enough. No boyfriend -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;no kidding. No family but my mother, -who was in Arizona. Thank God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost days I was fine with how things had turned out. I had the job I\u0027d always wanted in a town I\u0027d always loved. I had a decent apartment and the promise of a better future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d bought 250 acres just outside of Miniwa where I planned to build a home someday. Right now I kept it free of a trophy buck every fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf life wasn\u0027t perfect, it certainly didn\u0027t suck. But there were times I just felt... lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could drive out to my land and do laps in my private pond. Instead of jogging, as many of my counterparts - excluding Clyde -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;did to keep in shape, I chose to swim. A lot less stress on the knees and a great way to increase upper body strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m all for equality in the workplace, but you can\u0027t argue with nature. Men had more upper body strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like it, but moaning wouldn\u0027t change anything. More reps in the pond would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the Crown Victoria into my parking space. Since one of the officer benefits was personal use of the company vehicle -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;to a point -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I didn\u0027t even own a car. I rarely went anywhere but here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at my apartment. Though it was summer, the night wind in northern Wisconsin had a nip to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStripping to my Speedo and diving into a lake held little appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat the lake was nestled at the edge of a very dense, dark section of the woods lessened the appeal even more. I wasn\u0027t chicken, but I wasn\u0027t foolish, either. I could swim at the rec center as I\u0027d been doing all winter -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;at least until the wolf problem was resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I\u0027d have that second cola on my rarely visited balcony, sitting on my seldom-used porch furniture. I had a decent view on my side of the building, if I\u0027d ever take a minute to look. The trees shaded the patio and someone had put a flower garden on a small knoll to the east. Perhaps I\u0027d take a minute now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside I removed my gun, set the weapon on top of my refrigerator, and stashed the bullets in my pocket. A lot of precautions for a woman who lived alone, but who knows when company might come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis way, if someone found the gun they wouldn\u0027t have any bullets. If I needed the gun, the bullets were already on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looped the heavy utility belt over the coatrack. My gaze caught on the cell phone still tucked in the holder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. Why hadn\u0027t Cadotte called? I needed to get that totem back before Clyde blew another brain cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my message machine, but the light wasn\u0027t blinking. I checked the phone on my belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes cell service cuts out in the deep woods, and sometimes it doesn\u0027t. Why or why not is a mystery. But my battery was fine and there were no messages there, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught a whiff of myself and headed for the bedroom. Missing bodies and rabid wolves made for a lot of nervous sweat. I stripped to the waist, then took a quick sponge bath and yanked a fresh khaki short-sleeved shirt from my closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtoning the front, I returned to the kitchen and snagged one of the two colas I had left. I needed to go grocery shopping -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;my least favorite thing. When you lived alone and cooked rarely, the amount of choices in a grocery store was confusing. I usually came out with stuff I didn\u0027t need and more that I didn\u0027t know what to do with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething clinked against the floor-length sliding doors leading to my patio. I glanced in that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing but black night filled the glass. All I could see was myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a really big bug,\" I murmured. \"Or a low-flying dumb bird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed across the small living area, flicked the lock, picked up the metal rod that braced the door, and slid it open. Crickets chirped; the trees rustled; a chilly wind swirled into the room. I\u0027d never noticed how dark this side of the building was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cast a quick, longing glance toward my gun, then shook my head. I was not going to sit on my balcony armed. I was supposed to be relaxing. Besides, what was going to get me up here? Even a rabid wolf couldn\u0027t jump fifty feet in the air. Could it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I hated being afraid, I made myself step onto the porch. I leaned my forearms along the railing, cradling my soda in my palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only reason I had a chill down my back was the icy remnants of winter on the breeze. As I stared at the forest, something slunk along the edge of the woods. Something low to the ground, something furry with a tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coyote,\" I said, and my voice sounded loud in the stillness of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about what I\u0027d said and frowned. Wolves wouldn\u0027t tolerate coyotes in their territory. So had I really seen what I thought I had?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened and scanned the tree line again. But the night was too dark. Where was the moon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting my gaze to the sky, I caught a muted silver glow hanging halfway between the earth and the apex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen had the clouds moved in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scuffle of a foot against rocks and dirt pulled my attention from the sky to the ground. A man stood below my balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soda slipped from my hand. I gasped. He glanced up and snatched the can from the air seconds before it would have smashed into his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoda sloshed across his shirt. His gaze met mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You throw things at everyone, or am I just lucky?\" Cadotte asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-9.html","bookId":2088,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM"}
