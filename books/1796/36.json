She pulled her hand out from under his and picked up her salad fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas studied her through narrowed eyes for a few seconds. Then he shrugged and picked up his own fork. He began poking through the salad to find the mushrooms. \"Okay. First we\u0027ll talk about the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen what are we going to talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head came up abruptly, his eyes very golden in the shadows. \"Us?\" he repeated softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" Verity said. She felt more nervous than she had anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Verityâ€¦ \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" she begged softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas started to argue, but something about her expression stopped him. \"All right,\" he finally agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity smiled gratefully. \"Tell me, in your professional opinion, what exactly do you think is going on out there on that island?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My professional opinion is that the whole situation sucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You academic types have such a way with words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a professional requirement. It\u0027s been a few years, but when called upon I can, as I\u0027ve explained, still bullshit with the best of them. Have you noticed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve noticed,\" she said dryly. \"You know something? You can sound awfully impressive when you try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you gave that little dissertation at breakfast on the differences between Milanese and Florentine construction techniques, everyone was fascinated. Architecture wasn\u0027t even your specialty when you taught Renaissance history. How come you know so much about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goes with the territory,\" he explained. \"When you\u0027re studying the various Renaissance war machines designed to knock down walls and buildings, you find yourself learning a little something about how the walls and buildings were constructed in the first place. And don\u0027t get any ideas about nagging me to write an article about Hazelhurst\u0027s Horror for some obscure little history journal. The report I\u0027m doing for Doug is all I\u0027m interested in turning out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Jonas, if you\u0027re going to establish a career as a historical consultant you\u0027ll need to have your name appear in print occasionally. It\u0027s good advertising. Speaking of Hazelhurst\u0027s Horror, let\u0027s get back to the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love the way you call it \u0027the case.\u0027 Makes us sound like a couple of amateur detectives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe that\u0027s what we are. We\u0027ve already found one body, haven\u0027t we? Poor Hazelhurst. What do you think happened to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My professional opinion is that he got a stiletto in the back,\" Jonas said, munching his salad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not an uncommon fate during the Renaissance,\" Verity pointed out. \"Jonas, that ruby ring on the hand that stabbed Hazelhurst appeared in the first vision. I know I saw it, either in the chest or on the man\u0027s hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no maybe about it. I saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no way the guy in the vision came alive and killed Hazelhurst,\" Jonas said forcefully. \"Forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, if that\u0027s an impossibility, what does it leave us with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas ate the last of his mushrooms. \"It leaves us,\" he stated slowly, \"with the possibility that Hazelhurst and somebody else found the treasure, or at least the ruby ring, and the guy with the stiletto didn\u0027t want to go halvesies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity put down her fork and stared at Jonas. \"Good grief, you\u0027re right. That\u0027s a perfectly plausible explanation. That ring alone is probably worth killing for, which means that two years ago Hazelhurst involved someone else in the treasure hunt. But Maggie said that he never had any luck getting his academic buddies to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She also mentioned a guy who claimed he was a grad student in Renaissance history showing up a few months before Hazelhurst disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity nodded. \"But she said Hazelhurst didn\u0027t work with him long. Claimed the man wasn\u0027t a real student, just a treasure hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible the guy sneaked back into the villa after he was kicked out. If he was reasonably discreet, he could wander around a long time in that pile of rocks before anyone caught him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But maybe Hazelhurst did catch him. Maybe he ran into him in that hidden passage. And maybe one of them had found that ring along with a few others items, like the old stiletto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe there was an argument. A fight.\" Jonas nodded thoughtfully. \"It\u0027s possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means that whoever was hanging around two and a half years ago has long since taken the treasure and vanished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also possible. Probable, in fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means we\u0027re wasting our time,\" Verity concluded with a sigh. \"The treasure\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not necessarily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him in surprise. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas shook his head. \"I don\u0027t think the real treasure was found. Or if it was, I don\u0027t think the thief got away with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas looked at her, his eyes shadowed. \"Because the treasure, whatever it is, will be very well guarded, Verity. No casual treasure hunter could have stolen it, not easily. Precautions were taken. I felt the echoes of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Booby traps, you mean? But they might all have rusted by now, like the one that guarded the crystal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure that all the traps are mechanical.\" Jonas became very busy buttering a chunk of sourdough bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, for crying out loud, what are you trying to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, then said quietly, \"I don\u0027t know. But I got a strong sense of warning, a feeling of real threat from the room where the crystal was found. I got an even heavier dose of it from that vision of the man seated at the desk. I\u0027ve felt a lot of things in that psychic corridor, but what I felt this last time was different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I understood that part, I\u0027d have this case solved.\" Jonas bit off a large piece of the chewy bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s just this faint sense of impending action or violence. Like something\u0027s waiting to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the sound of this.\" Verity had been hungry, but she was rapidly losing her appetite. \"Do you think we should drop the whole thing and go home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? I wouldn\u0027t leave now if you paid me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Jonas, you just said it was dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be careful.\" He grew thoughtful. \"I could try exploring the passageway alone. You can stay behind in the bedroom. Apparently the link between us is strong enough now to permit some distance. I can get hold of you mentally if I need you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-36.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
