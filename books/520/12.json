A poem entitled,\n\u003cbr\u003e `From my Tower\u0027, appears in the February Monthly--on the first page,\n\u003cbr\u003e which is a very great honour for a Freshman. My English instructor\n\u003cbr\u003e stopped me on the way out from chapel last night, and said it was\n\u003cbr\u003e a charming piece of work except for the sixth line, which had too\n\u003cbr\u003e many feet. I will send you a copy in case you care to read it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Let me see if I can\u0027t think of something else pleasant--\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, yes! I\u0027m learning to skate, and can glide about quite\n\u003cbr\u003e respectably all by myself. Also I\u0027ve learned how to slide down\n\u003cbr\u003e a rope from the roof of the gymnasium, and I can vault a bar\n\u003cbr\u003e three feet and six inches high--I hope shortly to pull up to four feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We had a very inspiring sermon this morning preached by the Bishop\n\u003cbr\u003e of Alabama. His text was: `Judge not that ye be not judged.\u0027 \n\u003cbr\u003e It was about the necessity of overlooking mistakes in others,\n\u003cbr\u003e and not discouraging people by harsh judgments. I wish you might\n\u003cbr\u003e have heard it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is the sunniest, most blinding winter afternoon, with icicles\n\u003cbr\u003e dripping from the fir trees and all the world bending under a weight\n\u003cbr\u003e of snow--except me, and I\u0027m bending under a weight of sorrow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now for the news--courage, Judy!--you must tell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Are you SURELY in a good humour? I failed in mathematics and\n\u003cbr\u003e Latin prose. I am tutoring in them, and will take another examination\n\u003cbr\u003e next month. I\u0027m sorry if you\u0027re disappointed, but otherwise I don\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e care a bit because I\u0027ve learned such a lot of things not mentioned\n\u003cbr\u003e in the catalogue. I\u0027ve read seventeen novels and bushels of poetry--\n\u003cbr\u003e really necessary novels like Vanity Fair and Richard Feverel\n\u003cbr\u003e and Alice in Wonderland. Also Emerson\u0027s Essays and Lockhart\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e Life of Scott and the first volume of Gibbon\u0027s Roman Empire\n\u003cbr\u003e and half of Benvenuto Cellini\u0027s Life--wasn\u0027t he entertaining? \n\u003cbr\u003e He used to saunter out and casually kill a man before breakfast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So you see, Daddy, I\u0027m much more intelligent than if I\u0027d just stuck\n\u003cbr\u003e to Latin. Will you forgive me this once if I promise never to fail again?\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours in sackcloth,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59734.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
