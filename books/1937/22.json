Although she sat through the entire movie, she couldn’t remember a single scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday evening Anne Marie put a meat-loaf-and-potato casserole in the oven. It was a favorite recipe of her mother’s and one she hadn’t made in years. The meat mixture baked with sliced raw potatoes, both covered in tomato sauce. Anne Marie had liked it when she was around Ellen’s age and she hoped Ellen would, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she closed the oven door, she noticed Ellen approaching the large oak desk where she kept the scrapbooking materials for her Twenty Wishes book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s this?” Ellen asked, looking over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My Twenty Wishes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty Wishes,” the girl repeated. “What are those?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, on Valentine’s Day, my friends and I had a small party. We started talking about all the things we’d wished for in our lives and then we each decided to make a list.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just twenty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie laughed. So far, coming up with twenty had been hard enough, and in fact, she was only halfway there. “This is fine for now. I’ll think of more later on,” she said. “In fact, I’m still working on my first twenty.” She had a total of nine: the five she’d written earlier, plus her most recent additions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Find a reason to laugh\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7. Sing again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8. Purchase a home for me and Baxter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9. Attend a Broadway musical and learn all the songs by heart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was considering a line dancing class, which was a wish she’d erased earlier. The St. Patrick’s Day performance had inspired her interest in dancing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The wishes don’t need to be practical,” Anne Marie went on to explain. “That’s why they’re called wishes instead of resolutions or goals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I don’t necessarily expect them all to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t expect them to happen,” Ellen asked, regarding her quizzically, “then why are you writing them down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because they’re wishes,” Anne Marie said. Finding a pen, she added a wish she’d erased two or three times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10. Travel to Paris with someone I love\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat encompassed the essence of what she sought—love, adventure, new experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen stared down at the recently entered wish. “Can anyone make a list like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” Anne Marie set the timer on the oven. They’d gotten into a routine, the two of them, during the past five days. It felt as if Ellen had been with her much longer. One obvious difference in her life was that Anne Marie now regularly cooked dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since she’d started living alone, she’d fallen into the habit of grabbing something quick and easy or skipping dinner altogether, which she could ill afford to do. But Ellen needed regular nutritious meals and a daily structure. With everything else in the girl’s life in upheaval, Anne Marie could at least offer her that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang and Anne Marie picked it up immediately before Call Display could even register the number. She was expecting to hear from Elise, whom she’d been trying to reach all afternoon. “Hello.” She figured Elise wanted to share her news, which Anne Marie had already heard via the neighborhood grapevine. Elise had taken a part-time job working for Lydia at A Good Yarn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anne Marie, it’s Brandon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brandon! It’s great to hear from you,” she said with genuine pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been meaning to call you for a couple of weeks,” he went on. “Melissa told me what she did. I can’t believe my sister sometimes. And as for my father…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, I’m fine.” That was mostly true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure?” Brandon pressed. “To be fair to Melissa, I doubt she realized how hard you’d take that business about Dad. And she was pretty devastated herself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really, it’s okay,” Anne Marie lied, brushing off his concern. The last thing she wanted was to talk about her husband’s indiscretion—or even think about it. She felt a rush of pain whenever she remembered and constantly guarded herself against the image of Robert with Rebecca. In his office, on the couch…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure?” he asked again. He didn’t seem convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Positive.” As much as possible she made light of the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer stepson hesitated a moment, then blurted out, “Let me take you to dinner tonight. I know it’s short notice, but we could talk and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t.” She hoped he’d take her at her word, not force her to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” Brandon’s voice fell with disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a visitor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer announcement was met with a short silence. “Anne Marie, are you seeing someone?” he asked somberly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, of course not!” The question amused her. “Melissa asked me the same thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not? Why say it like that? You’re young and beautiful and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m with a…friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, the mystery intensifies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a mystery,” she said, smiling at his teasing banter. “It’s Ellen. She’s eight and she’s living with me for the next week or two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have an eight-year-old living with you? Is she a relative of yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I met her through a nearby school—the Lunch Buddies program. Why don’t you join us?” she said impulsively. “I just put a casserole in the oven and it won’t be ready for another forty minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You made dinner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t sound so shocked. I did a lot of cooking in my time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I’d like that. Thanks. Give me a few minutes to finish up here and I’ll drive straight over. You’re still living above the bookstore, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For now.” She really did hope to purchase a house, and soon. Spring, especially May and June, were the best months to look. As soon as Ellen was back with her grandmother, Anne Marie had every intention of beginning her search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brandon, one thing…Melissa’s and my conversation…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to discuss it, all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. “If that’s what you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is,” she told him, keeping her voice firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie hung up the phone and turned around to discover Ellen perched on a chair at the kitchen table, staring blankly into space. She had the end of a pencil clamped between her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you doing your homework?” Anne Marie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen shook her head. “I’m making a list of Twenty Wishes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen nodded. “Do you want to hear what I have so far?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would.” Anne Marie pulled out the chair next to her and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One,” Ellen announced with great formality. “Plant a garden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of garden?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Flowers,” Ellen said. “I read the book you gave me about that garden, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie smiled approvingly. Of course. On Sunday she’d given her a copy of the Edwardian children’s classic, The Secret Garden. Ellen was an advanced reader and had no difficulty with comprehension. Occasionally she’d asked about the meaning of a word. She’d loved the idea of the walled garden, hidden from the world, and had instantly identified with the story’s orphaned young heroine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there any other kind of garden than flowers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vegetables.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can grow tomatoes?” Ellen asked in an excited voice. “I like tomatoes a lot, especially when they’re warm from the sun. I like them with salt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie looked at her curiously. “Did you ever have a garden before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen lowered her gaze. “No…Grandma Dolores told me about warm tomatoes with salt. I’ve never had one but I know they’d be really good because my grandma said so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like tomatoes, too.” Anne Marie closed her eyes at the memory of working in her garden at the house she and Robert had owned. The smell of earth, the sun warm on her back…“Last summer I grew tomatoes right here, on my balcony.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child seemed thoroughly confused by that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a container garden because I didn’t have anywhere to plant an actual garden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about corn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That might be a challenge, but I’ll check into it. If you like, we can plant seeds in egg cartons and then once your grandmother’s home again, I’ll help you clear a small space in her yard for your very own garden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” The girl’s face shone with uncomplicated joy. “A garden,” she breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything else on your list?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen nodded. “I want to bake cookies with Grandma Dolores.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet she’d like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She always said we could, but then she’d get tired or she wouldn’t be feeling well and we never got to do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie slipped her arm around Ellen’s shoulders. “When your grandmother’s back from the hospital, she’ll be feeling much better and have a lot more energy, and I’m sure she’ll want to bake cookies with you then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oatmeal and raisin are my favorites.” Ellen set the pencil down. “I couldn’t think of anything else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about something whimsical?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen turned to her, expression blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whimsical means fanciful—a wish that’s not…serious, I suppose you could say. Something lighthearted, just for fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end of the pencil returned to Ellen’s mouth. “Do you have anything whi-whimsical on your list?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question. “Not yet. Let’s think about it.” She stood to get three plates from the cupboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well…” Anne Marie murmured. She looked at the child, then walked over to her own list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11. Dance in the rain in my bare feet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you write?” Ellen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Marie told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen started to giggle. “That’s silly. Aren’t you afraid your clothes will get wet? Or you’ll get mud between your toes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t care, especially if I was dancing with someone I loved.” She opened the refrigerator and removed a bag of romaine lettuce and other salad ingredients. Anne Marie occasionally made salad for dinner; she wasn’t afraid to add unusual ingredients, like walnut bits, cranberries, raw green beans, Chinese noodles, sunflower seeds, pickle slices, beets…Her inventions weren’t always successful—the chopped anchovies came to mind—but they were usually interesting. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twenty-wishes-blossom-street-5/page-22.html","bookId":1937,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:06 AM"}
