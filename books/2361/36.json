You call yourselves policemen? You\u0027re a disgrace to your uniforms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chief of police stood there, cringing under the withering scorn of Colonel Acoca. There was nothing else he could do, for the colonel was powerful enough to have his head. And Acoca was not yet through with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hold you personally responsible. I\u0027ll see that you\u0027re relieved from duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colonel - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out. You make me sick to my stomach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Acoca was boiling with frustration. There had not been enough time for him to reach Vitoria and catch Jaime Miro. He had had to entrust that to the local police. And they had bungled it. God alone knew where Miro had gone to now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Acoca went to the map spread out on a table in front of him. They will be staying in Basque country, of course. That could be Burgos or Logrono or Bilbao or San Sebastian. I\u0027ll concentrate on the northeast. They\u0027ll have to surface somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recalled his conversation with the prime minister that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your time is running out, Colonel. Have you read the morning papers? The world press is making us look like clowns. Miro and those nuns have made us a laughingstock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prime Minister, you have my assurance - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"King Juan Carlos has ordered me to set up an official inquiry board into the whole matter. I can\u0027t hold it off any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delay the inquiry for just a few more days. I\u0027ll have Miro and the nuns by then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. \"Forty-eight hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not the prime minister whom Colonel Acoca was afraid of disappointing, nor was it the king. It was the OPUS MUNDO. When he had been summoned to the paneled office of one of Spain\u0027s leading industrialists, his orders had been explicit: \"Jaime Miro is creating an atmosphere harmful to our organization. Stop him. You will be well rewarded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Colonel Acoca knew what the unspoken part of the conversation was: Fail and you will be punished. Now his career was in jeopardy. And all because some stupid policemen had let Miro walk away under their noses. Jaime Miro might hide anywhere. But the nuns...A wave of excitement coursed through Colonel Acoca. The nuns! They were the key. Jaime Miro might hide anywhere, but the sisters could find sanctuary only in another convent. And it would almost certainly be in a convent of the same order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Acoca turned to study the map again. And there it was: Mendavia. There was a convent of the Cistercian order at Mendavia. That\u0027s where they\u0027re headed, Acoca thought triumphantly. Well, so am I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly I\u0027ll be there first, waiting for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journey for Ricardo and Graciela was coming to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last few days had been the happiest Ricardo had ever known. He was being hunted by the military and the police, his capture meant certain death, and yet none of that seemed to matter. It was as though he and Graciela had carved out an island in time, a paradise where nothing could touch them. They had turned their desperate journey into a wonderful adventure that they shared together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked endlessly, exploring and explaining, and their words were tendrils that drew them even closer together. They spoke of the past, the present, and the future. Particularly the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be married in church,\" Ricardo said. \"You\u0027ll be the most beautiful bride in the world...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Graciela could visualize the scene and was thrilled by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we\u0027ll live in the most beautiful house...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she thought: I\u0027ve never had a house of my own, or a real room of my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the little casa she had shared with her mother and all the uncles, and then the convent cell, living with the sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we\u0027ll have handsome sons and beautiful daughters...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I will give them all the things I never had. They will be so loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Graciela\u0027s heart soared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was one thing troubling her. Ricardo was a soldier fighting for a cause he passionately believed in. Would he be content living in France, withdrawing from the battle? She knew she had to discuss this with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ricardo - how much longer do you think this revolution is going to go on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s already gone on too long, Ricardo thought. The government had made peace overtures, but ETA had done worse than reject them. It had responded to the offers with a series of increased terrorist attacks. Ricardo had tried to discuss it with Jaime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re willing to compromise, Jaime. Shouldn\u0027t we meet them halfway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their offer is a trick - they want to destroy us. They\u0027re forcing us to go on fighting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd because Ricardo loved Jaime and believed in him, he continued to support him. But the doubts refused to die. And as the bloodshed increased, so did his uncertainty. And now Graciela was asking, How much longer do you think this revolution is going to go on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Ricardo told her. \"I wish it were over. But I will tell you this, my darling. Nothing will ever come between us - not even a war. There will never be words enough to tell you how much I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they went on dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey traveled during the night, making their way through the fertile, green countryside, past El Burgo and Soria. At dawn, from the top of a hill, they saw Logrono in the far distance. To the left of the road was a stand of pine trees and beyond that a forest of electric-power lines. Graciela and Ricardo followed the winding road down to the outskirts of the bustling city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going to meet the others?\" Graciela asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicardo pointed to a poster on a building they were passing. It read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCIRQUE JAPON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE WORLD\u0027S MOST\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSENSATIONAL CIRCUS FRESH FROM JAPAN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJULY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTH FOR ONE WEEK\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAVENIDA CLUB DE PORTIVO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" Ricardo told her. \"We\u0027ll meet them there this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another part of the city, Megan, Jaime, Amparo, and Felix were also looking at a circus poster. There was a feeling of enormous tension in the group. Amparo was never out of their sight. Ever since the incident at Vitoria, the men treated Amparo as an outcast, ignoring her most of the time and speaking to her only when necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaime looked at his watch. \"The circus should be starting,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt police headquarters in Logrono, Colonel Ramon Acoca was finalizing his plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are the men deployed around the convent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Colonel. Everything is in place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcoca was in an expansive mood. The trap he had set was foolproof, and there would be no bungling policemen to spoil his plans this time. He was personally conducting the operation. The OPUS MUNDO was going to be proud of him. He went over the details with his officers once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The nuns are traveling with Miro and his men. It\u0027s important that we catch them before they walk into the convent. We\u0027ll be spread out in the woods around it. Don\u0027t move until I give the signal to close in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are our orders if Jaime Miro resists?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcoca said softly, \"I hope he does try to resist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn orderly came into the room. \"Excuse me, Colonel. There is an American here who would like to speak to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no time now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" The orderly hesitated. \"He says it\u0027s about one of the nuns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? An American, did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Colonel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, Alan Tucker was ushered in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to disturb you, Colonel. I\u0027m Alan Tucker. I\u0027m hoping you can help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes? How, Mr. Tucker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that you\u0027re looking for one of the nuns from the Cistercian convent - a Sister Megan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colonel sat back in his chair, studying the American. \"How does that concern you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for her too. It\u0027s very important that I find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting, Colonel Acoca thought. Why is it so important for this American to find a nun? \"You have no idea where she is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The newspapers - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goddamn press again. \"Perhaps you could tell me why you are looking for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t discuss that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colonel - could you let me know if you find her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcoca gave him a thin smile. \"You\u0027ll know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole country was following the hegira of the nuns. The press had reported the narrow escape of Jaime Miro and one of the nuns in Vitoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they\u0027re heading north, Alan Tucker thought. Their best bet to get out of the country is probably San Sebastian. I\u0027ve got to get hold of her. He sensed that he was in trouble with Ellen Scott. I handled that badly, he thought. I can make up for it by bringing her Megan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed a call to Ellen Scott.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cirque Japon was held in a huge tent in an outlying district of Logrono. Ten minutes before the circus was to begin, the tent was filled to capacity. Megan, Jaime, Amparo, and Felix made their way down the crowded aisle to their reserved seats. There were two empty seats next to Jaime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at them and said, \"Something\u0027s wrong. Ricardo and Sister Graciela were supposed to be here.\" He turned to Amparo. \"Did you - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I swear it. I know nothing about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights dimmed and the show began. There was a roar from the crowd, and they turned to look at the arena. A bicycle rider was circling the ring, and as he pedaled an acrobat leaped onto his shoulder. Then, one by one, a swarm of other performers jumped on, clinging to the front and back and sides of the bicycle until it was invisible. The audience cheered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA trained-bear act was next, and then a tightrope walker. The audience was enjoying the show tremendously, but Jaime and the others were too nervous to pay any attention. Time was running out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll wait another fifteen minutes,\" Jaime decided. \"If they\u0027re not here by then - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice said, \"Excuse me - are these seats taken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaime looked up to see Ricardo and Graciela, and grinned. \"No. Please sit down.\" And then, in a relieved whisper, \"I\u0027m damned glad to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicardo nodded at Megan and Amparo and Felix. He looked around. \"Where are the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you seen the newspapers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Newspapers? No. We\u0027ve been in the mountains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have bad news,\" Jaime said. \"Rubio is in a prison hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicardo stared at him. \"How - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was stabbed in a bar fight. The police picked him up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0026amp;iexcl;Mierda!\" Ricardo was silent a moment, then sighed. \"We\u0027ll just have to get him out, won\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my plan,\" Jaime agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Sister Lucia?\" Graciela asked. \"And Sister Teresa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Megan who answered. \"Sister Lucia has been arrested. She was - she was wanted for murder. Sister Teresa is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraciela crossed herself. \"Oh, my Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the arena a clown was walking a tightrope, carrying a poodle under each arm and two Siamese cats in his capacious pockets. As the dogs tried to reach the cats, the wire swayed wildly and the clown pretended to be fighting to keep his balance. The audience was roaring. It was difficult to hear anything over the noise of the crowd. Megan and Graciela had so much to tell each other. Almost simultaneously, they began to talk in the sign language of the convent. The others looked on in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicardo and I are going to marry...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s wonderful...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat has been happening to you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan started to reply and realized there were no signs to convey the things she wanted to say. It would have to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s move,\" Jaime said. \"There\u0027s a van outside waiting to take us to Mendavia. We\u0027ll drop the sisters off there and be on our way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started up the aisle, Jaime holding Amparo\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were outside in the parking lot, Ricardo said, \"Jaime, Graciela and I are getting married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin lit up Jaime\u0027s face. \"That\u0027s wonderful! Congratulations.\" He turned to Graciela. \"You couldn\u0027t have picked a better man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan put her arms around Graciela. \"I\u0027m very happy for you both.\" And she thought: Was it easy for her to make the decision to leave the convent? Am I wondering about Graciela? Or am I wondering about myself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Acoca was receiving an excited report from an aide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were seen at the circus less than an hour ago. By the time we could bring up reinforcements, they had gone. They left in a blue and white van. You were right, Colonel. They are headed for Mendavia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it\u0027s finally over, Acoca thought. The chase had been an exciting one, and he had to admit that Jaime Miro had been a worthy opponent. The OPUS MUNDO will have even bigger plans for me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough a pair of high-powered Zeiss binoculars, Acoca watched the blue and white van appear over the crest of a hill and head for the convent below. Heavily armed troops were hidden among the trees along both sides of the road and around the convent itself. There was no way anyone could escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the van approached the entrance to the convent and braked to a stop, Colonel Acoca barked into his walkie-talkie, \"Close in! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maneuver was executed perfectly. Two squads of soldiers armed with automatic weapons swung into position, blocking the road and surrounding the van. Acoca stood watching the scene for an instant, savoring his moment of glory. Then he slowly approached the van, gun in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re surrounded,\" he called out. \"You haven\u0027t got a chance. Come out with your hands up. One at a time. If you try to resist, you\u0027ll all die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long moment of silence, and then the van door slowly opened and three men and three women emerged, trembling, their hands raised high above their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were strangers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-36.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
