{"id":43783,"no":9,"title":"Chapter IX","content":"June, 1891.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sir, — To you, under your portrait, which is, in expression, your true, breathing self, and up to now saddens me; in time, and soon, I shall be glad to have it there; it is still only a reminder of your absence. Fanny wept when we unpacked it, and you know how little she is given to that mood; I was scarce Roman myself, but that does not count — I lift up my voice so readily. These are good compliments to the artist. I write in the midst of a wreck of books, which have just come up, and have for once defied my labours to get straight. The whole floor is filled with them, and (what’s worse) most of the shelves forbye; and where they are to go to, and what is to become of the librarian, God knows. It is hot to-night, and has been airless all day, and I am out of sorts, and my work sticks, the devil fly away with it and me. We had an alarm of war since last I wrote my screeds to you, and it blew over, and is to blow on again, and the rumour goes they are to begin by killing all the whites. I have no belief in this, and should be infinitely sorry if it came to pass — I do not mean for us, that were otiose — but for the poor, deluded schoolboys, who should hope to gain by such a step.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Letter resumed.] June 20th.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No diary this time. Why? you ask. I have only sent out four Letters, and two chapters of the Wrecker. Yes, but to get these I have written 132 pp., 66,000 words in thirty days; 2200 words a day; the labours of an elephant. God knows what it’s like, and don’t ask me, but nobody shall say I have spared pains. I thought for some time it wouldn’t come at all. I was days and days over the first letter of the lot — days and days writing and deleting and making no headway whatever, till I thought I should have gone bust; but it came at last after a fashion, and the rest went a thought more easily, though I am not so fond as to fancy any better.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Your opinion as to the letters as a whole is so damnatory that I put them by. But there is a ‘hell of a want of’ money this year. And these Gilbert Island papers, being the most interesting in matter, and forming a compact whole, and being well illustrated, I did think of as a possible resource.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It would be called\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Six Months in Melanesia,\n\u003cbr\u003e Two Island Kings,\n\u003cbr\u003e — Monarchies,\n\u003cbr\u003e Gilbert Island Kings,\n\u003cbr\u003e — Monarchies,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e and I daresay I’ll think of a better yet — and would divide thus:-\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Butaritati.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I. A Town asleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e II. The Three Brothers.\n\u003cbr\u003e III. Around our House.\n\u003cbr\u003e IV. A Tale of a Tapu.\n\u003cbr\u003e V. The Five Day’s Festival.\n\u003cbr\u003e VI. Domestic Life — (which might be omitted, but not well, better be recast).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The King of Apemama.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e VII. The Royal Traders.\n\u003cbr\u003e VIII. Foundation of Equator Town.\n\u003cbr\u003e IX. The Palace of Mary Warren.\n\u003cbr\u003e X. Equator Town and the Palace.\n\u003cbr\u003e XI. King and Commons.\n\u003cbr\u003e XII. The Devil Work Box.\n\u003cbr\u003e XIII. The Three Corslets.\n\u003cbr\u003e XIV. Tail piece; the Court upon a Journey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I wish you to watch these closely, judging them as a whole, and treating them as I have asked you, and favour me with your damnatory advice. I look up at your portrait, and it frowns upon me. You seem to view me with reproach. The expression is excellent; Fanny wept when she saw it, and you know she is not given to the melting mood. She seems really better; I have a touch of fever again, I fancy overwork, and today, when I have overtaken my letters, I shall blow on my pipe. Tell Mrs. S. I have been playing le chant d’amour lately, and have arranged it, after awful trouble, rather prettily for two pipes; and it brought her before me with an effect scarce short of hallucination. I could hear her voice in every note; yet I had forgot the air entirely, and began to pipe it from notes as something new, when I was brought up with a round turn by this reminiscence. We are now very much installed; the dining-room is done, and looks lovely. Soon we shall begin to photograph and send you our circumstances. My room is still a howling wilderness. I sleep on a platform in a window, and strike my mosquito bar and roll up my bedclothes every morning, so that the bed becomes by day a divan. A great part of the floor is knee-deep in books, yet nearly all the shelves are filled, alas! It is a place to make a pig recoil, yet here are my interminable labours begun daily by lamp-light, and sometimes not yet done when the lamp has once more to be lighted. The effect of pictures in this place is surprising. They give great pleasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e June 21st.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A word more. I had my breakfast this morning at 4.30! My new cook has beaten me and (as Lloyd says) revenged all the cooks in the world. I have been hunting them to give me breakfast early since I was twenty; and now here comes Mr. Ratke, and I have to plead for mercy. I cannot stand 4.30; I am a mere fevered wreck; it is now half-past eight, and I can no more, and four hours divide me from lunch, the devil take the man! Yesterday it was about 5.30, which I can stand; day before 5, which is bad enough; today, I give out. It is like a London season, and as I do not take a siesta once in a month, and then only five minutes, I am being worn to the bones, and look aged and anxious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We have Rider Haggard’s brother here as a Land Commissioner; a nice kind of a fellow; indeed, all the three Land Commissioners are very agreeable.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1389/41604.html","bookId":1427,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:05:47 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:05:47 AM"}
