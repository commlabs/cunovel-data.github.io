Much depends on what people dream in the secrecy of their hearts. I have always been as concerned with the shaping of dreams as with the shaping of actions. Between the lines of my journals is the struggle with humankind\u0027s view of itself-a sweaty contest on a field where motives from our darkest past can well up out of an unconscious reservoir and become events with which we not only must live but contend. It is the hydraheaded monster which always attacks from your blind side. I pray, therefore, that when you have traversed my portion of the Golden Path you no longer will be innocent children dancing to music you cannot hear.-The Stolen Journals NAYLA MOVED In a steady, plodding,pace as she climbed the circular stairs to the God Emperor\u0027s audience chamber atop the Citadel\u0027s south tower. Each time she traversed the southwest arc of the tower, the narrow slitted windows drew dust-defined golden lines across her path. She knew that the central wall beside her confined a lift of Ixian make large enough to carry her Lord\u0027s bulk to the upper chamber, certainly large enough to hold her relatively smaller body, but she did not resent the fact that she was required to use the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breeze through the open slits brought her the burnt-flint smell of blown sand. The low-lying sun ignited the light of red mineral flakes in the inner wall, ruby matches glowing there. Now and then she cast a glance through a slitted window at the dunes. Never once did she pause to admire the things to be seen around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have heroic patience, Nayla,\" the Lord had once told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembrance of those words warmed Nayla now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the tower, Leto followed Nayla\u0027s progress up the long circular stairs that spiraled around the Ixian tube. Her progress was transmitted to him by an Ixian device which projected her approaching image quarter-size onto a region of three-dimensional focus directly in front of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow precisely she moves, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe precision, he knew, came from a passionate simplicity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore her Fish Speaker blues and a cape-robe without the hawk at the breast. Once past the guard station at the foot of the tower, she had thrown back the cibus mask he required her to wear on these personal visits. Her blocky, muscular body was like that of many others among his guardians, but her face was like no other in all of his memory-almost square with a mouth so wide it seemed to extend around the cheeks, an illusion caused by deep creases at the corners. Her eyes were pale green, the closely cropped hair like old ivory. Her forehead added to the square effect, almost flat with pale eyebrows which often went unnoticed because of the compelling eyes. The nose was a straight, shallow line which terminated close to the thin-lipped mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Nayla spoke, her great jaws opened and closed like those of some primordial animal. Her strength, known to few outside the corps of Fish Speakers, was legendary there. Leto had seen her lift a one-hundred-kilo man with one hand. Her presence on Arrakis had been arranged originally without Moneo\u0027s intervention, although the majordomo knew Leto employed his Fish Speakers as secret agents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto turned his head away from the plodding image and looked out the wide opening beside him at the desert to the south. The colors of the distant rocks danced in his awareness-brown, gold, a deep amber. There was a line of pink on a faraway cliff the exact hue of an egret\u0027s feathers. Egrets did not exist anymore except in Leto\u0027s memory, but he could place that pale pastel ribbon of stone against an inner eye and it was as though the extinct bird flew past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe climb, he knew, should be starting to tire even Nayla. She paused at last to rest, stopping at a point two steps past the three-quarter mark, precisely the place where she rested every time. It was part of her precision, one of the reasons he had brought her back from the distant garrison on Seprek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Dune hawk floated past the opening beside Leto only a few wing lengths from the tower wall. Its attention was held on the shadows at the base of the Citadel. Small animals sometimes emerged there, Leto knew. Dimly on the horizon beyond the hawk\u0027s path he could see a line of clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a strange thing those were to the Old Fremen in him: clouds on Arrakis and rain and open water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto reminded the inner voices: Except for this last desert, my Sareer, the remodeling of Dune into verdant Arrakis has gone on remorselessly since the first days of my rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe influence of geography on history went mostly unrecognized, Leto thought. Humans tended to look more at the influence of history on geography.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho owns this river passage? This verdant valley? This peninsula? This planet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla was climbing once more, her gaze fixed upward on the stairs she must traverse. Leto\u0027s thoughts locked on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many ways, she is the most useful assistant I have ever had. I am her God. She worships me quite unquestioningly. Even when l playfully attack her faith, she takes this merely as testing. She knows herself superior to any test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had sent her to the rebellion and had told her to obey Siona in all things, she did not question. When Nayla doubted, even when she framed her doubts in words, her own thoughts were enough to restore faith... or had been enough. Recent messages, however, made it clear that Nayla required the Holy Presence to rebuild her inner strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto recalled the first conversation with Nayla, the woman trembling in her eagerness to please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if Siona sends you to kill me, you must obey. She must never learn that you serve me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one can kill you, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you must obey Siona.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Lord. That is your command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must obey her in all things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will do it, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother test. Nayla does not question my tests. She treats them as flea bites. Her Lord commands? Nayla obeys. I must not let anything change that relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have made a superb Shadout in the old days, Leto thought. It was one of the reasons he had given Nayla a crysknife, a real one preserved from Sietch Tabr. It had belonged to one of Stilgar\u0027s wives. Nayla wore it in a concealed sheath beneath her robes, more a talisman than a weapon. He had given it to her in the original ritual, a ceremony which had surprised him by evoking emotions he had thought forever buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the tooth of Shai-Hulud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had extended the blade to her on his silvery-skinned hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it and you become part of both past and future. Soil it and the past will give you no future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla had accepted the blade, then the sheath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Draw the blood of a finger,\" Leto had commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla had obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheath the blade. Never remove it without drawing blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Nayla had obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Leto watched the three-dimensional image of Nayla\u0027s approach, his reflections on that old ceremony were touched by sadness. Unless fixed in the Old Fremen way, the blade would grow increasingly brittle and useless. It would keep its crysknife shape throughout Nayla\u0027s life, but little longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have thrown away a bit of the past. -\u003d How sad it was that the Shadout of old had become today\u0027s Fish Speaker. And a true crysknife had been used to bind a servant more strongly to her master. He knew that some thought his Fish Speakers were really priestesses -Leto\u0027s answer to the Bene Gesserit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He creates another religion,\" the Bene Gesserit said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNonsense! I have not created a religion. I am the religion!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla entered the tower sanctuary and stood three paces from Leto\u0027s cart, her gaze lowered in proper subservience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill in his memories, Leto said: \"Look at me, woman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have created a holy obscenity!\" he said. \"This religion built around my person disgusts me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla\u0027s green eyes on the gilded cushions of her checks stared out at him without questioning, without comprehension, without the need of either response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I sent her out to collect the stars, she would go and she would attempt it. She thinks I am testing her again. I do believe she could anger me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This damnable religion should end with me!\" Leto shouted. \"Why should I want to loose a religion upon my people? Religions wreck from within-Empires and individuals alike! It\u0027s all the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Religions create radicals and fanatics like you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank You, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe short-lived pseudo-rage sank back out of sight into the depths of his memories. Nothing dented the hard surface of Nayla\u0027s faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Topri has reported to me through Moneo,\" Leto said. \"Tell me about this Topri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Topri is a worm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that what you call me when you\u0027re among the rebels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I obey my Lord in everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTouche!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Topri is not worth cultivating then?\" Leto asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Siona assessed him correctly. He is clumsy. He says things which others will repeat, thus exposing his hand in the matter. Within seconds after Kobat began to speak, she had confirmation that Topri was a spy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone agrees, even Moneo, Leto thought. Topri is not a good spy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agreement amused Leto. The petty machinations muddied water which remained completely transparent to him. The performers, however, still suited his designs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Siona does not suspect you?\" Leto asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not clumsy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know why I summoned you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To test my faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhhh, Nayla. How little you know of testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want your assessment of Siona. I want to see it on your face and see it in your movements and hear it in your voice.\" Leto said. \"Is she ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Fish Speakers need that one, Lord. Why do You risk losing her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forcing the issue is the surest way of losing what I treasure most in her,\" Leto said. \"She must come to me with all of her strengths intact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla lowered her gaze. \"As my Lord commands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto recognized the response. It was a Nayla reaction to whatever she failed to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will she survive the test, Nayla?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As my Lord describes the test...\" Nayla lifted her gaze to Leto\u0027s face, shrugged. \"I do not know, Lord. Certainly, she is strong. She was the only one to survive the wolves. But she is ruled by hate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite naturally. Tell me, Nayla, what will she do with the things she stole from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Topri not inform you about the books which they say contain Your Sacred Words?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdd how she can capitalize words only with her voice, Leto thought. He spoke curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes. The Ixians have a copy and soon the Guild and Sisterhood as well will be hard at work on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are those books, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are my words for my people. I want them to be read. What I want to know is what Siona has said about the Citadel charts she took.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She says there is a great hoard of melange beneath Your Citadel, Lord, and the charts will reveal it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The charts will not reveal it. Will she tunnel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seeks Ixian tools for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ix will not provide them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there such a hoard of spice, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a story about how Your hoard is defended, Lord. That Arrakis itself would be destroyed if anyone tried to steal Your melange. Is it true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And that would shatter the Empire. Nothing would survive-not Guild or Sisterhood, not Ix or Tleilaxu, not even the Fish Speakers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered, then: \"I will not let Siona try to get Your spice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nayla! I commanded you to obey Siona in everything. Is this how you serve me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord?\" She stood in fear of his anger, closer to a loss of faith than he had ever seen her. It was the crisis he had created, knowing how it must end. Slowly, Nayla relaxed. He could see the shape of her thought as though she had laid it out for him in illuminated words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ultimate test!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will return to Siona and guard her life with your own,\" Leto said. \"That is the task I set for you and that you accepted. It is why you were chosen. It is why you carry a blade from Stilgar\u0027s household.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer right hand went to the crysknife concealed beneath her robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow sure it is, Leto thought, that a weapon can lock a person into a predictable pattern of behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared with fascination at Nayla\u0027s rigid body. Her eyes were empty of everything except adoration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ultimate rhetorical despotism... and I despise it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go then!\" he barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla turned and fled the Holy Presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it worth this? Leto wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Nayla had told him what he needed to know. Nayla had renewed her faith and revealed with accuracy the thing which Leto could not find in Siona\u0027s fading image. Nayla\u0027s instincts were to be trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona has reached that explosive moment which I require. -\u003d The Duncans always think it odd that I choose women for combat forces, but my Fish Speakers are a temporary army in every sense. While they can be violent and vicious, women are profoundly different from men in their dedication to battle. The cradle of genesis ultimately predisposes them to behavior more protective of life. They have proved to be the best keepers of the Golden Path. I reinforce this in my design for their training. They are set aside for a time from ordinary routines. I give them special sharings which they can look back upon\u0027 with pleasure for the rest of their lives. They come of age in the company of their sisters in preparation for events more profound. What you share in such companionship always prepares you for greater things. The haze of nostalgia covers their days among their sisters, making those days into something different than they were. That\u0027s the way today changes history. All contemporaries do not inhabit the same time. The past is always changing, but few realize it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals AFTER SENDING word to the Fish Speakers, Leto descended to the crypt in the late evening. He had found it best to begin the first interview with a new Duncan Idaho in a darkened room where the ghola could hear Leto describe himself before actually seeing the pre-worm body. There was a small side room carved in black stone off the central rotunda of the crypt which suited this requirement. The chamber was large enough to accommodate Leto on his cart, but the ceiling was low. Illumination came from hidden glowglobes which he controlled. There was only the one door, but it was in two segments-one swinging wide to admit the Royal Cart, the other a small portal in human dimensions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto rolled his Royal Cart into the chamber, sealed the large portal and opened the smaller one. He composed himself then for the ordeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoredom was an increasing problem. The pattern of the Tleilaxu gholas had become boringly repetitious. Once, Leto had sent word warning the Tleilaxu to send no more Duncans, but they had known they could disobey him in this thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I think they do it just to keep disobedience alive!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tleilaxu relied on an important thing which they knew protected them in other matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe presence of a Duncan pleases the Paul Atreides in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Leto had explained it to Moneo in the majordomo\u0027s first days at the Citadel:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Duncans must come to me with much more than Tleilaxu preparation. You must see to it that my houris gentle the Duncans and that the women answer some of his questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which questions may they answer, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo had, of course, learned all about this procedure over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto heard Moneo\u0027s voice outside the darkened room, then the sound of the Fish Speaker escort and the hesitantly distinctive footsteps of the new ghola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Through that door,\" Moneo said. \"It will be dark inside and we will close the door behind you. Stop just inside and wait for the Lord Leto to speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why will it be dark?\" The Duncan\u0027s voice was full of aggressive misgivings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho was thrust into the room and the door was sealed behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto knew what the ghola saw-only shadows among shadows and blackness where not even the source of a voice could be fixed. As usual, Leto brought the Paul Muad\u0027Dib voice into play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It pleases me to see you again, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho was a warrior, and the warrior attacks. This reassured Leto that the ghola was a fully restored original. The morality play by which the Tleilaxu reawakened a ghola\u0027s pre-death memories always left some uncertainties in the gholas\u0027 minds. Some of the Duncans believed they had threatened a real Paul Muad\u0027Dib. This one carried such illusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear Paul\u0027s voice but I can\u0027t see him,\" Idaho said. He didn\u0027t try to conceal the frustrations, let them all come out in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was an Atreides playing this stupid game? Paul was truly dead in some long-ago and this was Leto, the carrier of Paul\u0027s resurrected memories... and the memories of many others!-if the Tleilaxu stories were to be believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have been told that you are only the latest in a long line of duplicates,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have none of those memories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto recognized hysteria in the Duncan, barely covered by the warrior bravado. The cursed Tleilaxu post-tank restoration tactics had produced the usual mental chaos. This Duncan had arrived in a state of near shock, strongly suspecting he was insane. Leto knew that the most subtle powers of reassurance would be required now to soothe the poor fellow. This would be emotionally draining for both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There have been many changes, Duncan,\" Leto said. \"One thing, though, does not change. I am still Atreides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They said your body is...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that has changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The damned Tleilaxu! They tried to make me kill someone I... well, he looked like you. I suddenly remembered who I was and there was this... Could that have been a Muad\u0027Dib ghola?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Face Dancer mimic, I assure you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looked and talked so much like... Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An actor, no more. Did he survive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course! That\u0027s how they wakened my memories. They explained the whole damned thing. Is it true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true, Duncan. I detest it, but I permit it for the pleasure of your company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe potential victims always survive, Leto thought. At least for the Duncans I see. There have been slips, the fake Paul slain and the Duncans wasted. But there are always more cells carefully preserved from the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your body?\" Idaho demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuad\u0027Dib could be retired now; Leto resumed his usual voice. \"I accepted the sandtrout as my skin. They have been changing me ever since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will explain that in due course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Tleilaxu said you look like a sandworm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did my Fish Speakers say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They said you\u0027re God. Why do you call them Fish Speakers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An old conceit. The first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams. They learned valuable things that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am those women... and everything that came before and after them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto heard the dry swallowing in Idaho\u0027s throat, then: \"I see why the darkness. You\u0027re giving me time to adjust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always were quick, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept when you were slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been changing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than thirty-five hundred years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what the Tleilaxu told me is true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They seldom dare to lie anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Tleilaxu have... copied me many times?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s time you asked how many, Duncan,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will let you see the records for yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so it starts, Leto thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis exchange always appeared to satisfy the Duncans, but there was no escaping the nature of the question:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duncans made no distinctions of the flesh even though no mutual memories passed between gholas of the same stock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember my death,\" Idaho said. \"Harkonnen blades, lots of them trying to get at you and Jessica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto restored the Muad\u0027Dib voice for momentary play: \"I was there, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a replacement, is that right?\" Idaho asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did the other... me... I mean, how did he die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All flesh wears out, Duncan. It\u0027s in the records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto waited patiently, wondering how long it would be until the tamed history failed to satisfy this Duncan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you really look like?\" Idaho asked. \"What\u0027s this sandworm body the Tleilaxu described?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will make sandworms of sorts someday. It\u0027s already far down the road of metamorphosis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean of sorts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will have more ganglia. It will be aware.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t we have some light\u0027? I\u0027d like to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto commanded the floodlights. Brilliant illumination filled the room. The black walls and the lighting had been arranged to focus the illumination on Leto, every visible detail revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho swept his gaze along the faceted silvery-gray body, noted the beginnings of a sandworm\u0027s ribbed sections, the sinuous flexings... the small protuberances which had once been feet and legs, one of them somewhat shorter than the other. He brought his attention back to the well-defined arms and hands and finally lifted his attention to the cowled face with its pink skin almost lost in the immensity, a ridiculous extrusion on such a body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Duncan,\" Leto said. \"You were warned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho gestured mutely toward the pre-worm body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto asked it for him: \"Why\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m still Atreides, Duncan, and I assure you with all the honor of that name, there were compelling reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could possibly...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will learn in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho merely shook his head from side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not. a pleasant revelation,\" Leto said. \"It requires that you learn other things first. Trust the word of an Atreides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the centuries, Leto had found that this invocation of Idaho\u0027s profound loyalties to all things Atreides dampened the immediate wellspring of personal questions. Once more, the formula worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m to serve the Atreides again,\" Idaho said. \"That sounds familiar. Is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In many ways, old friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old to you, maybe, but not to me.
