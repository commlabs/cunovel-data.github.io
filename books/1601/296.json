He carried Rand\u0027s bloody banner wrapped up in a small bundle, under his arm. Bodies lay scattered around, fallen weapons and pieces of armor, and blood stained the rocks. But the fighting was done here, the place empty of foes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoal smiled at Mat from horseback; Olver rode in front of him, clutching the Horn. Olver looked exhausted from Grady’s Healing—the Asha’man stood beside the horse—but also seemed proud as could be at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoal. One of the heroes of the Horn. It bloody made sense. Jain Farstrider himself. Well, you wouldn’t find Mat trading places with him. Noal might enjoy it, but Mat wouldn’t dance at another man’s command. Not for immortality itself, no he wouldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grady!\" Mat said. \"You did a nice job upriver. That water came just when we needed it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrady’s face was ashen, as if he’d seen something he had not wanted to. He nodded. \"What . . . What were . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ll explain another time\", Mat said. \"Right now, I need a bloody gateway\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where to?\" Grady asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat took a deep breath, pulling up. \"Shayol Ghul\". And curse me for a fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrady shook his head. \"It can’t happen, Cauthon\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’re too tired?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am tired\", Grady said. \"It isn’t that. Something’s happening at Shayol Ghul. Gateways opened there are deflected. The pattern is . . . warped, if that makes any sense. The valley isn’t one location any longer, but many, and a gateway can’t pinpoint it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grady\", Mat said, \"that made about as much sense to me as playing a harp with no fingers\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Traveling to Shayol Ghul don’t work, Cauthon\", Grady said with annoyance. \"Pick somewhere else\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How close can you send me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrady shrugged. \"One of the scouting camps a day’s hike out, probably\". A day’s hike out. The tugging pulled at Mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mat?\" Olver said. \"I think I need to go with you, don’t I? To the Blight? Won’t the heroes be needed to fight there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a piece of it. The tugging was insufferable. Bloody ashes, Rand. Leave me alone, you—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat stopped himself, a thought occurring to him. Scout camps. \"One of those Seanchan patrol camps, you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\", Grady said. \"They’ve been sending us status reports on the battle up there, now that the gateways are unreliable\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, don’t just sit there looking stupid\", Mat said. \"Get a gateway open! Come on, Olver. We have some more work to do\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhhh . . \". Shaisam rolled onto the battlefield at Thakan’dar. So perfect. So pleasurable. His enemies were killing one another. And he . . . he had grown vast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind was in every tendril of mist that rolled down the side of the valley. The souls of Trollocs were . . . well, unsatisfying. Still, simple grain could be filling in plentitude. And Shaisam had consumed quite a number of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis drones stumbled down the hillside, cloaked in mists. Trollocs with their skin pocked, as if it had boiled. Dead white eyes. He hardly needed them any longer, as their souls had given him fuel to rebuild himself. His madness had retreated. Mostly. Well, not mostly. Enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked at the center of the bank of mist. He was not reborn yet, not completely. He would need to find a place to infest, a place where the barriers between worlds was thin. There, he could seep his self into the very stones and embed his awareness into that location. The process would take years, but once it happened, he would become more difficult to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, Shaisam was frail. This mortal form that walked at the center of his mind . . . he was bound to it. Fain, it had been. Padan Fain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he was vast. Those souls had given rise to much mist, and it—in turn—found others to feed upon. Men fought Shadowspawn before him. All would give him strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis drones stumbled onto the battlefield, and immediately, both sides took to fighting them. Shaisam quivered in joy. They did not see. They did not understand. The drones weren’t there to fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were there to distract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the battle proceeded, he trailed his essence down in misty tendrils, then began stabbing it through the bodies of fighting men and Trollocs. He took Myrddraal. Converted them. Used them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, this entire army would be his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed that strength in case his ancient enemy . . . his dear friend decided to attack him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose two friends—those two enemies—were occupied with one another. Excellent. Shaisam continued his attack, striking down enemies on both sides and consuming them. Some tried to attack him by running into his mists, his embrace. Of course, that killed them. This was his true self. He had tried to create this mist before, as Fain, but he had not been mature enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could not reach him. No living thing could withstand his mist. Once, it had been a mindless thing. It had not been him. But it had been trapped with him, inside of a seed carried away, and that death—that wonderful death—had been given fertile ground in the flesh of a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three entwined within him. Mist. Man. Master. That wonderful dagger—his physical form carried it now—had grown something delightful and new and ancient all at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the mist was him, but the mist was also not him. Mindless, but it was his body, and it carried his mind. Wonderfully, with those clouds in the sky he did not have to worry about the sun burning him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo nice of his old enemy to welcome him so! His physical form laughed at the heart of the creeping mists, while his mind—the mists themselves—gloried in how perfect everything was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis place would become his. But only after he had feasted upon Rand al’Thor, the strongest soul of them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a wonderful celebration!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaul clung to the rocks outside the Pit of Doom. The winds ripped at him, driving sand and chips of rock against his body, slicing gashes in his skin. He laughed at the vortex of blackness above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do your worst!\" he shouted upward. \"I have lived in the Three-fold Land. I had heard the Last Battle would be grand, not a stroll to my mothers roof picking simblossoms!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe winds blew harder, as if in retribution, but Gaul flattened himself against the stone, giving the winds no purchase on him. He’d lost his shoufa—it had blown free—so he had tied part of his shirt over his lower face. He held one spear.
