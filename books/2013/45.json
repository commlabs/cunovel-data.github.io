Did not the Ganetok fight alongside their mercenaries?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youth spat. ‘Their war leader gathered from the. clans fifteen thousand warriors. When the Letherii arrived, he fled, and the warriors followed. They abandoned the foreigners! Left them to slaughter!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Settle the camp below,’ Redmask said. He pointed to the warriors standing behind Masarch. ‘Stand first watch along this ridge line, here and to the west. I am now war leader to the Renfayar clan. Masarch, where hides the Ganetok?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seven days to the east. They now hold the last great herd of the Awl.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Masarch, do you challenge my right to be war leader?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youth shook his head. ‘You are Redmask. The Elders among the Renfayar who were your enemies are all dead, Their sons are dead.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How many warriors remain among the Renfayar?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasarch frowned, then gestured. ‘You have met us, War Leader.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask noted a lone dray dog sitting at the edge of the camp. It seemed to be watching him. He raised his left hand and the beast lunged into motion. The huge animal, a male, reached him moments later, dropping onto its chest and settling its wide, scarred head between Redmask’s feet. He reached down and touched its snout-a gesture that, for most, would have risked fingers. The dog made no move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasarch was staring down at it with wide eyes. ‘A lone survivor,’ he said, ‘from an outrider camp. It would not let us approach.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The foreigners,’ Redmask said quietly, ‘did they possess wardogs?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. But they were sworn followers of the Wolves of War, and indeed, War Leader, it seemed those treacherous, foul beasts tracked them-always at a distance, yet in vast numbers. Until the Ganetok Elders invoked magic and drove them all away.’ Masarch hesitated, then said, ‘Redmask, the war leader among the Ganetok-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnseen behind the mask, a slow smile formed. ‘Firstborn son of Capalah. Hadralt.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How did you know?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tomorrow, Masarch, we drive the herds east-to the Ganetok. I would know more of those hapless foreigners who chose to fight for us. To die for the people of the Awl’dan.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We are to crawl to the Ganetok as did the Sevond and the Niritha?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are starving. The herds are too weakened. I lead six youths none of whom has passed the death night. Shall the seven of us ride to war against the Letherii?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough young, it was clear that Masarch was no fool. ‘You shall challenge Hadralt? Redmask, your warriors-we, we will all die. We are not enough to meet the hundreds of challenges that will be flung at us, and once we are dead, you will have to face those challenges, long before you are deemed worthy to cross weapons with Hadralt himself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will not die,’ Redmask said. ‘And none shall challenge any of you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you mean to carve through a thousand warriors to face Hadralt?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What would be the point of that, Masarch? I need those warriors. Killing them would be a waste. No.’ He paused, then said, ‘I am not without guardians, Masarch. And I doubt that a single Ganetok warrior will dare challenge them. Hadralt shall have to face me, he and I, alone in the circle. Besides,’ he added, ‘we haven’t the time for all the rest.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Ganetok hold to the old ways, War Leader. There will be rituals. Days and days before the circle is made-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Masarch, we must go to war against the Letherii. Every warrior’of the Awl-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘War Leader! They will not follow you! Even Hadralt could only manage a third of them, and that with payment of rodara and myrid that halved his holdings!’ Masarch waved at the depleted herds on the hillsides. ‘We-we have nothing left! You could not purchase the spears of a hundred warriors!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who holds the largest herds, Masarch?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Ganetok themselves-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. I ask again, who holds the largest herds?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youth’s scowl deepened. ‘The Letherii.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will send three warriors to accompany the last of the Renfayar to the Ganetok. Choose two of your companion” to accompany us.’ The dray dog rose and moved to one side. Redmask collected the reins of his horse and set out down towards the camp. The dray fell in to heel on his left. ‘We shall ride west, Masarch, and find us some herds.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-45.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
