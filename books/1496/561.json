The slowly-fading golden light dragon suddenly opened its eyes, causing all of the light shooting out of the holes in the walls to suddenly change direction and sweep through the crumbling sepulcher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden dragon vanished, and in the blink of an eye, the entire sepulcher was filled with dazzling, colorful shafts of light. Most of them landed on Mistress Red-Dust, causing her face to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light possessed some corrosive power that instantly dissolved Mistress Red-Dust’s clothing, revealing her milky white skin. Then, glowing red dots appeared on her that began to eat down into her skin, a corrosive attack that required cultivation base power to fight against. Magical items were useless against it, and therefore, Mistress Red-Dust waved her hand in an attempt to destroy the light-emitting holes. However, nothing worked, and she was forced to simply try to evade the touch of the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was shocked by all of this, but was in no mood to ogle Mistress Red-Dust’s lithe body. Some of the light flying around the room landed on him as well, although the effects seemed rather mild....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The curse. It\u0027s the curse.... I wiped away a line of text, but Mistress Red-Dust is far guiltier! Hah, the Arch-Emperor is a smart one after all!” Bai Xiaochun was feeling very proud of himself, and yet, before he had much time to gloat, a red mist sprang up around Mistress Red-Dust, she threw another set of clothing on, and then began to speed in his direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mist was rapidly being whittled away by the shooting light, and yet, Mistress Red-Dust seemed to think she had plenty of time to kill Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s eyes widened, and he let out a yelp of fright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your curse isn’t working, second generation Arch-Emperor....” With that, he shot forward with another burst of speed, becoming a series of afterimages as he fled from Mistress Red-Dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Mistress Red-Dust was a deva, and even a casual effort on her part was something that a person like Bai Xiaochun, in the great circle of the Gold Core stage, would be powerless to fight against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom rang out, and blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth. Despair filled his eyes; if he couldn’t find the exit, he would be killed beyond the shadow of a doubt!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re too slow.” Mistress Red-Dust said coldly. She took a step forward that seemed to simultaneously stretch and shrink the space around her. Clearly, she was about to place herself right in front of Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s hair stood on end as he backed up, letting out another shriek. However, it was in that moment that the sepulcher began to sway back and forth even more dramatically than before. Virtually all the statues along the walls were now falling to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, a burst of teleportation power suddenly appeared. Clearly... a teleportation spell formation was activating!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts effects weren’t limited to the sepulcher. In the realm of trials by fire, as well as in the tunnels of the labyrinth, teleportation power began to build up. Obviously, the teleportation was only moments away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that happened, everyone inside would be teleported away....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment... the exit was opening!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo everyone else, the chance to leave meant a chance to survive. But that wasn’t the case for Bai Xiaochun. Considering how Mistress Red-Dust was attacking him, he wouldn’t be able to hold out until the teleportation formation activated!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the teleportation power interfered with Mistress Red-Dust’s technique, leaving her in exactly the same place she had been in moments ago. Aware that a teleportation was imminent, her eyes flashed with determination as she began to stride toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shafts of light didn\u0027t seem to be hurting her very much at this point, and although the red dots on her skin were painful, she was able to suppress their effects with her cultivation base. Having no other options available, she summoned another cloud of red mist, and then attacked Bai Xiaochun again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was like a trapped animal. In the moment he had in which Mistress Red-Dust was delayed, he quickly pulled out a Godly Vestige Pill and popped it into his mouth, then continued to fall back. However, all Mistress Red-Dust had to do was take a single step, and his speed was useless. In the blink of an eye, she was right in front of him, whereupon she waved her right index finger in his direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she moved her finger casually through the air, it contained wildly destructive power. A sense of profound deadly crisis immediately caused Bai Xiaochun\u0027s bloodshot eyes to go wide. Considering he had no options left, he decided to throw caution to the wind and simply attack her with everything he had!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun knew that his only chance now was to buy some time for the teleportation spell formation to finish activating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let\u0027s finish this!” he roared, unleashing all of the potential of his Undying Live Forever Technique. Utilizing his Undying Gold Skin, Undying Heavenly King, and Undying Tendons, he reached out toward Mistress Red-Dust and pinched his fingers together!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was none other than the Throat Crushing Grasp!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, a boom echoed out, along with a scream from Bai Xiaochun, as Mistress Red-Dust simply grabbed his hand! With a slight gleam of disdain in her eye, she tossed him to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCracking sounds could be heard as his fingers were broken, and a massive force sent him flying away. Thankfully, his cultivation base and Undying Live Forever Technique made him extremely tough. Despite not being killed, he slammed over and over again into the ground, bones shattering and blood spurting out everywhere! His Undying Live Forever Technique had been completely routed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took only the shortest of moments for Bai Xiaochun to be severely injured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling coldly, Mistress Red-Dust said, “Aren’t we the tough one? Got anything else left in you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she flickered into motion to eradicate the last bit of Bai Xiaochun’s life force. Bai Xiaochun could tell how badly he had been injured, and could sense that the flame of his life force was on the verge of being extinguished. Groaning, he stuffed his mouth full of Godly Vestige Pills, but swallowed only one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaves of heat washed through him, repairing his body with incredible speed. However, that was all the time it took Mistress Red-Dust to reach him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes bloodshot, he released the power of his cultivation base, causing frigid qi to shoot out with reckless abandon. He even drew upon his spiritual power, not holding back even the smallest bit. In the blink of an eye, the entire sepulcher filled with cracking sounds as it froze into a world of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time for thought or planning. Bai Xiaochun immediately turned and fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough all of this takes a bit of time to describe, it took place in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint. Mistress Red-Dust’s eyes flickered with scorn; she could tell that Bai Xiaochun was trying to buy time, and yet, was still confident that even still, she would be able to crush him to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the frigid qi bore down on her, she waved her hand, causing it to crumble and disperse. Then she reached out with her finger, piercing through the air to appear right in front of Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was planning to end Bai Xiaochun’s life in that moment, but before she could, the shafts of light destroyed her red mist, forcing her to summon it again. Before she could, the red dots on her skin corroded her even further, forcing her to combat the effects with her cultivation base. Because of all of those distractions, she could only spare thirty to forty percent of her power to attack Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was spattered with blood, but could do nothing to dodge or evade her. Howling with rage, he resorted to the Mountain Shaking Bash!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom rang out, along with a miserable howl as Bai Xiaochun was flung off to the side again, where he slammed into the crumbling wall. Virtually all of the bones in his body were broken, and the flame of his life force was once again pushed to the edge of being extinguished. However, almost no time passed before he bit down onto one of the Godly Vestige Pills he’d put into his mouth earlier. Warmth spread through him again, healing him almost instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Mistress Red-Dust closed in him again, he danced to the side in lively fashion, causing her brow to furrow. Snorting coldly, she momentarily stopped worrying about the dots on her skin or the red mist, and unleashing a mighty blow onto Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I refuse to believe that you can recover from a true killing blow!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive image of an illusory hand closed in on Bai Xiaochun, causing the air to twist and distort and releasing explosive energy in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord Bai isn’t the kind of guy you can just kill whenever you want, Granny Red-Dust!” Even as the huge hand bore down on him, Bai Xiaochun whipped out his Eternal Parasol. Nine silver designs shone on its surface as he snapped it open. Then, the bizarre face appeared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-558\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-560\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-559","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
