I always wondered what it meant. Where was that circle? Surrounding the one now ruling, or closer still, like razors against the brow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAparal Forge walked along one verge of the blood path. He could have veered into his dragon form. He could have wheeled out from the high wall and in moments settled before the breach, those old scattered stones of the toppled edifice, with all the joyous carvings. But what would that be saying to his warriors? You are indeed led by dragons, by the blood-tainted, by the devourers of Kessobahn . But was he not Tiste Liosan? I am. For now, for as long as I can hold on. And I’d rather show them that. I’d rather they see me, here, walking .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers were ready. He could see as much. He sought to draw strength from them, reassurance, all the confidence he would need to in turn command them. As they in turn did when seeing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must speak to them. Fashion words. What shall I say? Mercenaries await us. Humans. They can be broken, for their will has been bought, and if it is to be something to bargain with, like a comforting robe, then that will cannot be worth much, when all comfort vanishes. No, make it simpler. Tell them that coin cannot purchase righteousness. Against our will the humans shall falter .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe must simply push hard enough for long enough .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeak with confidence, yes .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I will think of loves lost, to empty out all the places inside me. Ready to be filled with fury and desire .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Liosan knew enough about humans. Through the piercing of the veil such as a priest or mage occasionally achieved, they had ventured into human worlds. ‘Testing the notions of justice’, as one old scout had once said. Small parties, of aimless purpose or singular intent. Journeying often enough for these explorers to return with knowledge of the strange, weak but profligate human creatures. Short-lived and truncated of thought. Incapable of planning ahead beyond a few years at most, and more commonly barely capable of thinking past a mere stretch of days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were always exceptions, of course. Great leaders, visionaries. Tyrants. But even among them, the legacy they sought was more often than not a selfish one, the private glory of immortal notoriety or fame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he approached the breach, Aparal wondered whether there was a great leader among these humans, these mercenaries. It was of course possible, but he doubted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe once glorious gate had been shattered long ago. It had commemorated a marriage that had spilled more blood than could be imagined. Shattered three civilizations. Destroyed an entire realm. Father Light, could you but have known, would you have turned away? Would you have sacrificed your happiness for the sake of your people? And hers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like to think you would have. Yes. You would have sacrificed yourself, because you were better than all of us .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now your children yearn to avenge your failure. But nothing we can do, nothing we can ever do, will make it better. No matter. We’re not interested in healing old wounds – look at that gate for proof of that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA space had been left clear before the breach. Of the wound itself, there was naught to be seen but stacked corpses, dim and ethereal through Lightfall’s incessant bleeding. Seeing those bodies, Aparal scowled, and from deep inside him surged a rush of rage. Liosan. Draconean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped into the space, turned towards his kin. ‘Brothers! Sisters! See what these humans have done to our fallen! They choose not to honour us as worthy foes. They imagine this dread wall will wound us!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Son of Light looks down upon us from the White Wall’s rampart. The Son of Light has said that on this day we shall conquer the Realm of Dark! We shall conquer Kharkanas! We know they are waiting. Shall we seek them out? Brothers! Sisters! Shall we seek them out?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roar that answered him felt like a physical blow, but he welcomed it. Their anger is without measure. Their justness is unassailable. Kadagar is right. We shall win through .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faced the ruined gate, glared at the breach. Drawing his sword, he held it high. ‘Seventh Legion, Arrow Formation! Who leads?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA harsh voice called out behind him. ‘I lead, Aparal Forge! Gaelar Throe shall lead!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaelar. I should have known . ‘Gaelar. There is a commander among the humans. Find him. Kill him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I so vow, Aparal Forge! I so vow!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power massing behind him made Aparal tremble. This assault would sweep aside the humans. Up and into the forest beyond. To the city itself. The palace splashed in blood. The Son of Light triumphant upon the Throne, Sceptre in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if Mother Dark dwelt in the temple, they would kill her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-178.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
