The Overseer could see hospital tents rising along the near side, the canvas sides bright in the morning light. Above another hill, north of the train’s camp, wheeled two hawks or perhaps eagles. The sky was otherwise empty, a span of deep blue slowly paling as the sun climbed higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButterflies flitted among small yellow flowers-their wings matched precisely the colour of the petals, Brohl realized, surprised that he had not noted such a detail before. Nature understands disguise and deceit. Nature reminds us what it is to survive. The Tiste Edur had well grasped those truths-grey as the shadows from which they had been born; grey as the boles of the trees in the murky forests of this world; grey as the shrouds of dusk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What have we forgotten?’ he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Arapay war leader-a Preda-turned his helmed head, the scarred face beneath its jutting rim hidden in shadow. ‘Overseer? We are positioned as you commanded-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never mind,’ Brohl Handar cut in, inexplicably irritated by the veteran’s attention. ‘What is the guard at the camp?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Four hundred mixed infantry,’ the warrior replied, then shrugged. ‘These Letherii are ever confident.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Comes with overwhelming superiority,’ another Arapay drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first Preda nodded. ‘I do well recall, old friend, the surprise on their faces the day we shattered them outside Letheras. As if, all at once, the world revealed itself to be other than what they had always believed. That look-it was disbelief.’ The warrior grunted a laugh. ‘Too busy with their denial to adapt when it was needed most.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Enough of this,’ Brohl Handar snapped. ‘The Atri-Preda’s forces have engaged the Awl-can you not hear?’ He twisted on his saddle and squinted eastward. ‘See the dust.’ He was silent for a dozen heartbeats, then he turned to the first Arapay Preda. ‘Take two cohorts to the camp. Four hundred Letherii are not enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Overseer, what if we are called on to reinforce the Atri-Preda?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If we are, then this day is lost. I have given you my order.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nod, and the Preda spurred his horse towards the arrayed Edur warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl Handar studied the K’risnan at his side for a moment. The bent creature sat hunched in his saddle like a bloated crow. He was hooded, ho doubt to hide the twisted ravaging of his once-handsome features. A chief’s son, transformed into a ghastly icon of the chaotic power before which the Tiste Edur now knelt. He saw the figure twitch. ‘What assails you?’ the Overseer demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Something, nothing.’ The reply was guttural, the words misshaped by a malformed throat. It was the sound of pain, enduring and unyielding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Which?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother twitch, passing, Brohl realized, for a shrug. ‘Footfalls on dead land.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘An Awl war-party?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’ The hooded head pivoted until the shadow-swallowed face was directed at the Overseer. ‘Heavier.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once Brohl Handar recalled the enormous taloned tracks found at the destroyed homestead. He straightened, one hand reaching for the Arapay scimitar at his side. ‘Where? Which direction?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause, then the K’risnan pointed with a clawed hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards the supply camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere sudden screams erupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Cohorts at the double!’ Brohl Handar bellowed. ‘K’risnan, you and your warlocks-with me!’ With that he spurred his horse, kicking the startled beast into a canter, then a gallop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, he saw, the Arapay Preda who had been escorting the two cohorts had already commanded them into a half-jog. The warrior’s helmed head turned and tracked the Overseer and his cadre of mages as they pounded past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, the braying of terrified oxen and mules rose, mournful and helpless, above the sounds of slaughter. Tents had gone down, guide-ropes whipping into the air, and Brohl saw figures now, fleeing the camp, pelting northward-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– where a perfect Awl ambush awaited them. Rising from the high grasses. Arrows, javelins, sleeting through the air. Bodies sprawling, tumbling, then the savages, loosing war-cries, rushing to close with spears, axes and swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing to be done for them-poor bastards. We need to save our supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the faint slope and rode hard towards the row of hospital tents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast that burst into view directly before them was indeed a demon-an image that closed like talons in his mind-the shock of recognition. Our ancient enemy-it must be-the Edur cannot forget- \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-184.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
