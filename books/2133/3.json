Wulfgar\u0027s features remained strong, but boyish, despite the ruddiness of his skin from tendays at sea. To the more discerning observer, though, there loomed in Wulfgar\u0027s eyes a resonance that denied the youthful appearance, a sadness wrought of bitter experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat melancholy was not with him now, though, for up there, on the prow of Sea Sprite, Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, felt the same rush of adrenaline he\u0027d known all those years growing up in Icewind Dale, all those years learning the ways of his people, and all those years fighting beside Drizzt. The exhilaration could not be denied; this was the way of the warrior, the proud and tingling anticipation before the onset of battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd battle would soon be joined, the barbarian did not doubt, Far ahead, across the sparkling waters, Wulfgar saw the sails of the running pirate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this Bloody Keel, Sheila Kree\u0027s boat? Was his warhammer mighty Aegis-fang, the gift of his adoptive father, in the hands a pirate aboard that ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar winced as he considered the question, at the myriad of feelings that the mere thought of once again possessing Aegis-fang brought up inside him. He\u0027d left Delly Curtie and Colson, the baby girl they\u0027d taken in as their own daughter, back in Waterdeep. They were staying at Captain Deudermont\u0027s beautiful home while he had come out with Sea Sprite for the express purpose of regaining the warhammer. Yet, the thought of Aegis-fang, of what he might do once he had the weapon back in his grasp, was, at that time, still beyond Wulfgar\u0027s swirling sensibilities. What did the warhammer mean, really?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat warhammer, a gift from Bruenor, had been meant as a symbol of the dwarf\u0027s love for him, of the dwarfs recognition that Wulfgar had risen above his stoic and brutal upbringing to become a better warrior, and more importantly, a better man. But had Wulfgar, really? Was he deserving of the warhammer, of Bruenor\u0027s love? Certainly the events since his return from the Abyss would argue against that. Over the past months Wulfgar hadn\u0027t done many things of which he was proud and had an entire list of accomplishments, beginning with his slapping Catti-brie\u0027s face, that he would rather forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so this pursuit of Aegis-fang had come to him as a welcome relief, a distraction that kept him busy, and positively employed for a good cause, while he continued to sort things out. But if Aegis-fang was on that boat ahead, or the next one in line, and Wulfgar retrieved it, where would it lead? Was his place still waiting for him in Icewind Dale among his former friends? Would he return to a life of adventure and wild battles, living on the edge of disaster with Drizzt and the others?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar\u0027s thoughts returned to Delly and the child. Given the new reality of his life, given those two, how could he return to that previous life? What did such a reversion mean regarding his responsibilities to his new family?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barbarian gave a laugh, recognizing that it was far more than responsibilities hindering him, though he didn\u0027t often admit it, even to himself. When he had first taken the child from Auckney, a minor kingdom nestled in the eastern reaches of the Spine of the World, it had been out of responsibility, it had been because the person he truly was (or wanted to be again!) demanded of him that he not let the child suffer the sins of the or the cowardice and stupidity of the father, had been responsibility that had taken him back to the Cutlass tavern in Luskan, a debt owed to his former friends, Arumn, Delly, and even Josi Puddles, whom he had surely let down with his drunken antics. Asking Delly to come along with him and the child had been yet another impulse wrought of responsibility - he had seen the opportunity to make some amends for his wretched treatment of the poor woman, and so he had offered her a new road to explore. In truth, Wulfgar hadn\u0027t given the decision to ask Delly along much thought at all, and even after her surprising acceptance, the barbarian had not understood how profoundly her choice would come to affect his life. Because now . . . now his relationship with Delly and their adopted child had become something more. This child he had taken out of generosity - and, in truth, because Wulfgar had instinctively recognized that he needed the generosity more than the child ever would - had become to him his daughter, his own child. In every way. Much as he had long ago become the child of Bruenor Battlehammer. Never before had Wulfgar held even a hint of the level of vulnerability the new title, father, had brought to him. Never had he imagined that anyone could truly hurt him, in any real way. Now all he had to do was look into Colson\u0027s blue eyes, so much like her real mother\u0027s, and Wulfgar knew his entire world could be destroyed about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, with Delly Curtie, the barbarian had come to understand that he\u0027d taken on more than he\u0027d bargained for. This woman he\u0027d invited to join him, again in the spirit of generosity and as a denial of the thug he\u0027d become, was now something much more important than a mere traveling companion. In the months since their departure from Luskan, Wulfgar had come to see Delly Curtie in a completely different light, had come to see the depth of her spirit and the wisdom that had been buried beneath the sarcastic and gruff exterior she\u0027d been forced to assume in order to survive in her miserable existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly had told him of the few glorious moments she had known - and none of those had been in the arms of one of her many lovers. She told him of the many hours she\u0027d spent along the quiet wharves of Luskan before having to force herself to begin her nights at the Cutlass. There she\u0027d sit and watch the sun sinking into the distant ocean, seeming to set all the water ablaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly loved the dusk - the quiet hour, she called it - when the daytime folk of Luskan returned home to their families and the nighttime crowd had not yet awakened to the bustle of their adventurous but ultimately empty nights. In the months he\u0027d known Delly at the Cutlass, in the nights they\u0027d spent in each others\u0027 arms, Wulfgar had never begun to imagine that there was so much more to her, that she was possessed of hopes and dreams, and that she held such a deep understanding of the people around her. When men bedded her, they often thought her an easy target, tossing a few words of compliment to get their prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Wulfgar came to understand about Delly was that none of those words, none of that game, had ever really meant anything to her. Her one measure of power on the streets was her body, and so she used it to gain favor, to gain knowledge, to gain security, in a place lacking in all three. How strange it seemed to Wulfgar to recognize that while all the men had believed they were taking advantage of Delly\u0027s ignorance, she was, in fact, taking advantage of their weakness in the face of lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Delly Curtie could play the \"using\" game as well as any, and that was why this blossoming relationship seemed so amazing to him. Because Delly wasn\u0027t using him at all, he knew, and he wasn\u0027t using her. For the first time in all their history together, the two had merely been sharing each others\u0027 company, honestly and without pretense, without an agenda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Wulfgar would be a liar indeed if he couldn\u0027t admit that he was enjoying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA liar Wulfgar would be indeed, and a coward besides, if he couldn\u0027t admit that he\u0027d fallen in love with Delly Curtie. Thus, the couple had married. Not formally, but in heart and soul, and Wulfgar knew that this woman, this unlikely companion, had completed him in ways he had never known possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Killer banner up!\" came a call from the crow\u0027s nest, meaning that this was indeed a pirate vessel ahead of Sea Sprite, for in her arrogance, she was flying a recognized pirate pennant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith nothing but open water ahead, the ship had no chance of escape. No vessel on the Sword Coast could outrun Sea Sprite, especially with the powerful wizard Robillard sitting atop the back of the flying bridge, summoning gusts of wind repeatedly into the schooner\u0027s mainsail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar took a deep breath, and another, but found little in them to help steady his nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/ am a warrior! he reminded himself, but that other truth, that he was a husband and a father, would not be so easily put down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow strange this change in heart seemed to him. Just a few months before, he had been the terror of Luskan, throwing himself into fights with abandon, reckless to the point of self-destructive. But that was when he had nothing to lose, when he believed that death would take away the pain. Now, it was something even greater than those things he had to lose, it was the realization that if he perished out here, Delly and Colson would suffer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for what? the barbarian had to ask himself. For a warhammer, a symbol of a past he wasn\u0027t even sure he wanted to recapture?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar grabbed tight to the line running back to the foremast, clenching it so tightly his knuckles whitened from the press, and again took in a deep and steadying breath, letting it out as a feral growl. Wulfgar shook the thoughts away, recognizing them as anathema to the heart of a true warrior. Charge in bravely, that was his mantra, his code, and indeed, that was the way a true warrior survived. Overwhelm your enemies, and quickly, and you will likely walk away. Hesitation only provided opportunity for the enemy to shoot you down with arrows and spears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHesitation, cowardice, would destroy him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSea Sprite gained quickly on the vessel, and soon it could be seen clearly as a two-masted caravel. How fast that pirate insignia pennant came down when the ship recognized its pursuer!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSea Sprite\u0027s rear catapult and forward ballista both let fly, neither scoring a hit of any consequence, and the pirate responded with a catapult shot of its own, a meager thing that fell far short of the approaching hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A second volley?\" Captain Deudermont asked his ship\u0027s wizard. The captain was a tall and straight-backed man with a perfectly trimmed goatee that was still more brown than gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To coax?\" Robillard replied. \"Nay, if they\u0027ve a wizard, he is too cagey to be baited, else he would have shown himself already. Move into true range and let fly, and so will I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont nodded and lifted his spyglass to his eye to better see the pirate - and he could make out the individuals on the deck now, scrambling every which way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSea Sprite closed with every passing second, her sails gathering up the wind greedily, her prow cutting walls of water high into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont looked behind, to his gunners manning the catapult on the poop deck. One used a spyglass much like the captain\u0027s own, lining up the vessel with a marked stick set before him. He lowered the glass to see the captain and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let fly for mainsail,\" Deudermont said to the crewman beside him, and the cry went out, gaining momentum and volume, and both catapult and ballista let fly again. This time, a ball of burning pitch clipped the sails and rigging of the pirate, who was bending hard into a desperate turn, and the ballista bolt, trailing chains, tore through a sail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later came a brilliant flash, a streak of lightning from Robillard that smacked the pirate\u0027s hull at the water line, splintering wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going defensive!\" came Robillard\u0027s cry, and he enacted a semitranslucent globe about him and rushed to the prow, shoving past Wulfgar, who was moving amidships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA responding lightning bolt did come from the pirate, not nearly as searing and bright as Robillard\u0027s. Sea Sprite\u0027s wizard, considered among the very finest of sea-fighting mages in all Faerun, had his shields in place to minimize the damage to no more than a black scar on the side of Sea Sprite\u0027s prow, one of many badges of honor the proud pirate hunter had earned in her years of service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pirate continued its evasive turn, but Sea Sprite, more nimble by far, cut right inside her angle, closing even more rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont smiled as he considered Robillard, the wizard nibbing his fingers together eagerly, ready to drop a series of spells to counter any defenses, followed by a devastating fireball that would consume rigging and sails, leaving the pirate dead in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pirates would likely surrender soon after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA row of archers lined Sea Sprite\u0027s side rail, with several standing forward, as obvious targets, Robillard had placed enchantments on these few, making them impervious to unenchanted arrows, and so they were the brave ones inviting the shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Volley as we pass!\" the group leader commanded, and every man and woman began checking their draw and their arrows, finding ones that would fly straight and true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, Wulfgar paced nervously, anxiously. He wanted this to be done - a perfectly reasonable and rational desire - and yet he cursed himself for those feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pop to steady yer hands?\" one greasy crewman said to him, holding forth a small bottle of rum, which the boarding party had been passing around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar stared at the bottle long and hard. For months he had hidden inside one of those seemingly transparent things. For months he had bottled up his fears and his horrible memories, a futile attempt to escape the truth of his life and his past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and went back to pacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later came the sound of twenty bowstrings humming, the cries of many pirates, and of a couple from Sea Sprite\u0027s crew, hit by the exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar knew he should be moving into position with the rest of the boarding party, and yet he found he could not. His legs would not walk past conjured images of Delly and Colson. How could he be doing this? How could he be out here, chasing a warhammer, while they waited back in Waterdeep?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe questions sounded loudly and horribly in Wulfgar\u0027s mind. All he had once been screamed back at him. He heard the name of Tempus, the barbarian god of war, pounding in his head, telling him to deny his fears, telling him to remember who he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roar that sent those men closest to him scurrying in fear, Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, charged for the rail, and though no boarding party had been called and though Robillard was even then preparing his fiery blast and though the two ships were still a dozen feet apart, with Sea Sprite fast passing, the furious barbarian leaped atop that rail and sprang forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCries of protest sounded behind him, cries of surprise and fear sounded before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the only cry Wulfgar heard was his own. \"Tempus!\" he bellowed, denying his fears and his hesitance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tempus!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Deudermont rushed to Robillard and grabbed the skinny wizard, pinning his arms to his side and interrupting his spellcasting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fool!\" Robillard shouted as soon as he opened his eyes, to see what had prompted the captain\u0027s interference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that the wizard was surprised, for Wulfgar had been a thorn in Robillard\u0027s side ever since he\u0027d joined up with the crew. Unlike his old companions, Drizzt and Catti-brie, this barbarian simply did not seem to understand the subtleties of wizardly combat. And, to Robillard\u0027s thinking, wizardly combat was all-important, certainly far above the follies of meager warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard pulled free of Deudermont. \"I will be throwing the fireball soon enough,\" he insisted. \"When Wulfgar is dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont was hardly listening. He called out to his crew to bring Sea Sprite about and called to his archers to find angles for their shots that they might lend aid to the one-man boarding party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar clipped the rail as he went aboard the pirate ship, tripping forward onto the deck. On came pirate swordsmen, rolling like water to cover him - but he was up and roaring, a long length of chain held in each hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closest pirate slashed with a sword and scored a hit against the barbarian\u0027s shoulder, though Wulfgar quickly got his forearm up and pressed out, stopping the blade from doing more than a surface cut. The barbarian pumped out a right cross as he parried, hitting the man hard in the chest, lifting him from his feet and throwing him across the deck, where he lay broken on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChains snapping and smashing, roaring to his god, the barbarian went into a rampage, scattering pirates before him. They had never seen anything like this before, a nearly seven-foot-tall wild man, and so most fled before his thunderous charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut went one length of chain, entwining a pair of legs, and Wulfgar gave a mighty jerk that sent the poor pirate flying to the deck. Out went the second length of chain, rolling about the shoulder of a man to Wulfgar\u0027s left, going completely around him to snap up and smack him in the chest. Wulfgar\u0027s tug took a considerable amount of skin from that one, and sent him into a fast-descending spin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run away!\" came the cries before him. \"Oh, but a demon he is!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth his chains were entangled quickly enough, so Wulfgar dropped them and pulled a pair of small clubs from his belt. He leaped forward and cut fast to the side, catching one pirate, obviously the leader of the deck crew and the most heavily armored of the bunch, against the rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pirate slashed with a fine sword, but Wulfgar jumped back out of reach, then reversed stride with another roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp came a large, fine shield, and that should have been enough, but never before had this warrior faced the primal fury of Wulfgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barbarian\u0027s first smash against the shield numbed the pirate\u0027s arm. Wulfgar\u0027s second blow bent in the top of the shield and drove the blocking arm low. His third strike took the defense away all together, and his fourth, following so quickly his opponent hadn\u0027t even found the opportunity to bring his sword back in, smacked the pirate on the side of his helmet and staggered him to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar bore in, raining a series of blows that left huge dents in the fine armor and that sent the pirate stumbling to the deck. He had barely hit the planking though, before Wulfgar grabbed him by the ankle and jerked him back up, feet first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA twist and a single stride had the mighty barbarian standing at the rail, the armored pirate hanging in midair over the side. Wulfgar held him there, with hardly any effort, it seemed, and with only one arm. The barbarian eyed the rest of the crew dangerously. Not a man approached, and not an archer lifted a bow against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the flying bridge, though, there did indeed come a challenge, and Wulfgar turned to see the pirate wizard, staring at him while in the throes of spellcasting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flick of Wulfgar\u0027s wrist sent his remaining club spinning at the man, and the wizard had to dodge aside, interrupting his own spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now Wulfgar was unarmed, and the pirate crew seemed recovered from the initial shock of his overwhelming charge. The pirate captain appeared, promising a horde of treasure to the one who brought the barbarian giant down. The wizard was back into casting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea scum approached, murder in their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they stopped and stood straighter, and some dropped their weapons, as Sea Sprite glided alongside their ship right behind the barbarian, archers ready, boarding party ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobillard let fly another lightning bolt that smashed the distracted pirate wizard, driving him right over the far rail of the ship and into the cold sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne pirate called for a charge, but was stopped short as a pair of arrows thudded into his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSea Sprite\u0027s crew was too well trained, too disciplined, too experienced. The fight was over before it had even really begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can probably bring him back over the rail,\" Deudermont said to Wulfgar a short while later, with the barbarian still standing there, holding the armored pirate upside-down above the short expanse of water between the ships, though Wulfgar was now using two hands, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, do!\" the embarrassed pirate demanded, lifting the cage visor of his expensive helm. \"I am the Earl of Taskadale Manor! I demand - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a pirate,\" Deudermont said to him, simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bit of adventure and nothing more,\" the man replied haughtily. \"Now please have your ogre friend put me down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the captain could say a word, Wulfgar went into a half spin and sent the earl flying across the deck, to smack the mainmast with a great clang and roll right around it, crumbling down in a noisy lump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earl of Taskadale, whatever that might be,\" Deudermont remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not impressed,\" Wulfgar replied, and he started away, to the plank that would take him back to Sea Sprite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fuming Robillard was waiting for him on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who instructed you to board?\" the furious wizard demanded. \"They could have been taken with a single spell!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then cast your spell, wizard,\" Wulfgar grumbled at him, striding right past, having no time to explain his emotions and impulses to another when he hadn\u0027t even sorted them out for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not think that next time I shan\u0027t!\" Robillard yelled at him, but Wulfgar just went on his way. \"And pity Wulfgar when burning pieces of sail rain down upon his head, lighting his hair and curling his skin! Pity Wulfgar when - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rest easy,\" Deudermont remarked, coming up behind the wizard. \"The pirate is taken and not a crewman lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As it would have been,\" Robillard insisted, \"with less chance. Their magical defenses were down, their sails exposed. I had - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough, my friend,\" Deudermont interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That one, Wulfgar, is a fool,\" Robillard replied. \"A barbarian indeed! A savage to his heart and soul, and with no better understanding of tactics and advantage than an orc might hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeudermont, who had sailed with Wulfgar before and who knew well the dark elf who had trained this warrior, knew better. But he said nothing, just let the always-grumpy Robillard play out his frustration with a string of curses and protests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, Captain Deudermont was beginning to rethink the decision to allow Wulfgar to join Sea Sprite\u0027s crew, though he certainly believed he owed that much to the man, out of friendship and respect. Wulfgar\u0027s apparent redemption had struck well the heart of Captain Deudermont, for he had seen the man at his lowest point, on trial before the vicious magistrates of Luskan for attempting to assassinate Deudermont.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain hadn\u0027t believed the charge then - that was the only reason Wulfgar was still alive - though he had recognized that something terrible had happened to the noble warrior, that some unspeakable event had dropped Wulfgar to the bottom of the lowest gutter. Deudermont had been pleased indeed when Wulfgar had arrived at the dock in Waterdeep, asking to come aboard and join the crew, asking Deudermont to help him in retrieving the mighty warhammer that Bruenor Battlehammer had crafted for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was clear to the captain, though, that the scars of Wulfgar\u0027s pain had not yet fully healed. His charge back there had been reckless and foolish and could have endangered the entire crew. That, Captain Deudermont could not tolerate.
