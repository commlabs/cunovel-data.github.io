The item had been on my to-do list. Along with a whole bunch of other things I couldn\u0027t quite remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood and crossed to the window, peering at the second floor of the antiques store. A light was on inside, but no shadows moved beyond the curtains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I should see if they\u0027re okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wouldn\u0027t they be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned at Jessie\u0027s words. \"You\u0027ve never told me why you came to Fairhaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of them exchanged glances.

Uh-oh. I opened my mouth to explain, and Will jumped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there hasn\u0027t been an increase in the wolf population to account for the vanishing citizens. Damien says there aren\u0027t any werewolves here at all, except for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No werewolves?\" I glanced at Damien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No wolves of any kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are wolves all over this part of the state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except in Fairhaven,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only reason for no wolves in a place like this would be werewolves,\" I murmured. \"They don\u0027t like one another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" Damien agreed. \"So what does it mean if there\u0027s neither one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea, but I doubted it meant anything good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0027s seen any wolves,\" Leigh continued, \"but the forest is full of crows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrows and wolves work together in nature. Wolves tolerated the birds, even let them feed off their kills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn return, many naturalists believe crows fly ahead of the packs, leading them to prey. The behavior transfers to werewolves. Where there\u0027s a lot of one, there\u0027s a lot of the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own fascination with the large, black scavengers had begun in childhood. While many people used them for target practice, I\u0027d drawn pictures of crows over and over again. When I got older, I began to collect figurines, paintings, stuffed animals - like the one Nic had found on my desk. Heckle and Jeckle had been my favorite cartoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder Edward had kept such a close eye on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I\u0027m out in the woods,\" Damien murmured. \"I sense... I\u0027m not sure. It\u0027s as if something\u0027s coming, or maybe just left. I feel watched even when I\u0027m certain nothing\u0027s there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d say he was paranoid, except I\u0027d felt something, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you shooting at when I got here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shadows,\" Jessie muttered. \"We\u0027re all spooked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich wasn\u0027t like them. Werewolf hunters were the least spookable creatures on earth. They had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw my expression, must have read my mind. \"I can kill anything I see. But what am I supposed to do when I know it\u0027s there, but it isn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no answer for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Axe you sufficiently brought up to speed, Elise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s voice from the doorway made me gasp and spin around. \"I hate when you sneak up on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he could was amazing in itself. I had the hearing of a wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced past Edward, searching for Nic, my mind already scrambling for a way to explain our discussion of disappearing bodies. But my boss was alone, and that made me more nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know damn well who!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed, and I swallowed the rest of the angry words that threatened to spill off my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d get me nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is Agent Franklin, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart skipped, then lunged into my throat. \"You didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That depends on what you think I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go around killing FBI agents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"Why would I do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because your answer to every problem is to shoot it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has always worked well for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t just stand around while Nic might be dead or dying. I started for the door, and Edward yanked me back. \"Relax. He is safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped my arm immediately, surreptitiously rubbing his fingers against his black pants. Though I\u0027d been expecting it, Edward\u0027s typical reaction to being anywhere near me hurt more than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only man who had ever touched me gently, willingly, was Nic - and he didn\u0027t know what I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing him again made me long for what I didn\u0027t, and couldn\u0027t, have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By safe you mean - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alive,\" Edward snapped. \"I am not completely senile. Yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Yet being the operative word,\" Jessie muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed, anticipating an explosion of German obscenities. Instead, Edward smirked, winked, and the two of them chuckled. I stifled my childish jealousy. He would never care for me the way he cared for Jessie or Leigh, and I\u0027d better get used to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward glanced at the Fitzgeralds. \"I thought I sent you two... elsewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wanted to hear the story of why your second in command turns furry every month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last flicker of humor fled his eyes as he glanced at me. \"You told them everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everything. There were certain secrets only Edward and I could ever know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told them the basics so they wouldn\u0027t shoot me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were ordered to leave you alone.\" He fixed the others with a glare. \"Elise is beyond your reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe answers only to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"La-di-dah,\" Jessie mumbled. \"There isn\u0027t a scratch on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not for lack of trying,\" Will countered, taking her hand when she would have slugged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward scowled at Jessie, then Leigh. \"You are not to play games with Elise. No physical fighting, do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warm glow began in my chest. Edward was worried about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She could kill you without even trying,\" he continued, and the glow died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was worried about them. I should have known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I talk to you?\" Damien jerked his head. \"Outside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the others, but they were studiously avoiding my gaze. Except for Edward, who merely rolled his eyes and shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien preceded me onto the porch, where he pondered the sky for several moments. I didn\u0027t press. I was just glad to get away from everyone else for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more to your story than you told them,\" he said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t there always?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes met and a flash of understanding, a tug of camaraderie, passed between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is Mandenauer to you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised by the question. \"My boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was the father I didn\u0027t have, the mother, too. Even if he didn\u0027t love me, more than likely hated me, he was the only constant I\u0027d ever had in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How close are you, really?\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I thought he was asking again about me and Edward. Did everyone believe the old man and I were lovers? Hadn\u0027t they seen the way he treated me? Worse than a junior agent. Then I studied Damien\u0027s face and understood he meant something else entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To an antidote?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t wait for his answer. This was why he\u0027d asked me outside. He didn\u0027t want Leigh to know if I was further away from a cure than they thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t discovered anything new,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDismay filled his eyes, and I touched him before I thought not to. Power blazed - bright, blinding, painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snatched my hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have to watch that,\" I said. \"It hurts\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never touched any of my test subjects skin to skin. I couldn\u0027t afford to have them know what I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0027d been other times, other places, where I had touched a werewolf in human form. They hadn\u0027t lived to see another moon, or blow my cover, but my secret was safe with Damien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will find a cure,\" I promised. \"Count on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel better knowing...\" His voice drifted off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I have a personal interest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could desire a cure more than me - not even Damien. Leigh loved him despite what he was. I didn\u0027t have that luxury. No one loved me, and while I was like this, no one would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never doubted you weren\u0027t working as hard as you could,\" Damien said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither one of us jumped at the sound of Leigh\u0027s voice. I\u0027d heard her coming, and so had Damien. She wasn\u0027t as sneaky as Edward. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leigh - \" Damien began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me talk.\" She moved onto the porch and stood between us. \"I never trusted you, Doctor, and now I know why. Werewolves murdered my family. I don\u0027t like them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet you\u0027re married to one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flashed, and her fingers curled into fists. \"We can\u0027t help who we love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeigh cast me a quick glance, and her fingers relaxed. I understood her dilemma. She both loved Damien and hated his curse. She wanted him cured, needed him to be, and she had to depend on someone she distrusted to do it. Whoever said life was fair?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She saved you, Leigh. Show a little gratitude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thanked her. What do you want?\" Leigh tilted her head in my direction. \"A hug?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never been big on physical contact. Never knew when a simple touch, like Damien\u0027s, could give me a blistering headache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze was drawn to the throbbing pulse at the base of Leigh\u0027s neck - or an intense desire for red meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might be able to control my craving for human blood through medication, but that didn\u0027t mean I wasn\u0027t blindsided by a longing for it at the oddest moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeigh didn\u0027t trust me? Hell, I didn\u0027t trust myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just so we\u0027re clear,\" she continued. \"I want you to quit dicking around and fix him.

There\u0027s been a significant increase in werewolf activity pretty much everywhere over the past few days. Edward\u0027s cell phone\u0027s ringing like crazy.
