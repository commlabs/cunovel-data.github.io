It sounded like she was in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hit the transmit button. “I’m not turning back. I’ve got—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arc of electricity leaped from the radio receiver to his ear. Yelping out, he dropped the radio. He smelled burning hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a surge of static charge throughout the vehicle. Every surface shocked him. He kept his hands on the rubber-coated wheel. The laptop sizzled, then gave off a loud pop. The screen went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a foghorn reached him, blaring, persistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a foghorn…a truck’s horn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the side mirror. From the storm’s black wall, the pursuit truck flew out into the open. The last winds slapped the back end. Its frame tilted, beginning to flip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was free. It struck the sands, the tires on one side, then the other. It bounced, skidded, and spun a full turn. But it was out of the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truck’s driver must have been as shocked to be alive as Painter was to see him. The flatbed idled. It looked like hell. One tire was flat, the bumper was curled into a steel smile, the tarp over its load in back had been blown to one side, tangled amid the ropes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter pressed his accelerator, racing forward, putting as much distance between himself and the truck. He remembered the RPG bombardment. He wanted a little breathing room, then he’d take care of this truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the side mirror, the truck followed, limping after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter prepared to fight, setting the cruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead the desert was a forest of whirling sand devils, glowing in the twilight gloom. They all seemed to be on the move now. He frowned. They were all moving in unison, some unearthly ballet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he felt it. A familiar lurch in the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had felt the same when the grenades had triggered an avalanche over the dune face. The shift of sands under his treads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was on flat ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll around the whirlwinds danced, static electricity sparked, and the desert loosened under him. Against all odds, the twenty-ton tractor was becoming mired. His speed slowed. He felt its back end fishtailing. The tractor swung around, dragged by unknown forces. Then he was trapped, stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis side window now faced toward the pursuit truck. It continued toward him, closing in on its wide, knobby sand tires. Then the sand under it became powder. It sank to its rims…then axle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBogged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth hunter and prey were trapped, flies in amber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this amber still flowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt it beneath him. The sand was still moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:15 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS AFIA GAVE up on the radio. She could only watch in horror, alongside Kara and Lu’lu. It was a landscape out of a nightmare, a painting done by Salvador Dalí. The world melted and stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared out at the whirlwinds, the deadly electrical discharges, pools of black sands, streaks of the same, carved out by skittering devils. The dusty clouds in the sky glowed from the amount of energy flowing into them, fed by the snaking columns of sand and static charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was not the worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor as far as she could see, the entire desert floor had begun to churn in one giant whirlpool, spinning around the buried bubble of Ubar. The sandstone mesa was a boulder in the current. But there were smaller rocks: Painter’s tractor and another truck, mired in the churning sands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhirlwinds closed in on the vehicles, etching the sand with molten fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crash echoed to the left. A piece of the mesa tore away, tumbling into the sand, a glacier calving into the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t stay here,” Kara said. “It’ll tear this island apart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Painter…” Safia said. Her clothing sparked and crackled with discharges as she stepped toward the mesa’s edge. He had come to rescue them, driving to his doom. They had to do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s on his own,” Kara said. “We can’t help him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio suddenly crackled in her hand. She had forgotten she was holding it. Painter…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Safia, can you hear me?” It was Omaha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her radio. “I’m here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice sounded distant, as if from another planet. “Something strange is going on down here. The static is arcing all over. It’s zapping the glass. Melting spots. It’s the cataclysm all over again! Stay away!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you get up here? To the stairs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Danny, Clay, Coral, and I are holing up in the palace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA commotion by the tunnel drew her eye. Sharif climbed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara moved to meet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to the tunnel. “We’ve retreated to the stairs,” he said, panting. “Captain al-Haffi will attempt to hold the enemy off. You should—” His voice died as he suddenly caught a view of the desert. His eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother splintering crack erupted. Rocks crashed. The rim of the mesa crumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allah, preserve us,” Sharif prayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara waved him back. “He’d better. Because we’re bloody damn well running out of places to hide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:16 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC ASSANDRA KNEW true terror for the first time in ages. The last time she had felt this gut-level fear was as a child, listening to her father’s footsteps outside her bedroom door at midnight. This was the same. A fear that gelled the insides and turned bone marrow to ice. Breathing was a talent forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cowered inside a tiny glass building, more a chapel, enough for one person to kneel. Its only entrance was a short door that had to be ducked into. No windows. Past the door, the lower city spread below her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the continual arcing bolts of discharge. Some struck the lake, grew more intense, then sucked back to the roof, brighter for the effort, as if the storm above were feeding off the waters below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same was not true when it struck the glass. Every surface absorbed the strange energy, becoming a liquid pool, but only as briefly as a lightning flicker. Then it turned solid again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had watched one of her men succumb to such a bolt. He had been sheltering behind a wall, leaning on it. Then the bolt struck the wall. He fell through it, his support suddenly gone. The wall solidified again. Half his body on one side, the other half on this side. Between, he had been burned to bone. Even his clothes had caught fire, a human torch, on two sides of glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll across the city, the fighting had stopped. Men sought shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had seen the mummified bodies. They knew what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cavern had gone deathly quiet, accept for the occasional gunshot by the back wall, where the enemy had sequestered itself in some passageway. Anyone who approached was shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassanda clutched her electronic tracker. She watched the spread of red triangles. Her men. Or those few that were left. She counted. Of the fifty on the assault team, only a dozen were left. She watched as another blinked out. A shattering scream fluttered through the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath stalked her men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew even such enclosed shelters were not safe. She had seen the mummified bodies within a few of the homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key seemed to be movement. Perhaps the amount of static in the room was such that any stirrings attracted a bolt to stab out at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Cassandra sat still, very still. She had done the same in her childhood bed. It hadn’t helped then. She doubted it would now. She was trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:17 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO MAHA LAY flat at the entryway to the palace. The quiet pressed upon him. Beyond the courtyard, the firestorm worsened. Bolts crackled, shattering into brilliant forks. The dome shone like the corona of a blue-white sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha watched and knew death was near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at least he had told Safia he loved her. He had made his peace. He would have to be satisfied with that. He glanced upward. He prayed Safia was safe. She had relayed another short message, describing the chaos upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath above, death below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake your pick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoral lay with him, studying the storm. “We’re inside the world’s largest transformer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spoke in whispers, as if afraid to draw the sleeping giant’s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The glass cavern with its energized antimatter solution is acting like a massive insulated superconductor. It draws energy to itself like the iron camel did at the museum. In this case, it collects the static energy of any passing sandstorm, sucking it down from above. But as energy builds in the chamber, crossing some threshold, it must need to shed its excess energy, like lightning does during a thunderstorm. Only this is aimed from sand to sky, shooting upward again in immense discharges, creating those momentary blasts of deadly whirlwinds on the desert’s surface.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like it’s draining its battery,” Omaha said. “But what’s going on in here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A storm in a bottle. The megastorm is pouring too much energy down here. The bubble can’t discharge it fast enough, so some of it’s lashing back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zapping itself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Redistributing charge,” she corrected. “Glass is a great conductor. It merely takes the excess energy it can’t discharge to the surface and passes it down to the floor below. The glass here captures the energy and disperses it. A cycle to keep the charge spread evenly throughout the entire glass bubble rather than just the dome. It’s that equilibrium of energy that keeps the antimatter lake stable during this storm. A balance of charges.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about those pockets of molten glass?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think it’s molten glass. At least not exactly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha glanced questioningly in her direction. “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glass is always in a liquid state. Have you ever seen antique glass? The flowing streaks that slightly distort the clarity? Gravity affects glass like a liquid, slowly pulling it down in streams.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what does that have to do with what’s going on here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The energy bolts aren’t just melting the glass. They’re changing its state, instantaneously breaking all bonds, liquefying the glass to the point that it borders on gaseous. When the energy disperses, it resolidifies. But just for a flash, it’s in a fiery state between liquid and gas. That’s why it doesn’t flow. It keeps its basic shape.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sandstorm-sigma-force-1/page-86.html","bookId":1530,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM"}
