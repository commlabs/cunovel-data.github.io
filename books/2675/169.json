Believing above all else that Allie was alive and here in this hotel, five floors above a party thrown for her latest movie. Why in the world would she be holed up here? Hiding out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the pain in his eyes, knew that he didn’t want to believe that she’d lost all connection with sanity, that she was creating images that weren’t there, that she was hallucinating again and was easing her way back to a psychiatric ward. “I saw her, Trent, I did!” she said, nearly spitting out the words. Desperate to believe them herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cassie. This is . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nuts?” she supplied. “A half-baked fantasy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t answer. For half a heartbeat Cassie hesitated and then she said, “Well, you’re right. It is. But it’s my fantasy and I’m going to see it through and find my damned sister!” Spinning out of his arms, she grabbed the handle of the door and pushed hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her surprise it gave way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreaking inward to a dark void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allie?” she whispered, her voice cracking as she fumbled for the light switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overhead fixture snapped on. Bright light washed over a room that housed no one, just like the other rooms on this floor. The tattered carpet was dust-covered. A queen-sized bed with a bare mattress and a forgotten bubble-faced TV were the only furnishings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the balcony door was cracked, curtains billowing through the opening, and carelessly tossed over the battered headboard was a raincoat that appeared identical to one Cassie was sure belonged to her sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 34\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie Kramer stood on the dark corner. The wig she was wearing was sodden, the baggy sweatshirt and jeans wet as well, the rain coming down in buckets, and yet she was rooted to the ground, looking back at the hotel where the party for the release of Dead Heat was in full swing. She’d snuck into the hotel and done her part, pulled off her “appearance,” and before that, she’d managed to gain a peek at the setup for the party, where she should have been in the limelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the staging in the ballroom had soured her stomach—all those sets featuring her as Shondie Kent were disturbing. The worst had been seeing herself strapped down in a mental hospital. That image, though she’d played it, had chilled her to the bone. Even though she knew that these days patients weren’t physically restrained, being locked away like that was Allie’s worst nightmare and she couldn’t imagine how her sister had actually committed herself into a psych ward for a few weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, that was Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForever the drama queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike your bitch of a mother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t want to acknowledge what was so patently obvious. At least not while she was standing here in the frigid Oregon drizzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered, not for the first time, if she’d made a huge mistake agreeing to this sham. Things had escalated. Gotten ugly. Scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts skittered to her mother and she felt a pang of regret for the pain she was causing Jenna, but that jab of guilt quickly disintegrated, as it always did. Jenna didn’t deserve it. She’d lied to her children. To her husbands. Two-faced bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the thought of her older sister Allie’s blood boiled and she gritted her teeth. There had been a time when she’d looked up to Cassie, when she’d admired Cassie’s rebellious I-don’t-give-a-damn attitude, but everything had changed ten years ago in the aftermath of the maniac who had nearly killed Cassie and Jenna that cold, cold winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had both survived and clung to each other. Jenna had felt guilt that Cassie had nearly lost her life because of her mother. And Cassie, that thick-skinned rebel? She’d been reduced to a whimpering, frightened shell of her former self. Neither had time for the baby of the family. Neither seemed to notice that she, too, was hurting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaring down the street now, watching cars drive past the Hotel Danvers, seeing pedestrians hurrying along the sidewalk, observing the huge windows and veranda of the second story where Dean Arnette’s party was still going on, Allie tried and failed to tamp down her anger, the blinding rage that had stemmed from being ignored, from being the forgotten one, the girl who had faded into the background. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-169.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
