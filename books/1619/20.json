He realised the entire front of the RE8 had been wrenched off, ripped aside. His life was probably saved for a few seconds. The stove-hot engine was no longer three feet in front of his lap. Jolted out of its cowling, the contraption would have shot into the cockpit like a big bullet, punching through his soft body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop was pushed back into his seat by the force of the crash, then thrown forward into dark. Hard ground thumped him in the chest and face. He reflexively grabbed earth as if it were eiderdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis ears were still assaulted by the roar of the air and the grinding of the RE8 coming apart all around him. Something heavy fell on his back, forcing him further into the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goggles prevented his eyes from being mashed into his head but his mask was ribboned. Dirt went up his nose and into his mouth. A sharp spar worked its way through his Sidcot into his side. Every part of him hurt, as if he had been beaten about the belly, kidneys and groin. Death was a single breath, a heartbeat, away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat, he thought. Sorry for the silly letter ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his face from the ground, coughing and shaking loose matter from his mouth and nose. He breathed again. And again. His heart still beat. Maybe he would not die? Or maybe he was already dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was something like the plain of hell he had imagined as a child, listening to the Reverend Mr Kaye, Catriona\u0027s father. There were distant screams and pillars of fire, and a deep darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged violently, dislodging the broken wing-frame that had fallen on his back. His Sidcot tore as he extracted the spear-like end of a snapped strut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his knees, he froze, feeling only pain. His teeth rattled and were thickly smeared with blood and filth. He coughed and spat. His stomach rolled and emptied through his mouth. Being sick at least cleared his throat. He had no way of knowing which bones were broken and which just hurt. It might have been easier to determine which bones were unbroken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burst of intense light flared nearby, searing his eyes. Flame seemed to brush his face and dissipate in an instant. The engine had blown up but there wasn\u0027t enough fuel left to make a proper fire. Dribbles of flame spread along a dark shape revealed as the nose of the good old bloody old Harry Tate. The machine had died but somehow cherished his life to the last, bringing him alive to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should get away from the wreck before there was another explosion, but he couldn\u0027t move. He knelt, but it was as if his legs were anchored in the ground. His hammering heart slowed. Fumbling at his sooty face, he dislodged the remains of his goggles. It was as if the clouds parted. Moonlight flooded, spreading sickly. He pulled off his helmet and balaclava and wiped his face with the woolly rag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Man\u0027s Land was a mad landscape. Before the war, Winthrop had toured this country. It had been pleasantly wooded. Now there were no trees. The earth was pitted and cratered and denuded of all but the scrubbiest plant-life. Rolls of barbed wire were savagely strewn. The RE8 had gathered trails of the rusty stuff and dragged it, scratching deep ruts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMud-coloured corpses were beaten into the ground. A few feet away, a fanged skull in a pickelhaube lay on its side. It must have been there since the first push. The Boche didn\u0027t wear helmets like that any more. Winthrop tried not to make out disembodied limbs, tattered scraps of uniform, exposed bones. These former fields, fought over for four years, were seeded with millions of dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked his arms and legs and, though he found bruises and pain, thought his major bones intact. A bullet had creased his bootsole, burrowing like a worm. His sock was stiff with blood but the shot had done no more than tear his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, his right knee jolted pain. His Sidcot was torn and the pyjama trousers underneath were shredded, though his breeches were merely mashed into his leg. His footing wavered, as if on land after a month at sea. In the air, he had got used to the nothing under his feet. His balance was off but he struggled to recover it. His head swam and he blinked, yawning to open up his aching ears. He fought to regain his relationship with the solid ground, with gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA star-shell burst overhead. The brightness hurt his eyes. White trails showered like jellyfish tendrils. Such infernal devices were to light targets for night-snipers. With what seemed agonising slowness, he crouched against the broken side of the RE8, shadow wrapping around him. His ears still roared, so he could not be sure no one was shooting. The star-burst trails fizzled to the ground and he was still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at the skies for the bat-shapes. Would the Boche comb the wreckage for survivors? That was absurd. His survival was so unlikely and flopping down in No Man\u0027s Land so dangerous that even the Red Baron should leave him be. But he knew enough about vampires to guess the shape-shifted fliers would have their red thirst up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not deaf. Besides roaring and ringing, he heard engine noise. There was definitely a machine still in the sky. One of the Snipes. He wrenched off his helmet and shook gathered sweat out of his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was gunfire. Specks of light in the air. In the direction from which the engine sound was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see little, but imagined a fleeing Snipe, flying low, one of Richthofen\u0027s bat-staffel things on his tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore gunfire. Nearer. A machine passed over. He had the impression of swooping wings and wheels, a Snipe shimmering briefly in moonlight. He turned to follow the fighter\u0027s course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA silent shadow passed, spreading a heart-deep chill. Like a bottom-dweller looking up at a manta ray, Winthrop cringed as the Boche flew over, intent on his prey. The Snipe streaked towards the British lines, wings wavering. It was gaining a lead, leaving the Boche behind. The shape-shifter rose in the sky like a hawk, pouring down fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop couldn\u0027t look away. Fire took the fighter in the tail. The Snipe went into a sudden spin. The fire-burst hurt his eyes before he heard the explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Boche hovered over the crash, underside reddened by firelight. A hugely distended white belly bobbed from the bat\u0027s midriff, blue and red veins swarming through the membranous canopies of the wings. He had never seen a vampire so completely shifted from human shape. Not even Isolde was so far gone. Richthofen\u0027s flying freaks had fed on Dracula\u0027s blood. He understood Mata Hari\u0027s confession. The Germans were scientifically cross-breeding to create these monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Boche rose from his kill on warm air and slipped into the dark of the sky. Slowly, with great straining flaps of his wings, the vampire circled away, returning to the German lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop cursed the murderer\u0027s tail. Something in him had died in the crash. Panic burned away, freeing a lizard-like cool from within his brain. This was what it was like to be reborn as a predator. His priorities changed. Immediately, it was important he survive the night and get back to the Allied lines. Beauregard must be told about JG1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA painful step reminded him of his wounded knee. He needed a crutch. Stuck into the ground was the snapped-off blade of the Harry Tate\u0027s prop. It would do. At a pinch, it was sharp enough to pierce a vampire\u0027s heart. He wrapped his ruined helmet around the jagged end to pad it, and propped it under his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Snipe had been heading home. Now its fire was a beacon, signalling the direction he must take. He doubted the pilot would appreciate the use Winthrop was making of his flaming death but could afford no guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no point in looking for the RE8\u0027s cameras. They must be smashed. If it came to it, Winthrop could draw pictures. Every detail was burned into his memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set out, stumping towards the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlder, where he had grown up, was on the Somerset levels. In the wetlands, fields were divided by ditches rather than hedges. Outsiders often stood on the village green and assumed it a short walk across the moor to the church where Catriona\u0027s father was vicar. But if they took the \u0027short cut\u0027 rather than the winding lane, they would find themselves in a damp maze, forced to walk entirely around fields to find plank bridges laid over the ditches. It could take over an hour to cover the distance a crow could fly in a minute. No Man\u0027s Land by night was a similar matter of traps and blinds and dead ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop made his way methodically towards the Snipe\u0027s dwindling fire. After dawn he\u0027d be a crawling target for any Boche sniper who cared to draw a bead. Actually, his baggy Sidcot was so muddy it might easily be taken for German grey and earn him a bullet from some enthusiastic but misguided Tommy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not fret and swear when unbreachable tangles of wire or water-filled shell-holes barred his way. Patiently, he retraced his steps and found alternative routes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis new-mended watch was broken again, stopped at quarter to nine. Possibly, it was not yet ten o\u0027clock. Dog-fights rarely lasted more than a few minutes, though survivors often swore they had fought for upwards of an hour. There were hours before tomorrow\u0027s dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGround crunched and gave under his boots. He was walking on a horse that had been flattened like rolled-out dough. Birds had picked out the eye-sockets. The dead animal was alive with scavenging vermin. Squeaking rats writhed under their horsehide carpet and escaped in all directions. He didn\u0027t waste any effort on killing or hating rats. They were no worse than the human feeders-on-the-dead infesting this country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis knee hurt more. The rest of his pains lessened, if only by comparison. The top of his jury-rigged crutch tore his armpit. His toes were numbed and he hoped the chill would set in around his knee soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShells fell, but not too close. It was Allied policy to pour fire on No Man\u0027s Land by night, to discourage German excursions. As things stood, Winthrop considered the logic of the stratagem dubious, though he supposed it a mercy that he was unlikely to run into a lost scout out here in the mud. Even the most impoverished Boche would be equipped with a rifle and a bayonet and all he had to meet aggression was his trusty prop. This was such an impromptu jaunt he\u0027d not even thought to bring a revolver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Snipe was directly ahead, its fabric completely burned away. Red-hot metal parts glowed in the last of the fire. It was impossible to tell which of Cundall\u0027s Condors this had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe daredevil Courtney was dead. Plucked and sucked by the Bloody Red Baron. Almost certainly, Cundall himself had gone west. Not to mention all the Bs: Ball, Bigglesworth, Brown. And, for alphabetical variety, Bill Williamson. Condor Squadron would be crippled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shell whistled and burst within a hundred yards. A scattering of dirt pelted his face. It was horribly possible an artilleryman was sighting on the Snipe\u0027s blaze, just to have a bright target in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he returned, Winthrop would have suggestions to make which would, he felt, greatly improve the conduct of the war. After this picnic, he was entitled to bend Sir Douglas Haig\u0027s ear. He\u0027d look up the journalist Kate Reed. As a matter of fact, he\u0027d have looked her up anyway. An idea was forming, and Kate Reed was its budding heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her red hair and sharp tongue, Kate was the vampire Catriona might become. Dainty little fangs in an appealing overbite. Behind her specs, she was smart and resilient. She was the nearest thing to a vampire elder in his circle of acquaintance. He would need an elder. There was no doubt of that. A newborn would not do. The strength was in the bloodline. The Red Baron and his murderous crew were proof of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA trap closed on his ankle, barbs sinking into his boot. He wheeled around, lifting his propeller-crutch. He aimed to strike at the thing which held him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark, there was a human croak. Winthrop saw large eyes in a black, charred face. And shining white teeth, extended vampire incisors exposed by the burning away of the lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be a mercy to stab with the prop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe teeth parted with a hiss of breath. Another grip came, at his knee. The creature tried to climb up his leg, to haul itself upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the pilot. Winthrop couldn\u0027t tell which face this had been. The hiss died and the pilot let go of his leg, with an almost apologetic patting motion. The tatterdemalion stood, crookedly. From his twisted shape, he realised the vampire was Albert Ball. The pilot had survived another brush with Richthofen\u0027s Flying Freak Show, if barely. His Sidcot was fused with flesh, moulded black over his living bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good Lord,\u0027 Winthrop said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ruined leather of Ball\u0027s face made a smile. The pilot extended a contorted claw. Winthrop took the fragile hand and shook it, afraid fingers would snap off. He was grateful for the gauntlet that prevented him from touching the crackling greasiness of Ball\u0027s skin, but felt the cooked-through warmth of the pilot\u0027s grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ll have to get you home,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBall nodded his bald skull. His flying helmet was burned on to him. Cloud drifted across the moon. The darkness deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy himself, the chances had been slim enough. Now, Winthrop would have to get to the lines with the sorely wounded Ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese things were sent to try him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come on, old son,\u0027 he said to Ball. \u0027It\u0027s this way, I believe.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked towards the sound of the British guns. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bloody-red-baron-anno-dracula-2/page-20.html","bookId":1619,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:29 PM"}
