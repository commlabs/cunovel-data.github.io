But I shrugged, because I kind of missed them too. After I told her I’d swing by someday soon, Mason showed up, begging me to switch ends of the bar so he could flirt with his woman as he worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe band started their gig, and the place came to life, flooding with cheers and catcalls. City managed to stop at my end of the bar every time she filled an order, and she was always able to slip in a kiss when she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still feeling a high from her last one when Reese suddenly appeared in front of me, her eyes wide. “Knox,” she hissed, frantically waving me closer. I frowned but went to her. She leaned in and tried to call over all the noise as confidentially as possible. “Jeremy’s older brother just walked in the front door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over her shoulder and immediately caught sight of Tad Walden. He hadn’t changed much since the night he’d held back my arms to let City’s brothers hit me. And speaking of City’s brothers…was that Garrett Bainbridge strolling up to the bar with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed and muttered, “Shit,” under my breath. “Thanks for the warning.” I nodded gratefully to Reese right before she hurried away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the two approach, and then I intercepted them before they could go to Mason. “Can I help you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t recognize me. Not surprising. But my eyebrows did lift when Tad said, “We’re looking for Knox Parker. Heard he worked here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah? Where’d you hear that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, is he working tonight or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffed at his attitude. “As a matter of fact, I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir mouths dropped open. “Shit,” Garrett murmured as he looked me up and down. “You don’t look the same at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I’ve heard. What the fuck do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what I wanted. I wanted them gone before Felicity—or Rock—spotted them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We came to make amends.” Tad stuck out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter scowling at his palm, I lifted my gaze to his face. “Are you kidding me? Last time I saw you two, you beat the shit out of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because we’d just found you naked in the backseat of a car with my sister,” Garrett hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTad held up his hands. “And we now admit that we might’ve overreacted with the way we treated you. You didn’t deserve what happened to you after that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squinted, trying to figure out why he was trying to play peacekeeper. I’d killed his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “We saw the video of what happened between you and Jeremy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit.” I whirled away and wiped my hands over my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad anyone not seen that fucking video?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got a raw deal from all this,” Tad said. “And we wouldn’t blame you if you wanted to go after a certain few people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, we just don’t want those people to be us,” Garrett put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a snort, I shook my head. Unbelievable. They just wanted to cover their own asses. “Fine,” I muttered dryly as I turned back to them. “I’ll spare both your lives. That make you feel better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett opened his mouth, probably to say something else that would no doubt piss me off, but City showed up, plunking her empty tray on the bar top. “Damn, it’s busy tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother whirled toward her. “Felicity?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over and her jaw dropped. “Garrett? What’re you doing here?” Then her gaze zipped between me, him, and Tad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think he was trying to apologize for fucking up my life, except I never actually heard a sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett sent me a scowl before he returned his attention to City. “I should’ve known you two would find yourselves back together.” Then he shocked the shit out of me when he murmured, “Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCity shared a stunned arch of the eyebrows with me before she said, “So...how’s everyone at home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother shrugged. “No idea. I haven’t seen them in years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked her head to the side. “Say what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Though I heard Max has taken after Dad and become another soulless, life-sucking businessman. He was always worse than the old man if you ask me. He’d put on a good front, act like your friend...then bam...stab you in the fucking back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’re you talking about?” City demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m talking about our family. Just...everything. They’re heartless. Watching you walk out on the parents was the most badass, courageous thing I ever saw. I swear, I hated you then because I wished I could’ve done it first. Took me a month after you left to work up the balls to escape myself.” He shared a look with Tad—a look that only lovers shared—and then he took the other man’s hand. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-143.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
