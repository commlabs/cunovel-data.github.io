I just realized something. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWild Powers are all supposed to be \u0027born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision,\u0027 right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was trying to figure that out all yesterday. And now, it just came to me, like that.\" She snapped\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher fingers. \"I was thinking about visions like prophecies, you know? But I think what it meant was vision,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike sight. Eyesight. Aradia only had her eyesight for a year-and that\u0027s the year. Seventeen years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh looked at Claire. \"And she\u0027s \"Seventeen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\" Claire yelled. \"So are you! So are lots of people!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I,\" Hugh said with a wry smile. \"But not everybody can stop a train with blue fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t stop anything,\" Claire said with passionate intensity. \"I don\u0027t know what a Wild Power is, but I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t do anything back there. I was just lying there and I knew we were going to die-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then the blue light came and the train stopped,\" Jez said. \"You see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire shook her head. Hugh frowned and looked suddenly doubtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Jez-what about the fire at the Marina? Claire wasn\u0027t there, was she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But she was watching it live on TV. And she was very, very upset about it. I\u0027ve still got the scars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh drew in a slow breath. His eyes were unfocused. \"And you think it works across that distance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t see why it shouldn\u0027t.\" They were talking around Claire again, Jez gazing into the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edepths of the garage. \"I think maybe distance is irrelevant to it. I think what happens is that she sees\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething, and if she\u0027s upset enough about it, if she\u0027s desperate enough and there\u0027s no physical way to do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanything, she just-sends out the Power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s completely unconscious, then,\" Hugh said. \"And who knows, maybe she\u0027s done it before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez straightened, excited. \"If it\u0027s happening far away, and she doesn\u0027t see the flash, and she doesn\u0027t feel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanything...\" She turned on Claire. \"You didn\u0027t feel anything when you stopped the train?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t stop the train,\" Claire said, slowly and with shaky patience. \"And I didn\u0027t do anything about that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efire at the Marina, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire, why are you in such total denial about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s not the truth. I know I didn\u0027t do anything, Jez. When you know, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I don\u0027t blame her,\" Hugh said. \"It\u0027s not a great job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez blinked, and then the truth swept over her. Her entire body went cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Goddess... Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire\u0027s life as a normal person was over. She was going to have to leave everything, her family, her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efriends, and go into hiding. From this point on, she would be one of the four most important people in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworld-the only of the four Wild Powers who was identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstantly hunted. Constantly in danger. Sought after by everyone in the Night World, for a hundred\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edifferent reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Claire had no experience. She was so innocent. How was she supposed to adjust to a life like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez shut her eyes. Her knees were so weak that she had to sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Claire ... I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire gulped, staring at her. There was fear in her dark eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh knelt. His expression was still and sad. Tm sorry, too,\" he said, speaking directly to Claire. \"I don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblame you at all for not wanting this. But for right now, I think we\u0027d better think about getting you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomeplace safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire now had the look of somebody after an earthquake. How could this happen to me? Why wasn\u0027t I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epaying attention before it hit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... have to go home,\" she said. But she said it very slowly, looking at Jez in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez shook her head. \"Claire-you can\u0027t I-\" She paused to gather herself, then spoke quietly and firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home isn\u0027t safe anymore. There are going to be people looking for you-bad people.\" She glanced at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"A werewolf tried to run me down with a car, then jumped me. I think he must have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efollowed me from the station. I knocked him out, but I didn\u0027t kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s the vampire from the platform,\" Jez said. \"He got away-did he see the flash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He saw everything. We were both right there, looking down at you. After that, he took off running. I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esure he\u0027s going back to report to whoever sent him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027ll be putting everything they have on the streets, looking for us.\" Jez looked around the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need transportation, Hugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh gave a tiny grin. \"Why do I have the feeling you don\u0027t mean a taxi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027ve got a pocketknife, I can hotwire a car. But we have to make sure nobody\u0027s around. The last\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ething we need is the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both stood up, Jez reaching down absent-mindedly to pull Claire to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire whispered, \"Wait. I\u0027m not ready for tins-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez braced herself to be merciless. \"You\u0027re never going to be ready, Claire. Nobody is. But you have no\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eidea what these people will do to you if they find you. You... just have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe located a Mustang across the garage. \"That\u0027s a good one. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a loose brick in the wall near the car. Jez wrapped it in her jacket and broke the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took a moment to get the door open and another few seconds to start the car. And then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverybody was inside and Jez was pulling smoothly out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take Yanacio Boulevard to the freeway,\" Hugh said. \"We\u0027ve got to head south. There\u0027s a safe house in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFremont.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they never made it out of the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez saw the Volvo as she turned the first corner toward the exit It had its brights on and it was heading\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eright for them. She twisted the wheel, trying to maneuver, but a Mustang wasn\u0027t a motorcycle. She didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave room. She couldn\u0027t slip out and get away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Volvo never even slowed down. And this time there was no blue light. There was a terrible crashing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof metal on metal, and Jez fell into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez woke up slowly. For a long moment she had no idea where she was. Someplace-moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was being jolted and jarred, and that wasn\u0027t good, because she seemed to be bruised all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, how had that happened... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sat up so fast that it made her head spin. She found herself looking around the dim interior of a van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDim because there were no real windows. The one in back had been covered from the outside with duct\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etape, and only a little light came through at the top and bottom. No light came from the front. The driver\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecompartment was closed off from the back by a metal wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no seats in back, nothing at all to work with. Only three figures lying motionless on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire. Hugh. And... Morgead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stared, crawling forward to look at each of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire looked all right. She had been in the backseat with a seat belt on. Her face was very pale, but she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t seem to be bleeding and she was breathing evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh looked worse. His right arm was twisted oddly under him. Jez touched it gently and determined\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat it was broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don\u0027t have anything to set it with. And I think sbmething else is wrong with him-his breathing\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eraspy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she looked at Morgead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked great. He wasn\u0027t scraped or bruised or cut like the rest of them. The only injury she could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efind was a huge lump on his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she brushed his hair back from it, he stirred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes opened and Jez found herself looking into dark emeralds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez!\" He sat up, too fast. She pushed him back down. He struggled up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez, what happened? Where are we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping you might tell me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was looking around the van, catching up fast Like any vampire, he didn\u0027t stay groggy long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got hit. With wood. Somebody got me when I left my apartment.\" He looked at her sharply. \"Are you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eokay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I got hit with a car. But it could be worse; it was almost a train.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both looking around now, automatically in synch, searching for clues to their situation and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eways to get out They didn\u0027t have to discuss it The first order of business was always escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea who hit you?\" Jez said, running her fingers over the back door. No handles, no\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eway to get out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Pierce called to say he\u0027d come up with something on the Wild Power. I was going to meet him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen suddenly I got attacked from behind.\" He was going over the metal barrier that separated them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom the driver\u0027s cabin, but now he glanced at her. \"What do you mean, it was almost a train?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing here. Nothing on the sides. This van is stripped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing here, either. What do you mean, a train?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez wiggled around to face him. \"You really don\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her for a moment. Either he was a fantastic actor, or he was both innocent and outraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I would do something to hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez shrugged. \"It\u0027s happened in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared, seemed about to get into one of his Excited States. Then he shook his head. \"I have no idea\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat\u0027s going on. And I would not try to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027re both in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back against the metal wall. \"I believe you there.\" He was silent for a moment, then said in an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eodd, deliberate tone, \"It\u0027s the Council, isn\u0027t it? They found out about Hunter\u0027s deal with us, and they\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoving in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez opened her mouth, shut it. Opened it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed Morgead. Claire and Hugh weren\u0027t fighters. And whoever had them was a formidable\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t think it was the Council. The Council wouldn\u0027t use hired thugs; it would work through the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElders in San Francisco. And it would have no reason to kidnap Morgead; the deal with Hunter Redfern\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t really exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever it really was had a good intelligence system,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egood enough to discover that Morgead knew something about the Wild Power. And had a lot of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoney, because it had imported a lot of muscle. And had a sense of strategy, because the kidnappings of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez and Claire and Hugh and Morgead had been beautifully timed and nicely executed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might be some rogue vampire or werewolf chieftain who wanted to grab power. It might be some rival\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire gang in California. For all Jez knew, it might even be some insane faction of Circle Daybreak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing that was certain was that she was going to have to fight them whenever this van got where\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit was going, and that she needed all the help she could get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was important to lie to Morgead one last time, and hope that he would fight with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to get Claire away safely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all that mattered. The world would survive without her and Morgead, and even without Hugh,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealthough it would be a darker place. But it wouldn\u0027t survive without Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whether it\u0027s the Council or not, we\u0027re going to have to fight them,\" she said out loud. \"How\u0027s your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenergy-blast trick? The one you demonstrated when we were stick-fighting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"Not good. I used up all my Power fighting the guys who tackled me. It\u0027ll be a long time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore I recharge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez\u0027s heart sank. \"Too bad,\" she said unemotionally. \"Because those two aren\u0027t going to be able to do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those humans? Who are they, by the way?\" His voice was so carefully careless again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez hesitated. If she said they were unimportant, he might not help her save them. But she couldn\u0027t tell the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etruth, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Claire, and this is Hugh. They\u0027re-acquaintances. They\u0027ve helped me in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even humans can be useful sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I thought maybe one of them might be the Wild Power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought if I found the Wild Power I wouldn\u0027t tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It occurred to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so cynical, Morgead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I prefer to call it observant,\" he said. \u0027For instance, I can tell you something about your friend Hugh,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere. I saw him in the city, just once, but I remember his face. He\u0027s a damned Daybreaker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez felt a tension in her chest, but she kept her face expressionless. \"So maybe I\u0027m using him for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe,\" Morgead said, simply and pleasantly, \"you\u0027re using me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez lost her breath. She stared at him. His face was shadowed, but she could see its clean tines, the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrong but delicate features, the darkness of his eyebrows and the tension in his jaw. And she knew, as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe narrowed his eyes, that they were the color of glacier ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" he said, \"there\u0027s still a connection between us. I can feel it, sort of like a cord between our\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eminds. It pulls. You can\u0027t deny it, Jez. It\u0027s there whether you like it or not. And-\" He considered, as if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethinking of the best way to put this. \"It tells me things. Things about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, hell, Jez thought. It\u0027s over. I\u0027m just going to have to protect Hugh and Claire myself. From him and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhoever\u0027s got us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of her was scared, but part was just furious, the familiar fury of needing to bash Morgead over the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehead. He was so certain of himself, so ... smug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s it telling you now?\" she said sarcastically before she could stop herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you\u0027re not telling the truth. That there\u0027s something you\u0027re keeping from me, something you\u0027ve been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekeeping from me. And that it has to do with him.\" He nodded toward Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew. The jerk knew and he was just playing with her. Jez could feel self-control slipping away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something to do with why you want the Wild Power,\" Morgead went on, a strange smile playing on his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elips. \"And with where you\u0027ve been for the past year, and with why you suddenly want to protect humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why you say \u0027Goddess\u0027 when you\u0027re surprised. No vampire says that. It\u0027s a witch thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddess, I\u0027m going to kill him, Jez thought, clenching her teeth. \"Anything else?\" she said evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And with why you\u0027re scared of me reading your thoughts.\" He smirked. \"Told you I was observant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez lost it. \"Yeah, Morgead, you\u0027re brilliant. So are you smart enough to figure out what it all means? Or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust to get suspicious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means-\" He looked uncertain suddenly, as if he hadn\u0027t exactly figured out where all this was leading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"It means... that you\u0027re ...\" He looked at her. \"With Circle Daybreak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came out as a statement, but a weak one. Almost a question. And he was staring at her with an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI-don\u0027t-believe-it look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" Jez said nastily. \"Two points. No, one; it took you long enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead stared at her. Then he suddenly erupted out of his side of the van. Jez jumped forward, too, in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea crouch that would let her move fluidly and protect Hugh and Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Morgead didn\u0027t attack. He just tried to grab her shoulders and shake her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You little idiot!\" he yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez was startled. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a Daybreaker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you had it all figured out.\" What was wrong with him? Instead of looking betrayed and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebloodthirsty he looked scared and angry. Like a mother whose kid has just run in front of a bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did-I guess-but I still can\u0027t believe it. Jez, why? Don\u0027t you know how stupid that is? Don\u0027t you realize\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat\u0027s going to happen to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Morgead-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to lose, Jez. It\u0027s not just going to be the Council against them now. Everybody in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight World is going to be gunning for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re going to get wiped out, and anybody who sides with them will be wiped out, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was two inches from hers. Jez glared at him, refusing to give ground. \"I\u0027m not just siding with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem,\" she hissed. \"I am one of them. I\u0027m a damned Daybreaker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a dead Daybreaker. I can\u0027t believe this. How am I supposed to protect you from the whole\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight World?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe settled back, glaring, but not at her. He was looking around the van, avoiding her eyes. \"You heard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme. I don\u0027t care who your friends are, Jez. I don\u0027t even care that you came back to use me. I\u0027m just glad\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou came back. We\u0027re soulmates, and nothing can change that.\" Then he shook his head furiously. \"Even\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eif you won\u0027t admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morgead...\" Suddenly the ache in Jez\u0027s chest was too much to stay inside. It was closing off her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethroat, making her eyes sting, trying to make her cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had misjudged Morgead, too. She\u0027d been so sure that he would hate her, that he could never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforgive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut of course, he didn\u0027t know the whole truth yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe probably thought that her being a Daybreaker was something she would grow out of. That it was just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea matter of getting her to see the light and change sides again, and she would become the old Jez\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedfern. He didn\u0027t realize that the old Jez Red-fern had been an illusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTm sorry,\" she said abruptly, helplessly. \"For all of this, Morgead-I\u0027m sorry. It really wasn\u0027t fair to you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor me to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked irritated. \"I told you; I\u0027m glad you did. We can work things out-if you\u0027ll just stop being so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estubborn. We\u0027ll get out of this-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if we do get out of it, nothing\u0027s going to change.\" She looked up at him. She wasn\u0027t frightened of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat he might do anymore. The only thing she was frightened of was seeing disgust in his eyes-but she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estill had to tell him. \"I can\u0027t be your soulmate, Morgead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hardly seemed to be listening to her. \"Yes, you can. I told you, I don\u0027t care who your friends are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell keep you alive somehow. The only thing I don\u0027t understand is why you\u0027d want to ally yourself with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estupid humans, when you know they\u0027re going to lose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez looked at him. Morgead, the vampire\u0027s vampire, whose only interest was in seeing the Night World\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econquer humanity completely. Who was what she had been a year ago, and what she could never be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain. Who thought of her as an ally, a descendent of one of the first families of the lamia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho thought he loved who he thought she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez kept looking at him steadily, and when she spoke, it was very quietly. And it was the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m a human,\" she said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-16.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
