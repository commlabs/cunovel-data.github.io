After a few minutes of their usual easy chat, she settled at her desk and immediately began her work. The nausea almost always abated by nine. The first hour of the morning was the worst and odd though it seemed, she felt sick some afternoons once she got home. The second bout was always less intense than the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt noon Mary Lou, the receptionist, came into her office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a visitor,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do?\" This was unexpected. \"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Lou grinned. \"Why don\u0027t you come and see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia walked to the front of the office and there stood Ian with a small bouquet of flowers. \"Ian!\" she cried. \"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we\u0027d go to lunch, if that\u0027s okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s okay. Don\u0027t you have to work this afternoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, but I\u0027ve got time to take my wife to lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so pleased to see him, it didn\u0027t matter one little bit that she\u0027d brought her lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey got sandwiches and drinks at the Pot Belly Deli and walked to the WaterfrontPark, where they chose a relatively secluded picnic table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something for you,\" he said as she unpacked their lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan reached inside his pocket and brought out a plain gold cross on a chain. \"I want you to wear this, all right?\" Cecilia was stunned. \"Ian, it\u0027s beautiful. Thank you.\" He walked over to where she was sitting and placed it around her neck and secured the clasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t forgotten our anniversary or anything, have I?\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any special reason you\u0027re giving me a gift?\" He shrugged and tried unsuccessfully to hide a smile. He sat back on the picnic bench and unwrapped his veggie-and-cream-cheese croissant. \"You\u0027re having my baby. Isn\u0027t that reason enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears rose in Cecilia\u0027s eyes. Because of the pregnancy, all her hormones were out of control; the smallest thing set her off. Not that this was small. No, his gift, his acknowledgement of her pregnancy, was the most moving and important moment they\u0027d shared in months. She waved her hand in front of her face, blinking rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crying?\" Ian sounded surprised. \"I thought this would make you happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why are you crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was laughing, almost hysterically—weeping and laughing at the same time. \"Because I\u0027m having a baby, silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Ian took a bite of his sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I love my husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Who loves his wife and his baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia cried all the harder then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, don\u0027t cry. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just that I was so afraid you didn\u0027t. Love us, I mean.\" She sobbed, hiccupped and curled her fingers around the small cross. \"Everything\u0027s going to be just fine this time, Ian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile slowly disappeared. \"I\u0027m trying to believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you are. I\u0027ll do everything I can—and I feel it will be fine, but there are no guarantees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was one thing Cecilia understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob Beldon glanced at the menu in the bowling alley\u0027s small restaurant, although it wasn\u0027t necessary. He knew what he wanted. Two eggs over easy, bacon, cooked crisp, and two pieces of sourdough toast with strawberry jam if they had it. For two-fifty it was the best buy in town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress strolled past and without asking, filled his coffee cup. \"You waiting on someone, hon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob nodded. The instant he did, Roy McAfee stepped into the crowded restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right on time,\" Bob commented as Roy slid into the booth across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ordered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePad in hand, the waitress returned, filled Roy\u0027s mug and stood waiting for their order. Bob went first. Roy asked for a short stack of pancakes. The woman sauntered off and barked the order to the cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" Roy asked. Bob had called him last night to arrange this meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peggy told me something interesting the other day. I\u0027ve spoken to Troy Davis, but I wanted to get your opinion, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems Peggy and Hannah had a little heart-to-heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you learn anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Bob added sugar and cream, then stirred his coffee. \"Hannah let it slip that her father sometimes used false names. Peggy asked her about it, and I gather that through the years Max had amassed a whole slew of names and identifications.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy\u0027s eyebrows lifted. \"It didn\u0027t occur to her to bring this up earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob reviewed what had led up to this confession. \"She left the milk out all night and I got a little upset because it spoiled. After I went to play golf, Hannah came out of her bedroom and started talking to Peggy. From the way she described it, life with her father was no bed of roses, for her or her mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s never said anything negative about him before, has she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob needed to think about that. He shrugged. \"Not that I can remember. It\u0027s like she\u0027s been living in a fantasy world. In the beginning she painted a picture of the three of them skipping through the years as happy as can be. Turns out life wasn\u0027t quite as blissful as she let us believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes sense, I guess,\" Roy said, cupping his mug with both hands. \"She lost both parents within a short period. In tragic circumstances people tend to recall the good times instead of the bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob supposed his friend was right. \"Didn\u0027t Troy ask her if she knew anything about her dad using fictitious names?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure he did. Did she explain why she lied?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peggy asked her the same thing. Hannah claimed she was afraid that if anyone found out, there\u0027d be trouble and she couldn\u0027t deal with it. From what she said—and didn\u0027t say—trouble seemed to follow Max wherever he went.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Roy sipped his coffee. \"Did she happen to mention any of the names he used? Or where he got the various pieces of ID?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but if Peggy asks, Hannah will probably tell her.\" Bob didn\u0027t think Hannah trusted him enough to confide that information, but she had a close relationship with his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have Peggy ask her and I\u0027ll find out what I can. It might give us a lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob nodded. He\u0027d hoped Roy would volunteer to do exactly that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Hannah know anything about the fake ID her father carried when he died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She says she didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy studied him. \"Do you believe her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob had considered that question carefully and the fact was, he couldn\u0027t be sure. He wasn\u0027t especially fond of the girl and couldn\u0027t account for it, even though he had no real reason to dislike her. Peggy had taken to her fast enough, and heaven knew the young woman needed his wife\u0027s affection. Hannah\u0027s nervousness and her jittery manner made him uncomfortable. If Bob raised his voice even slightly, she cowered as if she expected him to pounce. Of course, what she\u0027d told Peggy explained a great deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone following you these days?\" Roy asked just as the waitress delivered their breakfasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I can tell. Nothing since that night, anyway. I\u0027m beginning to wonder if I imagined it. But I know I didn\u0027t. Maybe it\u0027s not even connected to Max. Maybe it was some random wacko.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy poured hot maple syrup over his pancakes. \"You sound disappointed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. It\u0027s ridiculous to live the way Peggy and I are living. I want this resolved, one way or another. I\u0027m also thinking it\u0027s time we started taking guests again. This whole mess has cost us thousands of dollars.\" He took a gulp of coffee. \"If someone was really after me, wouldn\u0027t he have done something by now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy nodded. \"I tend to agree with you. If someone was going to make a move, it probably would\u0027ve happened already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob grunted agreement through a mouthful of toast and jam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On second thought—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Roy,\" Bob protested, not giving the other man a chance to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want my advice? Then I\u0027ll give it to you, and seeing that it\u0027s free, you should appreciate my generosity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, all right.\" He broke the egg yolk with a corner of his toast. \"Share your wisdom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy grinned. \"Only accept reservations from people who\u0027ve stayed at the B and B before. People you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In other words, turn down strangers who arrive in the middle of a dark and stormy night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friend chuckled. \"You got that figured out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob finished his breakfast and reached for his recently refilled mug. \"I have a theory I want to bounce off you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy relaxed, leaning against the back of the booth. \"Shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know everything—what happened in Nam, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy nodded, his expression serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember that I didn\u0027t have an easy time after the war. I did everything I could to bury the memories. I sought oblivion. It was bad for everyone, especially Peggy and the kids.\" He paused. \"Outwardly Dan Sherman seemed to adjust to civilian life. That\u0027s what I assumed, anyway. I didn\u0027t see him for decades. And even when I moved back to Cedar Cove, we tended to avoid each other. So I didn\u0027t know he struggled with demons, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy waited while Bob sorted through his thoughts. \"From what Hannah told Peggy, Max didn\u0027t cope with life after the war any better than I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He drank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some, I gather, but I don\u0027t think that was his only problem. He pretty much became an obsessive-compulsive, although that wasn\u0027t the term Hannah used.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember how neatly everything was packed inside his suitcase?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob nodded. They\u0027d all been struck by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking?\" Roy pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I came back from Nam, I realized that someday, some way, I\u0027d have to pay for what happened in that village. If I\u0027ve learned anything about life these fifty-odd years, it\u0027s that there\u0027s a symmetry to things.\" He lowered his voice. \"I...took lives, and now it seems someone wants to take mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the words out in the open, Bob felt better. He\u0027d been thinking about this ever since Max\u0027s death, but hadn\u0027t found the courage to verbalize it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" Roy urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Dan realized this, too. He preferred to take his own life, choose his own time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I __\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear me out,\" Bob insisted. \"I wonder if it\u0027s possible that a family member of one of our... victims has hunted the four of us down. He might have confronted Dan, forced him to take matters into his own hands. For that matter, what else would send Max rushing to Cedar Cove? I think whoever\u0027s responsible is looking for revenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy considered his theory. \"I don\u0027t know. It could be, but I doubt it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Plenty of Vietnamese have immigrated to the United States since the war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s a bit far-fetched to believe one of them has a vendetta against four American soldiers after all these years. Why wait until now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know.\" Roy could be right; this scenario was probably a fantasy, something he\u0027d invented in his own desperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing else made sense, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking into the mall parking lot on Friday evening, Rachel hummed an old Eagles song, trying to get her mind off her pathetic love life. Her one date with bachelor Nate Olsen had been exactly that. One date. One expensive date. It depressed her that she hadn\u0027t heard from him in the two weeks since. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-32.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
