{"id":77393,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBree\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning I got up early for work and Archer got up with me, kissing me at the door. He looked sleepy and sexy and I took a few more minutes than I should, lingering at his lips, just rubbing mine over his. I still needed to go home and shower and get my uniform. Hopefully Natalie had taken Phoebe out and fed her. When I leaned back away from Archer, I said, Natalie and Jordan are picking me up right after work, so I\u0027ll see you as soon as I get back, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at me, his face going serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, I joked, take this time to get some actual sleep. Think of it as a week long break from having to service my insatiable sexual needs constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned a sleepy grin and signed back, I love your insatiable sexual needs. Hurry back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed a small laugh and breathed out. I will. I love you, Archer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you, Bree. He smiled a sweet smile at me and I lingered, not wanting to say goodbye. Finally, he smacked me playfully on the butt and said, Go. I laughed softly and waved at him as I walked up the driveway, blowing him kisses before I shut the gate behind me. He stood there in his jeans, no shirt on, his hands in his front pockets, a small smile on his face. God, I\u0027d miss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a busy day at the diner which was good since the day passed quickly, and I didn\u0027t have too long to linger in my thoughts over how much I was going to miss Archer–hell, how much I was going to miss the entire town. It had been such a short time, really, but already I felt like this was home. I missed my friends back in Ohio, but I knew that my life was here now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie and Jordan picked me up right at three o\u0027clock, and I changed into jeans and a t-shirt in the bathroom and said quick goodbyes to Maggie and Norm. We hopped in my car, Jordan driving and Phoebe chuffing softly at me from her carrier, and got right on the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d you guys do all day?\" I asked, trying to distract myself from the ball of emotion that was already moving up my throat as we got on the highway and moved further away from Pelion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We walked along the lake for a little bit,\" Natalie said. \"But it was so cold we didn\u0027t stay long. We drove across the lake to the town on the other side for lunch and checked out some of the shops. It was really nice, Bree. I can see why you like it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"The summer was beautiful, but the fall is–\" My phone chimed, cutting me off. I frowned. Who could that be? Maybe Avery? The only other people who ever texted me were sitting in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked my phone up and looked at the text from an unknown number. I frowned, clicking on it. It said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it too soon to start missing you? Archer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened and I pulled back from the phone, surprise taking over. I sucked in a breath. Archer? How in the world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up to the front passenger seat where Natalie was sitting. \"Archer\u0027s texting me!\" I said. \"How is Archer texting me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie just smiled a knowing smile. I gaped. \"Oh my God! Did you get him a cell phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie shook her head, smiling and pointed next to her to Jordan in the driver\u0027s seat. He looked in the rearview mirror at me sheepishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got Archer a cell phone?\" I whispered, tears springing into my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, whoa. Don\u0027t get all emotional. It\u0027s just a cell phone. How else are you guys gonna communicate while you\u0027re gone? I\u0027m surprised you didn\u0027t think of it yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears were sliding down my cheeks now, and I choked out a little laugh, shaking my head. \"You\u0027re… I can\u0027t…\" I sputtered, looking back over at Natalie who was crying and laughing now, too, swiping the tears off of her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t he?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, a new flood of tears falling out of my eyes as I laughed and wiped them off my cheeks. We were a mess–both of us laughing and crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Jordan in the rearview mirror, and he rubbed a fist into one eye, cringing slightly and saying, \"Something in my eye there. Okay, stop all the blubbering. You two are embarrassing. And text him back already. He\u0027s waiting, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d he say when you brought it to him?\" I asked, my eyes wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan shrugged and glanced in the rearview mirror at me. \"He looked at me like he was wondering what my ulterior motives were. But I just showed him how to use it and left.\" He shrugged again like it was no big deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you Jordan Scott,\" I said, leaning forward and kissing him lightly on his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you do,\" he said, grinning at me in the mirror again. \"And getting laid by hot blondes puts me in a generous mood so there you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, sniffling and bringing my phone up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I hope not because I started missing you before I even left. We\u0027re about twenty minutes outside of town. What are you doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited about a minute before his next message came through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Reading. It just started raining outside. Hopefully you\u0027re moving away from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I think so. Skies look clear ahead. Wish I was cuddled up with you. What are you reading?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Wish you were too. But what you\u0027re doing is important. I\u0027m reading Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton. Have you read it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: No. Is it good?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Yeah. Well, no. It\u0027s well written, but it\u0027s probably one of the most depressing books of all time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Lol. So you\u0027ve read it before? Why read it again if it\u0027s depressing? What\u0027s it about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: What\u0027s lol?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused and smiled, realizing this was Archer\u0027s very first time texting. Of course he didn\u0027t know what lol meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Laugh out loud. Text lingo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Oh, okay. I\u0027m not sure why I picked this book up today. My uncle seemed to like it. It\u0027s about a miserable man in a loveless marriage who falls in love with his wife\u0027s cousin and they try to commit suicide to be together, but only end up broken and paralyzed and still miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Oh God! That\u0027s… that\u0027s awful! Put the depressing book down, Archer Hale!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed out loud for real when I saw his reply. \"Keep it down back there,\" Natalie grumped, keeping her eyes closed, but smiling slightly as she turned her head on her seat back. My phone dinged softly again, indicating another text from Archer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: No, really, it\u0027s about isolation and a girl who represents happiness for a man who\u0027s never had any. I guess I can relate to some of the themes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed heavily, my heart squeezing for the man I loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I love you, Archer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: I love you too, Bree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Pulling into a gas station. Text you in a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: What\u0027s on your happy list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: What\u0027s a happy list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Just a short list of a few, simple things that make you happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone remained quiet for a few minutes before it finally dinged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: The smell of the earth after it rains, the feeling of falling asleep, the small freckle on the inside of your right thigh. What\u0027s on your happy list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and leaned my head back on the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Summer evenings, when the clouds part and a ray of golden light suddenly breaks through, knowing you\u0027re mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned back on the seat again, a small dreamy smile on my face. After a minute or two, my phone dinged again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: When do you think you\u0027ll get to Ohio?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Probably about 8 am. I\u0027m up next to drive so I better try to get some rest. I\u0027ll text you constantly to let you know what\u0027s going on, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Okay. Will you tell Jordan I said thanks for the phone? I\u0027d like to pay him for it. I didn\u0027t think to offer when he came over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I doubt if he\u0027d take it anyway. But I\u0027ll tell him. I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: I love you too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Slept for a couple hours. Dreamed about you. Stopping for dinner and then I\u0027m going to drive for the next five hrs or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Dream? What kind of dream?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: A really, really good dream. ;) Remember that time on the lake shore?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: I\u0027ll never forget. I was washing sand out of places sand should never be for a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Lol. It was worth it though, right? I miss you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Very worth it. I miss you too. Guess what? I went into town for a few things and now I\u0027m walking down the street texting you. I think Mrs. Grady almost had a heart attack. I heard her refer to me as the Unibomber, Jr. once when she passed me in the grocery store. I had to look up who that was at the library. I realized that it hadn\u0027t been a compliment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Some people could be so ignorant. I pictured that isolated teenager bravely fighting his way up to the gate where he would walk out into the world for the first time since he was a small child, and then getting a reception like that. I cringed. Every cell in my body screamed out to protect him, but I couldn\u0027t. It had already happened. I didn\u0027t even know him then–but the fact that I hadn\u0027t been there, shot through my body as guilt and grief anyway. It wasn\u0027t rational. It was love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I\u0027d read your manifesto, Archer Hale. Every word. I bet it\u0027d be beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Lol. Which, incidentally, in my case should actually be los (laugh out silently).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: :D You being funny? :D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Yes. What\u0027s on your funny list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned, thinking for a second before typing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Watching the puppies waddle because their tummies are so fat, hearing other people laugh (it\u0027s contagious), funny fail moments. What\u0027s on your funny list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Mr. Bivens in his crooked hairpiece, the look on a dog\u0027s face as it rides by with its head out the window of a car, people who snort when they laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I\u0027m laughing now (maybe snorting) as I\u0027m walking in to the restaurant. :D I\u0027ll text in the morning. Ilu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Okay. Goodnight, Ilu too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geez, Bree, you\u0027re not supposed to be writing novels on text. Both of your fingers are going to be too tired for anything good when you get back,\" Natalie joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and sighed–it might have been slightly swoony. Natalie rolled her eyes. \"I love it. I feel like I\u0027m getting to know him even better this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie wrapped her arm around my shoulder and pulled me into her, and we walked in to the restaurant smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Morning. You up? We only have another hour on the road. Nat\u0027s driving now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Yeah, I\u0027m up. Walking on the shore with the dogs. Hawk just ate a dead fish. He won\u0027t be coming inside today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, still sleepy. I sat up and moved my neck from side to side. Sleeping in the front seat of a car was not comfortable. Natalie was at the wheel, sipping a cup of McDonalds coffee, and Jordan was snoring softly in the back seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Eww! Hawk! What\u0027s on your gross-out list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Really long, curved fingernails, barnacles, mushrooms. What\u0027s on your gross-out list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Wait – you don\u0027t like mushrooms? I\u0027m going to cook something that will change your mind when I get back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: No, thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Cigarette breath, maggots, gas station bathrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: I\u0027ll be right back. I need to go take a shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, but then I paused before typing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Thank you, I needed that. I\u0027m a little nervous about today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: You\u0027re going to be fine. I promise, it\u0027s going to be fine. You can do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Do you think you would do me a favor? If I call you right before I go into the police station, and put the phone in my pocket, will you just… be with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Yes, yes. Of course I will. And I promise not to say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Funny. Ilu, Archer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Ilu, Bree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in the police station and looked at the pictures in front of me as the detective sat across the table, his hands folded, watching me closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes zeroed in on the face I\u0027d never forget. Lay down, I heard him command in my mind. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, feeling Archer on the line against my body, feeling his very being as if he was right there, holding me close, whispering in my ear, You can do this, you\u0027re brave, you can do this. And as I sat there, Archer\u0027s voice was stronger, louder. His voice was all I heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one,\" I said, pointing my finger at the man on the page in front of me. I didn\u0027t even shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\" the detective asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One hundred and ten percent sure,\" I said steadily. \"That\u0027s the man who killed my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detective nodded and took the pictures away. \"Thank you, Ms. Prescott.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to bring him in now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. We\u0027ll notify you as soon as we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Thank you so much, Detective. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later after completing some paperwork, I was walking down the police station steps. I took my phone out of my pocket and said into the open line, \"Did you hear all that? I picked him out, Archer! I didn\u0027t even hesitate. I saw him in the picture in front of me and I knew it was him the instant I looked at him. Oh my God, I\u0027m shaking like a leaf now.\" I laughed softly. \"Thank you for being there. You made all the difference. I\u0027m going to hang up now so you can text me. God, I love you. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second later my phone dinged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: You did good, Bree. So, so good. This is really hard. I want to hold you right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I know, I know, Archer. I want that too. Whew. Deep breath. Oh God, the tears are coming now. But I\u0027m happy. I can\u0027t believe this. My dad\u0027s going to get justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: I’m so happy about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Oh God, me too. What are you doing right now? I need to talk about something else while I calm down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: I just started a run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and sniffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: You\u0027re on a run and texting at the same time???\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: I\u0027ve gotten good at texting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: No kidding, overachiever. Why am I not surprised?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: You shouldn\u0027t be. Technology loves me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, and then cried a little more, emotion overcoming me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Thank you for being with me. It made all the difference. You made me brave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: No, you were brave long before you met me. What\u0027s on your calm list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, thinking of the things that calmed me, soothed me, comforted my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: The sound of the lake hitting the shore, a cup of hot tea, you. What’s on your calm list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Flannel sheets, looking up at the stars, you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Hey, Natalie\u0027s pulling up at the curb. We\u0027re going to my dad\u0027s house to pack up a few more things. I\u0027ll text you later. Thank you, thank you. Ilu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: Ilu2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Guess what? I\u0027m back on the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher: What?
