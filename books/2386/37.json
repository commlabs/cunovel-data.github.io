I’m on the admissions board at Princeton University.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh huh.” Spencer’s hands were shaking so badly she could barely hold the phone. She could just imagine the next sentence. We regret to inform you, but Spencer F. was a much stronger candidate. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was wondering if you were still planning on joining us for the early admission mixer next week,” Georgia’s chipper voice broke through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer frowned. “Pardon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia repeated herself. Spencer laughed confusedly. “I-I thought you were still reviewing my application.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the sound of papers flipping. “Uh . . . no. I don’t think so. It says here we accepted you six weeks ago. Congratulations again. This was a tough admissions year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the other Spencer Hastings?” Spencer said. “The boy with my same name who also applied? I got a letter that some of the admissions committee reviewed our applications thinking we were the same person, and . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got a letter from us?” Georgia sounded appalled. “Miss Hastings, we would never do something like that. Your application is reviewed by five different rounds of readers. Discussed in committees. Approved by the dean himself. I assure you that we don’t make mistakes with whom we admit. We are very, very careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer stared at her reflection in the large mirror in the hall. Her hair was wild around her face. There was a wrinkle in the middle of her forehead she always got when she was utterly confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia told Spencer the details about the mixer, then hung up. Afterward, Spencer sat back on the couch, blinking hard. What the hell had just happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, it came to her. She rose and padded across the hall to her dad’s old office, which still contained a bunch of computer and office equipment. It took her five seconds to log onto the Internet, and another five to call up Facebook. With shaking hands, she typed in Spencer F.’s name into the search window. Several Spencer Hastings profiles appeared, but none were for the golden boy from Darien, Connecticut, Spencer had stalked days before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pictured the letter from Princeton in her hands. Come to think of it, the seal had looked crooked. And it was suspicious that Kelsey had known Spencer had gotten into Princeton . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course. Kelsey had written the letter. She’d created Spencer F.’s profile, too, to mess with her head. Spencer F. didn’t exist. It was all a mind game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer shut her eyes, embarrassed that she’d been so naïve. “Good one, Kelsey,” she said into the silent room. She had to hand it to her old friend: It was classic A, through and through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 37\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFACE-TO-FACE WITH THE ENEMY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDread filled Hanna as she walked into the sleek lobby of the Preserve at Addison-Stevens Mental Wellness and Rehab facility on Monday after school. All of a sudden, she was reliving the events of last year: how her dad had shoved her through the revolving doors, certain she needed help for her panic attacks. How Mike had walked with her through the lobby, saying, “Well, this doesn’t look so bad!” Yeah, the lobby wasn’t bad at all. It was the rest of the place that was a nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to her, Aria squinted at a tall potted cactus in the corner. Someone had affixed two eyes, a nose, and a mouth to its long green body. “Where have I seen that before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer glanced at it and shook her head. Hanna shrugged. So did Emily, who had dressed up for the occasion in a rumpled gray skirt and a slightly too-small white sweater. She turned and nervously watched a worried-looking couple with a thin, hollow-eyed boy lean their elbows on the check-in desk. “It’s so weird to think Ali was here,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously,” Hanna said. Ali’s family had left her in here for years, too, barely even checking on her. They’d assumed she was the crazy twin, ignoring her pleas that she really was the Real Ali. That was probably enough to make anyone lose her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer approached the check-in desk and told an attendant that they were here to visit Kelsey Pierce. “Right this way,” the attendant said briskly, giving the girls a circumspect look. “Why do I know you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone exchanged a glance. Because a patient here tried to kill us, Hanna wanted to say. Really, it was a wonder the Preserve hadn’t been shut down by a medical review board—they’d let the Real Ali out, thinking she was well, and she’d gone on to murder a bunch of innocent people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey entered an airy room with round tables. There was a water dispenser in the corner, a coffee machine on the shelf. There were upbeat, self-esteem-affirming sayings written on yellow oaktag on the walls: YOU ARE UNIQUE! REACH FOR THE STARS! Gag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna recognized the black-and-white photo of the spiral staircase; apparently, some Preserve alum had taken it once he’d recovered. The room had a view to the facility hallway, and she couldn’t help but glance at some of the patients walking past, half expecting to recognize some of them. Like Alexis, who never ate anything. Or Tara, who had those huge boobs. Or Iris, who Hanna had thought was A—and who’d also roomed with Real Ali. But even the nurses looked unfamiliar. Betsy, the nurse who administered the meds, was gone. And there was no sign of Dr. Felicia, who’d led the torturous group therapy sessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, the door from the hallway creaked open, and a stout nurse with a hairy mole on her chin led a frail-looking girl in pink hospital pajamas into the room. The girl had bright red hair and small, even features, but it still took Hanna a beat to realize that this was the same person she had briefly met at Noel’s party last year . . . or the crazed figure she’d seen on the cliff two nights ago. There were circles under Kelsey’s eyes. Her hair was matted. Her shoulders slumped, and her arms hung heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stiffened as Kelsey pulled out a chair and quietly sat down. She looked at them blankly, her face betraying nothing. “Fancy meeting you here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” Spencer answered. She gestured at Hanna and the others. “You remember everyone, right? This is Hanna and Aria . . . and you know Emily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh huh,” Kelsey said morosely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, punishing silence. Hanna stared at her hands in her lap, suddenly desperate to busy them with a nail file or a cigarette. She and her friends hadn’t exactly discussed what they were going to say to Kelsey once they got here. They’d never been in this situation before: face-to-face with A, able to ask her why she was torturing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Kelsey sighed. “So my therapist says I’m supposed to apologize.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna snuck a peek at Aria. Apologize?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shouldn’t have dragged you out to that quarry.” Kelsey looked at Emily. “My therapist said I put you in danger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s throat bobbed as she swallowed. Wasn’t that the point? Hanna wanted to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I should thank you, too.” Kelsey stared at her fingernails, sounding upset. “For saving my life on Saturday. So . . . gracias.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily blinked. “Uh, you’re welcome?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey pushed a letter into Emily’s palm. “This is for you. I wrote it this morning, and it explains . . . everything. We don’t have access to phones or computers here, so our shrinks are all about us writing letters to get our feelings out.” She rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” Emily said, staring at the folded piece of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey shrugged. “I’m glad you pulled me back from the cliff, but you shouldn’t have called an ambulance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s mouth dropped open. “You were convulsing! What were we supposed to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave me. I would’ve come out of it okay. It’s happened before.” Kelsey started to tear a random napkin that was sitting on the table into pieces. Redness crept into her neck. “The cops had zero tolerance because of my record. This was strike three, so I’m automatically back in rehab. And after rehab, more juvie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shook her head slightly. “I had no idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None of us did,” Spencer added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey didn’t say anything, but she looked like she didn’t believe them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone shifted uncomfortably. Then, Spencer leaned forward. “Listen. I’m sorry, you know. About . . . what happened this summer. What I did at the police station.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey stared down at the table, still not saying a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’m sorry, too,” Hanna added. There was no way she could bottle it up any longer. “For putting those pills in your room. And for calling the cops and telling on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey let out a choppy laugh. “I already had a bunch of pills in my room, but that was pretty shitty of you to call the cops. I don’t even know you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna blinked hard. So . . . Kelsey deserved to go to jail after all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer looked equally blindsided. “Why didn’t you tell me you had pills that night? We wouldn’t have gone on that crazy drug deal. We wouldn’t have gotten in trouble!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sneaky smile appeared on Kelsey’s lips. “That was my secret stash, Spencer. My ticket to an Ivy League school—not yours. I never thought you’d have the balls to go to North Philly and buy drugs from someone. I mean, look at you.” She narrowed her eyes at Spencer’s blousy Elizabeth and James tunic and J Brand denim leggings, which Hanna had seen on a table at Otter for almost three hundred dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria leaned forward. “Why did you do this to us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do what?” Kelsey asked dumbly, raising her heavy-lidded eyes to the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorture us as A! Hanna wanted to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is because of Tabitha, right?” Aria pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s Tabitha?” Kelsey sounded bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know,” Spencer urged. “You know everything!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey stared at them for a beat, then squeezed her eyes shut. “My head really hurts. They have me on so many meds here.” She pushed back her chair and stood. “Frankly, this is kind of weird. I mean, thanks for apologizing and whatever. And . . . here.” She reached into the pocket of her pajama pants and pulled out a folded piece of lined paper. “I wrote this for you, too, Spencer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey pushed the letter into Spencer’s hands. “Have a nice life, guys.” And then she shuffled out of the room, her pajama bottoms dragging on the ground. A nurse stopped her outside the guest area and led her into a small office with transparent windows. The girls watched as she slumped onto a blue plastic chair. The nurse said something to her, and Kelsey nodded limply, her face expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna leaned across the table. “What the hell was that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She seemed so . . . different.” Emily stared at Kelsey across the hall. “So hopeless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer twisted her silver ring around her finger. “Why did she say she didn’t know Tabitha? She has to know her. She had those pictures on her phone. She sent me that text!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was lying,” Aria said matter-of-factly. “She had to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Spencer unfolded the letter Kelsey had given her and laid it flat on the table. Everyone hitched forward in their seats to read it. A single paragraph was written in leaky black pen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ruthless-pretty-little-liars-10/page-37.html","bookId":2386,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:41 AM"}
