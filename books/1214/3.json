{"id":29481,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"\u0026nbsp;The man called Gaius Julius Caesar Imperator V turned from the window and rubbed his hand over his graying hair. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This is the first time I\u0027ve ever run into anything of this sort.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The President of the Senate shrugged. He was an old man who had been placed in the Senate by his father in 1980. So long ago that people wondered when he would die. They were tired of these old men dictating to their ruler, as many people before them had been tired. The rise of the President of the Senate to leadership of that revered group had not been meteoric by any means. But his maintenance of the position had been tenacious. He was a careful man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The President of the Senate shrugged. \"It is. It is the first time anything of this sort has ever come up, Julius. Therefore it is up to you to set an example.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Caesar glanced over at General Bonadella. The General nodded in agreement with Senator Chianti.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This sort of business can break up the Empire if it\u0027s allowed to continue, Caesar,\" he said, in his pompous military way. \"I say death.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Major DeCosta nodded quietly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thumbs down all around, is it?\" Caesar sat down behind his desk and picked up the speaker of his private cable to London. He looked at the three men.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Commander in charge of Garrison C,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a silent moment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They looked up as Prefect Lamberti of the Pretorians, the Imperial personal bodyguard (it had progressed far beyond that. Its enrollment was tremendous; its power second only to the Dictator\u0027s) came in. The Senator nodded. The two field soldiers turned quickly away. The men of the field did not get along with the Pretorian dandies.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Commander? This is the Dictator,\" Caesar said unnecessarily. The garrison commander knew that only one person could call him on that line. The phone would react to no voice other than Caesar\u0027s.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you the fellow who was preaching dissension? I say one year in prison. You heard me. Yes, one year. What? No! No torture!\" He severed connections and looked up at his advisers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Prefect Lamberti shook his head. Senator Chianti turned and stalked out. After a moment General Bonadella followed. The Major turned away to stare out the window. He shook his head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"del Ponta? This is the Dictator,\" that quiet, flat voice said behind him. Caesar was calling the under-chief of the Pretoriani. \"I will speak tomorrow from the balcony. Yes. 1400. Of course. World-wide. That\u0027s right. Oh, I suppose about a quarter \u0027til.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man who ruled the world stood up and stared at Major DeCosta\u0027s back. At forty-one, Caesar was a gaunt man with stooped shoulders and sad lines running from his nostrils to the corners of his mouth. His forehead was lined and re-lined, and the keen brown eyes were dulled with years of decisions and hard work.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was tired.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They called him the Hound because his face bore the same sad, quiet look worn by those dogs. And they called him weak because he let offenders off too easily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n DeCosta turned around. The young Major met his Chief\u0027s gaze.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well?\" The voice of the Dictator was quiet and calm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n DeCosta\u0027s eyes flickered. He straightened militarily. He shrugged.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is not for me to say, Sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A slow smile spread over those weary features. \"And you, Farouk?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lamberti stretched out his arm and balled his fist with the thumb extended and pointing down. \"You know me, Caesar.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I do. Even my best friend disagrees with my decisions now, after all these years of elbow-rubbing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are usually more out-spoken, Major DeCosta. Have you nothing more to say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n DeCosta\u0027s reply was slow in coming but rapid in delivery. \"I am around Caesar much of late,\" he rapped out. His back was stiff and military as he strode out of the Dictator\u0027s office.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Prefect Lamberti\u0027s gloved hand dropped to the butt of his gun, but Caesar shook his head in gentle negation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Julius Caesar Imperator V gazed sadly at the closed door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jay had given up trying to reason with Ilaria about God. The man was intelligent as well as brilliant—there\u0027s a tremendous difference—about everything else, but he was stubbornly obstinate to Jay\u0027s arguments. At least in Jay\u0027s terminology he was stubbornly obstinate. All faith is stubborn obstinacy. Kevin Ilaria\u0027s faith was appalling. His arguments were beautiful. Flawless. Jay thought of his old friend, Father O\u0027mare. Even that great psychologist-priest would be hard-put, he decided.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So he quit. He didn\u0027t give up. He just quit.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Can you tell a man the Earth\u0027s flat after he\u0027s been up in a jet?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Can you talk a bullet out of pursuing its path?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Can you reason with a Marxist?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If a man can conquer the greatest enemy the world has ever faced, is he not God? If he can turn from killing and soldiering to soothing and pacifying, is he not God? If he can make the world one, after twenty-two centuries of \u0027world anarchism\u0027 is he not God? If he can maintain the peace and keep the people happy and heal all sores is he not God? If he just looks at you when you call him \u0027God\u0027 or \u0027Savior\u0027 and smiles and say \u0027I?\u0027 is he not God? If he chooses the perfect man to continue in his place, is he not God?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But that\u0027s proof! Why die? Isn\u0027t God immortal?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Only God could realize that one man can\u0027t continue to reign indefinitely. His ideas, yes. But he must create another to carry on his ideas. There must be variety and diversions.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unshakeable. Unquestioning. Jay could never understand a person\u0027s sticking to the claim \u0027I\u0027m a Christian\u0027 or \u0027I\u0027m a Moslem\u0027 when he would be killed for it. Jay had always figured he\u0027d have said to Nero\u0027s men \u0027Me? Me? A filthy Christian? Not I. I love Jupiter and Juno. Step inside and see my altars ...\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now he was seeing what sturdy, rock-firm martyr faith was like.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So he quit.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Instead he learned about the gyro-jet cars which hugged the roads like lovers on a honeymoon. He watched them sprout stubby wings and breathe flame and soar straight up. He learned about saying \u0027Open\u0027 to a lock and having the electronic device \u0027recognize\u0027 him and let him in. He learned about personalphones which \u0027recognized\u0027 your voice. He learned about the tiny pellet of potassium cyanide and sulphuric acid with which the guns were loaded. The pellets struck and broke and the victim was dead in seconds. Very humane. No maimed or wounded. Just the dead.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He learned about self-shaping sandals—the most comfortable and most sensible shoes man had ever worn—and air baths and soft-voiced alarm clocks which politely told you it was time to get up and about unbreakable ring-finger chronos and about atomic heating and flawless plumbing and he saw plastic, plastic, plastic.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He learned about all of them. But his real delight was the depilatory cream. This, above all others, was man\u0027s greatest invention.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No shaving ... no silly damned socks or tight, hot shoes or tie ... no battery stalling or flat tires ... I guess this is paradise, Kevin!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And the perfect government and the perfect religion! All one race! One religion! One nation! One language! One nationality! One God!\" Ilaria added exuberantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That reminds me. How come I never see any coloreds?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Haven\u0027t you? By the way, no murderous car insurance or alimony laws, either. And no need for them. All marriages are ideal.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jay was readily detoured to this new novelty.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, don\u0027t let\u0027s go too far. Identical religion and race and customs and ideals and opinions may lower the divorce rate a lot, but there\u0027s still ye olde sex angle. A couple can go together twenty years and break up on the wedding night. Some are hot and some are cold and some are slow and some are fast. The only thing you could have improved on, is sex education. It\u0027s astounding how many people of my time know nothing about the sexual part of marriage. The most important part!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course it\u0027s doing what comes naturally; but what if two people have been taught from different viewpoints? Or if one hasn\u0027t been taught at all? Some people are actually ashamed or embarrassed. There are intelligent people who don\u0027t even know the biological facts! Few—especially women, know about the pleasure and the habit-forming angle. That\u0027s the one thing than can break up something beautiful in ten minutes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Education, maybe. Human nature, no.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Whew!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Excuse me, Kevin, for launching into a Phillipic, but that\u0027s long been my pet peeve. Atrocious, deplorable, and all that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We don\u0027t usually tamper with human nature, Jay. As a rule, that is. This is going to come as a shock to you, with your silly, \u0027atrocious and deplorable\u0027 1954 ideas and morals.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A trial period. A pre-marital period of living together for a couple of weeks. If the couple isn\u0027t sexually suited, they either attempt to have it remedied by a physician or break off.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A shock, yes,\" Jay murmured, slowly shaking his head. \"How did it ever start? Anyone who\u0027d propound an idea like that in my time would be accused of being some sort of perverted sex-fiend!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A foolproof, flawless plan to insure happy marriages!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Half across the world a door swung open and a tall dark man with piercing black eyes and a twin-tufted beard came in. His dark-green garment, faintly resembling a trench-coat, was double-breasted and belted and military cut. His feet were encased in plastileather boots which clicked as he came to attention before the desk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The plate on the desk read \"Praefectus Praetoriani.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Major del Ponta, Sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man behind the desk looked up. \"At ease, Major.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Major Ali ben del Ponta relaxed and waited.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man behind the desk finished scanning the sheet of micro-paper, marked something on it with a stylo, stuck it in the pneumatube on the corner of his desk, and pushed the button to close his desk drawer. He looked up at Major Ali ben del Ponta.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well?\" He put his hands together, fingers touching.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It has begun, Prefect Lamberti. All over the world our local men are leading their followers in attack. Captain Abram Mazzoli has sent in his report from Tel Aviv. The city is in his hands. Captain Mahomet DiSanto\u0027s \u0027Raiders\u0027 have complete control of the Sahara. Captain Arnaldi\u0027s forces are firmly entrenched in the old Washington area of America. He will move northward to meet Colonel Magnani\u0027s forces from Canada and Commander Campisano. They—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Campisano\u0027s airborne ready to roll?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Sir. Arrangements have been made. The drop will be just outside New York.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Alright. Then everything has gone off as scheduled?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Prefect Farouk Lamberti regarded his deskchron thoughtfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And Caesar will make his speech in twenty-five hours and thirty-three minutes?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Major del Ponta glanced at his own chron, which was strapped to the third finger of his left hand. \"Yes, Sir. At 1400, tomorrow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have the twenty-foot \u0027visor screen activated for public showing. Mount it outside as we\u0027d planned.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s being taken care of, Sir. The screen is on its way to the Square. There will be a crowd.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good. We all want to hear noble Caesar.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Del Ponta grinned. \"Yes, Sir. We all do. Especially tomorrow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He doesn\u0027t know?—or suspect?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He shouldn\u0027t Sir. Our men took over and began covering up at once. You know the atrocious condition of world communications systems. The Empire could fall and Rome might not hear of it for days.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s what I was counting on ... that and the Disturber. The degeneracy of the field military is terrible. They are allowing themselves to get lazy and fat and careless.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have my car ready to drive to the Square behind Caesar\u0027s tomorrow. See that the covermen in the houses around the Square are doubled and double-checked. But when we go to the show, let\u0027s not have too great an exhibition of Imperial power. We don\u0027t want this thing to backfire and cut our own throats.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Sir.\" Del Ponta\u0027s grin widened.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dismissed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Del Ponta came to attention, saluted and about-faced and left.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Prefect Lamberti opened his desk drawer and took out his old service pistol. It was a gamma gun. He had not released any of the deadly, slow-acting rays from its chamber in seven years. But it was ready.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He opened another drawer and took out a white cloak, marked across the back with a blue dove and the single word \u0027Liberacione.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He checked the pistol.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Does the Emissary from 1954 get to meet Caesar?\" Jay wanted to know.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Later. He\u0027s to make a speech tomorrow afternoon. It will be world-televised.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He looks very old and very tired,\" Jay ventured. He\u0027d seen Caesar on transcriptions of old speeches and on old newsreels.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027s about ... forty, I think. Somewhat weak. Very lenient.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would\u0027ve guessed him to be a good deal older.\" Then \"Why weak? Because he\u0027s lenient?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ilaria smiled. \"Remember, Jay, \u0027Pax per Bello.\u0027 Too much leniency leads one\u0027s subjects to be bold. Over-bold.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"One man\u0027s opinion?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Tribune shrugged. \"No. Caesar doesn\u0027t get along with his advisors too well. They criticize him for being too ready to forgive and forget.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The more Jay saw of this perfect world, the more he realized how cruel and hard people must be to maintain a paradise. If everyone is to be happy, someone must be unhappy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The trouble is, people don\u0027t like to be told \"This is for your own good.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jay said so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But if they\u0027re sat on hard enough,\" Ilaria rebutted, \"they don\u0027t have a chance ever to try anything else which they might think is for their own good....\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jay nodded. Very true. As Ilaria left the room Jay went to the window and looked out at the Louisville of 2054. For the millionth time in the seven days he\u0027d been here, he wished he had a cigarette. They had been outlawed as detrimental to health long ago.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The fact that it had been seven days reminded him of something else left behind.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Julie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re a fool,\" he finally told himself. No wonder Julie\u0027d been on edge and acting what he termed \u0027odd\u0027 lately! She was scared. He\u0027d been out of school three and a half years. He was twenty-five. He\u0027d just bought a new Olds. He\u0027d begun buying his clothes at The Store rather than a store. Hell, he should\u0027ve been married long ago. His days here were full. There were meetings with scientists and historians and militarists and linguists and everyone else Kevin could think up. He talked and listened and discussed and lectured. But he thought of her every night. Every morning before he rose. At times like this, when he was alone for a few minutes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of course it was love! He\u0027d always thought too many people threw the word around too much. He\u0027d always been afraid to use it because he wasn\u0027t sure of its meaning. He\u0027s used it once. And he\u0027d been kicked in the teeth by the girl. He hadn\u0027t used it since.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When was a guy ever sure?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2852/78711.html","bookId":1214,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:35:19 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:35:19 AM"}
