Her lips burned as with words unspoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was the Great Sundering?” she asked. But no one answered, and she closed her eyes to blessed darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long time later she swayed as on the ocean, and the gulf of air opened beyond her so that if she inhaled deeply enough, she could breathe in the entire universe and all the stars which lay within reach of her hand, there beyond the chasm. She saw ground far below and a cliff at her shoulder, rubbed by the huge basket in which she sat all curled up. She was jerked upward, fainted again, and then there was rock beneath her feet and hands to lift her up. Many voices echoed around her, and it was terribly dark, as dark as the Abyss, into which none of God’s light shines, for it is not the presence of the Enemy that is torment as much as the absence of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the air was sweet, and she was laid down on a soft bed and water soothed her skin and then an ointment eased the terrible pain that had gripped her back and shoulders and she was fed a gruel so soft and mildly warm that it slipped down her throat like a salve for the dolorous heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one had yet answered her. A face swam into view, as blurry as a shifting shoal of minnows underwater. It was ancient, wrinkled like an apple left over from the last autumn’s harvest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was the Great Sundering?” Rosvita asked, surprised to hear her own voice, such as it was, coarsened by pain and the hardship of the journey and their failure. Why was she asking this question? Where had it come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancient crone smoothed a salve onto her cheeks. For a moment it stung, then faded. “You are suffering from a lack of water, and a surfeit of sun and pain and anxiety, my child,” she said in a voice made reedy by age. “Who has spoken to you of the Great Sundering?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” said Rosvita, marveling. Her eyes had adjusted. Two slits in the rock chamber let in air and light, and she realized that she lay on a pallet in the middle of a circular room hewn from rock. The plastered walls were entirely covered with frescoes that had long since cracked and peeled with immense age. People—nay, not people, but creatures like to humankind—stared at her with jade green eyes and skin now discolored to a greenish bronze. They wore plumage more than clothing, bold feathers, crudely cut skirts sewn of leather and furs, cunningly tied loincloths, shawls woven of shells and gold beads and precious stones. There was some narrative written into these paintings, a lush land torn by invasion, a desperate, overwhelmed population, the workings of magi each of whom held a staff carved out of black stone. A man of their kind was flayed alive, and his blood gave birth to warriors. Great cities of a vast and intricate architecture burned and toppled. And there was a crown of stars: a stone circle set out under a night sky brilliant with stars. Only one constellation was picked out in jewels above the stone circle, that of the Child who will be Queen; she reached for the sparkling cluster of seven stars, itself called the Crown, that lay directly above Rosvita at the height of the curved dome that was the ceiling of the stone chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where am I?” Rosvita whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are here in the convent of St. Ekatarina, she who prayed and fasted in the desert for many days until in the heavens she saw a vision of titanic battles and of dragons flying in the sky. And a voice said to her: ‘All that is lost will be reborn on this earth because of a Great Unveiling like to that Great Sundering in which vanished the Aoi.’ Then she came to this place. Here she found these paintings which spoke to her of that terrible time when the Lost Ones ruled mortal lands. Here she established a convent, and so we few have followed after her in caring for what God have preserved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are these relics of the Aoi themselves?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who can know, child? These were painted long ago. Perhaps they represent the last testament of the Aoi. Perhaps they represent the memories of those humans who lived in that long ago time, before they had the means to record their remembrances in writing. But you must rest now. You must sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The others?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left, and Rosvita was alone, yet not alone at all because of the creatures who stared at her from the walls, accusing, plaintive, proud, and angry. They are not like us. They looked hard and cruel, arrogant and cunning and unforgiving. What was it the church mothers had written of elvenkind? “Born of the mating between humans and angels.” With all the cold beauty of angels and the bestial passions of humankind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanglant’s mother had looked so. Rosvita had seen her one time, when she was herself a very young woman newly come to King Arnulf’s court. The elven woman had called herself. “Alia,” which means “other,” in Dariyan; no one had ever known her real name. She had wanted something, and everyone had first thought she wanted the child, but then she had abandoned him soon after his birth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-195.html","bookId":2014,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM"}
