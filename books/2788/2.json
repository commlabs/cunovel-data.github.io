This morning she wore a mint-green turban with an abundance of fluffy blonde curls springing forth from the top. She looked like a test tube fizzing over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely.\" I pulled a cup from the cupboard, trying to disregard the stained interior, and handed it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting up today had been a challenge. The mattress in my room felt like a bag of oranges, and the sound of the rolling waves hadn\u0027t lulled me to sleep at all. They just made me need to pee. When Jordan climbed into my bed at sunrise, bringing the dogs and their slobber with him, I wondered again if coming to Bell Harbor was a mistake. But Dody had badgered me with the tenacity of a Jehovah\u0027s Witness until I couldn\u0027t think of another reason to say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you sleep?\" Dody handed back the cup after sprinkling cinnamon on the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" I lied, wishing I could inject the coffee straight into my veins. I reached past her to straighten the pot, lining it up with the blender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful, dear. I was thinking after breakfast we could take a walk. There\u0027s a trail that leads right to the playground at the elementary school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy kids were sitting at the kitchen island, their eyes still a little puffy from sleep but hopeful with expectation. I leaned over and kissed their cheeks. Paige kissed me back while Jordan turned his face into his shoulder. He was getting too old for kisses, and my heart stung a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Mommy? I\u0027d like to see the school.\" Paige smiled her most beatific smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you brush your teeth before you came downstairs?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan frowned. \"I thought we were on vacation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not from dental hygiene. Brush them after you eat, then we\u0027ll go to the playground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fist bumped each other in victory, happy until Dody set steaming bowls in front of them. \"Eat your porridge, dears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige frowned at the foreign glop. \"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudged her in the shoulder. \"It\u0027s oatmeal, Paige. Just eat it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t look like our oatmeal. What are all those specks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peeked down at the sludge. Dody\u0027s cooking hadn\u0027t improved over the years. As kids, my sister and I sometimes made random bets and whoever lost had to eat one of Dody\u0027s peculiar concoctions. Her oatmeal was the worst offender, always gummy and discolored. And sometimes you\u0027d bite into something and couldn\u0027t tell what it was or why it was in there. I\u0027ve long suspected Jasper became a chef purely out of self-defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are the specks?\" I couldn\u0027t resist asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flaxseeds. They help you poop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan\u0027s eyes went big and round. \"Pooping is funny. One time I pooped a -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jordan!\" This was not the time for that story. \"Just eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, eat up, darlings. I have to be back here by noon. Harry is taking me skeet shooting.\" She pressed a hand to her temple and looked at me. \"Oh, dear. Is that rude of me? To go out on a date when you haven\u0027t had one in ages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said the word ages as though it caused physical pain. That was harsh, having my sixty-five-year-old auntie feeling sorry for me because her social life was superior to mine. But then again, it always had been. After Uncle Walter died, she\u0027d entertained a constant stream of suitors. It seemed the single gentlemen of Bell Harbor\u0027s AARP loved her zany sense of humor and zest for life. Well, that, and the fact that she put out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine, Dody. After the playground the kids and I will go to the beach. I want to teach them to swim anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, toots! Come here,\" Fontaine called from the deck, doing his best crocodile hunter accent. \"Running Man, dead ahead. Crikey, will you look at the sleek hindquarters on that mate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe runner? Again? What kind of pretentious jerk went running twice in twelve hours? I didn\u0027t need to see that. He was nothing to me. Still, I peeked out the kitchen window, where I could see his silhouette fast approaching. I took a sip from my cup. Well, I guess it was a fresh, sunny morning, perfect for enjoying one\u0027s coffee on the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thus began a lazy morning routine we performed each day for the next two weeks. Mystery porridge for my aunt and the kids in the kitchen and dark, caffeinated nectar of the gods for me and my cousin on the deck. Running Man became an unwitting accomplice to our daily ritual. Fontaine discovered that if we slouched down in the lounge chairs and stared between the railings, we could get a really good look at him. But some days we\u0027d stand tall and boldly wave like tourists on a double-decker bus. It all depended on how my hair looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should walk the dogs,\" Fontaine declared one morning, just after the runner had passed. \"When Running Man sprints by, the dogs will chase him and then you can introduce yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach flipped, like that moment you see the police car behind you and wonder if you were speeding. \"I don\u0027t want to introduce myself. These two weeks have given me the best relationship I\u0027ve ever had. I\u0027m not going to wreck it by actually getting to know him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine\u0027s dark head dropped. \"Baby girl, listen when I tell you this, you have got to get back on that pony. How long has it been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a slug of coffee. It suddenly tasted old and bitter. Like me. \"Since I rode the pony? None of your business.\" I did not want to have this conversation, not even with Fontaine, who, believe me, held nothing back. I rose from my deck chair and tucked it in snugly under the glass-topped table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That long, huh?\" Fontaine sipped his own coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that long.\" I wiped a spot off the tabletop with the edge of my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has there been anybody since Richard?\" He put out his foot, making me step over him in my haste to go inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d gone on a handful of dates since kicking Richard to the curb, but each one had been exponentially worse than the one before. The last had gone so horribly awry I nearly flung myself down an open elevator shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine pounced like a puma. \"Oh, there has been. I can tell. Spill it, cupcake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped him the finger and walked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndeterred, Fontaine followed, fast on my heels. \"Oh, come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I\u0027d have to give him something. The man was a pit bull in capris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say that on my last date I made a huge error in judgment, and he never called me again. OK?\" I picked up a pair of Jordan\u0027s shoes from the middle of the floor and set them down next to the ones I\u0027d lined up by the door yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, I see.\" His nod was all-knowing. He plopped down on the sofa in the living room. \"But you shouldn\u0027t be so hard on yourself. We\u0027ve all made that mistake. And it\u0027s exactly why you need to get back out there! Don\u0027t let that guy be the last guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudged the coffee table over a few inches with my knee. \"You are as pushy as your mother. She thinks I should go out with Anita Parker\u0027s derelict son! You know, the one who used to throw tent worms in my hair when we were little? No thanks. I am just fine being on my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you.\" He plucked at the fringe of a sofa pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Don\u0027t you think I can take care of myself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can, but we humans are social creatures and being alone is aberrant behavior. Trust me. I\u0027m an expert on aberrant behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet.\" I tossed a coordinating pillow next to him while dropping Fatso\u0027s chew toy into a basket with my other hand. \"Anyway, I don\u0027t want to talk about this. I\u0027m not interested in meeting new men right now.\" Or ever, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, fine.\" Fontaine pouted for a moment, stroking his goatee. I could feel his eyes boring into me as I puttered, trying to bring order to Dody\u0027s chaotic collections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up a speck of fuzz from the carpet and rearranged the magazines until his silence became unbearable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop doing that!\" I said at last. \"You\u0027re starting to freak me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes had a mischievous glint, like the time when we were sixteen and he talked me into smoking dope behind the boat shed and I ended up swimming naked in the lake. Then I woke up the next morning covered in beach grass cuts with a half gallon of melted ice cream on my pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are giving me an idea,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled. \"I don\u0027t like your ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might like this one. Check it out. I\u0027m an interior designer, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" I hesitated, another dog toy dangling from my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I go into people\u0027s houses, I see junk. Tons of junk, everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you love to put junk away. You\u0027re like one of those robotic vacuum thingies. What are they called? A Roomba!\" He snapped his fingers. \"That\u0027s it. You are a human Roomba. You\u0027re a...a humba. It\u0027s freakishly mesmerizing, I might add.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I should be a cleaning lady?\" I tossed the dog toy into the basket and stacked the coasters on the coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, dumbass. You should be a professional organizer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own burst of laughter surprised me. \"A professional organizer? Damn it, Fontaine. I thought you were serious. No one would pay me for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pudding pop, they\u0027ll pay huge! There are rich folks out there with piles of loot and way too much stuff. But they\u0027re too busy making more money to organize the crap they already own. But you have a gift. Seriously, look what you\u0027ve done to this place in just two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed the swooping motion of his arms. I had made some improvements at Dody\u0027s. It was nearly habitable now, with a clear path from the kitchen to the dining room and on to the sunporch. I\u0027d even convinced her to move the Star Wars figurines to a back bedroom instead of displaying them next to her grandmother\u0027s antique crystal vases. Now if I could just get her to move the jackalope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine went on talking. \"I design gorgeous rooms for my clients and they ruin it with papers lying around and hockey sticks and Wii remotes. They don\u0027t know how to put things in order. But to you, organizing comes naturally. Like...sarcasm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. I spoke fluent sarcasm. And I had always been fastidious. I used to drive my sister, Penny, crazy when we played dolls. All she wanted to do was have Malibu Barbie smooch with Beachcomber Ken, but I always made them fold up all their little clothes first and put away all those tiny shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A professional organizer, huh?\" I sank down onto the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, girlfriend. Use that personality disorder of yours for good instead of evil. Just think about it.\" He hoisted himself off the couch and left the room, leaving me to ponder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmm. I did love to categorize. And sort, and fold, and tuck, and stack. In fact, the best gift Richard ever gave me was my own label maker. He bought it as a joke, but I loved it. Of course, if I\u0027d had any brains I\u0027d have put a big, fat label on his forehead that said married. But maybe Fontaine was on to something. A job would give me something to focus on, something to move toward, instead of using all my energy to outrun my past. And I liked working. At least I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Richard and I first got married, I was fresh out of college. I had a lovely little job at a bookstore where I met every sort of person. Moms, grandparents, writers, and pseudo-intellectuals. But Richard didn\u0027t like that I wasn\u0027t home waiting for him. I think he mostly didn\u0027t like freethinking individuals out there filling my head with dangerous ideas. Then once Paige was born, I wanted nothing more than to be with her every minute of the day, and staying home seemed like a privilege.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she and Jordan weren\u0027t babies anymore. Soon they\u0027d both be in school all day and I would need something to occupy my time. Maybe having a job would give me some purpose, some direction. Some identity other than Richard Turner\u0027s ex-wife. If nothing else, when someone asked, \"And what do you do?\" it would give me something to answer besides, \"I sponge off of my ex-husband\u0027s bad judgment.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-2.html","bookId":2788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM"}
