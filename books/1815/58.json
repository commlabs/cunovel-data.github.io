I didn’t until we’d been coming to you for a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’d had nightmares, the really bad ones that had been coming less frequently of late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone buzzed again and I pulled it out. “Excuse me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Angus. I’m outside the office door, he’d texted first. This time, It’s urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy spine stiffened. Angus wouldn’t disturb me without a very good reason. I stood. “I’ll have to cut this short,” I told Dr. Petersen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set aside his tablet and rose to his feet. “Is everything all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If not, I’m sure you’ll hear about it on Thursday.” I shook his hand quickly and left the office, passing through the empty reception area before stepping out to the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus stood there, looking grim. He wasted no time. “The police are at the penthouse with Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy blood turned to ice. I strode to the elevator with Angus falling into step beside me. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anne Lucas filed charges of harassment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand shook as I poured freshly brewed coffee into three mugs. I couldn’t tell if that was because I was so pissed off or because I was afraid. Certainly, I was both. Being a cop’s daughter, I understood the unwritten rules followed by those who worked behind the blue wall of law enforcement. And after everything Gideon and I had been through regarding Nathan’s death, I was doubly on my guard now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn’t Detectives Graves and Michna of the homicide division who wanted to speak to me. I couldn’t decide if that made me more or less anxious. They were the devil I knew, so to speak. And while I wouldn’t go so far as to call Shelley Graves an ally, she’d dropped the case when she still had questions without answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time around, it was Officers Peña and Williams who had shown up on our doorstep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was Anne Lucas who sent them my way. That fucking bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d had to cut my appointment with Blaire Ash short, knowing it was unavoidable that the designer would pass the officers in the lobby when he exited the private elevator. I didn’t have time to worry about what he’d make of that. Instead, I took the brief time alone to call Raúl and tell him to find Arash Madani. I wanted to call Gideon, but he was with Dr. Petersen and I considered that more important. I could handle the police. I knew the basics: Have an attorney present and be succinct. Don’t elaborate or offer information not asked for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting the three mugs of coffee on a serving tray, I searched for something to pour the half-and-half into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have to go to any trouble, Ms. Tramell,” Officer Peña said as he and his partner entered the kitchen with their hats tucked under their arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeña had a baby face that made him look younger than he probably was, which I guessed was close to my age. Williams was a petite, curvy black woman, with sharp cop eyes that told me she’d seen things I would never want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d asked them to wait in the living room and they had followed me instead. That made me feel hunted, which I’m sure was part of their intention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no trouble.” I gave up trying to be classy about the half-and-half and just set the carton on the island. “And I’m waiting for my attorney to arrive, so there’s really not much else for me to do in the meantime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Williams eyed me coolly, as if she were wondering why I felt the need for counsel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have to justify myself but knew it wouldn’t hurt to let them know why I was cautious. “My dad’s on the job in California. He’d chew me out if I didn’t follow his advice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed the box of sugar I’d dug out of the pantry and set it on the tray before moving it all over to the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where in California?” Peña asked, grabbing a mug and taking his coffee black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oceanside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“San Diego area, right? Nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliams took her coffee with a splash of half-and-half and a whole lot of sugar, which she poured straight from the box. “Is Mr. Cross here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s in a meeting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her gaze on me as she lifted her mug to her lips. “Who was the guy leaving when we came up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deliberate casualness of her tone made me glad I’d sent word to Arash. I didn’t believe for a minute that the question was just small talk. “Blaire Ash. He’s the interior designer working on some renovations we’re doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You live here?” Peña asked. “We stopped by an apartment on the Upper West Side we heard was yours.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-58.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
