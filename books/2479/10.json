Some of the other villagers came over to see what they might scrounge from the bountiful knapsacks of the foreign giants. The commotion interrupted Captain Aubrey\u0027s questioning of the elders, and he came storming at the Bostonian like a monsoon cloud. It was explained to the soldier that he was not to be giving away his food or any other item in his possession, that the elders didn\u0027t want gifts because the Cong had been known to slaughter whole villages when they found canned goods, mirrors, or other trinkets. All this had been said with Captain Aubrey\u0027s face about two inches from the Bostonian\u0027s, and by the time the captain was finished speaking in his voice that could curl a chopper\u0027s rotors, the Bostonian\u0027s face had gone chalky under his fresh sunburn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was just a piece of candy,\" the young man had said when Captain Aubrey returned to his business and the children had been scattered away. \"It\u0027s no big deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan had looked at the Bostonian\u0027s sweat-damp shirt and seen his name printed there in black stencil over the pocket: Farrow. \"Out here everythin\u0027s a big deal,\" Dan had told him. \"Just lay low, do what you\u0027re supposed to, and don\u0027t go south, you might live for a week or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe platoon had left Cho Yat, moving across the flat, gleaming rice paddies toward the dark wall of jungle that lay beyond. Their patrol had lasted four hours and discovered not so much as the print of a Goodyear-soled sandal It was on the way out when the point team had radioed to Captain Aubrey with the message that something was burning in Cho Yat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerging from the jungle with the others, Dan had seen the dark scrawl of smoke in the ugly yellow sky.

If it was a police car ... His fingers weift to the key in the ignition switch. The headlights came closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan watched them coming, sweat glistening on his face. Then the car stopped about twenty feet away and the lights went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breathing resumed on a ragged note. It was a darkcolored Toyota, not a police car. Dan watched the rearview mirror for a few seconds longer, but he saw no other lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there waiting. So did the Toyota\u0027s driver. Well, he would have to make the first move. He got out and stood beside the station wagon. The driver\u0027s door of the Toyota opened, and a woman got out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe courtesy light gave Dan a brief glimpse of the young man who sat in the passenger seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan?\" If the sound of her voice had been glass, it would have cut his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me,\" he answered.

She showed him she still had her grit. She continued to walk toward him, toward the man who had suffered midnight mges and deliriums, who had attacked their son in his bed, who had brought some of the hell of that war back with him when the last helicopter left Saigon. Susan stopped n when she was an arm\u0027s length away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look good,\" he told her, and it was the truth. Susan had been on the thin side when they\u0027d divorced, but now she looked fit and healthy. He figured her nerves were a lot steadier without him around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d cut her dark brown hair to just above her shoulders, and Dan could tell that there was a lot of gray in it. Her face was still firm-jawed and more attractive than he remembered. More confident, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was some pain in her eyes, which were a shade between gray and green. She wore jeans and a short-sleeved pale blue blouse. Susan was still Susan: a minimum of makeup, no flashy jewelry, nothing to announce that she was anything other than a woman who accepted no pretense. \"You must be doin\u0027 all right,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.

Then all of a sudden he raced off, and I thought for sure they\u0027d caught you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan figured the man had gotten a radio call.

At seventeen years, Chad was hardly a boy anymore. He was husky and broad-shouldered, as Dan himself used to be. He was so changed from the picture Dan had-the picture left behind at the Hideaway Motor Court-that the sight of him was like a punch to Dan\u0027s chest. Chad\u0027s face had lost its baby fat and taken on the angles and planes of manhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sandy-brown hair was cut short, and the sun had burnished his skin. Dan caught the scent of Aqua Velva; the young man must\u0027ve shaved before they\u0027d left the motel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad wore khaki trousers and a blue-and-red tie-dyed T-shirt, the muscles in his arms defined. Dan figured he did outdoor work, maybe light construction or yardkeeping. He looked fine, and Dan realized this was going to be a lot tougher than he\u0027d thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you recognize me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kinda,\" Chad said. He paused, thinking it over. \"Kinda not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan eased into the driver\u0027s seat, but he left the door ajar to keep the courtesy light on. \"It\u0027s been a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir,\" Chad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You workin\u0027 this summer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir. Helpin\u0027 Mr. McCullough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got a landscapin\u0027 business. Puts in swimmin\u0027 pools, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good. You helpin\u0027 your mom around the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir. I keep the grass cut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan nodded. Chad\u0027s speech was a little hesitant and there was a dullness in his eyes. Otherwise, there was no outward sign of Chad\u0027s mental disability. Their son had been bornas the counselor put it-\"learning disabled.\" Which meant his thinking processes were always going to be labored, and tasks involving intricate detail would be difficult for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis fact of life had added to the fuel of Dan\u0027s anger in those bad years, had made him curse God and strike out at Susan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, tempered by time, he thought that the Agent Orange might have afflicted Chad. The poison that had seeped into Dan had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis sperm for years, like a beast in a basement, and:@ from him through Susan into their son. None of what he suspected could be proven in any court of law, but Dan thought it was true as surely as he remembered the oily feel of the dirty silver rain on his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching Chad try to put his thoughts together was like someone s to open a rusted lock. Most times the tumblers feff into place, but Dan remembered that when they didn\u0027t, the boy\u0027s face became an agony of frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve really grown up,\" Dan said. \"I swear, time\u0027s a thief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir?\" Chad frowned; the abstract statement had passed him by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan rubbed the bruised knuckles of his right hand. The moment had arrived. \"Your mom told you what I did, didn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir. She said the police are after you. That\u0027s why they came to the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. You\u0027ll probably hear a lot of bad things about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re gonna hear people say that I\u0027m crazy, that I walked into that bank with a gun, lookin\u0027 to kill somebody.\" Dan was speaking slowly and carefuly, and keeping eye contact with his son. \"But I wanted to tell you, face-to-face, that it\u0027s not true. I did shoot and kill a man, but it was an accident. It happened so fast it was like a bad dream. Now, that doesn\u0027t excuse what I did. There\u0027s no excuse for such a thing.\" He paused, not knowing what else to say. \"I just wanted you to hear it from me,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad looked away from him and worked his hands together. \"Did ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat man you killed... did he do something\u0027 bad to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could say he did, but he was just doin\u0027 his job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna give yourself up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad\u0027s gaze came back to him. His eyes seemed more focused and intense. \"Mom says you can\u0027t get away. She says they\u0027ll find you sooner or later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Dan said, \"I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/* \u003c![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]\u003e */\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon it being\u0027 later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in silence for a moment, neither one looking at the other. Dan had to say this next thing he couldn\u0027t recall his father-the spit-and-polish major-ever saying it to him, which made saying it doubly difficult and doubly important. \"I wasn\u0027t such a good father,\" he began. \"I had some things inside me that wouldn\u0027t let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made me blind and scared. I wasn\u0027t strong enough to get help, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your mom told me she wanted a divorce, it was the best thing she could\u0027ve done for all of us.\" Tears suddenly burned his eyes, and he felt a brick wedged in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not one day goes by that I don\u0027t think about you, and wonder how you\u0027re doin\u0027. I know I should\u0027ve called, or written you a letter, but ... I guess I didn\u0027t know what to say. Now I do.\" He cleared his throat with an effort. \"I just wanted you to know I love you very, very much, and I hope you don\u0027t think too badly of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad didn\u0027t respond. Dan had said everything he needed to. It was time to go. \"You gonna take good care of your mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir.\" Chad\u0027s voice was thick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He put his hand on his son\u0027s shoulder, and it crossed his mind that he would never do this again. \"You hang tough, hear.9\" Chad said, \"I\u0027ve got a picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A picture? Of what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elis \"You.\" Chad reached into his back pocket and brought out his wallet. He slid from it a creased photograph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan took it. The photo, which Dan recalled was snapped at a Sears studio, showed the Lambert family in 1978.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan-burly and beardless, his face sunburned from some outdoors carpentry job but his eyes deepset and hauntedand Susan were sitting against a paper backdrop of summer mountains, the four-year-old Chad smiling between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad\u0027s arms were clutched to their shoulders. Susan, who appeared frail and tired, wore a brave smile. Looking at the picture, Dan realized it was the image of a man who hadn\u0027t yet learned that the past was a more implacable enemy than any VietCong crouched in a snake hole. He had given his nightmares power over him, had \u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"13617653\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/a\u003e to seek help because a man-a good soldier-did not admit weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the end that war he\u0027d survived had taken everything of worth away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the picture, he thought, of a man who\u0027d gone south a long, long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a picture of me?\" Chad asked. Dan shook his head, and Chad took a folded piece of paper from the wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can have this one if you want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan unfolded the paper. It was a picture of Chad in a football uniform, the number fifty-nine across his chest. The camera had caught him in a posed lunge, his teeth gritted and his arms reaching for an off-frame opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cut it out of last YaWs annual,\" Chad explained. \"That was the day the whole team got their pictures taken. Coach Pierce said to look mean, so that\u0027s what I did.\"You did a good job of it. I wouldn\u0027t\u0027 care to line up against you.\" He gave his son a smile. \"I do want this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you.\" He refolded the picture and put it in his own pocket, and he rewmed the Sears studio photograph to Chad. And now, as much as he wished it weren\u0027t so, he had to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad knew it, too. \"You ever comin\u0027 back? he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dan said. He didn\u0027t know quite how to end this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwkwardly, he offered his hand. \"So long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad leaned into him and put his arms around his father\u0027s shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan\u0027s heart swelled. He hugged his son, and he wished for the impossible- a rolling-back of the years. He wished the dirty silver rain had never fallen on him. He wished Chad had never been contaminated, that things could\u0027ve been patched up with Susan, and that he\u0027d been strong enough to seek help for the nightmares and flashbacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe guessed he was vnshing for a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad said, up close to his ear, \"So long, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan let his son go and got out of the car. His eyes were wet. He wiped them with his forearm as he walked to the station wagon, where Susan waited. He\u0027d almost reached her when he heard a dog barking, a high-pitched yap yap yap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan stopped in his tracks. The sound had drifted across the park, its direction hard to pinpoint. It was close enough, though, to instantly set Dan\u0027s nerves on edge. Where had it come from? Was somebody walking a dog in the park at this hour.9 Wherever it was, the dog had stopped barking. Dan glanced around, saw nothing but the dark shapes of pine trees that stood in clusters surrounding the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all right?\" Susan looked as if she\u0027d aged five years in the last few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" A tear had trickled down his cheek into his beard. for bringin\u0027 him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you think I wouldn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know.
