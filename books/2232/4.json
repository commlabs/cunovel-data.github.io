{"id":107807,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003eABBEY DES FONTAINES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFRENCH PYRENEES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:00 PM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SENESCHAL KNELT BESIDE THE BED TO COMFORT HIS DYING master. For weeks he\u0027d prayed that this moment would not come. But soon, after ruling the Order wisely for twenty-eight years, the old man lying on the bed would achieve a well-earned peace and join his predecessors in heaven. Unfortunately for the seneschal, the tumult of the physical world would continue, and he dreaded that prospect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was spacious, the ancient stone-and-wood walls free of decay, only the pine-hammered ceiling beams blackened by age. A solitary window, like a somber eye, broke the exterior wall and framed the beauty of a waterfall matted by a stark gray mountain. A growing dusk thickened the room\u0027s corners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seneschal reached for the old man\u0027s hand. The grip was cold and clammy. \"Can you hear me, Master?\" he asked in French.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tired eyes opened. \"I am not gone as yet. But soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d heard others in their final hour make similar statements and wondered if the body simply did exhaust itself, lacking the energy to compel lungs to breath or a heart to beat, death finally conquering where life had once flourished. He gripped the hand tighter. \"I\u0027ll miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile came to the thin lips. \"You have served me well, as I knew you would. That\u0027s why I chose you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will be much conflict in the days ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are ready. I have seen to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was the seneschal, second only to the master. He\u0027d risen fast through the ranks, too fast for some, and only the master\u0027s firm leadership had quelled the discontent. But death would soon claim his protector and he feared open revolt might follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no guarantee I\u0027ll succeed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You underestimate yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I respect the power of our adversaries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA silence washed over them, allowing the larks and blackbirds beyond the window to announce their presence. He stared down at his master. The old man wore an azure smock besprinkled with golden stars. Though the facial features were sharpened by his approaching death, there remained a vigor to the old man\u0027s lean form. A gray beard hung long and unkempt, the hands and feet constricted with arthritis, but the eyes continued to glisten. He knew twenty-eight years of leadership had taught the old warrior much. Perhaps the most vital lesson was how to project, even in the face of death, a mask of civility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor had confirmed the cancer months ago. As required by Rule, the disease was allowed to run its course, the natural consequences of God\u0027s action accepted. Thousands of brothers through the centuries had endured the same end, and it was unthinkable that the master would soil their tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could smell the water\u0027s spray,\" the old man whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seneschal glanced toward the window. Its sixteenth-century panes were swung open, allowing the sweet aroma of wet stone and verdant greens to seep into his nostrils. The distant water roared in a bubbly tenor. \"Your room offers the perfect venue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the reasons I wanted to be master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, knowing the old man was being facetious. He\u0027d read the Chronicles and knew that his mentor had ascended by being able to grasp each turn of fortune with the adaptiveness of a genius. His tenure had been one of peace, but all that would soon change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should pray for your soul,\" the seneschal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time for that later. Instead, you must prepare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The conclave. Gather your votes. Be ready. Do not allow your enemies time to rally. Remember all I taught you.\" The hoarse voice cracked with infirmity, but there was a firmness in the tone\u0027s foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure that I want to be master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friend knew him well. Modesty required that he shun the mantle, but more than anything he wanted to be the next master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the hand within his shiver. A few shallow breaths were needed for the old man to steady himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have prepared the message. It is there, on the desk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew it would be the next master\u0027s duty to study that testament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The duty must be done,\" the master said. \"As it has been done since the Beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seneschal did not want to hear about duty. He was more concerned with emotion. He looked around the room, which contained only the bed, a prie-dieu that faced a wooden crucifix, three chairs protected by an old tapestried cushion, a writing desk, and two aged marble statues standing in wall niches. There was a time when the chamber would have been filled with Spanish leather, Delft porcelain, English furniture. But audacity had long been purged from the Order\u0027s character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs from his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man gasped for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared down at the man lying in an uneasy slumber of disease. The master gathered his wind, blinked a few times, then said, \"Not yet, old friend. But soon.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1/page-4.html","bookId":2232,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM"}
