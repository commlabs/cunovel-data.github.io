But when she went to step inside, Gian caught her arm. \"Say the words, Skye. Invite me in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a small half-smile. \"Come inside, Gian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door closed behind him decisively, triumphantly. His expression was fierce predator and aroused man. She wouldn\u0027t deny him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye took the Harley jacket off and dropped it over the back of a chair. His eyes traveled along her body, taking satisfaction in the beaded nipples, in the need he could see rippling over her skin. It wouldn\u0027t be an easy hunt, but in the end she would accept his binding. She wouldn\u0027t be able to fight the demands of her body, of her Angelini bloodline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian\u0027s eyes settled on the mark he\u0027d given her in the parking lot and for an instant he could only stare in disbelief. She\u0027d allowed some other man to touch her, to cover his mark with their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind instantly flashed to the man he\u0027d seen her dancing with at the club. \"Who is he?\" Gian growled as he closed the short distance, crowding into Skye\u0027s space, wanting her to fear his retribution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t back up, didn\u0027t back down. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been with someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re a virgin?\" Her lips tipped up in a half-smile that sent heat roaring through his veins along with possessive rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nostrils flared. There was no remorse in her. No fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was strong, but he was stronger. She had some of The Bloodline in her, but he was full-vampire and had been for centuries. A flick of his wrist and he could snap her neck. A quick strike and he could bleed her to death, or to the point where she was so weak that he could overcome her defenses and make her a puppet, a servant whose only desire was to please her master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gums tingled. His fangs threatened to slip from their sheaths, itched to sink into her neck, into the hot, thick, rich blood that flowed there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye stilled and he could see wariness replace her earlier amusement. \"Should I tell you to leave?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian stepped back and forced a calmness into his body. Few laws applied to him, but he could not be here if she denied him access. There would be time to deal with this other man later-unless she\u0027d taken him as a mate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle\u0027s words came back to haunt him. And you will share her with another? A shifter? A human? The Angelini have always taken two mates in order to make their hunting easier, in order to better protect themselves. You know that as well as I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thoughts stilled Gian. He had shared women in the past, though he\u0027d never thought to share his companion. But if she had truly bound another man to her then there would be no choice. To destroy her mate would mean that he\u0027d have to destroy her as well. She would never be completely safe otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian\u0027s eyes narrowed. Perhaps she would never be completely safe anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cursed himself. He should have taken her last night, should have bound her to him first. The call of her blood was a siren song, a melody that had resonated in his soul from the first moment he\u0027d seen her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved away, toward the kitchen. \"Do you want something to drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was his turn to half-smile. Oh yes, he wanted something to drink. But until her defenses were lowered, until her senses were clouded with passion, he would have to wait to take what he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Red wine if you have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about white zinfandel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little sweet for my taste, but I\u0027ll share a glass with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took him literally, pouring wine into a single glass before taking a seat on the couch. Gian joined her, once again pushing into her space, but this time as a lover would. \"You didn\u0027t join your friends at the club tonight,\" he said, taking the wineglass from her fingers and pressing his lips over the spot hers had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stopped by a place called Bangers instead. Have you heard of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small laugh escaped him. So she had been out hunting tonight, as he was out hunting now, only the prey was different. \"I know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the glass from him, brushing his fingers with hers and sending a pulse of fire to his cock. Her eyes never left his as she said, \"Haley\u0027s sister was seen there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threaded his hands through her hair, tilting her head so that her neck was slightly arched. The bite mark pulsed with the beat of her heart. \"Let\u0027s not talk about Jen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set the wineglass down on the coffee table. \"Or anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or anything else,\" he agreed, leaning forward so that his lips hovered above hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye pressed her hands to his chest, feeling the smoothness of his shirt and the hardness of the body it covered. The need to be with him was a compulsion that was impossible to fight, just as it had been impossible to fight the need to be with Rico. Her body was like a separate entity. It wanted both men, needed them both, would settle for nothing less than having them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian\u0027s fingers undid her braid, freeing the hair to cover her shoulders and arms. His hands traveled to her sides and guided Skye so that she straddled him on the couch. She slipped the band out of his long black hair and plunged her fingers into thick silkiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesire whipped through Skye with an intensity that had her cunt tightening painfully. She rubbed her lower body against him. Felt him pump into her involuntarily. He was rock-hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir mouths met, tongues mated in heated, wet, darkness. Bodies strained for as much contact as possible, trying to melt into each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian ended the kiss, pulling away just far enough so that he could slip the tank top out of her jeans and over her head. It dropped soundlessly to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bra she wore was pale blue, almost transparent. When he would have reached for it she denied him in a low, husky voice. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye\u0027s hands moved to the buttons on his shirt. One by one she freed them. When she was done, she leaned forward and ran her tongue along his breastbone, in a line over to his heart then up across the small nipple. Gian panted. His lower body pumped into hers again and he grabbed her head, forcing her mouth to linger over the dark brown nipple. \"Bite me,\" he whispered, fighting the urge to open a wound on his chest and make her take his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye teased him instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tongue scraped over the nipple and sent a bolt of fire to his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arched into her, pressing his nipple against the seam of her lips. \"Bite me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grasped it between her lips, sucking it and striking it with her tongue, sending him spiraling higher and higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desire to mark him, to claim him, whipped through Skye with the same urgency she\u0027d experienced with Rico. She clamped down on his nipple and bit, reveling in the way he cried out, in the way his cloth-covered cock rose to press itself against her cunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beat of his heart drew her attention. She rubbed her lips and tongue along fevered skin until she was above it, until it felt as though it pulsed in her mouth. Once again she bit, clamping down on him hard, marking his skin with her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire roared through her blood, through his. They were both panting when she released her grip on him and leaned away, pushing his shirt aside so that bare skin could touch bare skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian\u0027s hands removed the bra without protest then returned to cover her breasts, squeezing her nipples in a rhythm that alternated between exquisite pain and unbearable pleasure. This time it was Skye who panted and moved her lower body against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands released the snap on his jeans and pulled the zipper down. She could feel him hard and thick against her. His lips left hers and moved along her neck, made the fire in her veins burn even hotter. He trailed kisses along her collarbone then back over the throbbing pulse in her neck. She arched into him, freeing his cock so that it burned against the palms of her hands. He was huge, ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian\u0027s hand slid along her side, rested briefly on her hip before slipping inside her panties and cupping her in his hand, rubbing her clit and teasing along the edges of her wet, swollen slit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye arched above him, tempting him with her pebbled nipples, the beat of her heart, the smell of her arousal. Gian\u0027s tongue lashed out across her areola and she moved in, offered herself to him, pleading as she\u0027d made him plead. \"Bite me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe need to sink his fangs into her, to have her blood spill over her nipple as he suckled was almost unbearable. His hiss was deep and primal as he clamped onto her breast, taking as much of her into his mouth as he could and reveling in the way she writhed and panted above him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thumb teased the engorged head of his penis as he sucked, as she pressed herself against him in demand. His lips moved to the spot above her heart and he bit her, as she\u0027d bitten him, only harder, so that the hot rush of her blood flowed over his tongue, intoxicating him, binding him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye thrashed above him, the primitiveness of his bite filling her with feral pleasure. She was slick and swollen, consumed by dark need. She wanted him to drink her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe animal instinct to mate was overwhelming, overpowering. She pulled away from him and stood, stripping the clothing from her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for her, pulling her to him and burying his face in her cunt, spearing his hot, greedy tongue into her channel. Her fingers dug into his hair, to steady herself, to hold him to her body. She spread her legs wider, offering more even as she demanded more. Again and again his tongue laved her clit, the inside of her thigh, her slick channel as though he was bathing in her scent, marking himself in it. When she orgasmed he tumbled them to the floor and hungrily ate everything she had to offer then locked his teeth on the inside of her thigh, biting her, marking her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sent her up again. Made the blood in her veins burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed him to his back and stripped him of his jeans, biting his neck, the place over his heart, his inner thigh before running her tongue along the thick veins and ridges of his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was huge, hungry, hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took him into her mouth and sucked, thrilling in the groan that was torn from his throat, at the violent way his body moved underneath hers. She cupped his balls, reveling in their size, in the way they tightened at her touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesire tore through Gian, a feral hunger unlike any he\u0027d ever known. He wanted to fill her mouth with his cum, to cover her body with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d thought to bind her to him, but instead she was binding him to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no fighting it, no turning back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body already craved hers as it had never craved another-as it would never crave another. This was an Angelini mating, not the making of a vampire companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother wave of fire ripped through Gian\u0027s body as her hands squeezed his balls, as her fingers explored the smooth skin behind them. The need to dominate whipped through him, the urge to fuck her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA growl tore from his throat as he pulled her away from his cock. She struggled, her eyes flashing wild and hungry, but she was no match for his strength as he forced her to her back and covered her with his body, slamming his cock into her at the same time his fangs found the pulse in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart thrilled. Her soul rejoiced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePleasure commanded Skye\u0027s body. She arched into him, offered herself even as she took him deep within her, locking him to her, claiming him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcstasy flooded her mind with each hot wave of orgasm, until finally there was only darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian shuddered as his fangs slid back into their sheaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cock was still buried in her hot, wet channel, but he couldn\u0027t bring himself to pull out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyelids flickered then opened. \"Did you bind him to you?\" Gian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stilled underneath him. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he understand what it means? Is he willing to share you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye\u0027s heart raced, her mind whirled with questions. Gian was the first person she\u0027d ever met who could hypnotize as she did. She\u0027d thought them alike at Fangs, but now her instincts screamed caution. To admit that she knew so little about her origins-about what she was-would be dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe countered with a question. \"Are you willing to share?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face tightened marginally, deep in his eyes a flame flared and danced. \"Is there any choice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we will both have you.\" But I will command you. I will own you for all eternity. You will be my companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian dropped his head and whispered a soft kiss over the mark on her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharp, painful need surged through Skye, from bite mark to bite mark to bite mark, from nipples to clit to womb. She arched against him, crying out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his mouth away from her fevered skin and stared into her passion-clouded eyes. \"Merge with me,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye felt his mind pressing down on hers as his body was, offering unparalleled ecstasy. She accepted the offer, embraced the dark promise in his eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skye-s-trail-the-angelini-1/page-7.html","bookId":1765,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM"}
