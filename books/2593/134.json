Can\u0027t smoke cigars there,\" McDermott and I say at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cross that one out,\" Hamlin says. \"Gandango?\" he suggests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibility, possibility,\" I murmur, mulling it over. \"Trump eats there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zeus Bar?\" one of them asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make a reservation,\" says the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I tell them, \"I\u0027m thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bateman ...,\" Hamlin warns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m toying with the idea,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bateman ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.

Right? Zeus Bar?\" Hamlin concludes, he hopes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys. I am finding myself increasingly incapable of dealing with this at all,\" McDermott says. \"Zeus Bar. That\u0027s final.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" Hamlin says. \"I\u0027ll call and make a reservation.\" He clicks off, leaving McDermott and myself on hold. It\u0027s silent for a long time before either one of us says anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" I finally say. \"It will probably be impossible to get a reservation there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should go to M.K.

I moan and tell McDermott to hold on. It\u0027s Jeanette. She sounds tired and sad. I don\u0027t want to get back on the other line so I ask her what she did last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After you were supposed to meet me?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause, unsure. \"Uh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We ended up at Palladium which was completely empty.

McDermott. Hamlin.\" And then, less hopefully, \"Would you like to meet us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she sighs.
