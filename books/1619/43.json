There were no clear lines any more, just waves of ants and flame. It seemed the offensive was a complete success. Wireless messages came in from all along the front. Enemy defences were overwhelmed, targets taken, fortifications breached. The armies of the Vaterland rolled on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We shall be in Paris by tomorrow\u0027s sunset,\u0027 Strasser opined to his commander-in-chief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attila descended gently. As enemy gun positions were taken or destroyed, it became safer for the aerial warship to approach the ground. With each confirmation, Strasser authorised a downward shift. The view through the port enlarged, showing more detail. The crawling ants became men, identifiable as things that fought and suffered and died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of battle seeped into the gondola. Stalhein was affected. His nose flattened into a snout. Vampire teeth thrust from his gums. The beginnings of a pelt pricked under his tunic. As his ears flared into bat-points, he heard more acutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrasser, a new-born, was plainly alarmed by Stalhein\u0027s tentative shape-shift. Stalhein knew the type. Like all dirigible men, Strasser deemed aeroplanes trespassers in the sky. He was discomforted further by the idea of men who grew their own wings. His dream, inherited from the likes of the Graf von Zeppelin and Engineer Robur, was mastery of the world attained by floating serenely in an unassailable gasbag, making doughnut holes in clouds, occasionally deigning to drop a bomb or two. Creatures who buzzed and tussled at lower altitudes were insect nuisances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this, Stalhein knew from meeting the kapitan\u0027s gaze for a moment. In his changed form, he acquired the ability to read the surface of a man\u0027s mind. He had to hold himself in, to prevent his spine swelling. If he were to transform completely, he would burst out of his uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the side-ports, Stalhein saw his comrades of JG1. They fell into formation around the Attila, an honour guard of demon princes. Fear boiled up from the ground. To the Entente, the coming of the Attila and its attendants must be the Day of Judgement. Many would be converted to the cause of Dracula by the magnificence of the spectacle. And many more would become helplessly insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were beyond the trenches now, sailing over territory that had been the enemy\u0027s less than an hour ago. The Attila kept level with the first wave of trundling tanks. Wherever the shadow of the dirigible fell was Germany\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young airman snapped a salute at his superiors and reported the sighting of hostile aircraft. Attention moved from the floor-port to the panoramic nose-window. A great bat-shape hung in front of the Attila. In his rightful place at the head of his formation, Baron von Richthofen held the air like a kite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night sky was warmed by ground fires. Stalhein saw the advancing specks that were enemy aircraft. Condor Squadron, the enemy\u0027s closest equivalent to JG1. Richthofen would appreciate the chance of a rematch with the men who had killed his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now we shall see the invincibility of the airship,\u0027 said Engineer Robur, rubbing his hands. \u0027These English lords are fools to get into a fight with us. The pests will be swatted from the sky.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula nodded gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Take us down closer to the battle,\u0027 he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop\u0027s mouth was full of blood and pain. His teeth split his jaw. The vampire in him rose, reddening his field of vision. He tore off goggles and mask, eyes open against the wind. He drank smoky, icy air, swallowing the taste of war. His night vision was perfect. The Ball and Kate voices whispered in his brain, urging him on to the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attila was monstrously large. Its presence over France was an insult, but Winthrop didn\u0027t care about the Zeppelin or its passenger. His sights were on the creature that flew ahead of the airship, the Bloody Red Baron. Tonight, Richthofen would be destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle passed swiftly beneath the observation port. Stalhein saw fire dots as guns were fired at the Attila. The picture enlarged so that individual skirmishes could be seen. A tank rumbling through a farmhouse, rising to get over the hump of smashed brickwork. Infantry creeping up on a gun position, stick grenades falling closer to the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula stood at the nose of the gondola, hands linked in the small of his back, surveying the scene, unsmiling as Camel fighters swarmed closer, spreading out to speckle the entire panorama of the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kapitan spoke urgently with Robur, who leaned on his sticks and impatiently shook his head. There was a disagreement between the airship men. Strasser, reluctant and concerned, relayed more orders to his crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStalhein\u0027s constricting sleeves split at the seams as his forearms swelled with sinew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the Camels fired. Tiny flashes popped around propellers. They were well out of range but the English liked to get a man\u0027s attention before engaging in combat. Stalhein respected that, though he thought it foolish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFliers came up from the sides of the Zeppelin and joined Richthofen in the forward position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a loud cracking rip. Airmen looked around. Stalhein\u0027s tunic had burst up the back. He shrugged out of the ruin and allowed himself a deep breath. His wings were forming, membranous folds blossoming in his armpits, running along the undersides of his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attila was ahead of the German advance. The roads below were thronged with retreating British and American troops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrasser was briefly engaged in conversation with Reitberg, the master bombardier. Vital gun positions were to be destroyed. Such actions would transform the Entente\u0027s retreat into a rout. Reitberg tottered along a walkway to the bomb bay, muttering to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Camel, ahead of its pack as forlorn hope, swooped at the Zeppelin. Two fliers converged on it from above and below, firing Spandaus. The aeroplane\u0027s engine burst in a fireball that scorched Stalhein\u0027s eyes. Fliers flapped backwards away from the explosion and the burning machine spiralled towards the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrasser\u0027s men gave a hearty cheer which was frozen by Robur\u0027s glower. It did not do for an airshipman to hail the achievements of mere wing-jockeys. Strasser went to Robur again, grabbing his sleeve and insisting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We are too low,\u0027 Strasser said, \u0027too close to the ground.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engineer shook the kapitan off but could not rid himself of dawning doubts. Robur, another Zeppelin fanatic, knew the limitations of the vessel he had designed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula half-turned, motioned with his hand. Lower still. Strasser almost protested but it was unthinkable that an order from the Graf be questioned. He stood back, unable to think, so Robur issued instructions, effectively usurping command. Airmen snapped to, pulling levers and wires that released pockets of gas, allowing the Attila to settle nearer the ground. Strasser threw up his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStalhein stepped forwards, round the observation port. Though only a little taller than in his man-shape, he was transformed into a flying beast, a man-bat. He spread his wings to steady himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood beside Dracula, watching his comrades engage the Camels in a dog-fight. Several more fighters blew to pieces, raining fiery debris on to the countryside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobur settled into his chair by the organ, enjoying his authority. Airshipmen, awed by this legend of their calling, deferred to him. Strasser was cut entirely from the chain of command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a rap at the window. A crack ran through the thick glass. A bullet-lump was lodged close to Dracula\u0027s head, tip sparkling silver. The Graf shrugged but Stalhein was close enough to notice the slight shiver of his shoulders. The commander-in-chief interlaced his fingers tighter behind him, quelling shaking hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong. Dracula was not afraid. Dracula was fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrasser was with them, awaiting the order to take the ship up. It was clearly time to withdraw to frozen heights and observe inevitable victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula turned his face to the fire-blotched darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We go down more,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop had expected the Attila to begin ascent as soon as Condor Squadron hove into view. Allard had prepared them for an attack on the Zeppelin\u0027s belly, warning of the thinning air and gathering cold that would form a ceiling beyond which an airship was safe and an aeroplane was doomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead the Attila hugged close to the crowded ground, bombing retreating troops. It was insane. Something as dangerous as a million gallons of flammable gas should never be allowed this close to a firefight. Dracula, of course, was insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop\u0027s Camel climbed on the first pass, breaking formation. Allard\u0027s plan, to concentrate fire from below at the engine and fuel supplies, would have to be abandoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed over the gasbag, wheels almost brushing an acre of stiffened silk. One bomb could destroy the whole leviathan. But the Camel was not a bomber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing the terrible strain that would be put upon his upper plane, Winthrop angled the Camel nose down and pressed his thumbs on the firing buttons. His Lewis guns strafed the top of the Attila, ripping parallel lines of tiny holes in the gasbag. It was about as effective as sticking hatpins into Moby-Dick. Incendiary bullets must strike something solid to explode. The tiny charges spent uselessly in the empty bloat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop overshot the Attila and ceased fire. He wheeled in the air for another assault. A batwinged thing had been on his tail. Now he faced it. Guns fired. He flew into a swarm of bullets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStalhein saw the faces of the Entente soldiers who fired up as bombs burst among them. The gondola rattled with direct hits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRifle fire would do little harm. The gondola was armoured and the gasbag big enough to sustain a million fleabite wounds before it was seriously ruptured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one explosive shell. One mortar bomb ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReitberg, staggering back along the bucking walkway, tripped and fell, clinging to rigging. Blood burst from his collar. A stray bullet had sunk in his neck. The bombardier pitched off the walkway on to the observation port. The glass jarred in its frame but did not break. Trickles of blood ran across the circle, spreading over the scene below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We must climb,\u0027 Strasser shouted, looking urgently at Dracula, torn apart. The kapitan could not question an order, only wait for it to be rescinded. Dracula watched the dog-fight, rigid as a statue. Strasser looked to Robur. The engineer was too delighted to have control of his creation to heed his subordinate\u0027s qualms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiraculously, Winthrop\u0027s engine was not hit. There were whistling holes in his fuselage, but he had come through. The shape-shifter he faced was not the Red Baron, but some smaller Prey-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop turned the Camel on its side and fired. He sliced past the flier, ripping into his wings with an accurate burst. The creature tumbled in the air, shoulders dislocated as wind caught his wings wrong. Winthrop did not see him recover, so he assumed the German fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flew fast, darting around the huge shape of the Attila, and kept losing sight of the battle. For a moment, as he replaced his ammunition drums, he thought he was alone in the air with the Zeppelin. Then he rounded the bulk of the gasbag, and saw Condor Squadron mixing with JG1 in a scramble of flame and wings. Aeroplanes exploded like comets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge flapping fire-shape fell out of the path of a Camel. From the size, Stalhein knew it was Emmelmann. Flames spread across the vast lump of his body and scattered across the canopies of his wings. Strasser gasped as Emmelman loomed close. If he were to plunge into the gasbag, the balloon would be burst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Camel zoomed down on Emmelman, who changed course, diving towards ground. The pilot pursuing the flier had unknowingly saved the Attila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Madness, madness,\u0027 Strasser screamed, tottering towards the wall of levers. \u0027We must climb.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula looked sideways, eyes flaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardt, the Graf\u0027s man, levelled a pistol and shot the kapitan in the leg. Strasser screamed and stumbled, falling forwards, hands outreached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We shall keep to our course,\u0027 Hardt said. \u0027We are all brave men, are we not?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobur, mind gone, ordered his crew to hold the course. He turned to the keyboard and wrung chords from the pipes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrasser curled into a ball. Airmen closed around the kapitan, and helped him up. He was fainting on his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmelman hit the ground and exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething big burst in the trees below. Winthrop climbed, looking around. Just now, he was a monster. But it would take a monster to destroy the Bloody Red Baron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough outnumbered, the shape-shifters knocked down more Camels than they sustained casualties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandberg passed. A bat-thing had claws sunk into the tail of his Camel and ripped towards the pilot with tin-opener jaws. The Camel went into a spin, taking the shape-shifter down. Another fire-burst on the ground. One for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no Archie. The offensive had swept past the lines. They were deep into what had been home ground. Winthrop could not think of the big picture. He had prey to find and kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Gentlemen,\u0027 Hardt said, \u0027you have done your Kaiser a service which will never be forgotten.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula was turned away. Robur\u0027s mad music filled the gondola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Our lives will have brought victory.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scatter of bullets smashed across the windows. Glass burst inwards with a rush of wind. Stalhein\u0027s wings shrugged involuntarily. He was ready to take to the air. Hardt saluted the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop sought Richthofen, slipping through the dog-fight in the shadow of the Attila. He swooped upwards and looked down on the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny scrawl of flame clung to the Zeppelin\u0027s gondola. It was whipped to extinction by cold winds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Camel rose to join Winthrop. From the streamers, he knew it was Allard. A shape-shifter pursued the flight commander. Winthrop caught its chest with a burst of fire, and it sank, recovering balance. Wounded, the thing would be an easy target for another pilot. Only one victory counted. Confirmation didn\u0027t matter. Winthrop just had to know he had done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllard flew away from the Attila and turned in a wide circle. Then he swooped back, closing upon the airship as if the length of its gasbag were a landing strip. He fired a Verey pistol over the side. The flare fell on to the skin of the gasbag, burning purple, lighting up Allard\u0027s path. Seeing what the flight commander intended, Winthrop pulled up on the stick, gaining height. Allard\u0027s Camel scraped the silk with its wheels, ran into the spreading flame of the flare, then flipped up and over, prop shredding through the silk skin, wings buckling. A rent appeared in the top of the gasbag and Allard tumbled in. Gas belched out of the ruptured compartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop heard Allard\u0027s engine stall and buzz. There was gunfire inside the gasbag. Flashes showed through the silk as Allard emptied his Lewis guns. Then a spark of purple, as the flight commander, swamped by an atmosphere of flammable gas, fired another flare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attila shuddered as something slammed down on to it. Robur screamed at the violation of his beautiful ship, jamming his hands against the keys. Tortured wind roared through the organ pipes, accompanied by the creaking and cracking of metal struts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardt stood over the observation port, where Reitberg still lay, and kicked down with a heavy heel. The port fell out in pieces, dropping Reitberg like a loose-limbed tumbling bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStalhein was confined by the broken walls of the gondola. He should fly free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula was still turned away from the panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardt saluted, smiled and stepped out of the hole. He fell like a weight. Others of Dracula\u0027s guard followed. Some prayed, most were stone silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrasser, conscious and intent despite the pain, pulled useless levers. Too many connections were broken. The organ pipes groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the big explosions came, discharging a foul smell through the gondola. Then the second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ball of fire burst out of the side of the Attila, ripping through the gasbag as if it were a paper lantern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop felt the hot air rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should look away but could not. The airship kinked in the middle. One compartment turned inside out in a gust of fire. Crumpling tail-planes angled up. The firelight showed a dozen flying shapes desperately trying to burst free of the gravity of the huge, doomed ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother compartment, near the nose, exploded. Winthrop saw Camels and shape-shifters outlined black in the flames that consumed them entirely. He was calm. Richthofen would not be destroyed so easily, so stupidly. The Red Baron would be saved for him. Another compartment blew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the hole in the gondola floor, the forests were as brightly lit as by day. The Attila was a burning red sun. Fires spread around, running along walkways, climbing ropes, chasing airmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the crew had followed Hardt. Stalhein saw them break against treetops five hundred feet below. Some, by a miracle, might survive. He waited for his own last duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrasser, almost calm, stood away from the controls and smoothed his hair, then replaced his cap. He made no move to the hole. He would go down with his ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobur turned away from his keyboard and looked at his disciple. He said \u0027we should have won. If it were not for the insects.\u0027 He did not mean the war between the Entente and Germany, but the war between airships and aeroplanes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula stood. Knowing it was time, Stalhein rose from the floor, struggling with hot air under his wings, and took the Graf from behind, wrapping his legs around the commander. He surged forwards, dragging his burden, and burst through the last of the nose-port.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was ejected from the burning airship. A winged figure, something wrapped in its legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinthrop let the thing pass through his sights without firing. He had more important prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stalked the skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove, as Dracula\u0027s weight pulled Stalhein down, the black canopy of the gasbag dissolved into a sky of fire. The organ, attacked in a final frenzy by the engineer, produced insane music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wingspan grew and Dracula was less heavy. They flew straight, descending towards the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Attila was lost, a string of burning balloons falling from the skies. The gondola crunched into treetops a hundred yards behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStalhein put on speed, outracing fingers of flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog-fight, scattered by the fall of the Attila, regrouped. The last of both sides forgot the possibility of surviving this battle and mixed in for death. He looked for a place to set down. Once duty was discharged, he should join his comrades in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn aeroplane was above him, closing. Though unarmed, he\u0027d have a chance in a skirmish. He could drop Dracula and rip off the pilot\u0027s head. But he would not give up his commander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a glance, he realised he was spared. The aircraft was German, a two-man Junkers J1 spotter. It would give him cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were past the burning forest. A straight road extended ahead. Glassy lakes reflected the fire. Stalhein spread his wings, letting wind slow him rather than speed him on, and settled towards the ground. They hit hard and he lost his grip on the Graf, sprawling in a mess of wings and limbs as he rolled across a field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking he was broken, he turned, trying to get the horizon level. After the even air, the ground was unsteady, rising and falling like the deck of a ship in a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Junkers, still aloft, circled like a protective spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStalhein saw Dracula rise from the field and brush off his uniform. He still did not understand why the Attila had been wasted, why an airship had committed suicide. The Graf walked over to Stalhein and looked down at him. His flat face was inexpressive, but Stalhein recognised the daze. In a lesser man, it might be called shell-shock. In Dracula, such weakness was unthinkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe field was not empty. Men shouted, in English. Shots were fired. Stalhein cringed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up, he saw Dracula was wounded. Blood soaked his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To die,\u0027 he announced, theatrically, \u0027to be really dead ...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadow-men gathered around in a circle. The Junkers uselessly strafed the field, hundreds of feet out of range. Silver caught light.
