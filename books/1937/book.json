At thirty-eight, she\u0027s childless, a recent widow, alone. She owns a successful bookstore on Seattle\u0027s Blossom Street, but despite her accomplishments, there\u0027s a feeling of emptiness. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eOn Valentine\u0027s Day, Anne Marie and several other widows get together to celebrate…hope. They each begin a list of twenty wishes—things they always wanted to do but never did. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAnne Marie\u0027s list includes learning to knit, falling in love again, doing good for someone else. When she volunteers at a local school, an eight-year-old girl named Ellen enters her life. It\u0027s a relationship that becomes far more involving—and far more important—than Anne Marie had ever imagined. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAs Ellen helps Anne Marie complete her list of twenty wishes, they both learn that wishes can come true…but not necessarily in the way you expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/twenty-wishes-blossom-street-5.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/twenty-wishes-blossom-street-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:26 AM"}
