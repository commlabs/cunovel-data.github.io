She sleeps like an angel he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was almost dawn, time to be moving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio leaned over and whispered gently in her ear, \"Sister Lucia...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is time for us to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe yawned and stretched lazily. The blouse she was wearing had become unbuttoned and part of her breast was showing. Rubio hastily looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must guard my thoughts. She is the bride of Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I wonder if I could ask a favor of you.\" He was almost blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - it\u0027s been a long time since I prayed. But I was brought up a Catholic. Would you mind saying a prayer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the last thing Lucia had expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long has it been since I said a prayer? she wondered. The convent did not count. While the others were praying, her mind had been busy with plans to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I don\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it would make us both feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she explain that she did not remember any prayers? \"I - er - \" Yes. There was one she remembered. She had been a little girl kneeling at her bedside and her father had stood beside her, ready to tuck her into bed. Slowly, the words of the Twenty-third Psalm started to come back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name\u0027s sake...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories came flooding back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and her father had owned the world. And he had been so proud of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were born under a lucky star, faccia d\u0027angelo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd hearing that, Lucia had felt lucky and beautiful. Nothing could ever hurt her. Was she not the beautiful daughter of the great Angelo Carmine?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evil ones were the enemies of her father and brothers. And she had made them pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was God when I needed comforting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was speaking more slowly now, her voice a whisper. What had happened, she wondered, to the little girl in the white communion dress? The future had been so golden. Somehow it had all gone wrong. Everything. I\u0027ve lost my father and my brothers and myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the convent she had not thought about God. But now, out here with this simple peasant...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould you mind saying a prayer for us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia went on. \"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio was watching her, moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia nodded, unable to speak. What\u0027s the matter with me? Lucia asked herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready, Sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Rubio Arzano and said, \"Yes. I\u0027m ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later they were on their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were caught in a sudden downpour and took shelter in a deserted cabin. The rain beat against the roof and sides of the cabin like angry fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think the storm will ever let up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio smiled. \"It\u0027s not a real storm, Sister. It\u0027s what we Basques call a sirimiri. It will stop as quickly as it started. The earth is dry right now. It needs this rain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m a farmer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt shows, Lucia thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me for saying this, Sister, but you and I have a lot in common.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia looked over at the bumbling hayseed and thought: That will be the day. \"We do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I truly believe that in many ways being on a farm must be much like being in a convent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe connection eluded her. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Sister, in a convent you think a lot about God and His miracles. Is that not true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a sense a farm is God. One is surrounded by creation. All the things that grow from God\u0027s earth, whether it\u0027s wheat or olives or grapes - everything comes from God, does it not? These are all miracles, and you watch them happen every day, and because you help them grow, you are a part of the miracle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia had to smile at the enthusiasm in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the rain stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can move on now, Sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will be coming to the Duero River soon,\" Rubio said. \"The Penafiel Falls is just ahead of us. We will go on to Aranda de Duero and then Logrono, where we will meet the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll be going to those places, Lucia thought. And good luck to you. I\u0027ll be in Switzerland my friend\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard the sound of the falls half an hour before they reached them. The Penafiel Falls was a beautiful sight cascading down into the swift-moving river. The roar of it was almost deafening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to bathe,\" Lucia said. It seemed years since she had last had a bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio Arzano stared at her. \"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you idiot, in Rome. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful. The river is swollen because of the rain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry.\" She stood there, patiently waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I will go away while you undress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay nearby,\" Lucia said quickly. There were probably wild animals in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lucia started to undress, Rubio hastily walked a few yards away and turned his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go in too far, Sister,\" he called. \"The river is treacherous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia put down the wrapped cross where she could keep an eye on it. The cool morning air felt wonderful on her naked body. When she had stripped completely, she stepped into the water. It was cold and invigorating. She turned and saw that Rubio was steadfastly looking in the other direction, his back turned to her. She smiled to herself. All the other men she had known would be feasting their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped in deeper, avoiding the rocks that were all around, and splashed the water over herself, feeling the rushing river tugging hard at her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few feet away a small tree was being swept downstream. As Lucia turned to watch it, she suddenly lost her balance and slipped, screaming. She fell hard, slamming her head against a boulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio turned and watched in horror as Lucia disappeared downstream in the raging waters. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-23.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
