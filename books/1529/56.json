Here is the protein schematic you ordered. From the virus in the toxic soup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor backed from the screen so all could see the rotating image, spinning like a toy top on the monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt depicted the icosahedron shell of the virus: twenty triangular sections, forming a sphere, like a soccer ball. Except some of the triangles bulged out with alpha proteins, while others were sunken in by beta proteins. Lisa had wanted it all mapped out to better test her hypothesis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa pointed. \"Can you stop the rotation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChenier tapped a button on her mouse and the spinning halted, freezing the image on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stood back up. \"Now, on the other monitor, can you bring up the protein map of the virus recovered from Susan Tunis\u0027s cerebral spinal fluid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, a second soccer ball appeared, spinning. Lisa moved closer, studying it. She manipulated the mouse button herself this time, freezing the image where she wanted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe faced the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh shrugged, using his whole upper body. \"So? It looks the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back. \"Picture the two side by side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenri stood up, eyes widening. \"They\u0027re not the same!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"They\u0027re mirror images of each other. They may superficially look the same, but they are really exact opposites. Geometric isomerism. Two forms of the same geometric shape, just mirrored one upon the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cis and trans,\" Chenier said, using the technical term for the two sides of the same coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa tapped the first screen. \"Here is the trans form, or the bad form of the virus. It infects bacteria and turns them into monsters.\" She waved to the other screen, depicting the virus found inside Susan\u0027s skull. \"Here is the cis form, or the good virus that heals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cis and tram,\" Miller mumbled. \"Good and bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa elaborated her theory. \"As we already know, the trans virus toxified bacteria in order to weaken the blood-brain barrier, thus allowing it to penetrate that virgin territory of the inner skull. It even brought along some company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cyanobacteria,\" Miller said. \"The glowing bacteria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And normally the toxins produced by the bacteria corrupted the brain in such a manner that it triggered catatonic excitement with psychosis. But in Susan\u0027s case, something else happened. The virus, when it hit her brain fluid, somehow altered. Changed from its evil trans form over to its beneficial cis form. And once altered, the new virus swept out and began reversing all the damage done by its evil twin, healing the patient and sending her into a deep recuperative stupor, contrary to the manic excitement phase of the other patients.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if you\u0027re correct,\" Henri said, \"which I believe you are, what was so special about Susan\u0027s biochemistry to trigger this change?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa shrugged. \"I wager over the next days or weeks, we\u0027ll see a handful of other patients make the same transformation. Susan was infected five weeks ago. So it may be too soon to judge. But I think it\u0027s still a very rare event. A random quirk in her genetics. For example, are you familiar with the Eyam phenomenon during the Black Plague?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChenier raised her hand as if in a schoolroom. \"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa nodded. Of course, an infectious disease expert would know the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChenier explained, \"Eyam was a small village in England. Back in the sixteen hundreds, the Black Plague struck the village. But after a year, most of Eyam still lived. Modern genetic studies revealed why. A rare mutation was present in the villagers. In a gene called Delta 32. It was a benign defect that was passed from one family member to another, and in such an isolated township, inbred as they were, a good portion of the town had acquired the mutation. Then the plague struck. And this strange little mutation, just hanging about, saved them. Made them immune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh spoke up. \"Are you suggesting our patient carries the Delta 32 equivalent against the Judas Strain? Some random protein that enzymatically switched the virus in her from trans to cis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe it\u0027s not that random,\" Lisa mumbled. She\u0027d been struggling with this question ever since her discovery of the altered virus. \"Only a very small percentage of our DNA is actually functional. Only three percent, in fact. The other ninety-seven percent is considered genetic junk. It doesn\u0027t code for anything. But some of that junk DNA bears a remarkable resemblance to viral code. The current belief is that such coding might serve a protective role, to help us survive future disease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lisa continued, she pictured the body of Susan\u0027s friend, attacked and eaten. \"Like cannibalism, for example.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer strange statement drew everyone\u0027s eyes from the monitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa elaborated. \"Genetic markers found worldwide show that most humans carry a specific set of genes against diseases that can only be acquired by eating human flesh. These findings suggest that our ancient ancestors might have all been cannibals. Maybe Susan has a similar genetic marker to protect her brain against the attack by the Judas Strain virus. Something left over from our long-lost genetic history. Something buried in our collective past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Intriguing as usual, Dr. Cummings.\" Devesh rocked back and forth on his toes, plainly excited. \"But whether the transformation was random chance or was triggered by some viral genetic marker from our past... it doesn\u0027t truly matter. Now that we know about this new virus, we can use this knowledge to produce a cure!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChenier looked less sure. \"Possibly,\" she stressed. \"It will take more study. Luckily we have a boatload of sick patients upon which to test potential treatment regimens. But first, we\u0027ll need more of that cis virus.\" She glanced significantly over to Devesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No worries,\" he said. \"With Rakao and his men already hunting the island, we\u0027ll soon have Susan Tunis and the others back. But with that matter settled—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh turned to Lisa. \"It\u0027s now time to discuss your punishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, a figure stepped forward, carrying a doctor\u0027s satchel in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer long black hair had been retied into a braid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:14 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk climbed the steep switchback, following the naked rear end of one of the cannibals. Another dozen tribesmen scaled the crooked trail in the rock ahead of him. Behind Monk, more followed, another forty strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cannibal army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain poured out of the dark skies. But at least the winds had mostly died down, snapping with only occasional gusts across the jagged peaks. Monk had purposefully timed this ascent, waiting for the eye of the storm to crest over the island. It had been an agonizing delay, but his patience had opened a small window of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued on. Though the path they climbed was sheltered, cut deep into the rock, the downpour made the rocks slippery, treacherous, requiring crawling at times on hands and knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk glanced behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder and Jessie had his back. Strung out behind them, a line of tribesmen followed, dressed in feathers, shells, bark, bird claws, and bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLots of bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe improvised strike team bore short spears, sapling bows, and sharpened clubs. But half of them also carried rifles and a smattering of old assault weapons—Russian AK-47S, United States Mi6s—along with bandoliers strapped with extra magazines and cartridges. It seemed the cannibals had been trading for more than just two-legged meat with the pirates that shared their cove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom this height, Monk had a wide view of the dark lake. The cruise ship glowed like a sodden wedding cake in the middle. It was the goal of the cannibal strike team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed whatever Rangda, the witch queen, wanted, the mesmerized cannibals would make sure she got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Rangda wanted that cruise ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer wishes and orders were translated by the young Jessie. He spoke Malay, and as it was the official trading language of the pirates, most of the cannibals understood it, too. They were much in awe of the young nurse, that he should understand the language of their queen and was able to pass on Rangda\u0027s desires. She even bestowed a kiss on her interpreter\u0027s cheek, blessing the young nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one dared disobey him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while Jessie had been integral in organizing the assault, the plan here was all Monk\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his back on the cruise ship. With the waters surely watched, they\u0027d never manage an assault by boat. And swimming was certainly not an option. Even from this height, Monk noted the occasional flashes streaking through the lagoon far below. The storm had the denizens stirred up and hunting the shallows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it had left only one choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk climbed higher, all the way to the roof of the world. They had finally reached the giant steel support posts and massive cabling that anchored this section of the island\u0027s net.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk stared out across the net\u0027s underside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain poured from it, soaking through all the camouflaging vegetation woven into the web\u0027s upper side. Someone had to be maintaining that illusion. And Monk guessed it wasn\u0027t just the pirates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProving this, one of the cannibals scurried up the nearest cable, his bare feet flogging his lithe form up the span. He vanished through the netting. A rope ladder cascaded back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers began scaling up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk turned to Jessie. \"You can still go back down, join Susan at the beach. We can pick you both up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie swept rain-soaked hair out of his eyes. \"I\u0027m going. Otherwise, who\u0027s going to translate for you?\" Before Monk could argue, the nurse grabbed the ladder and scurried up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder followed next, clapping Monk on the shoulder as he passed. Once the billionaire had shoved through the net overhead, Monk grabbed the lower rung, staring back at the spread of his dark army. Feathered, armed to the teeth, ready to do the bidding of their queen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-56.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
