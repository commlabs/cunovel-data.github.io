Furthermore, this was a true Fusion Skill between the Darkness and Demonic Attributes. Zhou Weiqing had six-Attributes of his own, and more importantly, he was the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya’s disciple. In that short period of time, he had already accurately assessed this blow from Dreamwake and analysed it thoroughly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe blow that Dreamwake’s Dragon Spear had released was indeed the\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTenebrous Attribute, but it was not as simple as that.

The seemingly solid blue shield of light was actually unable to fully block the piercing of the twelve streaks of blood-coloured light.

After all, although his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set was also extremely powerful, it currently had the limit of being a ten-piece Legendary Set. Just thinking about the power boost he would gain from completing ten pieces of his own Legendary Set, Zhou Weiqing could vaguely guess the sheer terror that would be this eleven-piece Set, and what it granted to both Dreamwake and the\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTenebrous Demon Dragon.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe oceans water parted, almost as if split apart, and in a massive clashing sound, the Terror Sea Dragon rose from the ocean, soaring into the skies.

Furthermore, this was even a fusion of two pieces… that of an eleven-piece Legendary Set! Added on with the power of the\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTenebrous Demon Dragon, one could just imagine the sheer power behind this spear.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe reason why the Terror Sea Dragon was so afraid of this Dragon Spear was because in the past, its father had perished to this very spear. The power of this spear… even a Mid Level Heavenly God Tier powerhouse like itself would not be able to accept so easily.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe terrifying energy reverberations shook throughout the air around them.

Previously, the successful blow they had landed caused its confidence to grow. It had been a long time since it had fought in unison with a companion with the full Tenebrous Demon Dragon Legendary Set. In fact, it had almost forgotten the true power of that Dragon Spear. Even it had not imagined that Dreamwake could wield that Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear to such a degree.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThat scary Dragon Spear pierced forward once more, and the bloodshot eyes of Dreamwake did not seem to hold any emotions as her attention and spirit were fully locked onto the Terror Sea Dragon.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Terror Sea Dragon gave an enraged roar, its body beginning to glow brightly once more. This time, it was not just its body, even the ocean beneath it began to glow. A shocking amount of Water Attribute energies gathered instantly, forming a huge cage of atmospheric power, forcefully enclosing the\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake in it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear pierced out several times in succession, and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon also launched several powerful attacks simultaneously. However, as soon as the attacks touched the icy blue cage, they actually disappeared just as swiftly. Even if it was damaged slightly, the constantly gushing water attribute flowing from below would quickly replenish and repair the damage done.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHaving unleashed this powerful skill, the Terror Sea Dragon clearly showed signs of fatigue, but its eyes were extremely excited.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This is my Domain, so what if your combined powers can match mine?

She lifted the Dragon Spear high above her head, and a ball of blood-coloured light shone from the tip of the spear, forming the semblance of a petal. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe blood-red petal did not destroy this Ocean Cage that the Terror Sea Dragon had summoned.

To be able to fight it to a standstill and retreat fully intact would already be a feat in itself. However, they had come fully prepared for this! The Tenebrous Sealing Formation, this was a ‘gift’ they had prepared specially for this Terror Sea Dragon. It could be said that all of the previous fighting, all the changes and variances, while real, was all bait for the Terror Sea Dragon. The true reason was for it to enter the boundaries of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation. Once that happened, it would truly become the meat on their chopping board, easy pickings for them to slay.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs expected, when the twelve pillars of black light rose into the sky, the Terror Sea Dragon started in surprise. Soon, that surprise turned into alarm, even panic, as its massive body shot forward in a flash. A thousand metres was a distance that could be covered in a mere blink to a powerhouse like it, but alas as soon as it reached the borders of the formation, it smashed savagely into one of the pillars of light and was sent bouncing back.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-249-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-250-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-250-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
