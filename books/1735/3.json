He didn\u0027t speak until he reached the head of the flight, and then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sent him after the selenium?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how long has he been out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five hours now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence! This was a devil of a situation. Here they were, on Mercury exactly twelve hours-and already up to the eyebrows in the worst sort of trouble. Mercury had long been the jinx world of the System, but this was drawing it rather strong - even for a jinx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell said, \"Start at the beginning, and let\u0027s get this straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in the radio room now - with its already subtly antiquated equipment, untouched for the ten years previous to their arrival. Even ten years, technologically speaking, meant so much. Compare Speedy with the type of robot they must have had back in 2005. But then, advances in robotics these days were tremendous. Powell touched a still gleaming metal surface gingerly. The air of disuse that touched everything about the room - and the entire Station - was infinitely depressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan must have felt it. He began: \"I tried to locate him by radio, but it was no go. Radio isn\u0027t any good on the Mercury Sunside - not past two miles, anyway. That\u0027s one of the reasons the First Expedition failed. And we can\u0027t put up the ultrawave equipment for weeks yet -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skip all that. What did you get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I located the unorganized body signal in the short wave. It was no good for anything except his position. I kept track of him that way for two hours and plotted the results on the map.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a yellowed square of parchment in his hip pocket - a relic of the unsuccessful First Expedition - and he slapped it down on the desk with vicious force, spreading it flat with the palm of his hand. Powell, hands clasped across his chest, watched it at long range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan\u0027s pencil pointed nervously. \"The red cross is the selenium pool. You marked it yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one is it?\" interrupted Powell. \"There were three that MacDougal located for us before he left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sent Speedy to the nearest, naturally. Seventeen miles away. But what difference does that make?\" There was tension in his voice. \"There are the penciled dots that mark Speedy\u0027s position.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for the first time Powell\u0027s artificial aplomb was shaken and his hands shot forward for the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious? This is impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There it is,\" growled Donovan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little dots that marked the position formed a rough circle about the red cross of the selenium pool. And Powell\u0027s fingers went to his brown mustache, the unfailing signal of anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan added: \"In the two hours I checked on him, he circled that damned pool four times. It seems likely to me that he\u0027ll keep that up forever. Do you realize the position we\u0027re in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell looked up shortly, and said nothing. Oh, yes, he realized the position they were in. It worked itself out as simply as a syllogism. The photo-cell banks that alone stood between the full power of Mercury\u0027s monstrous sun and themselves were shot to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing that could save them was selenium. The only thing that could get the selenium was Speedy. If Speedy didn\u0027t come back, no selenium. No selenium, no photo-cell banks. No photo-banks - well, death by slow broiling is one of the more unpleasant ways of being done in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan rubbed his red mop of hair savagely and expressed himself with bitterness. \"We\u0027ll be the laughingstock of the System, Greg. How can everything have gone so wrong so soon? The great team of Powell and Donovan is sent out to Mercury to report on the advisability of reopening the Sunside Mining Station with modern techniques and robots and we ruin everything the first day. A purely routine job, too. We\u0027ll never live it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t have to, perhaps,\" replied Powell, quietly. \"If we don\u0027t do something quickly, living anything down - or even just plain living - will be out of the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid! If you feel funny about it, Greg, I don\u0027t. It was criminal, sending us out here with only one robot. And it was your bright idea that we could handle the photo-cell banks ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re being unfair. It was a mutual decision and you know it. All we needed was a kilogram of selenium, a Stillhead Dielectrode Plate and about three hours\u0027 time and there are pools of pure selenium all over Sunside. MacDougal\u0027s spectroreflector spotted three for us in five minutes, didn\u0027t it? What the devil! We couldn\u0027t have waited for next conjunction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what are we going to do? Powell, you\u0027ve got an idea. I know you have, or you wouldn\u0027t be so calm. You\u0027re no more a hero than I am. Go on, spill it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t go after Speedy ourselves, Mike- not on the Sunside. Even the new insosuits aren\u0027t good for more than twenty minutes in direct sunlight. But you know the old saying, \u0027Set a robot to catch a robot\u0027 Look, Mike, maybe things aren\u0027t so bad. We\u0027ve got six robots down in the sublevels, that we may be able to use, if they work. If they work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a glint of sudden hope in Donovan\u0027s eyes. \"You mean six robots from the First Expedition. Are you sure? They may be subrobotic machines. Ten years is a long time as far as robot-types are concerned, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they\u0027re robots. I\u0027ve spent all day with them and I know. They\u0027ve got positronic brains: primitive, of course.\" He placed the map in his pocket. \"Let\u0027s go down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robots were on the lowest sublevel - all six of them surrounded by musty packing cases of uncertain content. They were large, extremely so, and even though they were in a sitting position on the floor, legs straddled out before them, their heads were a good seven feet in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan whistled. \"Look at the size of them, will you? The chests must be ten feet around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because they\u0027re supplied with the old McGuffy gears. I\u0027ve been over the insides - crummiest set you\u0027ve ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you powered them yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. There wasn\u0027t any reason to. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything wrong with them. Even the diaphragm is in reasonable order. They might talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had unscrewed the chest plate of the nearest as he spoke, inserted the two-inch sphere that contained the tiny spark of atomic energy that was a robot\u0027s life. There was difficulty in fitting it, but he managed, and then screwed the plate back on again in laborious fashion. The radio controls of more modern models had not been heard of ten years earlier. And then to the other five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan said uneasily, \"They haven\u0027t moved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No orders to do so,\" replied Powell, succinctly. He went back to the first in the line and struck him on the chest. \"You! Do you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster\u0027s head bent slowly and the eyes fixed themselves on Powell. Then, in a harsh, squawking voice - like that of a medieval phonograph, he grated, \"Yes, Master!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell grinned humorlessly at Donovan. \"Did you get that? Those were the days of the first talking robots when it looked as if the use of robots on Earth would be banned. The makers were fighting that and they built good, healthy slave complexes into the damned machines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t help them,\" muttered Donovan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it didn\u0027t, but they sure tried.\" He turned once more to the robot. \"Get up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot towered upward slowly and Donovan\u0027s head craned and his puckered lips whistled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell said: \"Can you go out upon the surface? In the light?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was consideration while the robot\u0027s slow brain worked. Then, \"Yes, Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Do you know what a mile is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother consideration, and another glow answer. \"Yes, Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will take you up to the surface then, and indicate a direction. You will go about seventeen miles, and somewhere in that general region you will meet- another robot, smaller than yourself. You understand so far?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will find this robot and order him to return. If he does not wish to, you are to bring him back by force.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan clutched at Powell\u0027s sleeve. \"Why not send him for the selenium direct?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I want Speedy back, nitwit. I want to find out what\u0027s wrong with him.\" And to the robot, \"All right, you, follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot remained motionless and his voice rumbled: \"Pardon, Master, but I cannot. You must mount first.\" His clumsy arms had come together with a thwack, blunt fingers interlacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell stared and then pinched at his mustache. \"Uh... oh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan\u0027s eyes bulged. \"We\u0027ve got to ride him? Like a horse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess that\u0027s the idea. I don\u0027t know why, though. I can\u0027t see- Yes, I do. I told you they were playing up robot-safety in those days. Evidently, they were going to sell the notion of safety by not allowing them to move about, without a mahout on their shoulders all the time. What do we do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been thinking,\" muttered Donovan. \"We can\u0027t go out on the surface, with a robot or without. Oh, for the love of Pete\" - and he snapped his fingers twice. He grew excited. \"Give me that map you\u0027ve got. I haven\u0027t studied it for two hours for nothing. This is a Mining Station. What\u0027s wrong with using the tunnels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mining Station was a black circle on the map, and the light dotted lines that were tunnels stretched out about it in spiderweb fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan studied the list of symbols at the bottom of the map. \"Look,\" he said, \"the small black dots are openings to the surface, and here\u0027s one maybe three miles away from the selenium pool. There\u0027s a number here - you\u0027d think they\u0027d write larger - 13a. If the robots know their way around here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell shot the question and received the dull \"Yes, Master,\" in reply. \"Get your insosuit,\" he said with satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time either had worn the insosuits - which marked one time more than either had expected to upon their arrival the day before - and they tested their limb movements uncomfortably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe insosuit was far bulkier and far uglier than the regulation spacesuit; but withal considerably lighter, due to the fact that they were entirely nonmetallic in composition. Composed of heat-resistant plastic and chemically treated cork layers, and equipped with a desiccating unit to keep the air bone-dry, the insosuits could withstand the full glare of Mercury\u0027s sun for twenty minutes. Five to ten minutes more, as well, without actually killing the occupant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still the robot\u0027s hands formed the stirrup, nor did he betray the slightest atom of surprise at the grotesque figure into which Powell had been converted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell\u0027s radio-harshened voice boomed out: \"Are you ready to take us to Exit 13a?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood, thought Powell; they might lack radio control but at least they were fitted for radio reception. \"Mount one or the other, Mike,\" he said to Donovan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed a foot in the improvised stirrup and swung upward. He found the seat comfortable; there was the humped back of the robot, evidently shaped for the purpose, a shallow groove along each shoulder for the thighs and two elongated \"ears\" whose purpose now seemed obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell seized the ears and twisted the head. His mount turned ponderously. \"Lead on, Macduff.\" But he did not feel at all lighthearted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gigantic robots moved slowly, with mechanical precision, through the doorway that cleared their heads by a scant foot, so that the two men had to duck hurriedly, along a narrow corridor in which their unhurried footsteps boomed monotonously and into the, air lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long, airless tunnel that stretched to a pinpoint before them brought home forcefully to Powell the exact magnitude of the task accomplished by the First Expedition, with their crude robots and their start-from-scratch necessities. They might have been a failure, but their failure was a good deal better than the usual run of the System\u0027s successes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robots plodded onward with a pace that never varied and with footsteps that never lengthened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell said: \"Notice that these tunnels are blazing with lights and that the temperature is Earth-normal. It\u0027s probably been like this all the ten years that this place has remained empty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheap energy; cheapest in the System. Sunpower, you know, and on Mercury\u0027s Sunside, sunpower is something. That\u0027s why the Station was built in the sunlight rather than in the shadow of a mountain. It\u0027s really a huge energy converter. The heat is turned into electricity, light, mechanical work and what have you; so that energy is supplied and the Station is cooled in a simultaneous process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" said Donovan. \"This is all very educational, but would you mind changing the subject? It so happens that this conversion of energy that you talk about is carried on by the photo-cell banks mainly - and that is a tender subject with me at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell grunted vaguely, and when Donovan broke the resulting silence, it was to change the subject completely. \"Listen, Greg. What the devil\u0027s wrong with Speedy, anyway? I can\u0027t understand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not easy to shrug shoulders in an insosuit, but Powell tried it. \"I don\u0027t know, Mike. You know he\u0027s perfectly adapted to a Mercurian environment. Heat doesn\u0027t mean anything to him and he\u0027s built for the light gravity and the broken ground. He\u0027s foolproof-or, at least, he should be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence fell. This time, silence that lasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master,\" said the robot, \"we are here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh?\" Powell snapped out of a semidrowse. \"Well, get us out of here - out to the surface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found themselves in a tiny substation, empty, airless, ruined. Donovan had inspected a jagged hole in the upper reaches of one of the walls by the light of his pocket flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meteorite, do you suppose?\" he had asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell shrugged. \"To hell with that. It doesn\u0027t matter. Let\u0027s get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA towering cliff of a black, basaltic rock cut off the sunlight, and the deep night shadow of an airless world surrounded them. Before them, the shadow reached out and ended in knife-edge abruptness into an all-but-unbearable blaze of white light, that glittered from myriad crystals along a rocky ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Space!\" gasped Donovan. \"It looks like snow.\" And it did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell\u0027s eyes swept the jagged glitter of Mercury to the horizon and winced at the gorgeous brilliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This must be an unusual area,\" he said. \"The general albedo of Mercury is low and most of the soil is gray pumice. Something like the Moon, you know. Beautiful, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was thankful for the light filters in their visiplates. Beautiful or not, a look at the sunlight through straight glass would have blinded them inside of half a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan was looking at the spring thermometer on his wrist. \"Holy smokes, the temperature is eighty centigrade!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell checked his own and said: \"Um-m-m. A little high. Atmosphere, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On Mercury? Are you nuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mercury isn\u0027t really airless,\" explained Powell, in absentminded fashion. He was adjusting the binocular attachments to his visiplate, and the bloated fingers of the insosuit were clumsy at it. \"There is a thin exhalation that clings to its surface - vapors of the more volatile elements and compounds that are heavy enough for Mercurian gravity to retain. You know: selenium, iodine, mercury, gallium, potassium, bismuth, volatile oxides. The vapors sweep into the shadows and condense, giving up heat. It\u0027s a sort of gigantic still. In fact, if you use your flash, you\u0027ll probably find that the side of the cliff is covered with, say, hoar-sulphur, or maybe quicksilver dew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter, though. Our suits can stand a measly eighty indefinitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell had adjusted the binocular attachments, so that he seemed as eye-stalked as a snail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan watched tensely. \"See anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other did not answer immediately, and when he did, his voice was anxious and thoughtful. \"There\u0027s a dark spot on the horizon that might be the selenium pool. It\u0027s in the right place. But I don\u0027t see Speedy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell clambered upward in an instinctive striving for better view, till he was standing in unsteady fashion upon his robot\u0027s shoulders. Legs straddled wide, eyes straining, he said: \"I think... I think- Yes, it\u0027s definitely he. He\u0027s coming this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan followed the pointing flnger. He had no binoculars, but there was a tiny moving dot, black against the blazing brilliance of the crystalline ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see him,\" he yelled. \"Let\u0027s get going!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell had hopped down into a sitting position on the robot again, and his suited hand slapped against the Gargantuan\u0027s barrel chest. \"Get going!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giddy-ap,\" yelled Donovan, and thumped his heels, spur fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robots started off, the regular thudding of their footsteps silent in the airlessness, for the nonmetallic fabric of the insosuits did not transmit sound. There was only a rhythmic vibration just below the border of actual hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faster,\" yelled Donovan. The rhythm did not change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No use,\" cried Powell, in reply. \"These junk heaps are only geared to one speed. Do you think they\u0027re equipped with selective flexors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had burst through the shadow, and the sunlight came down in a white-hot wash and poured liquidly about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan ducked involuntarily. \"Wow! Is it imagination or do I feel heat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll feel more presently,\" was the grim reply. \"Keep your eye on Speedy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobot SPD 13 was near enough to be seen in detail now. His graceful, streamlined body threw out blazing highlights as he loped with easy speed across the broken ground. His name was derived from his serial initials, of course, but it was apt, nevertheless, for the SPD models were among the fastest robots turned out by the United States Robot amp; Mechanical Men Corp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Speedy,\" howled Donovan, and waved a frantic hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speedy!\" shouted Powell. \"Come here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distance between the men and the errant robot was being cut down momentarily - more by the efforts of Speedy than the slow plodding of the fifty-year-old antique mounts of Donovan and Powell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were close enough now to notice that Speedy\u0027s gait included a peculiar rolling stagger, a noticeable side-to-side lurch- and then, as Powell waved his hand again and sent maximum juice into his compact head-set radio sender, in preparation for another shout, Speedy looked up and saw them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeedy hopped to a halt and remained standing for a moment with just a tiny, unsteady weave, as though he were swaying in a light wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell yelled: \"All right, Speedy. Come here, boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhereupon Speedy\u0027s robot voice sounded in Powell\u0027s ear. phones for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt said: \"Hot dog, let\u0027s play games. You catch me and I catch you; no love can cut our knife in two. For I\u0027m Little Buttercup, sweet Little Buttercup. Whoops!\" Turning on his heel, he sped off in the direction from which he had come, with a speed and fury that kicked up gouts of baked dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his last words as he receded into the distance were, \"There grew a little flower \u0027neath a great oak tree,\" followed by a curious metallic clicking that might have been a robotic equivalent of a hiccup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan said weakly: \"Where did he pick up the Gilbert and Sullivan? Say, Greg, he... he\u0027s drunk or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you hadn\u0027t told me,\" was the bitter response, \"I\u0027d never realize it. Let\u0027s get back to the cliff. I\u0027m roasting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Powell who broke the desperate silence. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"Speedy isn\u0027t drunk - not in the human sense - because he\u0027s a robot, and robots don\u0027t get drunk. However, there\u0027s something wrong with him which is the robotic equivalent of drunkenness\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To me, he\u0027s drunk,\" stated Donovan, emphatically, \"and all I know is that he thinks we\u0027re playing games. And we\u0027re not. It\u0027s a matter of life and very gruesome death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Don\u0027t hurry me. A robot\u0027s only a robot. Once we find out what\u0027s wrong with him, we can fix it and go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once,\" said Donovan, sourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell ignored him. \"Speedy is perfectly adapted to normal Mercurian environment. But this region\" -and his arm swept wide- \"is definitely abnormal. There\u0027s our clue. Now where do these crystals come from? They might have formed from a slowly cooling liquid; but where would you get liquid so hot that it would cool in Mercury\u0027s sun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Volcanic action,\" suggested Donovan, instantly, and Powell\u0027s body tensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of the mouths of sucklings,\" he said in a small, strange voice and remained very still for five minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, he said, \"Listen, Mike, what did you say to Speedy when you sent him after the selenium?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan was taken aback. \"Well damn it- I don\u0027t know. I just told him to get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know. But how? Try to remember the exact words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said... uh... I said: \u0027Speedy, we need some selenium. You can get it such-and-such a place. Go get it\u0027 That\u0027s all. What more did you want me to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t put any urgency into the order, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for? It was pure routine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell sighed. \"Well, it can\u0027t be helped now - but we\u0027re in a fine fix.\" He had dismounted from his robot, and was sitting, back against the cliff. Donovan joined him and they linked arms: In the distance the burning sunlight seemed to wait cat-and-mouse for them, and just next them, the two giant robots were invisible but for the dull red of their photoelectric eyes that stared down at them, unblinking, unwavering and unconcerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnconcerned! As was all this poisonous Mercury, as large in jinx as it was small in size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell\u0027s radio voice was tense in Donovan\u0027s ear: \"Now, look, let\u0027s start with the three fundamental Rules of Robotics - the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot\u0027s positronic brain.\" In the darkness, his gloved fingers ticked off each point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have: One, a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two,\" continued Powell, \"a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right! Now where are we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly at the explanation. The conflict between the various rules is ironed out by the different positronic potentials in the brain. We\u0027ll say that a robot is walking into danger and knows it. The automatic potential that Rule 3 sets up turns him back. But suppose you order him to walk into that danger. In that case, Rule 2 sets up a counterpotential higher than the previous one and the robot follows orders at the risk of existence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I know that. What about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s take Speedy\u0027s case. Speedy is one of the latest models, extremely specialized, and as expensive as a battleship. It\u0027s not a thing to be lightly destroyed\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Rule 3 has been strengthened - that was specifically mentioned, by the way, in the advance notices on the SPD models - so that his allergy to danger is unusually high. At the same time, when you sent him out after the selenium, you gave him his order casually and without special emphasis, so that the Rule 2 potential set-up was rather weak. Now, hold on; I\u0027m just stating facts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, go ahead. I think I get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see how it works, don\u0027t you? There\u0027s some sort of danger centering at the selenium pool. It increases as he approaches, and at a certain distance from it the Rule 3 potential, unusually high to start with, exactly balances the Rule 2 potential, unusually low to start with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan rose to his feet in excitement. \" And it strikes an equilibrium. I see. Rule 3 drives him back and Rule 2 drives him forward-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he follows a circle around the selenium pool, staying on the locus of all points of potential equilibrium. And unless we do something about it, he\u0027ll stay on that circle forever, giving us the good old runaround.\" Then, more thoughtfully: \"And that, by the way, is what makes him drunk. At potential equilibrium, half the positronic paths of his brain are out of kilter. I\u0027m not a robot specialist, but that seems obvious. Probably he\u0027s lost control of just those parts of his voluntary mechanism that a human drunk has. Ve-e-ery pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what\u0027s the danger? If we knew what he was running from-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You suggested it. Volcanic action. Somewhere right above the selenium pool is a seepage of gas from the bowels of Mercury. Sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide - and carbon monoxide. Lots of it and at this temperature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan gulped audibly. \"Carbon monoxide plus iron gives the volatile iron carbonyl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a robot,\" added Powell, \"is essentially iron.\" Then, grimly: \"There\u0027s nothing like deduction. We\u0027ve determined everything about our problem but the solution. We can\u0027t get the selenium ourselves. It\u0027s still too far. We can\u0027t send these robot horses, because they can\u0027t go themselves, and they can\u0027t carry us fast enough to keep us from crisping. And we can\u0027t catch Speedy, because the dope thinks we\u0027re playing games, and he can run sixty miles to our four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If one of us goes,\" began Donovan, tentatively, \"and comes back cooked, there\u0027ll still be the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" came the sarcastic reply, \"it would be a most tender sacrifice - except that a person would be in no condition to give orders before he ever reached the pool, and I don\u0027t think the robots would ever turn back to the cliff without orders. Figure it out! We\u0027re two or three miles from the pool - call it two - the robot travels at four miles an hour; and we can last twenty minutes in our suits. It isn\u0027t only the heat, remember. Solar radiation out here in the ultraviolet and below is poison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um-m-m,\" said Donovan, \"ten minutes short.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As good as an eternity. And another thing. In order for Rule 3 potential to have stopped Speedy where it did, there must be an appreciable amount of carbon monoxide in the metal-vapor atmosphere - and there must be an appreciable corrosive action therefore. He\u0027s been out hours now - and how do we know when a knee joint, for instance, won\u0027t be thrown out of kilter and keel him over. It\u0027s not only a question of thinking - we\u0027ve got to think fast!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep, dark, dank, dismal silence!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan broke it, voice trembling in an effort to keep itself emotionless. He said: \"As long as we can\u0027t increase Rule 2 potential by giving further orders, how about working the other way? If we increase the danger, we increase Rule 3 potential and drive him backward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell\u0027s visiplate had turned toward him in a silent question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see,\" came the cautious explanation, \"all we need to do to drive him out of his rut is to increase the concentration of carbon monoxide in his vicinity. Well, back at the Station there\u0027s a complete analytical laboratory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally,\" assented Powell. \"It\u0027s a Mining Station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. There must be pounds of oxalic acid for calcium precipitations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy space! Mike, you\u0027re a genius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So-so,\" admitted Donovan, modestly. \"It\u0027s just a case of remembering that oxalic acid on heating decomposes into carbon dioxide, water, and good old carbon monoxide. College chem, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell was on his feet and had attracted the attention of one of the monster robots by the simple expedient of pounding the machine\u0027s thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he shouted, \"can you throw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\" Powell damned the robot\u0027s molasses-slow brain. He scrabbled up a jagged brick-size rock. \"take this,\" he said, \"and hit the patch of bluish crystals just across the crooked fissure. You see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan pulled at his shoulder. \"Too far, Greg. It\u0027s almost half a mile off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet,\" replied Powell. \"It\u0027s a case of Mercurian gravity and a steel throwing arm. Watch, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot\u0027s eyes were measuring the distance with machinely accurate stereoscopy. His arm adjusted itself to the weight of the missile and drew back. In the darkness, the robot\u0027s motions went unseen, but there was a sudden thumping sound as he shifted his weight, and seconds later the rock flew blackly into the sunlight. There was no air resistance to slow it down, nor wind to turn it aside - and when it hit the ground it threw up crystals precisely in the center of the \"blue patch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell yelled happily and shouted, \"Let\u0027s go back after the oxalic acid, Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as they plunged into the ruined substation on the way back to the tunnels, Donovan said grimly: \"Speedy\u0027s been hanging about on this side of the selenium pool, ever since we chased after him. Did you see him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess he wants to play games. Well, we\u0027ll play him games!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were back hours later, with three-liter jars of the white chemical and a pair of long faces. The photo-cell banks were deteriorating more rapidly than had seemed likely. The two steered their robots into the sunlight and toward the waiting Speedy in silence and with grim purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeedy galloped slowly toward them. \"Here we are again. Whee! I\u0027ve made a little list, the piano organist; all people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll puff something in your face,\" muttered Donovan. \"He\u0027s limping, Greg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed that,\" came the low, worried response. \"The monoxide\u0027ll get him yet, if we don\u0027t hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were approaching cautiously now, almost sidling, to refrain from setting off the thoroughly irrational robot. Powell was too far off to tell, of course, but even already he could have sworn the crack-brained Speedy was setting himself for a spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her go,\" he gasped. \"Count three! One- two-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo steel arms drew back and snapped forward simultaneously and two glass jars whirled forward in towering parallel arcs, gleaming like diamonds in the impossible sun. And in a pair of soundless puffs, they hit the ground behind Speedy in crashes that sent the oxalic acid flying like dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the full heat of Mercury\u0027s sun, Powell knew it was fizzing like soda water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeedy turned to stare, then backed away from it slowly - and as slowly gathered speed. In fifteen seconds, he was leaping directly toward the two humans in an unsteady canter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell did not get Speedy\u0027s words just then, though he heard something that resembled, \"Lover\u0027s professions when uttered in Hessians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away. \"Back to the cliff, Mike. He\u0027s out of the rut and he\u0027ll be taking orders now. I\u0027m getting hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey jogged toward the shadow at the slow monotonous pace of their mounts, and it was not until they had entered it and felt the sudden coolness settle softly about them that Donovan looked back. \"Greg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell looked and almost shrieked. Speedy was moving slowly now -so slowly- and in the wrong direction. He was drifting; drifting back into his rut; and he was picking up speed. He looked dreadfully close, and dreadfully unreachable, in the binoculars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan shouted wildly, \"After him!\" and thumped his robot into its pace, but Powell called him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t catch him, Mike - it\u0027s no use.\" He fidgeted on his robot\u0027s shoulders and clenched his fist in tight impotence. \"Why the devil do I see these things five seconds after it\u0027s all over? Mike, we\u0027ve wasted hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need more oxalic acid,\" declared Donovan, stolidly. \"The concentration wasn\u0027t high enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven tons of it wouldn\u0027t have been enough - and we haven\u0027t the hours to spare to get it, even if it were, with the monoxide chewing him away. Don\u0027t you see what it is, Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Donovan said flatly, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were only establishing new equilibriums. When we create new monoxide and increase Rule 3 potential, he moves backward till he\u0027s in balance again - and when the monoxide drifted away, he moved forward, and again there was balance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell\u0027s voice sounded thoroughly wretched. \"It\u0027s the same old runaround. We can push at Rule 2 and pull at Rule 3 and we can\u0027t get anywhere - we can only change the position of balance. We\u0027ve got to get outside both rules.\" And then he pushed his robot closer to Donovan\u0027s so that they were sitting face to face, dim shadows in the darkness, and he whispered, \"Mike!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it the finish?\"-dully. \"I suppose we go back to the Station, wait for the banks to fold, shake hands, take cyanide, and go out like gentlemen.\" He laughed shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike,\" repeated Powell earnestly, \"we\u0027ve got to get Speedy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike,\" once more, and Powell hesitated before continuing. \"There\u0027s always Rule 1. I thought of it -earlier- but it\u0027s desperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan looked up and his voice livened. \"We\u0027re desperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. According to Rule 1, a robot can\u0027t see a human come to harm because of his own inaction. Two and 3 can\u0027t stand against it. They can\u0027t, Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even when the robot is half cra- Well, he\u0027s drunk. You know he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the chances you take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut it. What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going out there now and see what Rule 1 will do. If it won\u0027t break the balance, then what the devil - it\u0027s either now or three-four days from now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on, Greg. There are human rules of behavior, too. You don\u0027t go out there just like that. Figure out a lottery, and give me my chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. First to get the cube of fourteen goes.\" And almost immediately, \"Twenty-seven forty-four!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonovan felt his robot stagger at a sudden push by Powell\u0027s mount and then Powell was off into the sunlight. Donovan opened his mouth to shout, and then clicked it shut. Of course, the damn fool had worked out the cube of fourteen in advance, and on purpose. Just like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was hotter than ever and Powell felt a maddening itch in the small of his back. Imagination, probably, or perhaps hard radiation beginning to tell even through the insosuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeedy was watching him, without a word of Gilbert and Sullivan gibberish as greeting. Thank God for that! But he daren\u0027t get too close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was three hundred yards away when Speedy began backing, a step at a time, cautiously - and Powell stopped. He jumped from his robot\u0027s shoulders and landed on the crystalline ground with a light thump and a flying of jagged fragments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe proceeded on foot, the ground gritty and slippery to his steps, the low gravity causing him difficulty. The soles of his feet tickled with warmth. He cast one glance over his shoulder at the blackness of the cliff\u0027s shadow and realized that he had come too far to return - either by himself or by the help of his antique robot. It was Speedy or nothing now, and the knowledge of that constricted his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar enough! He stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speedy,\" he called. \"Speedy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sleek, modern robot ahead of him hesitated and halted his backward steps, then resumed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell tried to put a note of pleading into his voice, and found it didn\u0027t take much acting. \"Speedy, I\u0027ve got to get back to the shadow or the sun\u0027ll get me. It\u0027s life or death, Speedy. I need you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeedy took one step forward and stopped. He spoke, but at the sound Powell groaned, for it was, \"When you\u0027re lying awake with a dismal headache and repose is tabooed-\" It trailed off there, and Powell took time out for some reason to murmur, \"Iolanthe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was roasting hot! He caught a movement out of the corner of his eye, and whirled dizzily; then stared in utter astonishment, for the monstrous robot on which he had ridden was moving - moving toward him, and without a rider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was talking: \"Pardon, Master. I must not move without a Master upon me, but you are in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Rule 1 potential above everything. But he didn\u0027t want that clumsy antique; he wanted Speedy. He walked away and motioned frantically: \"I order you to stay away. I order you to stop!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quite useless. You could not beat Rule 1 potential. The robot said stupidly, \"You are in danger, Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowell looked about him desperately. He couldn\u0027t see clearly. His brain was in a heated whirl; his breath scorched when he breathed, and the ground all about him was a shimmering haze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called a last time, desperately: \"Speedy! I\u0027m dying, damn you! Where are you? Speedy, I need you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still stumbling backward in a blind effort to get away from the giant robot he didn\u0027t want, when he felt steel fingers on his arms, and a worried, apologetic voice of metallic timbre in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy smokes, boss; what are you doing here? And what am I doing- I\u0027m so confused-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" murmured Powell, weakly. \"Get me to the shadow of the cliff - and hurry!\" There was one last feeling of being lifted into the air and a sensation of rapid motion and burning heat, and he passed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe woke with Donovan bending over him and smiling anxiously. \"How are you, Greg?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine!\" came the response. \"Where\u0027s Speedy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here. I sent him out to one of the other selenium pools - with orders to get that selenium at all cost this time. He got it back in forty-two minutes and three seconds. I timed him. He still hasn\u0027t finished apologizing for the runaround he gave us. He\u0027s scared to come near you for fear of what you\u0027ll say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drag him over,\" ordered Powell. \"It wasn\u0027t his fault.\" He held out a hand and gripped Speedy\u0027s metal paw. \"It\u0027s O.K., Speedy.\" Then, to Donovan, \"You know, Mike, I was just thinking-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" -he rubbed his face - the air was so delightfully cool, \"you know that when we get things set up here and Speedy put through his Field Tests, they\u0027re going to send us to the Space Stations next-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! At least that\u0027s what old lady Calvin told me just before we left, and I didn\u0027t say anything about it, because I was going to fight the whole idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fight it?\" cried Donovan. \"But --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. It\u0027s all right with me now. Two hundred seventy-three degrees Centigrade below zero. Won\u0027t it be a pleasure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Space Station,\" said Donovan, \"here I come.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-robot-robot-0-1/page-3.html","bookId":1735,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:06 AM"}
