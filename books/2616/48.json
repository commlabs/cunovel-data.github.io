Amaliya\u0027s phone and car keys were right where he had left them the night before. His Master was a complete idiot and Roberto was disgusted. Sliding off his jacket, he slung it over a chair and went into the kitchen to make himself some coffee. The sun was low over the horizon and the loft was awash in morning light. It was refreshing to his senses after sulking around the Magnolia Cafe all night. He had tried to amuse himself with a book, but had ended up sipping endless cups of coffee and contemplating leaving Cian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, if he did that, he would begin to age again and eventually die. He was not ready to do that. His relationship with Cian was always a bit odd. They had come together out of necessity. Cian needed shelter; Roberto wanted to live forever. For years they had enjoyed the wild life in Mexico, living rich and fine among the vampires there. They had what Roberto considered adventures until the modern age gripped hold of the world and drove it into the boring reality it was now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCian was happy to stay secure in Austin and build up his mini-empire. Roberto had hoped that one day they would strike out again to new territory, but he could not be certain now. Cian\u0027s obsession with being normal and human had dissipated now that Amaliya was on the scene. That was quite a relief, but it was clear that he was changing into someone Roberto did not know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCian was not reverting to the man he had been before. Roberto had found Cian beaten down, nearly destroyed by the vampire hunters. A man who was broken and without a home. Roberto felt he had helped cultivate the former slave into an educated and sophisticated man. But now Cian was changing and this time Roberto was not certain that he could influence his Master, nor keep his elevated position in his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya had changed everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubbing his brow, he felt the need for more coffee. He rarely slept, but he was tired now. But he refused to sleep until he sorted out his thoughts and devised a plan of action. Obviously his plan from the day before had failed miserably. He had not been able to be rid of the interloper and now Cian was being an absolute fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poured the coffee slowly into a cup and frowned as he stared into the dark liquid reflecting the morning light. He should have convinced Cian to kill Amaliya the very first night he brought her to the apartment. Now he was uncertain of what to do. He was tied to Cian unless he found another alternative to secure his immortality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would miss his time with Cian. For years he had loved Cian as a brother, but then again, he had killed his real brother long ago. Love and hate were not so different when passion was involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang and he arched an eyebrow. It rang again a few seconds later and he gently laid the cup on the counter. He slowly walked down the hallway, curious as to who could possibly be at the door. Neither he nor Cian was particularly social and Samantha had her own key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeering through the peephole, he saw one of the pretty blonds that lived in the building waiting in the hallway. Roberto had spoken to her on occasion. He had figured out swiftly that she was more interested in his elusive master than in him. It had disappointed him for he thought her breasts were wonderful and in need of caressing. He was very surprised to see her lingering outside their door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemoving the chain and unlocking it, he slowly opened it. “Heather? Can I help you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked a little unsure of herself for a second, then raised the gun and shot him in the chest. “No, I have it covered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two dead homeless men The Summoner had sent to help her, stepped out from around the corner, and moved to gather up Roberto\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in Heather\u0027s muddled mind, she was screaming, but the rest of her thoughts were consumed with The Summoner and his commands. He was powerful and she must obey his power. She could feel him, in her apartment, waiting for her. He didn\u0027t have to sleep anymore. He had said he was beyond that now and his legions walked both the day and the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t dead yet. She had wondered at first if maybe she was dead. But her heart was still beating unlike the two huge men busy wrapping Roberto up into the hallway rug. Those two men were truly dead. She rubbed the gun against her leg nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she was doing was wrong, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t sure anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Summoner called out to her through the darkness of her mind and she moved toward the elevator. Looking down at the gun, the thought of shooting him flickered through her mind. But he needed her. He had told her so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to obey him. Serve him. Love him. Until he killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio was intent on sleeping in. It was Saturday morning and his wife had taken the kids to visit her relatives. Because he had to work a double shift the night before, he had been given a reprieve from his glowering mother-in-law. She absolutely hated him because of his Mexican blood and he absolutely hated her because she was a bitch. He had woken up long enough to kiss his kids and wife goodbye, then had collapsed onto the sofa to sleep the morning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he dozed, he was dimly aware of the cat lying on his back, kneading his shoulder as her tiny claws lightly scratched him. The sound of the neighborhood kids playing outside tried to pull him from his light slumber and he grumbled. He\u0027d give anything for there to be Saturday morning cartoons again so the kids would be inside being little TV zombies. Then at least he could sleep deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud banging on his front door made him jump. The cat yowled and drew blood as she scampered off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks a lot, Tinkerbell,” he muttered, and wondered why he had let the kids name the cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrumbling, he sat up and stared at the door. There was no one visible through the glass panes set in the door in the shape of a fan. Deciding he must have dreamed the banging, he lay back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door shook as the banging started again. This time his grandmother\u0027s voice joined the harsh knocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sergio! Sergio! Open the door!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking, he sat up again and rubbed his eyes. “Grandmama?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open the door!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling his undershirt down over his stomach, he staggered to the door, unlocked it, and swung it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tiny grandmother stood on the stoop clutching her big tote bag with the flag of Texas on it. She was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt with a picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe on it and her tiny feet were tucked into bright pink sneakers. “Get dressed. We\u0027re going to Austin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” He rubbed his eyes again and tried to figure out why his grandmother was bugging him on a Saturday morning at the ungodly hour of nine AM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amaliya hasn\u0027t answered her phone in two nights and something is wrong. Get your gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandmama, I want to sleep in,” he muttered, and was shoved aside as she barged in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No time to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, why do I need a gun?” He shut the door and stared at her in confusion. Sergio\u0027s muddled brain couldn\u0027t take all this in quite yet and he sat down in his recliner, blinking tiredly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grandmother sat down on the sofa and the cat instantly appeared on her lap. “I gave Amaliya that phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And she called me and told me about this Cian.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Key Inn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. It\u0027s a name. Cian. Anyway, she said he was going to help her. But she hasn\u0027t answered her phone in two days and now I am worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, Grandmama, technically, she is already dead,” Sergio said timidly. The events of the other night still haunted him and he tried hard not to think of it too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t care. She\u0027s alive in a new way,” his grandmother answered. Her lips set into a firm little line as she lifted her chin. “And we\u0027re going to go find her and save her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandmama, I don\u0027t mean to upset you, but Amaliya is not the most reliable person in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe not. But she\u0027s our blood. And she is my granddaughter and your cousin and we protect family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio looked at her through bleary eyes trying to figure this whole thing out when something occurred to him. “Hey, how did you get here? She took your car!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My boyfriend brought me,” his grandmother answered primly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a boyfriend!” Sergio suddenly felt very awake. “You have a boyfriend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I do.” His grandmother rubbed the cat under her chin vigorously and made soft noises to the furry creature as she obviously ignored Sergio\u0027s reddening face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio waited a beat, then said explosively, “Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Juan Carlos.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The old guy who rides around on the moped. He brought you over on the moped?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grandmother rolled her eyes and pointed at him with a gnarled finger. “Get dressed. Get your guns. We\u0027re going to Austin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio leaped to his feet. Not to run for his gun, but to look out the window. “Where is he?” He had a strong desire to go outside and shake the old guy and threaten him something good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He left. I told him you would take me to Austin. But we need to go to my house. I have my stuff packed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio blinked and turned to look at his sweet, tiny grandmother. He knew she was feisty, but he was realizing she had this whole other life he was not aware of. “You have a boyfriend and didn\u0027t tell me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-48.html","bookId":2616,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM"}
