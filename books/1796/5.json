It was the kind of fury that had its roots in a very primitive fear, a fear that had been nibbling at him for the past couple of weeks, a fear he had refused to acknowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the fear that Verity might be growing dissatisfied with her live-in lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vacation!\" Jonas jackknifed upright in bed. \"What the hell do you mean?\" Verity lay back on the pillows, staring thoughtfully up into the darkness. Jonas\u0027s violent reaction had startled her. \"I think I need one. You\u0027ve told me yourself that I\u0027m working too hard,\" she pointed out reasonably. \"Well, now is a perfect time to slow down for a while. It\u0027s the middle of winter. Business is slow. There\u0027s just a handful of tourists and a few people from the spa at the cafe in the evenings. Nobody\u0027s going to mind if I close up for a week. Hawaii would be perfect this time of year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think nobody\u0027s going to mind if you take off by yourself for a week of sun and fun in the islands?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas was outraged. He loomed over Verity, caging her face between his hands. \"I\u0027ve got news for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll mind. A lot. If you think I\u0027m going to let you go off by yourself to wiggle around in a bikini in front of a flock of beachboys for a week, you can think again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity began to feel annoyed. \"It\u0027s okay for you to fly off to Mexico for a week of sun and fun, but I don\u0027t have the same right, is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ almighty.\" Jonas\u0027s voice was raw with exasperation. \"You know damn well I\u0027m not going to Mexico for fun and games. Don\u0027t you dare try to pretend it\u0027s a vacation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could fly down with you. Maybe wait for you and Dad in Acapulco,\" she suggested, considering the possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance. I don\u0027t want you anywhere near Mexico. How do you expect me to keep my mind on business if I\u0027m wondering what you\u0027re up to in Acapulco? Forget it, Verity. You\u0027re going to stay right here, where I don\u0027t have to worry about you. If you\u0027re serious about a vacation, we\u0027ll take one when I get back. You can spend this week thinking about a place for us to go. Make the plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I make plans for a trip when I don\u0027t know when you and Dad will return?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll probably be back within a week. How long can it take to arrange a ransom payoff? Ten days at the outside. Make the plans for two weeks from today. That should be safe enough. Or make them for next month. Hell, use some common sense.\" Jonas spoke with clenched teeth, clearly working hard to hang on to his temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity put her arms around his neck and felt the tension there and in the muscles of his broad shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be very careful in Mexico, won\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m always careful. Verity, about this stupid idea of a vacation. I don\u0027t want you going anywhere until I get back. Do you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you.\" She tugged gently at his neck, aware of his resistance. She tried a seductive smile. \"I\u0027m going to miss you, Jonas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated a moment and then slowly relaxed, lowering himself alongside her. He gathered her into his arms. \"I\u0027m going to miss you, too, little tyrant. You behave yourself while I\u0027m gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of yourself, Jonas. Take care of Dad, too. He\u0027s not as young as he once was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your old man can still whip most guys half his age. Whatever Emerson is losing to the years, he\u0027s more than making up for with an increasingly devious mind.\" He bent down and brushed her lips with his. \"But don\u0027t worry about him, honey. I\u0027ll keep an eye on him for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep an eye on yourself, too. Good dishwashers are hard to find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always nice to be appreciated. Just don\u0027t start interviewing any replacements for my job while I\u0027m gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Jonas.\" She slid her hands down to his firm, muscular bu**ocks and squeezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re insatiable.\" He kissed her breast, his tongue warm and damp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky for me you always rise to the occasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luck has nothing to do with it.\" He slid one knee between her legs. \"The hell with it,\" he muttered against her throat. \"I can sleep on the plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson glanced out the window of the Jeep and waved at his daughter standing in the doorway of the No Bull Cafe. Verity waved back and blew a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like you did a good job of sweet-talking her last night,\" Emerson remarked. \"Verity seemed downright cheerful this morning. I expected a lot of last-minute lectures on the subject of brainless male machismo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas turned the Jeep onto the road leading out of Sequence Springs. It was still dark, and the sleepy little town slumbered peacefully beside the lake. \"Things weren\u0027t so cheerful for a while there last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should have heard her, Emerson. She started talking about taking a vacation. A vacation all by herself. Can you beat that? Something about going to Hawaii while we\u0027re in Mexico. If she hadn\u0027t left claw marks in my leg the last time I tried it, I would have turned her over my knee and paddled some sense into her. She was planning to take off for the islands the minute my back was turned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson\u0027s lips twitched briefly. He studied the road ahead with a thoughtful expression. \"You talk her out of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right. Told her that if she really wanted to go on vacation, we\u0027d go when I got back from Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe can spend the next week planning the trip. It\u0027ll give her something constructive to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she needs a vacation,\" Emerson remarked slowly. \"There\u0027s something different about Verity lately. You noticed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas was silent for a long moment. \"I\u0027ve noticed,\" he said finally. He would have given a great deal to know exactly what was going on in her feminine brain. More than once he\u0027d caught her in a strange mood of self-absorption, as if she was looking inward and thinking about making some changes in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought filled Jonas with a strong feeling of uneasiness, and an even stronger feeling of possessiveness. His hands tightened around the steering wheel. If Verity was thinking of changing lovers, she could damn well forget it. She had waited twenty-eight years for himâ€”twenty-eight years for her first sexual experience. And she had taken to his lovemaking like a dolphin to water. Jonas didn\u0027t like the thought that she might be wondering now if she\u0027d waited for the wrong man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure you talked her out of going off alone to Hawaii?\" Emerson asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas set his jaw, remembering belatedly that Verity had changed the subject last night, without giving him any promises. \"She wouldn\u0027t dare. She knows there\u0027d be hell to pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, the comforts of \u0027brainless male machismo.\u0027 No wonder we men cultivate it so carefully. Gives us a nice, pleasant, totally false sense of security when we need it most.\" Emerson laughed wryly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-5.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
