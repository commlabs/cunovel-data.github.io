Only then did he understand why Lin Dong was qualified to stand alongside the Ancient Masters.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Leave him to me.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith a fearsome expression in his eyes, Lin Dong stared at the Third Seat King, before he dropped a message to the Flame Master’s group. After which, without further ado, a resplendent divine light erupted from between his brows before he dashed straight towards the Third Seat King.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Flame Master’s group nodded upon seeing this. Currently, Lin Dong’s strength was on par with them. Therefore, thanks to his Divine Palace, it was possible for him to fight the Third Seat King.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Third Seat King’s face was still filled with smiles. He flipped his hand before a devil light shot out from the evil eye on his palm, intercepting the divine light that had shot out from the Divine Palace between Lin Dong’s brows.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong moved and appeared in front of the Third Seat King. The Flame Master and the rest also began their attack, as they intercepted the remaining members of the upper echelon of the Devil Prison.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, the sky and ground were divided into several battlegrounds. Meanwhile, the terrifying energy fluctuations from them affected the entire Western Xuan Region. In fact, even the citizens of the other three Xuan Regions could feel them as well. Soon after, countless pairs of anxiety filled eyes looked towards this extremely distant location.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You are quite impressive indeed. It has only been a year since we last met, yet you have actually formed a Divine Palace.” The Third Seat King looked at Lin Dong, who was standing in front of him, before he said with a faint smile.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong glanced at him indifferently. Currently, he was no longer in the mood for such an unnecessary conversation. Immediately, his body trembled before both his arms quickly liquidized. Following which, the strength of three great Ancestral Symbols erupted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter he advanced to the Divine Palace Master level, Lin Dong’s control over the Ancestral Symbols have clearly reached a godlike level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Swoosh!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong moved. He seemingly teleported as he appeared above the head of the Third Seat King instantaneously. Meanwhile, his Ancestral Symbol palm, which contained vast and mighty Yuan Power, ruthlessly smashed towards the latter’s head together with a terrifying force.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough Lin Dong’s strength had soared, the Third Seat King was no pushover as well. Immediately, his body shook before viscous demonic aura gathered on his body. Then, they transformed into a ferocious looking black Devil Emperor Armour. Finally, he threw a punch and clashed head-on with Lin Dong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA palm and fist slammed together furiously. Immediately, the surrounding space began to collapse an inch at a time. The shattered signs were startling obvious and shocking, and they looked just like cracked glass.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter throwing a punch, the Third Seat King showed no mercy. Many dark black sharp thorns quickly appeared on his ferocious looking Devil Emperor Armour, before he turned his body and swept towards Lin Dong like a hurricane. In fact, this attack was so sharp that it even cut the empty space itself.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNonetheless, Lin Dong did not step back after seeing this. Instead, the glow from his three Ancestral Symbols flashed wildly across his body. After which, his entire body gradually liquidized. In an instant, the liquidized Ancestral Symbols strength suddenly solidified. Then, they actually transformed into a black, lightning and silver coloured armour on his body.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA battle armour formed by his three great Ancestral Symbols enveloped Lin Dong’s body. Following which, he threw both his fists forward. Countless black holes, thunderbolts and silver light formed under his fists.
