He, too, had played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie’s biggest fear, other than floods, was enclosure, and she was relieved when instead of being packed in the trunk, she was guided roughly into the backseat of a car she didn’t recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove for what seemed like forever—long enough that she began to get bored and fell asleep. Then the car stopped, and she saw a vast, empty parking lot, and a fence enclosed by barbed wire. Before the headlights cut, she saw a weathered sign tacked to a sad, saggy-looking building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWELCOME TO THE DENNY SWIMMING POOL. HOURS 9 A.M.–DUSK, MEMORIAL DAY TO LABOR DAY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe padlock on the gates had been left undone. Ellie remembered, as they passed through it, that Ray Hanrahan had done maintenance at the Denny Swimming Pool last summer. Could he be in on this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the wet grass, the squelching mud, to the edge of the pool, which sat glimmering slickly in the moonlight, faintly lit up from below, electric and improbable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear came rushing back all at once. “You have to be kidding me.” She was at the edge of the deep end, trying to backpedal. But she couldn’t move. They had her tightly. Something metal bit into the palm of her hands, and she curled her fingers instinctively around it, too frightened to think or wonder what it was. “How do you expect me to—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t get to finish before she was pushed, roughly, headfirst into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlood. A flood of water everywhere: mouth, eyes, nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was underwater for a little more than a minute before she was hauled roughly to the surface, but she would afterward swear it was at least five, or seven. Endless seconds of her heartbeat thudding in her ears, her lungs screaming for air, her legs kicking for purchase. So many seconds of panic—so complete, so all-consuming, it wasn’t until she was once again in the open air, taking deep, grateful breaths, she realized that all along she had been clutching tightly to the small metal key that fitted her handcuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodge’s gamble at last paid off. In the morning, the story of Ellie spread, and by noon the betting slips had once again appeared. This time, they were passed from hand to hand, secretively, cautiously. Zev Keller and Ellie Hayes had both failed their individual challenges. They were out of the game. Colin Akinson, too. He’d been the first to flee the Graybill house—rumor was he hadn’t stopped running until he was almost to Massachusetts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodge, Ray, Heather, and Nat were still in. So were Harold Lee, Kim Hollister, and Derek Klieg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly seven players left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWEDNESDAY, JULY 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE WAS NO JOY LEFT IN THE GAME—NO LIGHTNESS or humor at all. Panic, as far as Dodge knew, had never been this serious. It had never been played with so much secretiveness, either. This was about more than getting busted for continuing a game. The cops were still trying to pin the fire at the Graybill house, and Little Bill’s death, on someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the judges had, apparently, lost their sense of humor. The next email that arrived, several days after Ellie had been eliminated from the game, was bleakly to-the-point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalden Plaza, 1-87. 9:00 p.m. Wednesday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBishop drove. It felt almost routine: Heather sat shotgun, Nat and Dodge were in the back. Nat spent the whole drive tapping the window with a knuckle, unconsciously beating out her own private rhythm. Dodge could almost believe they were just heading on some kind of late-night adventure to the mall. Except that Heather looked exhausted, and kept yawning, and Bishop hardly said a word except to ask her, in a low voice, what was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think is wrong?” Heather replied. Dodge didn’t want to eavesdrop, but he couldn’t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mom called,” Bishop said after a pause. “She said you haven’t been home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just staying at Anne’s for a few days. I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She said you took the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So now you’re on her side?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBishop must have gone to Little Bill’s funeral. Dodge recognized the folded memorial pamphlet, featuring a winged angel, now hanging on a ribbon from his rearview mirror. Like a charm, or a talisman. Weird that he’d felt the need to hang it. Bishop didn’t strike Dodge as superstitious. Then again, Dodge didn’t really get Bishop. He didn’t, for example, understand why he seemed to feel he was part of the game, why he seemed to feel guilty for Bill Kelly’s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they passed the Columbia County water towers, Dodge looked out and remembered the night of the first raid, when he, Nat, and Heather had hid from the cops. He felt a sudden wrench of grief, for the way time always goes forward, relentlessly. It was like floodwater: it left only clutter in its wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky was choked with masses of dark clouds, but it had stopped raining at last. Impossible to tell, actually, where the sun was coming from. A thick beam of light, singular and strange when the rest of the sky was still so dark, cut across the road. But the drive to Malden Plaza was long—they had to loop around to get to the northbound side—and before they’d arrived, the sun had set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few dozen cars in the lot, most of them hugging up as close to the McDonald’s as possible, plus a couple of eighteen-wheelers, trucks that must have been on a run from Albany to Canada. From the opposite side of the lot, Dodge watched a family emerging from the big swinging doors, carrying paper bags of fast food and large soda cups. He wondered where they were off to. Somewhere better than here, probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe players had parked as far from the building as possible, at the edge of the lot, where the trees were creeping close to the pavement and it was much darker. Seven players left and only two dozen spectators. Dodge was kind of surprised that Diggin had bothered to show up. Standing under the tall, stiff-necked streetlamps, he looked kind of green, as if he was in danger of puking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rules are simple.” Diggin practically had to shout over the roar of traffic behind him. I-87, separated from the parking lot by only a flimsy, shin-high divider, was a six-lane mega-highway. “Each of you has to cross. The five who cross fastest move on. The other two don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go first.” Ray stepped forward. He had avoided even glancing at Dodge. There was something like a truce between them, at least temporarily. It was funny. Ray was probably the guy Dodge hated most in the world, besides Luke. And yet Ray was the guy who knew more of Dodge’s secrets than anyone. “I want to get this over with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait.” Diggin extracted a strip of black fabric from his pocket and shook it out. He truly looked miserable. “You have to wear this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is that?” Ray asked, even though it was obviously a blindfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat and Heather exchanged a look. Dodge knew what they were thinking without having to ask. There was always a twist. The game was never easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiggin hesitated. For a second, it looked as though he was going to attempt to tie the blindfold on Ray himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay scowled at him. “Give me that,” he said, and snatched the blindfold from Diggin. Diggin backed off quickly, obviously relieved. Ray put the fabric over his eyes and knotted it behind his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Happy now?” he said, to no one in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodge stepped forward, so he was standing directly in front of Ray. He threw a punch, stopping a few inches short of Ray’s nose. Nat gasped and Diggin shouted. But Ray didn’t even flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all right,” Dodge said. “He can’t see shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t trust me, Mason?” Ray’s mouth curled into a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not even a little,” Dodge said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiggin had to help guide Ray to the divider that separated the parking lot from the narrow patch of grass and gravel that ran along the highway. Trucks were thundering past, spitting exhaust and roaring heat. A car blew its horn as Ray fumbled over the divider, and Dodge imagined a sudden swerve, the headlights swollen, freezing Ray in place, the shudder of the impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that would come later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time,” Diggin shouted. He had his phone out. For the first time, he noticed that Bishop was standing some ways apart, his lips moving as though in silent prayer. His face was incredible: anguished, twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that moment, Dodge had a suspicion. More like an intuition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he dismissed the thought quickly. Impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten seconds down,” Diggin announced. Dodge turned his eyes back to the highway. Ray was still hesitating, swaying like a drunk, like he was hoping momentum would unglue his feet. A truck blasted a horn, and he jerked backward. The sound rolled and echoed through the night air, distorted by distance to an alien cry. Motion was noise: Dodge closed his eyes and heard the fizz of the tires on the road, the thud of bass and music, engines grinding and spitting, the rush of air when a car blew by. He opened his eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty seconds!” Diggin’s voice had gone shrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sudden break in the traffic. Four, five seconds—in all six lanes, the road was clear. Ray sensed it and ran. He barreled straight into the divider on the other side of the road and nearly face-planted. But it didn’t matter. He’d done it. He whipped off the blindfold and waved it above his head, victorious. The whole thing had taken him twenty-seven seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to wait for another break in the traffic to cross, but this time he did so at a jog. He was showing off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s next?” Diggin said. “Let’s get this over with before—” Another truck blasted by, whipping away the rest of his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go.” Dodge stepped forward. Ray dangled the blindfold from one hand. For a second, their eyes met. They were joined now, more than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t choke,” Ray said in a low voice. Dodge snatched the blindfold from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry about me,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cloth was thick and totally opaque, like something you’d fashion a tarp out of. Once Dodge put it over his eyes, he was completely blind, and for a moment he felt a tightness in his chest, the overwhelming sense of disorientation and dizziness, like when you wake up from a nightmare in an unfamiliar place. He focused on the sounds: trucks, music, the fizz of the tires, and gradually he could map out the space in his mind. Funny how just being without sight could leave him feeling so exposed, raw. Anyone could rush at him and he’d never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt two soft hands slip around his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful,” Nat whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t answer, just fumbled to touch her face, hoping he wouldn’t accidentally get her boob instead. Kind of hoping he would, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” he announced in what he hoped was Diggin’s direction. “I’m ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he had done with Ray, Diggin took his arm and guided him to the low metal divider, and instructed him to climb it. Then Dodge was standing blind on the side of the road, while cars and semis roared past him. The wind blew hot and stinking with exhaust, and the ground trembled from the motion of the crushing wheels. Horns screamed out and faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodge’s heart was going hard and his mouth was dry. He hadn’t expected to be so afraid. His ears were full of a pounding rhythm—he couldn’t tell if it was noise from the highway or the echo of his heart. He barely heard Diggin call time. Shit. He couldn’t hear—how was he going to know when to cross? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/panic/page-22.html","bookId":1721,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:44 AM"}
