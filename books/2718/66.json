Have one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hands me a bright yellow key chain with DON’T HURT YOUR HAPPINESS in flowing, white script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” I say. I’m feeling better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn alarm sounds. On the walls, domed lights flare red. Gonzo drops to the ground and covers his head with his hands. “I told you, Cameron! Didn’t I tell you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the room is flooded by guys in commando gear. “Move, move, move!” they shout. They pass us by and surround a yellow sofa, where a young guy sits in his pajamas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Team leader! We’ve got a situation!” one of the commandos shouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, Cameron,” Daniel says. He goes over to the kid on the couch. “Thomas, what’s wrong, friend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, I don’t know. I just started feeling …” He searches for the word. “Sad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel gives Thomas’s shoulders a squeeze and the kid winces. “We don’t feel sad, here, Thomas. Why do you want to hurt your happiness?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I totally don’t! I don’t know what happened. It’s like I just couldn’t help it. I was thinking about the time my dog, Snuffy, got hit by a car when I was six and how I still miss him, and it … the sad just snuck up on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Smoothie,” Daniel says to a commando, who opens the right side of his coat, displaying a dazzling array of cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What flavor?” Daniel asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh … mango?” Thomas answers. The commando hands off the cup and Daniel puts the straw to Thomas’s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here drink this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas takes a few sips like he’s not really thirsty; he’s just being polite. “It tastes like vanilla.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel’s really concentrating. “Just tell us what you want, friend. Tell us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas buries his head in his hands. “I don’t know. That’s the problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here. We’ll help you.” The commando opens the left side of his coat. It’s like a magazine rack of catalogs. Daniel calls them off. “CESSNAB Jeans? CESSNAB Music? CESSNAB Golf? CESSNAB Games?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Games?” Gonzo comes out of his safety crouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m telling you, I don’t know!” The poor guy’s in a panic. Like he’s lost his happiness and can’t remember where he put it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel puts a hand on his shoulder. “Thomas. You know what you need? You need to go bowling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is greeted by a chorus of “Amen’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think …” Thomas starts, but he’s cut off by the choir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’re special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole world’s special, so don’t you forget it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Universe wants us\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll to be happy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFull of smiles and all that stuff,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that stuff\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s happy and smiley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo get happy, happy, happy right now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet happy, happy, happy right now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet happy, happy, happy right now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come with us,” Ruth says, taking Gonzo and me by the hand as Daniel and Thomas lead the way to a set of wide double doors with the winged bowling ball insignia in the middle. Everyone gets quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this place?” I whisper to Ruth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is our church. The Church of Everlasting Satisfaction. And Snack ’N’ Bowl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amen,” everyone intones, and the doors are opened wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get the f**k out,” Gonzo says under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis has to be the biggest friggin’ bowling alley I have ever seen in my life. Just row after gleaming row of well-maintained lanes bordered by litter-free gutters. There’s not a scuff on the floor. An enormous TV screen encased in theater-worthy lightbulbs is suspended from the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every single one of us knows what it’s like out there,” Daniel says. “The stress. The worrying—am I good enough, strong enough, smart enough, pretty enough? How come Johnny got an A-plus on his paper but I only got a C? Is he better than me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why does only the winning athlete get a first-place medal?” another kid says, putting “winning” in air quotes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do bad things happen? There must be a reason for it—something you can avoid doing so you’ll never, ever be sad,” a girl in saddle shoes says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA kid with a bowling ball tattoo on his arm speaks up. “Why shouldn’t we all just be happy all the time?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/going-bovine/page-66.html","bookId":2718,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM"}
