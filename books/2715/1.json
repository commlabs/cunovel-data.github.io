But mostly, I cherished the absolute absence of human intervention. God, did I adore the quiet scuttle of squirrels pillaging through the foliage, birds chirping their daily chorus, and the flutter of the breeze through the hollows, like the breath of nature, whispering her secrets to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I’d sought the woods with my e-reader almost every day this summer, escaping either my mother, my father, or both my brothers, pretty much my entire life in general. It was one big happy retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea why I hadn’t come out here before this year. The quiet, relaxing solitude was addictive. And there was so much of it. My father owned a half-mile strip through the forest—or three hundred and twenty acres, as he would classify it. The only other property to butt against ours was the Parkers’, and their place was clear on the other side, so I had the entire three hundred and twenty acres all to mysel—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch out!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled out of my peaceful reverie, I whirled around, clutching my Kindle to my chest. But what...how...? Someone else was in my woods?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept there was no way to deny he was charging directly toward me as if the hounds of hell were after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh...crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to stop and avoid a collision. I could tell by the way his arms flailed through the air as if he were grasping for invisible brakes, and by the widening of his eyes...right before he plowed into me with a jarring thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breath snapped from my lungs. Momentum from his run propelled me backwards and him forward. There was a brief moment when we were both soaring through the air that our gazes met in the hazy, pollen-clogged afternoon. His enlarged brown eyes filled with horror. Mine, fear. That’s all we had time to do, share a single look—I didn’t even get in a good scream—before we landed, him on top, me crushed beneath with my back to the forest floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fall didn’t knock me unconscious, which was disappointing since the pain was immediate, searing up my spine and exploding out all four limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a dazed moment, we lay together, a tangled knot of arms and legs. He crushed me to the earth with his warmth and the sharp incense of boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d never thought of what boys might smell like before. But he certainly didn’t exude snips and snails and puppy-dogs’ tails. He was musky and fresh with a hint of apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then his smell was taken away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh...shit.” He did an awkward crablike crawl to scramble off me, making me moan as his weight lifted and the release of pressure brought about more sensation, like that new throb of agony to my hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay? Hey.” Hands gripped my shoulders and shook. When I did nothing, because the wind was still knocked from me, he said, “shit,” again. “Wake up. Please wake up. I’m sorry. I—shit...you have to be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers skimmed over my face and into my hairline, boy fingers, containing the slight rasp of callouses against the softest part of my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I keep noticing the boy aspects of him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why couldn’t I tell if I was wiggling my toes or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd hey, why exactly was he running his fingers through my hair? The creeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized he wasn’t feeling me up but was rather searching for wounds about the same moment he found a goose egg on the back of my skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ouch!” Pain zapped through me, from the back of my head, down, until it shot out the ends of my feet. And yeah, I could definitely feel my toes now as they pulsed with an agonizing throb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed his wrist and flashed my eyes open. The first thing I saw was the straight, tall branches overhead with the blue sky peeking through, checking on me as if making sure I was okay. I transferred my gaze until I focused on concerned brown eyes, the skin around them wrinkled into a sympathetic wince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay? Let me help you up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis warm, boy fingers wrapped around my elbow and more of them gently took hold of my shoulder. But when he tried to lift me into a sit, I sucked in a breath and curled away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe immediately let go and shied back. “Sorry. Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled onto my side, cradling my ribs, and bent my knees up toward my chest. But...ouch, this did not feel good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy hovered above me, his fear, concern, and indecision oozing with a pungent intensity. “Where does it hurt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moaned, or maybe whimpered was a better word. “Everywhere.” Closing my eyes, I gnashed my teeth and concentrated on nothing but breathing until I could bear the ache. Then I blew out a breath and began to sit up on my own. He shifted toward me and extended an arm as if he wanted to assist, but then he paused, changing his mind. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-1.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
