{"id":46361,"no":1044,"title":"Chapter 1042: Fierce Battle With Ghostmother","content":"\u003cp\u003eNumerous thoughts raced through Ghostmother’s mind as the bone lizard sped through the sky toward Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, it was possible to see the fearsome energy of the bone lizard distorting the air around it as it moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Heavenspan Realm, a mighty bone lizard like this could cause mountains to crumble and the land to shatter with its passing. But these were the Eternal Immortal Domains, and therefore, the mighty energy fluctuations did little to the surrounding landscape, much less the roiling Eternal Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to the huge lizard, Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King were like tiny bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the intense energy of the lizard got closer and closer, the Giant Ghost King’s heart began to race as he sensed his cultivation base beginning to grow unstable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of ship is that?!?!” he said, his scalp tingling in shock. At that point, Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, causing a moon-shaped flash of light to emerge from his bag of holding. It was his moonflower, the same one which had appeared during his fight with Daoist Heavenspan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter spending the better part of the past year in recovery, the moonflower was mostly back to normal. Furthermore, the aura of its home, and the familiar spiritual energy of heaven and earth here, ensured that it was bursting with excitement. Directed by Bai Xiaochun, the moonflower shot toward the Giant Ghost King and coiled protectively around him, defending him against the pressure from the bone galleon to some degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Giant Ghost King saw the moonflower, his eyes went wide, especially considering that it emanated fluctuations equivalent to the great circle of the Demigod Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell is that…? Fudge, the great circle of the Demigod Realm?! It’s… it’s stronger than me!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe added boost from the moonflower helped the Giant Ghost King speed up, and together with Bai Xiaochun, he flew deeper into the Eternal Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two of them sped along, black flames suddenly rose up in the eyes of the bone lizard that made it seem intelligent to a certain degree. At the same time, Ghostmother performed an incantation gesture, causing the lizard’s mouth to open and emit a howl in Bai Xiaochun’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with the howl came black flames that also bore down on Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a raging sea of fire, its heat so intense that it seemed it could melt anything that got in its way!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s expression flickered at the terrifying power he sensed in the sea of flames. Without any hesitation, he spun, clenched his hand into a fist, and unleashed a punch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power of his fleshly body erupted, and numerous shockwaves rolled out as his fist made contact with the sea of flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deafening boom filled the air as the sea of flames suddenly lurched to a halt as surely as if it were a person who had been grabbed by the throat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhostmother snorted coldly, sending another command to the bone lizard. Another howl erupted from its mouth, accompanied by a second sea of flames. However, this one was vastly more powerful than the last, and it immediately destroyed the tempest that had been created by Bai Xiaochun’s fist strike. Then, it coalesced into the shape of an enormous, fiery ghost face, which lunged forward ravenously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that the seven demigod cultivators closed in like seven shooting stars. In the blink of an eye, they were right on top of Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree of them performed incantation gestures to summon huge, flaming birds that let out ear-piercing shrieks. The birds merged with the demigods, giving them additional speed that they used to attack the Giant Ghost King.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unsightly expression could be seen on the Giant Ghost King’s face as he fell back and waved his hand, sending a mist of ghosts out to defend himself. At the same time, the moonflower held nothing back to aid him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, a major battle was underway right over the Eternal Sea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the fiery ghost face closed in, Bai Xiaochun used the power of the Live Forever Codex to fuel his Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation. Roaring, he transformed to a height of more than 300 meters. Looking like the forefather of all humanity, the original Arch-Ancestor, he leaped forward, throwing his arms out wide as he slammed into the ghost face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost face howled in response, and yet, was powerless to defend itself, and shattered into innumerable black sparks that fell down to the Eternal Sea below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No wonder the gravekeeper picked him,” Ghostmother thought, looking down coldly at Bai Xiaochun. “And he was able to defeat Daoist Heavenspan too. He must have plenty of trump cards at his disposal!” Instead of impulsively rushing into the fighting herself, she waited on the deck of the bone galleon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the months in which she had been hunting down Heavenspan cultivators, she had collected quite a few clues that gave her a fairly good understanding of the final, spectacular battle between Bai Xiaochun and Daoist Heavenspan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still completely and utterly confident that, since she was in the early Celestial Realm, she was superior to Bai Xiaochun. And yet, she still maintained caution. Her bone lizard was the envy of the other celestials in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, and therefore, she relied on it to carry out the initial attack on Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling coldly, she performed another incantation gesture, causing yet another black sea of flames to erupt out. Within it was a nine-meter column of light that shot directly toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, things weren’t over yet. Ghostmother now performed an incantation gesture with her left hand, causing a magical symbol to appear there. At that point, the two ghost flags on the deck of the battleship began to wave, and the ghost faces emerged, joining the sea of flames in the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s expression was unsightly to the extreme. He had known all along that Ghostmother would not be easy to deal with. Her bone lizard and its seas of flame contained terrifying destructive power, and only three bursts of it had already filled the area with a deadly miasma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Bai Xiaochun had shocking powers of regeneration, the way the miasma constantly ate away at him caused him to frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was the beam of light, which he could instantly tell was too powerful for him to face directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd last were the two ghost faces. Although they didn’t match up to the laughing-crying ghost face, they still radiated the power of the quasi-celestial level, and were obviously very intelligent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ghostmother must already know about my fight with Daoist Heavenspan. That’s why she\u0027s being so careful. She wants me to use my trump cards early on…. However, I can’t do that this close to the borders of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty….” Gritting his teeth, he faced the beam of light, the sea of flames, and the ghost face, and clenched his hand into a fist. Instantly, a black vortex sprang up around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, rumbling sounds echoed out as a shadowy emperor appeared, radiating domineering energy left and right!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve never fought a true celestial before. Let’s see how far away I actually am from the Mahayana Realm!” His eyes were completely bloodshot as wild energy fluctuations erupted from his fist!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1041\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1043\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1042","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
