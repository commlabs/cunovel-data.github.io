Noontime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guan Luo road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun lashed his horse, loosening the reins, speeding it forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sped toward Chang’an.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis horse tore along, galloping at full speed. He had already changed horses four times on his journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery horse had been top quality, and fast. He knew horses, and was willing to spend a lot of money buying one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe urgently wished to arrive in Chang’an.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the four horses, and all of them had ended up collapsing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun felt the same, completely exhausted, about to collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he must reach Chang’an.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frightening and inauspicious premonition filled his heart, as if a dear relative was about to be slaughtered like an animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same day, the same time. Chang’an.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same old Chang’an. Chang’an was the same as before, the people were the same as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person with the box was waiting to make his kill just as before, and the person without a box was waiting to be killed just as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no snow, and no sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gloomy sky looked like the eyes of a young girl who has been crying for too long, devoid of charm and color. To those eyes, the box looked just as ordinary as before, just as old fashioned. Awkward and ugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the box had already opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ordinary, ugly pieces of metal inside the box had in the twinkling of an eye been transformed into a weapon that could not be defended against, and in just as short a time period, Zhuo Donglai would soon be killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the time he was young all the way into the prime of his life, Zhuo Donglai had always wielded a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had used many types of swords. When thirteen years of age, he had used a butcher’s knife, which he had pilfered directly from a butcher’s chopping block, to kill the tyrant of the fish and meat market, “Boss Pig-killer.” Since then he had changed blades many times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was fourteen he had used a folded iron broadsword, at fifteen, a pure steel horse-cutter, and at sixteen, a ghost-head blade. At seventeen he replaced his single blade with double blades, a pair of mandarin duck butterfly swords. At twenty, he replaced his double blades with a single blade, an extremely heavy, extremely dignified golden-backed mountain-chopping blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt twenty-three, he had used the most dignified weapon in all of Jianghu, a purple-gold fish-scale blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after the age of twenty-six, the blades he used yet again changed, from the resplendent to the ordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe once again used a folded iron broadsword, a goose-quill sabre, even a foreign monk’s knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsn’t it true that one can see the changes in a person’s sword skill and personality from the changes in the weapons they use?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, regarding knowledge and understanding of “blades” and “sword skill,” almost no one in the martial world could compare to Zhuo Donglai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo after reaching the prime of his life, he no longer needed to use a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could take a tangible sword and make it intangible, could defeat a sword with no sword. And yet he still used a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcealed in his boot was an incredibly sharp dagger that could cut through iron as if it were mud, or cut through two legs as if they were made of tofu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Die Wu’s legs, so lithe, so nimble, so beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlower-petal-like drops of blood splattered everywhere. Die Wu stopped dancing, would never dance again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Zhu Meng fled. Little Gao left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Zhuo Donglai snatched up the dagger, carrying with it the gory soul of a dancer. And so once again it lay concealed in the boot of this ice-cold person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis dagger was a blade among blades, created by Zhuo Donglai after countless bitter lessons, setbacks and victories alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the essence of everything he had experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat method would Xiao Leixue use to assemble a weapon that could overcome this blade?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe definitely had a method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never failed in an attempt to kill someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same day, afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main road outside of Chang’an city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Chang’an neared, Sima Chaoqun’s state of mind grew more agitated than ever. The inauspicious premonition was stronger than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if he could see one of his closest relatives calling out from within a pool of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn’t see who it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, the people who should soon be dead were Gao Jianfei and Zhu Meng. He did not see how they could escape death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut their deaths did not really concern him. They were not related to him, and were not friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat of Wu Wan? Could it be Wu Wan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn’t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a woman, and had never harmed another. Furthermore, she lived a life of seclusion at home. How could she have befallen any sort of calamity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be Zhuo Donglai?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was even more improbable. Zhuo Donglai’s resourcefulness and martial arts would allow him to protect himself in any situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if the Great Protection Agency had befallen some great calamity, he would definitely have escaped safely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than these people, he really had no other relatives in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo whom did this horrible, inauspicious premonition relate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun could not imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even less imaginable to him was the fact that Zhuo Donglai was currently like a helpless animal beneath the claws of a tiger, a fish on the chopping block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same day, the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChang’an.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai’s fate was most certainly sealed. He knew that Xiao Leixue had never before failed in an attempt to kill someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, he wasn’t dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a “beng” sound when the box opened, and Xiao Leixue’s long, dextrous, powerful fingers went into motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he moved, the metal pieces in the box would be assembled in an instant to form a deadly weapon, something that could definitely overpower Zhuo Donglai’s blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet in that exact moment, his fingers suddenly grew stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis whole body grew stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a very long time, he lifted his head and faced Zhuo Donglai. His face was completely emotionless, but his eyes were filled with the expression of a dying wild animal facing a hunter, furious and sorrowful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men faced each other. Neither spoke, nor moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore time passed, who knew how long. Suddenly, footsteps could be heard on the path outside the small courtyard, and then Zhuo Qing appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour men followed him. One carried a drinking vessel, another carried some clothing and a hat, and the remaining two carried a violet sandalwood chair, covered with a violet sable skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai put on a pair of pants and some stockings, then donned the leather hat. He sat down gently into the chair, and poured some red wine into the violet crystal drinking cup. He let out a light sigh. “This is much more comfortable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Leixue wasn’t listening, and wasn’t watching. All of this, it seemed he wasn’t watching. Anyone who looking at this scene would definitely think they were dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis couldn’t be happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was the most fearsome enemy under heaven, with the most fearsome weapon; life and death hung on a breath, then suddenly Zhuo Donglai started acting completely relaxed and carefree, so much so that he called for people to bring a change of clothes. He was even drinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn intelligent and clear-headed person would never do something like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet Zhuo Donglai had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the box opened, Xiao Leixue didn’t move at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis mysterious and fearsome person seemed like a spectre from hell, whose spirit had suddenly been recalled by the lord of the netherworld, and whose body had become like an ancient, fossilized corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai poured another cup of wine and took a sip. He turned and asked Zhuo Qing, “Do you know what’s going on here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what kind of person Mr. Xiao is?” Zhuo Donglai answered his own question. “He’s an amazing person. In the last twenty or thirty years, the number of Jianghu heroes and experts of the martial world who have died under his hand number at least forty or fifty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Qing listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s said that the box he has in his hand is the most fearsome weapon under heaven. I’ve never been a very humble person, but I truly believe that all he has to do is make a move, and I would be dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the box in Xiao Leixue’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He already opened the box, because he wants to kill me, and yet up to now he hasn’t made a move.” Zhuo Donglai was very calm. “All of a sudden, he would rather just stand there like an idiot watching me drink, and not do anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Leixue wasn’t listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever Zhuo Donglai said, it seemed he wasn’t listening at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai suddenly laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that he doesn’t dare to kill me. In Mr. Xiao’s eyes, someone like me is no better than a dog.” He looked at Zhuo Qing, “Do you know why he hasn’t killed me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He hasn’t killed me because he has no way to kill me,” said Zhuo Donglai. “The only thing he can do now is stand there and wait for me to kill him. Kill him like a dog. In fact, killing him might be easier than killing a dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should not be happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one would dare insult Xiao Leixue in this way, much the same way that no one had ever dared to insult Zhuo Donglai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zhuo Qing, let me ask you. Do you know how the incomparable, matchless Mr. Xiao could suddenly change into a dog?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be able to see, or at least see a little bit,” said Zhuo Donglai coldly. “If you can\u0027t see, I’m afraid you’ll have a hard time living to twenty years of age.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” said Zhuo Qing. “I should be able to see at least a bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What can you see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems someone used a special method to immobilize Mr. Xiao. He can’t use any of the power in his body whatsoever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Xiao used to be a dragon among men, not a dog. But Mr. Xiao also knows that if the dragon dies, even if it is a celestial dragon, it can’t compare to a dog.” He spoke very calmly, because he was merely stating the facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But dogs can die as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. Sooner or later. But not at the moment. Wheter it be dragon, person, or dog, being able to live one moment longer is better than dying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith life, there was hope. Even if it was only a sliver of hope, it should not be abandoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sadly, I don’t see how he can have any hope now,” said Zhuo Donglai. “I’m afraid anyone who is poisoned by ‘Fragrance of the Gentleman,’ will be left without any hope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fragrance of the Gentleman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The friendship of gentlemen is as pure as water. The sincere and honest gentlemen is as warm and kind as jade. Fragrance of the Gentleman is the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The same?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As clear and fluid as water, colorless, odorless. As gentle and beautiful as jade.” Zhuo Donglai’s voice was also very warm. “The only difference is, the gentleman in Fragrance of the Gentleman is a hypocrite. Because it is a poison.” He laughed. “The friendship of gentlemen is as cleansing as the spring breeze, and the poison of this gentlemen is also like the spring breeze. It can make a person unwittingly become intoxicated. And once intoxicated, ones emotions will overcome one’s spirit, and one will be lost forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could Mr. Xiao have been poisoned by something like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because in Mr. Xiao’s eyes, I’m nothing but a dog, an obedient dog. In front of Mr. Xiao, there are some things I don’t dare even think of, because as soon as I think of them, it would be revealed in my expression, and would be very difficult to conceal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai poured another glass of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Xiao obviously never imagined that I would have come earlier and placed Fragrance of the Gentleman onto the jacket of a dead person. As soon as Mr. Xiao approached the body and moved the clothing, Fragrance of the Gentleman would float like the spring breeze into his face.” Zhuo Donglai sighed. “Mr. Xiao never imagined that a dog would do something like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” said Zhuo Qing. “In the future, I will never view other people as dogs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man was dead, and the secret that Xiao Leixue so wished to understand had died with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he caught sight of the dead old man, of course he would check to see of he was really dead. And how he had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course, it would be difficult to look for the cause of death without disturbing the clothing on the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai had planned ahead of time in case Xiao Leixue lived, and had thus prepared the Fragrance of the Gentleman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was really a simple matter, very simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimple and fearsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai let out another sigh. “When this old man was alive, he was no gentleman. Who would have thought that after he died he would have the fragrance of a gentleman. Sometimes a gentleman really is fearsome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words were not gems of wisdom, nor food for thought or philosophy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were simple facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 4\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy dusk, Sima Chaoqun had returned to Chang’an.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had resided here longer than any other place in his life. He was familiar with most of the streets and roads, and yet it seemed that as of now there had been a great change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough, it was not the ancient city of Chang’an that changed, but rather he himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet he couldn’t say what exactly had changed, nor when the change had occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Was it when he’d set foot on that blood-stained, slab stone street? Or was it when he’d listened to Oxhide talk of Cleats’ bloodstained bravery?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one must trample the corpses of others to climb up, even if one reaches the peak, it would not be a joyous occasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen and horses both can become exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he lashed his horse down an out-of-the-way little street that ran along the city wall, he suddenly caught sight of someone familiar from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis person had already blended into the shadows of the city wall, and then disappeared into the darkness without turning his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sima Chaoqun was certain that it was Gao Jianfei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he wasn’t drunk, his memory and vision were much better than others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—How could Gao Jianfei still be alive?

In these circumstances, it would be easy for anyone to misidentify another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the person wasn’t Gao Jianfei after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Xiao Leixue hadn’t died beneath “Tearstains,” then Gao Jianfei must certainly be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he had entered into a contract to kill someone, Xiao Leixue would never let them go for any reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe definitely wouldn’t make an exception for Little Gao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao was a worthless Jianghu wanderer, and had nothing to do with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao also couldn’t figure out why Xiao Leixue hadn’t killed him.

Suddenly, a blade flashed; a shining, snow-white broadsword slashed out of the darkness toward his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blade descended, clearly intent on splitting his head in two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut whoever it was that wanted to split Gao Jianfei’s head into two, they would find it a difficult task. He had a sword in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis blade attack was not very fast, the technique not very amazing.

He also saw the person’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name was Man Niu, and he was one of the bravest members of the Lion Clan, one of the eighty-six warriors Zhu Meng had brought to Chang’an to die. \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he had never officially met this man, he considered himself to be his brother, a brother with whom to share weal and woe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis attack was definitely made in error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Little Gao, Gao Jianfei.” His body flashed, and the blade met nothing.

The wielders also fell, immobilized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wielders of the blades did not retreat.

If you don’t understand then who could?” Man Niu howled angrily. “We viewed you as a person! Who knew that you were really just an animal?
