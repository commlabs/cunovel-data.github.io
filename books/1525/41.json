He stared transfixed by the spear of sharpened white bone protruding like a branch from the side of his friend’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph crashed to his knees. “G… Goddammit! Run!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind Ralph, a tall, pale creature rose on spindly limbs. Their tracker had come out of hiding. Huge black eyes glared at Norman as the creature lifted a second spear of bone and leaped toward him, bounding high over Ralph’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman danced backward but was too slow on his injured leg. The beast plunged toward him, bone spear raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDucking, Norman braced for the impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Ralph suddenly bellowed with rage and lunged forward. He snatched the ankle of the creature as it flew past, a lineman grabbing a fumbled pass. He yanked the beast clear of Norman and swung the startled creature through the air, swatting it against the neighboring wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts skull shattered like eggshells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs its carcass collapsed in a tangle of limbs, so did Ralph. He struck the floor hard, too weak to break his own fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman rushed to his side, ignoring the pain as he fell to his hands. “Don’t move! I’ll get help! Sam can’t be far.” Norman gently turned his friend’s face upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlazed eyes stared back. Empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman’s hand flinched back. Ralph was already gone. He crawled back, tears blurring his vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround him, the cavern echoed again with the yammering howls and gibbering cries of the beasts. More trackers. They detected fresh blood and were drawn by their ravenous hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman pressed his forehead against the cool rock and took several deep breaths. He was too tired to run, but he forced himself up. He would not let Ralph’s sacrifice be for nothing. Glancing at Ralph’s body, he stood unsteadily, torch in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on his good heel and swung around. Only three yards away crouched another of the foul creatures: squat, with thick arms and bent back. It growled at Norman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman’s eyes narrowed with rage. He shoved his torch high. “Fuck you!” he screamed, fists clenched and trembling. He put all his hate and sorrow into his cry, as tears rolled down his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike those of a frightened deer, the beast’s eyes flared wide, clearly startled by the unusual reaction of its injured prey. Disconcerted, it crept back, then scampered down a side street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman’s cry ended with a choking sob. He wiped at his face, then shoving his glasses higher on his nose, he limped forward. “You-all sure as hell better not get in my way! I’m not in the fuckin’ mood!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie knelt by the door in the heel of the great statue. It was a long and narrow silver inset, about half a meter wide and two meters tall, flush almost with the surrounding gold walls. She was surprised Sam had even spotted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Denal shone the flashlight, she once again worked the tip of the golden dagger into the narrow slot in the door’s center. It had to be a keyhole, but so far no amount of manipulation of the gold dagger’s tip would release the catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss Maggie,” Denal said quietly behind her, the flashlight’s beam jittering. They rarely spoke, and only in whispers, afraid to attract the ears of the predators out there. “Mister Sam gone a long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pictured Sam sneaking around the necropolis, alone, and pounded her fist against the unyielding surface in frustration. “I know that, Denal!” she hissed. Besides a flurry of rifle shots, sounding like an asthmatic machine gun, and one screamed shout, there had been no indication that anyone but the creatures still moved out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy mumbled a meek apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Maggie leaned back, resting the dagger on her lap. “I didn’t mean to snap at you, Denal. I’m the one who should be sorry. It’s… it’s just that I can’t get this damn thing open, and they’re counting on me.” Maggie felt near tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed his hand on her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven that small bit of solace went a long way to calm her frayed nerves. She took a shuddering breath, forcing herself to calm down. Glancing at Denal, she patted his hand. “Thanks.” She stared into the boy’s scared eyes, then returned to study the door. “Denal, I’m sorry for getting you into this mess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No sorry. It were my choice to spy on Gil. I wanted to help you. My mama, before she die, she say I must help others. Be brave, Denal, she tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother sounds like a wonderful woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenal sniffed back tears. “She was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, by Jesus, she thought silently, I’m not going to let that wonderful woman’s boy die down here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith renewed determination, she raised the gold dagger; the foot-long blade glittered in the flashlight beam. She remembered Sam’s trick at transforming the dagger. She tilted the knife and examined its sculpted hilt, the fanged god Huamancantac. She ran her fingers along its contoured handle. She found no catch to trigger the change. “How did you do that, Sam?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie glanced to the door, then back up to the statue. She needed to think. Why a door in the back of the heel? The Greek myth of Achilles came to mind. The invincible warrior’s only weak spot was his heel. But there was no such corresponding myth among the Incas or any of the Peruvian tribes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the coincidence kept nagging her. Could there be some connection? Many myths crossed cultures and continents. Just because she had never heard of such an Incan myth did not mean it did not exist. Without a written language, much of Incan heritage had been lost over the ages—perhaps tales of the Incan equivalent of Achilles had been lost, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting the dagger, she recalled the Greek myth. The great Achilles was finally brought down by a blow to his heel. But it wasn’t a knife that slew the magically protected warrior. It had been an arrow. She shook her head at this useless train of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only you were an arrow, she wished at the dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her hands, the hilt grew suddenly cool and the golden blade stretched and thinned, blossoming at its tip into a sharp arrowhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus!” Maggie blurted out, popping to her feet. She turned to Denal, holding out the transformed knife. “Look!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenal, though, was staring the other way, gaping out at the necropolis. He backed toward her, raising an arm. “Miss Maggie…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her gaze, she followed where he pointed. At the shadowed edge of the tombs, pale, monstrous shapes crouched. They had crept up on them so silently, even now not a growl or yowl escaped them. Maggie noticed several of the faces stared up at the gigantic statue—but not all of them. Several pairs of hungry eyes stared directly at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if knowing they had been spotted, the creatures began to slink, crawl, and waddle out from the necropolis’s edge. Silent, like twisted shadows. There had to be at least two dozen of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie pulled Denal back with her into the small cubby between the two heels of the Incan king. Denal had a flashlight, and the remains of their one torch. It would not hold the hordes off. They needed help. She risked a step forward and yelled with all the wind in her lungs. There was no reason to hide in silence any longer. “Sam! Help!” Her call echoed throughout the large cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of the nearest beasts, angered by the noise, rushed toward her. They were of the soldier class of the pack, loping on muscular legs, eyes narrowed to black slits, fangs bared. They resembled hairless bears, muzzles stretched wide as they attacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie brandished her only weapon, the dagger now shaped like an arrow. If she could kill one of them…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearest of the two raised up from its crouched run, ready to lash out at her, then its eyes flicked toward her only weapon. The beast howled as if struck and fell back, colliding with its partner. The two tangled together, claws raking each other as they fought to back away. Slitted eyes had widened in raw panic. Whining, they fled back to the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stepped farther from her hiding place. She lifted her weapon high. A squeal of fear ran through the massed beasts. Like a school of startled fish, they spun and darted away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering the transformed knife, she frowned at the gold arrow. What had just happened? She ran a finger down the shaft of the arrow. She glanced back at the locked door. More from the beasts’ reaction than her own insight, Maggie suspected she truly held the key to the Incan statue. They had obviously feared it. But why? Did the beasts recall some frightening memory of the Incas who had once traveled here with this strange knife. If so, how? It had been so long ago, at least five centuries. Was it some type of collective memory, a genetic instinct among this diverse pack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping toward the silver door, she was determined to test her theory. Crouching, she slid the slender arrow through the slit. If this proved to be the key, then it also suggested the Incas had shared some common myths with the Greeks. This fact alone could be worth an entire doctoral thesis. Holding her breath, Maggie slid the arrow home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small click sounded—and the door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark chamber lay beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie hung back. She glanced to her hand. With the door open, the gold dagger had returned to its original shape. The long blade glinted in the light. Holding the weapon toward the doorway, she recalled the booby traps in the other chamber. Still, there was only one way to proceed. Without turning, she waved her free hand toward Denal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring me the flashlight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShining the light forward, she noticed that beyond the doorway lay a small, unadorned chamber, its floor of gold matching the statue. It was plenty large enough to house all of them. She leaned forward and cast the light up. There was no ceiling. The beam climbed into the hollow heart of the gold statue. It seemed to go on forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing back out, she ran her light along the length of the Incan king. Overhead, his raised gold palms held up the roof of the cavern. For a hiding place, it was not exactly unobtrusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie turned to face the dark necropolis. But where the hell were the others?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam froze when he heard Maggie’s cry for help. He stared forward for a heartbeat into the maze of streets. For the past half hour, there had been no further sign of Ralph and Norman. The last he had heard was an explosive “fuck you,” then nothing else. The streets lay silent. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/excavation/page-41.html","bookId":1525,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM"}
