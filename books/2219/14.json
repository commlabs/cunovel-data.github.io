I’m just following your lead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Must you call me honey?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question jolted me, serving notice that I had been behaving like a jerk ever since the chief removed the cuffs. Maybe I had cause. My head continued to throb; I was still naked except for my spoiled shorts and apparently a figure of some curiosity and amusement according to the expressions of the people who walked or drove by. Plus, I wasn’t altogether sure where I was or how I was going to get home. Yet I could hear the old man admonishing me when I was a kid playing ball and I had a bad day at the plate. “That’s no excuse for poor manners,” he’d say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I apologize,” I said. “I won’t do it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracie blinked hard. I don’t know if it was because of the sun or because she was startled by my response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mentioned a hotel,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just up the street.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here, let me carry those.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the two shopping bags filled with my purchases from her hands. Tracie blinked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something else?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I keep comparing you to Rush. He was very polite, very considerate—he seemed like a nice man. Looking back, I realize now that it was all for show. You, on the other hand—you don’t seem like a nice man at all, and yet you were angry when Mr. Miller hit his daughter, and what you said about Chuck … Who are you, McKenzie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’ll tell you. I don’t know if I let a week go by when I don’t ask myself that same question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharren Nuffer grinned when we went through the front doors of the Pioneer Hotel, and she kept grinning as Tracie and I approached the registration desk. Her tumbled-down, chemically enhanced hair resembled raw blue-black silk, and her rich tan reached all the way to the valley between her breasts, which she displayed beneath a black sleeveless shirt. Apparently she didn’t like buttons, because she used only a couple of them and they were straining to keep her shirt closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many times do I have to tell you, Tracie,” she said. “We don’t rent by the hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re hysterical, Sharren,” Tracie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharren must have agreed, because she laughed long and hard. When she finished, she waved a slender hand at me and said, “Seriously, what is this all about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need a room for McKenzie here,” Tracie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie? Rushmore McKenzie? You’re not Rushmore McKenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I am,” I said. Sharren looked like she didn’t believe me. “It’s a long story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t, but Tracie did. Only the way she told it, what had happened to me since four forty-five that morning didn’t seem like anything to get excited about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew Rush,” Sharren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you know him well?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharren hesitated before she answered. “As well as I could.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s the first person you should talk to, my inner voice told me. I literally shook the thought from my head. Who said I’m staying? I asked myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took some wrangling, yet Tracie managed to book a room using Miller’s credit card—eighty-nine dollars a night. Sharren procured my key from a row of boxes behind the desk, a real key, not a plastic card. While they went at it, I looked around. From the outside, the Pioneer seemed almost quaint, a dignified redbrick Victorian with three floors and no elevator. Yet the inside had an air of quiet dissipation. The reception area was crammed with faded couches, armchairs, and marble-top tables with ceramic figurines, ashtrays, fake Roman busts, and lamps with shades fringed with tassels. It didn’t seem old-fashioned as much as it seemed merely old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter checking in, I carried the key and my shopping bags to the worn-carpeted staircase. Tracie tried to follow. I stopped her at the base of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is where I draw the line,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—” Tracie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No buts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahh,” said Sharren. “Too bad, so sad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said it with a smile, yet it was obvious that the two women did not like each other. It was equally obvious that they were very much alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracie frowned. “Dinner? Say in an hour?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make it an hour and a half. I have calls to make.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracie was looking at Sharren when she said, “There’s a diner down the street.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We serve a very nice filet if you want real food,” Sharren said. “Perhaps you’d care for room service.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharren batted her long, fake eyelashes at me, but I assumed that was for Tracie’s benefit. The way I looked—seriously, not even an aging divorcée in Libbie, South Dakota, could be that hard up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is the diner?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Café Rossini,” Tracie said. “Out the door and to the left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll meet you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ninety minutes.” Tracie turned and left the hotel, but not before throwing Sharren a triumphant smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharren smirked back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-taking-of-libbie-sd-mac-mckenzie-7/page-14.html","bookId":2219,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:43 PM"}
