Who do you take us for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoral spoke at his side, matter-of-fact, professional. “Dr. Dunn, he is telling you the truth. We tested the blast zone ourselves, detecting Z-bozons and gluons, decay particles from an antimatter/matter interaction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha frowned, less sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know it sounds preposterous,” Painter said. “But if you’ll lower your gun, I’ll explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha steadied the pistol instead. “So far this is all that’s kept you talking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter sighed. It was worth the try. “Have it your way, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the gun pointed at his face, he gave a brief overview: of the Tunguska explosion in Russia in 1908, of the unique gamma radiation found both there and at the British Museum, of the plasma characteristics of the explosion, and how evidence hinted that somewhere out in the deserts of Oman lay a possible source of antimatter, preserved in some unknown fashion to make it stable and unreactive while in the presence of matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Though now it may be destabilizing,” Painter finished. “That may be why the meteor exploded at the museum. And it may happen here, too. Time is critical. Now may be the only time we can discover and preserve this source of unlimited power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara frowned. “And what does the United States government plan on doing with such a limitless source of power?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter read the suspicion in her eyes. “Safeguard it for now. That’s the immediate and primary goal. To protect it from those who would abuse it. If this power should fall into the wrong hands…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence lingered as his words died away. They all knew borders no longer divided the world so much as ideologies. Though it was undeclared, there was a new world war being waged, where fundamental decency and respect for human rights were under assault by forces of intolerance, despotism, and blind fervor. And while its battles were sometimes waged in plain sight—in New York City, in Iraq—its greater struggle was carried on invisibly, fought in secret, its heroes unknown, its villains hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilling or not, the group assembled here on the beach had been drafted into this war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara finally spoke. “And this other group. Safia’s kidnappers. They’re the same ones who broke into the British Museum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter nodded. “I believe so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are they?” Omaha still held the pistol at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know…not for sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bullshit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter held up a hand. “All I know for certain is who leads the team. A partner I once worked with, a mole planted in DARPA.” He was too exhausted to hide his anger. “Her name is Cassandra Sanchez. I never discovered who she worked for. A foreign power. Terrorists. A black-market group. All I know is that they are well funded, organized, and cold-blooded in their methods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha scoffed, “And you and your partner are the warm, fuzzy types.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t kill innocent people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you’re fucking worse!” he spat. “You let others do your dirty work. You knew we were walking into a possible shitstorm but kept your mouths closed. If we had known before now, we might’ve been better prepared. We might have stopped Safia’s abduction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter had no comeback. The man was right. He’d been caught off guard, jeopardizing the mission and their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistracted by his own guilt, he failed to respond in time. Omaha lunged and pressed the pistol’s barrel against his forehead, knocking him back a step. “You bastard…this is all your fault!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the pain and anguish in Omaha’s voice. The man was beyond reason. Anger built in Painter’s chest. He was cold, sore, and tired of having a gun waved in his face. He didn’t know if he’d have to take Omaha out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoral waited, tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupport came from an unlikely source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thunder of hooves suddenly broke across the beach. All eyes turned, even Omaha. He stepped back and finally lowered the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goddamn…” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the sand, an amazing sight galloped. A white stallion, mane flying, hooves casting up gouts of sand. It was the horse from the Shabab Oman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stallion raced toward them, perhaps drawn by their raised voices. It must have swum to shore after the explosion. It slammed to a stop a few yards from them, huffing white into the cool night air, heated. It tossed its head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe it got away,” Omaha said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Horses are excellent swimmers,” Kara scolded, but she couldn’t keep the awe from her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the Desert Phantoms slowly approached the horse, palm out, whispering in Arabic. It shivered but allowed the approach. Exhausted, frightened, needing reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden arrival of the horse cut the tension. Omaha stared down at his gun as if unsure how it had gotten into his fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara stepped forward and faced Painter. “I think it’s time we stopped arguing. Casting blame. We all had our reasons for coming out here. Hidden agendas.” She glanced back to Omaha, who would not meet her eye. Painter could guess the man’s agenda. It was plain from the way he’d been looking at Safia, his furious anger a moment ago. He was still in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From here,” Kara continued, “we must figure out what we’re going to do to save Safia. That’s the priority.” She turned to Painter. “What do we do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter nodded. His left eye ached with the motion. “The others think we’re dead. That gives us an advantage we’d best keep. We also know where they’re heading. We have to reach Salalah as quickly as possible. That means crossing almost three hundred miles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara stared toward the lights of the distant village. “If I could reach a phone, I’m sure I could get the sultan to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he cut her off. “No one must know we’re alive. Not even the Omani government. Any word, anywhere, that we’re still alive jeopardizes our thin advantage. Cassandra’s group managed to abduct Safia through their advantage of surprise. We can win her back the same way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But with the sultan’s help, Salalah could be locked down and searched.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cassandra’s group has already proven too damn resourceful. They’ve brought in significant manpower and weapons. That couldn’t have happened without resources in the government.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if we come out of hiding, word would reach the kidnappers,” Omaha mumbled. He had holstered the pistol in his waistband and rubbed his knuckles. His angry outburst seemed to have steadied the man. “The kidnappers would be gone before any action could be taken. We’d lose Safia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what do we do?” Kara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We find transportation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain al-Haffi stepped forward. Painter was unsure how the man would feel about deceiving his own government, keeping them in the dark, but then again, when out in the field, the Desert Phantoms acted with full independence. He nodded to Painter. “I’ll send one of my men over to the village. They won’t arouse suspicion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain must have read something in Painter’s face, some question about why he was so readily helping the team. “They killed one of my men. Kalil. He was my wife’s cousin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter nodded with sympathy. “May Allah carry him home.” He knew there was no stronger loyalty than that to the members of one’s own tribe and family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a half bow of thanks, Captain al-Haffi waved to the taller of his two men, a true giant of a man, named Barak. They spoke rapidly in Arabic. Barak nodded and began to step away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara stopped him. “How are you going to get a truck with no money?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarak answered her in English, “Allah helps those who help themselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to steal one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Borrow. It is tradition among our desert tribes. A man may borrow what he needs. Stealing is a crime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this little bit of wisdom, the man headed out toward the distant lights at a steady jog, disappearing into the night like a true phantom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Barak will not fail us,” Captain al-Haffi assured them. “He will find a vehicle large enough to carry all of us…and the horse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter glanced back along the rocky shore. The remaining Phantom, a taciturn young man named Sharif, led the stallion with a length of towline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why bring the horse?” Painter asked, concerned about the exposure of a large vehicle. “There’s good grazing here, and someone would find it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain al-Haffi answered, “We have little money. And the horse may be bartered, sold. Used as transportation if needed. It is also a cover for us to be traveling to Salalah. The horse farms there are well known. It will lessen suspicion if we bring the stallion along on our journey. And besides, white is good luck.” This last was said with deadly seriousness. Luck among the folks of Arabia was as important as a roof over one’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made a brief camp. While Omaha and Painter beached the launch behind some rocks to hide it, the others built a fire out of drift-wood, sheltering it within the lee of a tumbled section of cliff. Hidden, the tiny pyre would be hard to spot, and they all needed its warmth and light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty minutes later, the grinding of gears announced the arrival of their transportation. Headlights rounded a bend in the coastal road. A flatbed truck rolled up. It was an old International 4900, painted yellow, scarred with rust. Its bed was framed in wooden fencing with a drop gate behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarak hopped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see you found something to borrow,” Kara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey put out the fire. Barak had also managed to borrow some clothes: robes and cloaks. They quickly dressed, concealing their Western wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce ready, Captain al-Haffi and his men took the truck’s cab, in case they were stopped. The others clambered into the back. It took blind-folding the horse to get it to walk up the drop gate into the flatbed. They tied the Arabian near the front cab. Then Painter and the others huddled near the back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sandstorm-sigma-force-1/page-40.html","bookId":1530,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM"}
