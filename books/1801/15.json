I\u0027ll see you at the ball.\" \"Luck to you, Etion, and thank you very much for your gracious proposal. I give you my word I will\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do that, Sariana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana turned away with a last smile and found herself doing exactly as Etion had asked. She thought about his businesslike, practical and eminently rational proposal for a marriage alliance. He was right, she knew. If she was fated to be stranded in this strange land for the rest of her life, Etion would make a most suitable marriage partner for her. They had a great deal in common - including their exile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely enough, she found herself more disturbed by Rakken\u0027s proposal than she ought to have been. Not because accepting it would mean giving up on her dreams to go home, but precisely because it had been such a businesslike, practical and reasonable offer of marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was ridiculous, but she found herself wishing there had been a little more emotion attached to Etion\u0027s offer. She would like to have felt he wanted her for more personal reasons man because they had business interests in common.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana sighed. She had definitely been living in Serendipity too long if she was starting to think along such lines. Every young woman of a high ranking eastern clan in any social class knew that marriage was not a matter of emotion. It was first and foremost a business arrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Sariana administered the brisk little lecture to herself the bright morning sky suddenly clouded over. Lightning flared and thunder rolled. The warm summer shower caught her three blocks from the Avylyns\u0027 front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana shook her head philosophically as the rain drenched her hair and clothing. The shower was typical of life in Serendipity. Unpredictable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph Chassyn closed the door of his new sleeping chamber and started down the long hall that led toward the central hub of the Avylyns\u0027 villa. His new quarters were definitely a cut above his old ones which were located in a far less affluent part of town. He decided the fringe benefits of this new job were going to be pleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered what Lady Sariana Dayne would say when she found out he had just been assigned a suite near her own apartments. Gryph had a hunch she would not be pleased. Lucky for him Lord and Lady Avylyn were far more intimidated by a Shield than they were of their business manager. That morning Gryph had asked for the rooms and he had gotten them, no questions asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emerged from the long wing into the central hall of the villa just as a young blond-haired boy came racing into the hall from the workshop wing. Gryph didn\u0027t need to see the boy\u0027s dark eyes to know he was about to meet the Avylyns\u0027 youngest son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri Avylyn was clutching a small cage of elaborately designed gold wire as he dashed across the wide, circular hall. His attention was focused on the small creature inside the cage and he almost collided with Gryph. Less than a meter away he came to an abrupt halt and automatically began a proper, if hasty, apology without looking up. He was too obviously fascinated by the contents of the cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your pardon, sir, I was on my way into the guest wing. I didn\u0027t see you.\" \"No harm done,\" Gryph said easily. \"What have you got in the cage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri raised his head excitedly. \"It\u0027s a present for Lady Sariana. Do you know her?\" Then his dark Avylyn eyes grew very wide as he realized who was standing in front of him. \"You\u0027re the Shield, aren\u0027t you? Bryer said one had been hired to protect the jewelry that will be on display the night of the ball. I\u0027m Luri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph nodded and crouched down in front of the boy to examine the cage. \"The luck of the day to you, Luri. You say this is to be a present for Sariana? It\u0027s a scarlet-toe, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. Do you think she\u0027ll like it? It took me days and days to catch one. I finally found this one in the gardens down by the river.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri held out the gold filigree cage. The small, brilliant red lizard inside bunked its scarlet eyes at Gryph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a very handsome scarlet-toe,\" Gryph said as he admired the lizard. \"Uh, do you happen to know whether or not Sariana likes lizards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri shook his head impatiently. \"She\u0027s never had one. In fact, I don\u0027t think she\u0027s ever had any pets. The people of the eastern provinces are quite strange, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve heard.\" Gryph grinned at the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri automatically responded with a wide smile and then curiosity got the better of him. \"Are you really a Shield?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a Shield in the same way that you are a Jeweler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri\u0027s chin lifted slightly with pride. \"My specialty is going to be gemology. When I\u0027m grown up I will be in charge of buying the uncut stones our craftsmen use in their work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a good profession,\" Gryph said seriously. \"Bryer\u0027s an expert in fine metals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph nodded as he studied the scarlet lizard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri shifted from one foot to the other, still clutching the cage carefully. His eyes darted-down to the weapon kit attached to Gryph\u0027s belt. Then he drew a deep breath and blurted out his next question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true that no one can open a Shield\u0027s weapon kit except the Shield himself?\" Gryph glanced up and saw the breathless fascination in the boy\u0027s eyes. \"That\u0027s not quite true,\" he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexplained quietly. \"There is one other person who can open a Shield\u0027s kit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri\u0027s dark eyes grew wider. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Shield\u0027s lady can open the kit. She is the only other person on the face of the planet who can unseal the prisma lock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a lady?\" Luri demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph shook his head. \"Not yet.\" \"Are you going to get one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If my luck holds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri chewed on his lower lip. \"Are you sure you couldn\u0027t teach me how to open the kit?\" Gryph laughed and rose to his feet. He ruffled the boy\u0027s bright blond hair with a friendly hand. \"I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafraid not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you can\u0027t teach me or anyone else how to do it, how will you teach a wife?\" \"Every social class has its secrets, Luri. You know that. The way we teach our wives to open our\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweapon kits is a Shield secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuri nodded seriously, well aware of the inviolable laws that protected such secrets. He sought for a way around the problem. \"Can you show me what\u0027s inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Gryph said thoughtfully. \"Maybe I will do that one of these days when the time is right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does the time have to be right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just does. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Luri considered his words and then decided to try another angle. \"If you won\u0027t show me what\u0027s inside the weapon kit will you at least tell me some good tales of bandit fighting?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-15.html","bookId":1801,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM"}
