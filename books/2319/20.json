Just couldn\u0027t get it out of our heads, there wasn\u0027t a day one of us didn\u0027t bring it up. So eventually we went to this Ruddle and asked him if he\u0027d take a polygraph test. You know what that is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lie detector?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lie detector. We were completely straight with him, we told him he could refuse to take the test, and we also told him it couldn\u0027t be entered in evidence against him, which it can\u0027t. I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s a good idea, incidentally, but that\u0027s the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He agreed to take the test. Don\u0027t ask me why. Maybe he thought it would look suspicious of him to refuse, although he must have known we damn well knew he killed her and nothing was going to make him stop looking suspicious to us. Or maybe he honestly thought he could beat the machine. Well, he took the test, and I made sure we had the best operator available to administer the test, and the results were just what we expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was guilty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No question about it. It nailed him to the wall, but there was nothing we could do with it. I told him the machine said he was lying. \u0027Well, those machines must make a few mistakes now and then,\u0027 he said, \u0027because it made one right now.\u0027 And he looked me right in the eye, and he knew I didn\u0027t believe him, and he knew there was nothing on earth I could do about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went over and sat down next to her again. I sipped some of my drink and closed my eyes for a moment, remembering the look in that bastard\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My partner and I tossed it back and forth. My partner wanted to put him in the river.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill him and set him in cement and drop him somewhere in the Hudson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t do a thing like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I might have gone along with it. See, he did it, he killed that girl, and he was an odds-on candidate to do it again sooner or later. Oh, hell, that wasn\u0027t all of it. Knowing he did it, knowing he knew we knew he did it, and sending the bastard home. Putting him in the river started sounding like a hell of a good idea, and I might have done it if I hadn\u0027t thought of something better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had this friend on the narcotics squad. I told him I needed some heroin, a lot of it, and I told him he would be getting every bit of it back. Then one afternoon when Ruddle and his wife were both out of the apartment I let myself in, and I flaked that place as well as it\u0027s ever been done. I stuffed smack inside the towel bar, I stuck a can of it in the ball float of his toilet, I put the shit in every really obvious hiding place I could find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I got back to my friend in narcotics, and I told him I knew where he could make himself a hell of a haul. And he did it right, with a warrant and everything, and Ruddle was upstate in Dannemora before he knew what hit him.\" I smiled suddenly. \"I went to see him between the trial and the sentencing date. His whole defense was that he had no idea how that heroin got there, and not too surprisingly the jury didn\u0027t sit up all night worrying about that one. I went to see him and I said, \u0027You know, Ruddle, it\u0027s a shame you couldn\u0027t take a lie-detector test. It might make people believe you didn\u0027t know where that smack came from.\u0027 And he just looked at me because he knew just how it had been done to him and for a change there was nothing he could do about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He drew ten-to-twenty for possession with intent to sell. About three years into his sentence he got in a grudge fight with another inmate and got stabbed to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing is, you wonder just how far you have a right to turn things around like that. Did we have a right to set him up? I couldn\u0027t see letting him walk around free, and what other way was there to nail him? But if we couldn\u0027t do that, did we have a right to put him in the river? That\u0027s a harder one for me to answer. I have a lot of trouble with that one. There must be a line there somewhere, and it\u0027s hard to know just where to draw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA LITTLE while later she said it was getting to be her bedtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you\u0027d rather stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turned out to be good for each other. For a stitch of time all the hard questions went away and hid in dark places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward she said that I should stay. \"I\u0027ll make us breakfast in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, sleepily, \"Matt? That story you were telling before. About Ruddle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What made you think of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sort of wanted to tell her, probably for the same reason I\u0027d told her the story in the first place. But part of what I had to do was not tell her, just as I had avoided telling Cale Hanniford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just the similarities in the cases,\" I said. \"Just that it was another case of a girl raped and murdered in the Village, and the one case put me in mind of the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe murmured something I couldn\u0027t catch. When I was sure she was sleeping soundly, I slipped out of bed and got into my clothes. I walked the couple of blocks to my hotel and went to my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I would have trouble sleeping, but it came easier than I expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe service had just gotten under way when I arrived. I slipped into a rear pew, took a small black book from the rack, and found the place. I\u0027d missed the invocation and the first hymn, but I was in time for the reading of the Law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed taller than I remembered. Perhaps the pulpit added an impression of height. His voice was rich and commanding, and he spoke the Law with absolute certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me, and keep My commandments…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was not crowded. There were perhaps eighty persons present, most of them my age or older, with only a few family groups with children. The church could have accommodated four or five times the number in attendance. I guessed most of the congregation had made the pilgrimage to the suburbs in the past twenty years, their places taken by Irish and Italians whose former neighborhoods were now black and Puerto Rican.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere there more people in attendance today than normally? Their minister had experienced great personal tragedy. He had not conducted the service the preceding Sunday. This would be their first official glimpse of him since the murder and suicide. Would curiosity bring more of them out? Or would restraint and embarrassment-and the cold air of morning-keep many at home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thou shalt not kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnequivocal statements, these commandments. They brooked no argument. Not Thou shalt not kill except in special circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thou shalt not commit adultery… Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed at a pulse point in my temple. Could he see me? I remembered his thick glasses and decided he could not. And I was far in the back, and off to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear also what our Lord Jesus Christ saith: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood up and sang a psalm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE service took a little over an hour. The Old Testament reading was from Isaiah, the New Testament reading from Mark. There was another hymn, a prayer, still another hymn. The offering was taken and consecrated. I put a five on the plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sermon, as promised, dealt with the proposition that the road to Hell was paved with good intentions. It was not enough for us to act with the best and most righteous goals in mind, Martin Vanderpoel told us, because the highest purpose could be betrayed if it were advanced by actions which were not good and righteous in and of themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t pay too much attention to how he elaborated on this because my mind got caught up in the central thesis of the argument and played with it. I wondered whether it was worse for men to do the wrong things for the right reason or the right things for the wrong reason. It wasn\u0027t the first time I wondered, or the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we were standing, and his arms were spread, his robed draping like the wings of an enormous bird, his voice vibrant and resonant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of God, and of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and the blessing of God Almighty, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, be amongst you, and remain with you always. Amen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few people slipped out of the church without stopping for a few words with Reverend Vanderpoel. The rest lined up for a handshake. I managed to be at the end of the line. When it was finally my turn Vanderpoel blinked at me. He knew my face was familiar, but he couldn\u0027t figure out why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said, \"Why, it\u0027s Mr. Scudder! I certainly never expected to see you at our services.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was enjoyable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m pleased to hear you say that. I hardly anticipated seeing you again, and I didn\u0027t dream of hoping that our incidental meeting might lead you to search for the presence of God.\" He looked past my shoulder, a half-smile on his lips. \"He does work in mysterious ways, does He not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it seems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That a particular tragedy could have this effect upon a person like yourself. I imagine I might find myself using that as a theme for a sermon at some later date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to talk to you, Reverend Vanderpoel. In private, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, dear,\" he said. \"I\u0027m quite pressed for time today, I\u0027m afraid. I\u0027m sure you have a great many questions about religion, one is always filled with questions that seem to have a great need for immediate answers, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk about religion, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about your son and Wendy Hanniford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already told you all that I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I have to tell you some things, sir. And we\u0027d better have that conversation now, and it really will have to be private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" He looked at me intently, and I watched the play of emotions on his face. \"Very well,\" he said. \"I do have a few tasks that need to be attended to. I\u0027ll just be a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited, and he wasn\u0027t more than ten minutes. Then he took me companionably by the arm and led me through the back of the church and through a door into the rectory. We wound up in the room we had been in before. The electric fire glowed on the hearth, and again he stood in front of it and warmed his long-fingered hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like a cup of coffee after morning services,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll join me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sins-of-the-fathers-matthew-scudder-1/page-20.html","bookId":2319,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM"}
