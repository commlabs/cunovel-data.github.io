In these family clans there were some ancient texts that vaguely described the world of the Sky Spill Continent from 100,000 years ago. By combining this information together, one could speculate a number of things.

When Lin Ming was in the 90 mile range of the Thunder Dominion this was the appearance that the top grade heaven-step Thunder Soul had taken! Before crossing Life Destruction, Lin Ming was only able to rely on the Heretical God Sprout to suppress that Thunder Soul; it was itself difficult to control.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow that Lin Ming’s entire body was tempered by the power of thunder and he was reborn, it wasn’t difficult for him to control and galvanize the top grade heaven-step Thunder Soul.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming evenly lifted the long spear in his hands.

He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out blood essence. This was the source blood essence of the Ancient Profound Hawk Clan. Blood essence quickly burnt up in the air. Soon after, over 20% of the Blood Drinking Seals on Situ Luosha’s black wings disintegrated. His entire body shined with a blood light and the faint cry of a hawk seemed to emerge from his body.
