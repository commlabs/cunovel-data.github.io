The difficulties, for both doctor and patient, of adjusting to this new machine were recognized by everyone.

Ten scenarios drawn up by Hudson Institute; subjects required-- to make YES/NO decision in each case.

He began the formal briefing, talking rapidly, pacing up and down the room, hands moving constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"As you know,\" he said, \"we are on the top level of a five-story underground structure. According to protocol it will take us nearly twenty-four hours to descend through the sterilization and decontamination procedures to the lowest level. Therefore we must begin immediately. The capsule is already on its way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He pressed a button on a console at the head of the table, and a television screen glowed to life, showing the coneshaped satellite in a plastic bag, making its descent. It was being cradled by mechanical hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"The central core of this circular building,\" Stone said, \"contains elevators and service units-- plumbing, wiring, that sort of thing. That is where you see the capsule now. It will be deposited shortly in a maximum-sterilization assembly on the lowest level.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He went on to explain that he had brought back two other surprises from Piedmont. The screen shifted to show Peter Jackson, lying on a litter, with intravenous lines running into both arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"This man apparently survived the night. He was the one walking around when the planes flew over, and he was still alive this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"What\u0027s his status now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Uncertain,\" Stone said. \"He is unconscious, and he was vomiting blood earlier today.

It was howling, strapped down to a tiny bed. An intravenous bottle was running into a vein in the scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"This little fellow also survived last night,\" Stone said. \"So we brought him along. We couldn\u0027t really leave him, since a Directive 7-12 was being called. The town is now destroyed by a nuclear blast. Besides, he and Jackson are living clues which may help us unravel this mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Then, for the benefit of Hall and Leavitt, the two men disclosed what they had seen and learned at Piedmont. They reviewed the findings of rapid death, the bizarre suicides, the clotted arteries and the lack of bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Hall listened in astonishment. Leavitt sat shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;When they were through, Stone said, \"Questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"None that won\u0027t keep,\" Leavitt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Then let\u0027s get started,\" Stone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They began at a door, which said in plain white letters: TO LEVEL II It was an innocuous, straightforward, almost mundane sign. Hall had expected something more-- perhaps a stern guard with a machine gun, or a sentry to check passes. But there was nothing, and he noticed that no one had badges, or clearance cards of any kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He mentioned this to Stone. \"Yes,\" Stone said. \"We decided against badges early on. They are easily contaminated and difficult to sterilize; usually they are plastic and high-heat sterilization melts them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The four men passed through the door, which clanged shut heavily and sealed with a hissing sound. It was airtight. Hall faced a tiled room, empty except for a hamper marked I \u0027clothing.\" He unzipped his jumpsuit and dropped it into the hamper; there was a brief flash of light as it was incinerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Then, looking back, he saw that on the door through which he had come was a sign: \"Return to Level I is NOT Possible Through this Access.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He shrugged. The other men were already moving through the second door, marked simply EXIT. He followed them and stepped into clouds of steam. The odor was peculiar, a faint woodsy smell that he guessed was scented disinfectant. He sat down on a bench and relaxed, allowing the steam to envelop him. It was easy enough to understand the purpose of the steam room: the heat opened the pores, and the steam would be inhaled into the lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The four men waited, saying little, until their bodies were coated with a sheen of moisture, and then walked into the next room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Leavitt said to Hall, \"What do you think of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"It\u0027s like a goddam Roman bath,\" Hall said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The next room contained a shallow tub (\"Immerse Feet ONLY\") and a shower. (\"Do not swallow shower solution. Avoid undue exposure to eyes and mucous membranes.\") It was all very intimidating. He tried to guess what the solutions were by smell, but failed; the shower was slippery, though, which meant it was alkaline. He asked Leavitt about this, and Leavitt said the solution was alpha chlorophin at pH 7.7. Leavitt said that whenever possible, acidic and alkaline solutions were alternated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"When you think about it,\" Leavitt said, \"we\u0027ve faced up to quite a planning problem here. How to disinfect the human body-- one of the dirtiest things in the known universe-- without killing the person at the same time. Interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He wandered off. Dripping wet from the shower, Hall looked around for a towel but found none. He entered the next room and blowers turned on from the ceiling in a rush of hot air. From the sides of the room, UV lights clicked on, bathing the room in an intense purple light. He stood there until a buzzer sounded, and the dryers turned off. His skin tingled slightly as he entered the last room, which contained clothing. They were not jumpsuits, but rather like surgical uniforms-- light-yellow, a loose-fitting top with a V-neck and short sleeves; elastic banded pants; low rubber-soled shoes, quite comfortable, like ballet slippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The cloth was soft, some kind of synthetic. He dressed and stepped with the others through a door marked EXIT TO LEVEL II. He entered the elevator and waited as it descended. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-andromeda-strain/page-10.html","bookId":1577,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:08 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:08 AM"}
