It worked. I laughed for the first time in what felt like a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter our fight the summer before senior year, I really thought that Taylor and I would make up fast, the way we always did. I thought it would blow over in a week, tops. Because what were we really even mad about? Sure, we both said some hurtful things—I called her a child, she called me a crappy best friend, but it wasn’t like we’d never had a fight before. Best friends fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got home from Cousins, I put Taylor’s shoes and her clothes in a bag, ready to take them over to her house as soon as she gave me the signal that we were done being mad at each other. It was always Taylor who gave the signal, the one who initiated making up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited, but it didn’t come. I went to Marcy’s a couple of times, hoping I’d run into her and we’d be forced to talk things out. Those times I was at Marcy’s, she never came. Weeks passed. The summer was almost over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah kept saying the same thing he’d been saying for all of July and most of August. “Don’t worry, you guys will make up. You guys always make up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t get it, this isn’t like before.” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She wouldn’t even look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of this over a party,” he said, which pissed me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not over a party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, I know—hold on a sec, Bells.” I heard him talking to someone, and then he came back on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our hot wings just got here. Want me to call you back after I eat? I can be quick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that’s all right,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be mad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “I’m not,” and I wasn’t. Not really. How could he understand what was going on with me and Taylor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a guy. He didn’t get it. He didn’t get how important, how really and truly vital, it was to me that Taylor and I start off our last year of high school together by each other’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why couldn’t I just call her, then? It was partly pride and partly something else. I was the one who had been pulling away from her this whole time, she was the one who had been holding on. Maybe I thought I was growing past her, maybe it was all for the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’d have to say good-bye next fall, maybe it would be easier this way. Maybe we’d been codependent, maybe we’ll always have summer · 51\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore me on her than the other way around, and now I needed to stand on my own feet. This is what I told myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I told this to Jeremiah the next night, he said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just call her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pretty sure he was just sick of hearing me talk about it, so I said, “Maybe. I’ll think about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe week before school started, the week I usually came back from Cousins, we always went back-to-school shopping together. Always. We’d been doing it since elemen-tary school. She always knew the right kind of jeans to get. We’d go to Bath \u0026amp; Body Works and get those “Buy Three, Get One Free” kind of deals, and then we’d come home and split everything up so we each had a lotion, a body gel, a scrub. We’d be set until Christmas, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat year, I went with my mom. My mom hated shopping. We were waiting in line to pay for jeans when Taylor and her mom walked into the store carrying a couple of shopping bags each. “Luce!” my mom called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Jewel waved and came right over, with Taylor trailing behind her wearing sunglasses and cutoff shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom hugged Taylor, and Mrs. Jewel hugged me and said, “It’s been a long time, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my mom, she said, “Laurel, can you believe our little girls are all grown up now? My gosh, I remember 52 · jenny han\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen they insisted on doing everything together. Baths, haircuts, everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember,” my mother said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught Taylor’s eye. Our moms kept on talking, and we just stood there looking at each other but not really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a minute, Taylor pulled out her cell phone. I didn’t want to let this moment pass without saying something to her. I asked, “Did you get anything good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. Since she was wearing sunglasses, it was hard to tell what she was thinking. But I knew Taylor well. She loved to brag about her bargains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor hesitated and then said, “I got some hot boots for twenty-five percent off. And a couple of sundresses that I can winterize with tights and sweaters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Then it was our turn to pay, and I said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, see you at school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you,” she said, turning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout thinking, I handed the jeans to my mom and stopped Taylor. It could be the last time we ever talked to each other if I didn’t say something. “Wait,” I said. “Do you want to come over tonight? I bought a new skirt, but I don’t know if I should tuck shirts into it or what …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pursed her lips for a second and then said, “Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor did come over that night. She showed me how to wear the skirt—which shoes looked best with it and which tops. Things weren’t the same with us, not right we’ll always have summer · 53\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway, and maybe not ever. We were growing up. We were still figuring out how to be in each other’s lives without being everything to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truly ironic thing is that we ended up at the same school. Of all the schools in all the world, we ended up at each other’s. It was fated. We were meant to be friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were meant to be in each other’s lives, and you know what? I welcomed it. We weren’t together all the time like we used to be—she had her sorority friends, I had my friends from my hall. But we had each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, I couldn’t hold out any longer. I called Jeremiah. I told him I needed to see him, that he should come over, and my voice shook as I said it. Over the phone, I could hear how grateful he was, how eager to make amends. I tried to justify calling him so fast by telling myself that I needed to see him face-to-face in order to move on. The truth was, I missed him. I, probably just as much as he did, wanted to figure out a way to forget what he had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as much as I’d missed him, when I opened my door and saw his face again, all the hurt came rushing back, hard and fast. Jeremiah could see it too. At first he looked hopeful, and then he just looked devastated. When he tried to pull me to him, I wanted to hug him, but I couldn’t let myself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-10.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
