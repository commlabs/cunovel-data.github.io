{"id":68506,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\u003cp\u003eAtanas Stavich was feeling terribly aroused. Taking care of a contract always did that to him. He made it a rule to have sex with his victims, male or female, before he killed them, and he always found it exciting. Now he was frustrated because there had been no time to torture Catherine or to make love to her. Atanas looked at his watch. It was still early. His plane didn\u0027t leave until eleven o\u0027clock that evening. He took a taxi to Shepherd Market, paid the driver, and wandered into the labyrinth of streets. There were half a dozen girls standing on street corners calling out to the men passing by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, love, would you like a French lesson tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a little party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you interested in Greek?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of the women approached Atanas. He walked up to a tall blonde wearing a brief leather skirt and blouse and stiletto-heeled shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening,\" Atanas said politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at him, amused. \"Hello, little boy. Does your mother know you\u0027re out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtanas smiled shyly. \"Yes, ma\u0027am. I thought if you weren\u0027t busy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prostitute laughed. \"Did you, now? And what would you do if I wasn\u0027t busy? Have you ever made love to a girl before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once,\" Atanas said softly. \"I liked it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the size of a minnow,\" the girl laughed. \"I usually throw the little ones back, but it\u0027s a slow night. Have you got ten bob?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, love. Let\u0027s go upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led Atanas through a doorway, and up two flights of stairs to a small one-room apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtanas handed her the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let\u0027s see if you know what to do with it, love.\" She stripped off her clothes and watched Atanas undress. She looked at him in astonishment. \"My God! You\u0027re enormous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got into bed and said, \"Be careful. Don\u0027t hurt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtanas moved toward the bed. Ordinarily, he enjoyed beating up whores. It increased his sexual satisfaction. But he knew that this was no time to do anything suspicious or to leave a trail that the police might want to follow. So Atanas smiled down at her and said, \"This is your lucky night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\" He climbed on top of her and closed his eyes and plunged into her, hurting her, and it was Catherine screaming for mercy, begging him to stop. And he pounded her savagely, harder and harder, her screams exciting him until finally everything exploded and he sank back satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God,\" the woman said. \"You\u0027re unbelievable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtanas opened his eyes and he wasn\u0027t with Catherine. He was with some ugly whore in a dreary room. He got dressed and took a taxi to his hotel room, where he packed and checked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he headed for the airport, it was nine-thirty. He had plenty of time to catch his plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small line at Olympic Airways. When Atanas reached the head of the line, he handed the clerk his ticket. \"Is the flight on time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" The clerk looked at the name on the ticket, Atanas Stavich. He looked up at Atanas again, then glanced at a man standing nearby and nodded. The man walked over to the ticket counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I see your ticket?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtanas handed him the ticket. \"Is anything wrong?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man said, \"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ve overbooked this flight. If you\u0027d like to come into the office, I\u0027ll try to straighten everything out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtanas shrugged. \"All right.\" He followed the man toward the office, filled with a feeling of euphoria. Demiris was probably out of jail by now. He was too important a man for the law to touch him. Everything had gone perfectly. He would take the fifty thousand dollars and put it into one of his Swiss numbered accounts. Then a little vacation. The Riviera perhaps, or Rio. He liked the male prostitutes in Rio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtanas walked into the office and stopped, staring. He turned pale. \"You\u0027re dead! You\u0027re dead! I killed you!\" It was a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtanas was still screaming when they led him out of the room and into a police van. They watched him leave, and Alan Hamilton turned to Catherine. \"It\u0027s over now, darling. It\u0027s finally over.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-32.html","bookId":2362,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM"}
