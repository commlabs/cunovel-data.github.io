She is a werewolf who feels nothing but disgust for the bloodlust and violent tendencies inside her. Nick Franklin is the man she met and fell in love with in college, and the man whose touch first awakened her beast. When she realized that her lust for him inspired the wolf inside her, she ran as far and as fast as she could. To defeat her furry side, she has spent the last five years in a secret location in Montana, trying to find a cure for lycanthropy. Just as she feels she\u0027s at the edge of a breakthrough, her research is interrupted. Nick is now an FBI agent--and he\u0027s standing in her lab. Minutes after they leave the building, it explodes, destroying all of Elise\u0027s research and the serum she needs to fight her bloodlust. Together, Nick and Elise must race to find a cure for before the next full moon rises. Dark Moon is full of dry wit, steamy chemistry, and truly scary villians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3.jpg","author":"Lori Handeland","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:22 PM"}
