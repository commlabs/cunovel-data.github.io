Dog crap, so when you stomp out the fire you\u0027re stepping in it. The kid skipped that part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pictures don\u0027t show what he\u0027s doing,\" he said, \"because with the lens I was right in tight on his face. But I have to laugh when I look at them, because his expression brings it all back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he looked sort of beleaguered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said, \"that\u0027s why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCleveland\u0027s airport is south and west of the city. Lakewood is situated on the lake, appropriately enough, and a little ways to the west of Cleveland, so we could get there without running into city traffic. Jason drove and kept up his end of the conversation, and I found myself comparing him with TJ. Jason was probably a year or two older, and looked on the surface to have had an easier time of it, blessed as he was with a white face and a middie-class upbringing. He\u0027d had a good deal more in the way of formal education, although you could argue that TJ\u0027s street sense was as valuable, with a tuition every bit as pricey. By the time we got to Lakewood I\u0027d decided that the two of them weren\u0027t as different as they seemed. They were both decent kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLakewood turned out to be an older suburb, with big trees and prewar houses. Here and there you\u0027d see a lot that the builders had originally passed up, with a little ranch house perched on it looking like the new kid on the block. We parked across the street from one of these and Jason killed the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t see where the fire was,\" he said. \"When I drove off he was going at it with a broom. I guess he did a pretty good job of cleaning up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have hired that same kid to scrub it for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be something, wouldn\u0027t it? I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s home. With the garage door shut you can\u0027t tell if his car\u0027s there or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have to set any fires to find out,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll just ring his doorbell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to come with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered it. \"No,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll wait here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d appreciate that,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ll be. It may be a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve still got that jar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only had to ring the bell once. The eight-note chimes were still echoing when I heard his footsteps approaching. Then he opened the door a crack and saw me, and then he opened it the rest of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photos were a good likeness. He was a small and slender man, with some age showing in his pink face and some gray lightening his neatly combed hair. Close up, I could see his watery blue eyes behind his bifocal lenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wearing dark gabardine slacks and a plaid sportshirt. There were several pens in the breast pocket of the shirt. His shoes were brown oxfords, recently polished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no fire raging on his stoop this time, just another middle-aged guy. But Havemeyer still sported his beleaguered expression, as if the world was just a little bit more than he could cope with. I knew the feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Mr. Havemeyer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I come in? I\u0027d like to talk with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a policeman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s often a temptation to say yes to that question, or to leave it artfully unanswered. This time, though, I didn\u0027t feel the need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"My name is Scudder, Mr. Havemeyer. I\u0027m a private investigator from New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did Iâ€¦\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you fly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said, and his shoulders drooped. \"I guess you\u0027d better come in, hadn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d have thought it was a social call. He led me to the front parlor, recommended a chair, and announced that he could do with a cup of tea. Would I have one? I said I would, and not just to be sociable. It sounded like a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed there while he fussed in the kitchen, and it struck me that he might return brandishing a butcher knife, or holding the same gun he\u0027d used to kill Byron Leopold. If he did, I wouldn\u0027t stand a chance. I wasn\u0027t wearing body armor, and the closest thing I had to a weapon was the nail clipper on my key ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, though, I knew I wasn\u0027t in any danger. There was a greater risk that he\u0027d seize the opportunity to turn the knife or gun on himself, and I figured he had the right. But he didn\u0027t strike me as suicidal, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came out carrying a silver-handled walnut tray bearing a china teapot flanked by a sugar bowl and a little milk pitcher. There were spoons and cups and saucers as well, and he set everything out on the coffee table. I drank my tea black, while he added milk and sugar to his. The tea was Lapsang souchong. I can\u0027t ordinarily tell one kind of tea from another, but I recognized its smoky bouquet before I\u0027d even taken a sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing like a cup of tea,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d brought a pocket tape recorder along, and I took it out and set it on the table. \"I\u0027d like to record this,\" I said. \"If it\u0027s all right with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it\u0027s all right,\" he said. \"Really, what difference does it make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI switched on the recorder. \"This is a conversation between Matthew Scudder and William Havemeyer,\" I stated, and mentioned the date and time. Then I sat back and gave him a chance to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you know everything,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know most of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d come. Well, not you, not specifically. But someone. I don\u0027t know what made me think I could get away with it.\" He raised his eyes to mine. \"I must have been crazy,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did it happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That boat,\" he said. \"That awful, awful boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ferry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Magnar Syversen. They had no business keeping the damnable boat in service, you know. It was manifestly unsafe. You wouldn\u0027t believe how many violations they uncovered. And do you know how many people were needlessly killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eighty-four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And John Wilbur Settle was one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you held a policy on his life,\" I said. \"You\u0027d bought it through a broker in Texas who specializes in viatical transactions. You\u0027d already been a party to one such transaction, involving a man named Phillips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harlan Phillips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made money on Phillips,\" I said, \"and invested it in Settle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These were good investments,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for all concerned. For the poor men who were horribly ill and had no money, and for those of us seeking a safe investment with a generous return. I\u0027m sorry, you told me your name but I don\u0027t remember it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matthew Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course. Mr. Scudder, I\u0027m a widower. My wife had multiple sclerosis, she was ill for most of the years of our marriage and died almost seven years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must have been hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was, I suppose. You get used to it, just as you get used to being alone. I worked for over twenty years for the same corporation. Five years ago they offered me early retirement. \u0027You\u0027ve been such a good and faithful employee for so many years that we\u0027ll pay you to quit.\u0027 They didn\u0027t use those words, obviously, but that\u0027s what it amounted to. I accepted their offer. I didn\u0027t really have much of a choice in the matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that gave you money to invest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It gave me money that I had to invest if I was going to have sufficient income to see me through. Savings bank interest wouldn\u0027t be enough, and I\u0027ve never been comfortable with risk. You flew here, didn\u0027t you? I\u0027ve never flown anywhere in my life. I\u0027ve always been afraid to fly. Isn\u0027t that ridiculous? I shot a man dead in the street, I murdered him in cold blood without turning a hair, but I\u0027m afraid to get on an airplane. Did you ever hear anything so ridiculous in your life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to glance at the tape recorder. I just hoped it was getting all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"When the boat sankâ€¦\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Magnar Syversen. A floating death trap. You\u0027d expect better than that from the Scandinavians, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it was an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that was relevant, wasn\u0027t it? The policy you held on the life of John Wilbur Settle was for fifty thousand dollars, and if he\u0027d stayed home and died of AIDS that\u0027s what you would have received in the course of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But because his death was the result of an accidentâ€¦\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got twice that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hundred thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the policy had a double-indemnity clause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which I didn\u0027t even know about,\" he said. \"I had no idea whatsoever. When the insurance company check arrived I thought they\u0027d made a mistake. I actually called them up, because I was sure that if I didn\u0027t they\u0027d come around wanting the money back with interest. And they told me about double indemnity, and how I was getting twice the face amount of the policy because of the way Mr. Settle died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite a windfall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027d paid thirty-eight thousand dollars for the policy, so I was already getting a very good return on my investment, but this was just remarkable. I had very nearly tripled my investment. I\u0027d turned thirty-eight thousand dollars into a hundred thousand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you entered into another viatical transaction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I believed in it as an investment medium, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can understand why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I put some of the proceeds in the bank and the rest in a viatical transaction. I bought a larger policy this time, seventy-five thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you first make sure there was a double-indemnity clause?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! No, I swear I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never asked. But when I received the policy-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Just, you know, to see if there was such a clause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And as it happened there was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the silence stretch, drank some more of my tea. The red light glowed on the side of my little tape recorder. The tape advanced, recording the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some commentators have been very critical of viatical transactions. Not as an investment, everyone agrees that they\u0027re a good investment, but the idea of waiting for a person to die so that you can benefit financially. There was a cartoon I saw, a man walking in the desert and vultures circling overhead. But it\u0027s not like that at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it different?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you just don\u0027t think about the person that much. If you think of him at all you wish him well. I\u0027d certainly rather have a man enjoy one more month of life than that my investment mature one month sooner. After all, I know he\u0027s not going to live forever, that much is a medical fact, and both my principal and the interest on it are guaranteed by the irreversible biological progress of his condition. With both Harlan Phillips and John Settle, why, I knew they were going to die, and within a fairly certain period of time. But I didn\u0027t dwell on it, and I didn\u0027t wish it sooner.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-39.html","bookId":2331,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:03 AM"}
