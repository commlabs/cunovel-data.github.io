Is that how you managed to get along, assuming you got along in the first place?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan grimaced. ‘Can’t say we did, much. Got along, I mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What might she be holding inside?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I wish I knew.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben’s growing agitation was evident in his waving hands, his sudden pacing, the sharp, wide-eyed looks he threw at Paran. ‘I thought you two had this planned !’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Had what planned?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re the Master of the Deck of Dragons!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So I am. Why, you want to play?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment it seemed Quick Ben’s eyes would burst from their sockets. And then, with sudden hope: ‘A reading! Yes – that’s it! I’d take a damned reading right now – why not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Paran was shaking his head. ‘You don’t want that, High Mage. Trust me, you don’t. There are too many rogue players in this game. Icarium. Draconus. The First Sword of the T’lan Imass. Olar Ethil, Silchas Ruin, Tulas Shorn, Kilava – even Gruntle, the Mortal Sword of Treach. And now the Eleint, and how many dragons have come or are coming through the gate? A hundred? A thousand? Oh, and the Elder Gods: Errastas, the past Master of the Tiles, and Kilmandaros and her son …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben was staring as if Paran had lost his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan scowled. ‘What now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They – they’re all here ?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have the Deck of Dragons in my damned skull, remember. I caught the first winds of convergence some time ago. Trust me when I say this will be the biggest the world has ever seen, bigger even than the chaining of the Crippled God. Nobody said it’d be easy, High Mage. The question is, what do you have to offer me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben snarled. ‘Why, more good news, what did you think?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Mage threw up his hands. ‘Let’s just add the K’Chain Che’Malle and the Jaghut, and oh, we should probably mention Hood himself – no longer dragging the Throne of Death by one ankle. And who knows how many slavering fanatics of the Wolves of Winter! And what about the Crippled God himself – will he go quietly? Why should he? If I was him, even if you showed me the inviting door at the far end, I’d be slicing throats all the way down the corridor. I’d have damn well earned the right to as much vengeance as I could muster!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan grunted. ‘All right, it’s rather more complicated than I had imagined, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben seemed to choke on his reply. After a bout of coughing, and then spitting, he shook his head and, eyes watering, he rubbed at his face again. Then he took a deep, settling breath, and said, ‘We need a secret weapon, Paran.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have a gut feeling about that—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The one burning a hole in your stomach?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope not . ‘I think we might have two secret weapons, High Mage.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Please, I am begging you, go on.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Quick Ben, tell me, who was the toughest Bridgeburner you ever knew? Think back, and think carefully. Get your ego out of the way. Ignore your favourites and the ones who spent all their time looking mean. Not the callous shits, not the back-stabbers, none of the posers. The toughest , Quick Ben. Day in, day out, good times, bad. Tell me. Who?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Mage squinted, glanced down at the ground at his feet, and then he sighed and nodded, looking up as he said, ‘I didn’t need that list, Ganoes. I knew my answer right from the start. We all knew.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fiddler. There’s no tougher man alive.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan looked away. ‘My family … aye, we were something of a mess. But I will tell you this, this one thing I know without any doubt, and it starts with a memory – my sister had an area of ground cleared for her at the country estate, and it was where, beginning when she was barely five years old, she used toys to fight battles from every history book and scroll she could find. And the times when my father entertained High Fists in his horse-selling ventures, he’d make it a kind of challenge to those veteran commanders – take to the field against little sallow-faced Tavore, with all those toy soldiers. Count your attrition honestly, and see what happens. My sister, Quick Ben, from about seven onward, never lost to a single commander. And when their corpses were dragged away, she went deeper into the histories, she started taking the loser’s sides, and then won those, too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tavore, then.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-321.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
