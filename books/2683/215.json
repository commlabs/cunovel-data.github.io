I shove the hand that\u0027s holding the gun under his chin, pushing him away. He moves his head back, my hand slipping off. I try again, this time with the other hand and harder, and my fist connects with his chin. When Bobby lets go he tears my shirt open and he lunges forward again, grabbing my shoulders and bringing my face up to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You... are... dead,\" he says, his voice low and hoarse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s like we\u0027re dancing, colliding with each other before we crash into a wall, almost knocking over the cameraman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe keep hugging each other until Bobby maneuvers around and smashes my face against a wall-length mirror, once, twice, my head impacting against it until the mirror cracks and I fall to my knees, something warm spreading across my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby staggers away, looking for his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lurch up, blinking blood out of my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gaffer tosses me a clip to reload with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch it and then slam Bobby back against a stall door. I duck as his fist comes flying toward me, Bobby leaping on me like we\u0027re in a mosh pit, his face completely tensed up, and he\u0027s slapping at me madly, out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slams my head against a urinal and then grabs my scalp and shoves my head down as he brings his knee up into it, my forehead connecting, my neck snapping violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby pulls me back and starts dragging me across the tiled floor to where his gun rests, now next to the trash can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get it-get his gun,\" I\u0027m screaming at the crew as Bobby keeps hauling me across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperately, I grab for a stall door handle, hanging on to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby grunts, reaches down and grabs the waistband of the Prada slacks I\u0027m wearing and pulls me up until I\u0027m standing with him and then both of us are tumbling backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI land on top of him, then roll over, get on one knee and stand up, then run into a stall, slamming and locking the door so I can slip the new clip into the gun but Bobby tears the door off its hinges and throws me out, hurling me against a sink, my hand trying to block the force of impact, and then I\u0027m smashing into the mirror above the sink, shattering it, the clip slipping from my gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shove away from him but Bobby\u0027s scratching at my face now and I\u0027m lashing out blindly. Again we both fall, sprawling, the gun knocked out of my hand, skidding along the icy floor, and when I spot Bobby\u0027s gun under the sink I reach out but his boot is suddenly on my hand, crushing it, and a giant bolt of pain causes me to become more alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen another boot is on my head, grinding into my temple, and I flip over and grab Bobby\u0027s foot, twisting until he loses his balance and slips, falling on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaggering to my feet, I regain my footing and reach for his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point the barrel where he\u0027s lying on the floor but Bobby kicks out a leg, knocking the gun from my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lunges up and knocks me back, slamming into my side, and I\u0027m not prepared for the ferocity of Bobby\u0027s fist connecting with the side of my head and there\u0027s a cracking sound and as he lurches toward me he grabs my throat with both hands, pushing me to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s straddling me, shutting off my windpipe, and I\u0027m making choking sounds, both of Bobby\u0027s hands clamping my throat even tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he\u0027s grinning, his teeth stained red with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shove one hand under his chin, trying to push him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one hand crushing my neck, he easily reaches over and grabs his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m kicking out, unable to move, my hands pounding the tiled floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby holds the gun at chest level, riding me, the barrel tilted toward my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to scream, lashing my head back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing. For a second we\u0027re both still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I spring up yelling and I hit Bobby hard, knocking him backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe goes sprawling, blood jetting from his nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sitting on the floor, looking around madly for my gun and the new clip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spot them under the sink, a few feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start crawling toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, turning in a circle, Bobby reaches into his jacket for a new clip and quickly reloads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach under the sink and slip in the clip, tensing up, closing my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby fires. A bullet splinters another mirror above me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fires again, missing, the bullet thudding into the wall behind me. Tile explodes next to my face as he keeps firing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll over onto my side, aiming at him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-215.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
