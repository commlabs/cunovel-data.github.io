Even so, they would never dare fire you if Morton were alive. But he\u0027s not, anymore. And you\u0027re gone all the time. And the police are calling here for you, which I have to tell you is not good. It makes everybody nervous. And then theywhat are you doing with this Mr. Connor, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter. I told you.\" She sounded sulky. He knew he would have to trade information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said, trying to sound reluctant. \"I\u0027m carrying out an assignment that Morton gave me, before he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a secret, I can\u0027t tell you yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George Morton gave you an assignment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In writing,\" he said.

I know you can\u0027t talk. But just amp;good luck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up. Jennifer was smiling. \"That was very skillfully done,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he wasn\u0027t smiling back. As far as he was concerned, the world was closing in around him. It didn\u0027t feel good. And he was still very, very tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called Sarah to arrange for the plane, but got her voice mail. He called the pilot and was told that he was in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s flying, right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you that, sir. Would you like his voice mail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Evans said. \"I need to charter a plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When would you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In half an hour. To go to San Francisco, with a stop at whatever the airport is nearest Sequoia.

He pulled over to the side of the road and got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer said, \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the way to Van Nuys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped into the passenger seat and fastened his seat belt. He watched her pull into traffic, and then closed his eyes and slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 62\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEQUOIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTUESDAY, OCTOBER 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:30 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forest floor was dark and cool. Shafts of sunlight filtered down from the magnificent trees rising all around them. The air smelled of pine. The ground was soft underfoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a pleasant spot, with sunlight dappling the forest floor, but even so the television cameras had to turn on their lights to film the third-grade schoolchildren who sat in concentric circles around the famous actor and activist Ted Bradley. Bradley was wearing a black T-shirt that set off his makeup and his dark good looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These glorious trees are your birthright,\" he said, gesturing all around him. \"They have been standing here for centuries. Long before you were born, before your parents or your grandparents or your great-grandparents were born. Some of them, before Columbus came to America! Before the Indians came! Before anything! These trees are the oldest living things on the planet; they are the guardians of the Earth; they are wise; and they have a message for us: Leave the planet alone. Don\u0027t mess with it, or with us. And we must listen to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kids stared open-mouthed, transfixed. The cameras were trained on Bradley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now these magnificent treeshaving survived the threat of fire, the threat of logging, the threat of soil erosion, the threat of acid rainnow face their greatest threat ever. Global warming. You kids know what global warming is, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands went up all around the circle. \"I know, I know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you do,\" Bradley said, gesturing for the kids to put their hands down. The only person talking today would be Ted Bradley. \"But you may not know that global warming is going to cause a very sudden change in our climate. Maybe just a few months or years, and it will suddenly be much hotter or much colder. And there will be hordes of insects and diseases that will take down these wonderful trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of insects?\" one kid asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad ones,\" Bradley said. \"The ones that eat trees, that worm inside them and chew them up.\" He wiggled his hands, suggesting the worming in progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would take an insect a long time to eat a whole tree,\" a girl offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it wouldn\u0027t!\" Bradley said. \"That\u0027s the trouble. Because global warming means lots and lots of insects will comea plague of insectsand they\u0027ll eat the trees fast!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding to one side, Jennifer leaned close to Evans. \"Do you believe this shit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans yawned. He had slept on the flight up, and had dozed off again in the ride from the airport to this grove in Sequoia National Park. He felt groggy now, looking at Bradley. Groggy and bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now the kids were fidgeting, and Bradley turned squarely to the cameras. He spoke with the easy authority he had mastered while playing the president for so many years on television. \"The threat of abrupt climate change,\" he said, \"is so devastating for mankind, and for all life on this planet, that conferences are being convened all around the world to deal with it. There is a conference in Los Angeles starting tomorrow, where scientists will discuss what we can do to mitigate this terrible threat. But if we do nothing, catastrophe looms. And these mighty, magnificent trees will be a memory, a postcard from the past, a snapshot of man\u0027s inhumanity to the natural world. We\u0027re responsible for catastrophic climate change. And only we can stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished, with a slight turn to favor his good side, and a piercing stare from his baby blues, right into the lens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to pee-pee,\" one girl said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane lifted off the runway and rose over the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry to rush you,\" Evans said. \"But we have to get to the morgue before six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem, no problem.\" Bradley smiled indulgently. After his talk, he had taken a few minutes to sign autographs for the kids. The cameras filmed that as well. He turned to Jennifer, giving her his best smile. \"And what do you do, Miss Hadley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on the global warming legal team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, so you\u0027re one of us. How\u0027s the lawsuit going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just fine,\" she said, glancing at Evans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get the feeling you\u0027re as brilliant as you are beautiful,\" Bradley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, no,\" she said. Evans could see that the actor was annoying her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re being modest. It\u0027s very charming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m being honest,\" she said, \"and telling you I don\u0027t like flattery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly flattery, in your case,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And hardly honest, in yours,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me when I say that I genuinely admire what you\u0027re doing,\" Bradley said. \"I can\u0027t wait for you people to stick it to the EPA. We have to keep the pressure on. That\u0027s why I did this thing with the kids. It\u0027s a sure-fire television segment for abrupt climate change. And I thought it went extremely well, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reasonably well, considering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Considering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That it was all bullshit,\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBradley\u0027s smile remained fixed, but his eyes narrowed. \"I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re referring to,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m referring to all of it, Ted. The whole speech. Sequoias are sentinels and guardians of the planet? They have a message for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they do\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re trees, Ted. Big trees. They have about as much of a message for mankind as an eggplant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you are missing\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027ve managed to survive forest fires? Hardlythey\u0027re dependent on fires, because that\u0027s how they reproduce. Redwoods have tough seeds that only burst open in the heat of a fire. Fires are essential for the health of the redwood forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Bradley said rather stiffly, \"that you may have missed my point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? What did I miss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was trying to conveyperhaps a bit lyricallythe timeless quality of these great primeval forests, and\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Timeless? Primeval? Do you know anything about these forests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I think I do.\" His voice was tight. He was visibly angry now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look out the window,\" Jennifer said, pointing to the forest as they flew above it. \"How long do you think your primeval forest has looked the way it does now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously, for hundreds of thousands of years\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not true, Ted. Human beings were here for many thousands of years before these forests ever appeared. Did you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was clenching his jaw. He did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me lay it out for you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty thousand years ago, the Ice Age glaciers receded from California, gouging out Yosemite Valley and other beauty spots as they left. As the ice walls withdrew, they left behind a gunky, damp plain with lots of lakes fed by the melting glaciers, but no vegetation at all. It was basically wet sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few thousand years, the land dried as the glaciers continued to move farther north. This region of California became arctic tundra, with tall grasses supporting little animals, like mice and squirrels. Human beings had arrived here by then, hunting the small animals and setting fires. \"Okay so far?\" Jennifer said. \"No primeval forests yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m listening,\" Ted growled. He was clearly trying to control his temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued. \"At first, arctic grasses and shrubs were the only plants that could take hold in the barren glacial soil. But when they died they decomposed, and over thousands of years a layer of topsoil built up. And that initiated a sequence of plant colonization that was basically the same everywhere in post-glacial North America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, lodgepole pine comes in. That\u0027s around fourteen thousand years ago. Later it\u0027s joined by spruce, hemlock, and aldertrees that are hardy but can\u0027t be first. These trees constitute the real primary\u0027 forest, and they dominated this landscape for the next four thousand years. Then the climate changed. It got much warmer, and all the glaciers in California melted. There were no glaciers at all in California back then. It was warm and dry, there were lots of fires, and the primary forest burned. It was replaced by a plains-type vegetation of oak trees and prairie herbs. And a few Douglas fir trees, but not many, because the climate was too dry for fir trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, around six thousand years ago, the climate changed again. It became wetter, and the Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar moved in and took over the land, creating the great closed-canopy forests that you see now. But someone might refer to these fir trees as a pest plantan oversized weedthat invaded the landscape, crowding out the native plants that had been there before them. Because these big canopy forests made the ground too dark for other trees to survive. And since there were frequent fires, the closed-canopy forests were able to spread like mad. So they\u0027re not timeless, Ted. They\u0027re merely the last in line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBradley snorted. \"They\u0027re still six thousand years old, for God\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jennifer was relentless. \"Not true,\" she said. \"Scientists have shown that the forests continuously changed their composition. Each thousand-year period was different from the one before it. The forests changed constantly, Ted. And then, of course, there were the Indians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Indians were expert observers of the natural world, so they realized that old-growth forests sucked. Those forests may look impressive, but they\u0027re dead landscapes for game. So the Indians set fires, making sure the forests burned down periodically. They made sure there were only islands of old-growth forest in the midst of plains and meadows. The forests that the first Europeans saw were hardly primeval. They were cultivated, Ted. And it\u0027s not surprising that one hundred fifty years ago, there was less old-growth forest than there is today. The Indians were realists. Today, it\u0027s all romantic mythology.\"* She sat back in her chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s a very nice speech,\" Bradley said. \"But those are technical objections. People aren\u0027t interested. And it\u0027s a good thing, because you\u0027re saying that these forests aren\u0027t really old and therefore aren\u0027t worth preserving. Whereas I say they are reminders of the beauty and power of the natural world and should be preserved at all costs. Especially from the dire threat of global warming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer blinked. She said, \"I need a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll join you there,\" Bradley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Evanswho had intermittently been attempting to call Detective Perry while this discussion was taking placethe most disturbing aspect was the implication of constant change. Evans had never really focused on the idea that Indians had lived at the same time as the glaciers. Of course, he knew that this was true. He knew that early Indians had hunted the mammoth and other large mammals to extinction. But he had never considered the possibility that they would also have burned forests and changed the environment to suit their purposes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-43.html","bookId":1706,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM"}
