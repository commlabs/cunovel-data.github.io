Doesn\u0027t anyone speak Spanish in this damn country?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaring down at him was a short, pimple-faced teenager with a shaved head. Half of his scalp was red and half was purple. He looked like an Easter egg. \"I said you\u0027re in my seat, asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you the first time,\" Becker said, standing up. He was in no mood for a fight. It was time to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you put my bottles?\" the kid snarled. There was a safety pin in his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker pointed to the beer bottles he\u0027d set on the ground. \"They were empty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were my fuckin\u0027 empties!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My apologies,\" Becker said, and turned to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punk blocked his way. \"Pick \u0027em up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker blinked, not amused. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\" He was a full foot taller and outweighed the kid by about fifty pounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I fuckin\u0027 look like I\u0027m kidding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pick \u0027em up!\" The kid\u0027s voice cracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker attempted to step around him, but the teenager blocked his way. \"I said, fuckin\u0027 pick \u0027em up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStoned punks at nearby tables began turning to watch the excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to do this, kid,\" Becker said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m warning you!\" The kid seethed. \"This is my table! I come here every night. Now pick \u0027em up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker\u0027s patience ran out. Wasn\u0027t he supposed to be in the Smokys with Susan? What was he doing in Spain arguing with a psychotic adolescent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, Becker caught the kid under the armpits, lifted him up, and slammed his rear end down on the table. \"Look, you runny-nosed little runt. You\u0027re going to back off right now, or I\u0027m going to rip that safety pin out of your nose and pin your mouth shut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid\u0027s face went pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker held him a moment, then he released his grip. Without taking his eyes off the frightened kid, Becker stooped down, picked up the bottles, and returned them to the table. \"What do you say?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid was speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome,\" Becker snapped. This kid\u0027s a walking billboard for birth control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to hell!\" the kid yelled, now aware of his peers laughing at him. \"Ass-wipe!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker didn\u0027t move. Something the kid had said suddenly registered. I come here every night. Becker wondered if maybe the kid could help him. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Becker said, \"I didn\u0027t catch your name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two-Tone,\" he hissed, as if he were giving a death sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two-Tone?\" Becker mused. \"Let me guess... because of your hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit, Sherlock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catchy name. Make that up yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn straight,\" he said proudly. \"I\u0027m gonna patent it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker scowled. \"You mean trademark it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid looked confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d need a trademark for a name,\" Becker said. \"Not a patent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever!\" the punk screamed in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motley assortment of drunken and drugged-out kids at the nearby tables were now in hysterics. Two-Tone stood up and sneered at Becker. \"What the fuck do you want from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker thought a moment. I want you to wash your hair, cleanup your language, and get a job. Becker figured it was too much to ask on a first meeting. \"I need some information,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ain\u0027t seen him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t seen him,\" Becker corrected as he flagged a passing waitress. He bought two Aguila beers and handed one to Two-Tone. The boy looked shocked. He took a swig of beer and eyed Becker warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hitting on me, mister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker smiled. \"I\u0027m looking for a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-Tone let out a shrill laugh. \"You sure as hell ain\u0027t gonna get any action dressed like that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker frowned. \"I\u0027m not looking for action. I just need to talk to her. Maybe you could help me find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-Tone set down his beer. \"You a cop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"You look like a cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kid, I\u0027m from Maryland. If I were a cop, I\u0027d be a little out of my jurisdiction, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question seemed to stump him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s David Becker.\" Becker smiled and offered his hand across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punk recoiled in disgust. \"Back off, fag boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker retracted the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid sneered. \"I\u0027ll help you, but it\u0027ll cost you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker played along. \"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hundred bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker frowned. \"I\u0027ve only got pesetas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever! Make it a hundred pesetas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForeign currency exchange was obviously not one of Two-Tone\u0027s fortes; a hundred pesetas was about eighty-seven cents. \"Deal,\" Becker said, rapping his bottle on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid smiled for the first time. \"Deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Becker continued in his hushed tone. \"I figure the girl I\u0027m looking for might hang out here. She\u0027s got red, white, and blue hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-Tone snorted. \"It\u0027s Judas Taboo\u0027s anniversary. Everybody\u0027s got-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s also wearing a British flag T-shirt and has a skull pendant in one ear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint look of recognition crossed Two-Tone\u0027s face. Becker saw it and felt a surge of hope. But a moment later Two-Tone\u0027s expression turned stern. He slammed his bottle down and grabbed Becker\u0027s shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s Eduardo\u0027s, you asshole! I\u0027d watch it! You touch her, and he\u0027ll kill you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 56\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidge Milken prowled angrily into the conference room across from her office. In addition to the thirty-two foot mahogany table with the NSA seal inlaid in black cherry and walnut, the conference room contained three Marion Pike watercolors, a Boston fern, a marble wet bar, and of course, the requisite Sparklett\u0027s water cooler. Midge helped herself to a glass of water, hoping it might calm her nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she sipped at the liquid, she gazed across at the window. The moonlight was filtering through the open venetian blind and playing on the grain of the table. She\u0027d always thought this would make a nicer director\u0027s office than Fontaine\u0027s current location on the front of the building. Rather than looking out over the NSA parking lot, the conference room looked out over an impressive array of NSA outbuildings-including the Crypto dome, a high-tech island floating separate from the main building on three wooded acres. Purposefully situated behind the natural cover of a grove of maples, Crypto was difficult to see from most windows in the NSA complex, but the view from the directorial suite was perfect. To Midge the conference room seemed the perfect vantage point for a king to survey his domain. She had suggested once that Fontaine move his office, but the director had simply replied, \"Not on the rear.\" Fontaine was not a man to be found on the back end of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidge pulled apart the blinds. She stared out at the hills. Sighing ruefully, she let her eyes fall toward the spot where Crypto stood. Midge had always felt comforted by the sight of the Crypto dome-a glowing beacon regardless of the hour. But tonight, as she gazed out, there was no comfort. Instead she found herself staring into a void. As she pressed her face to the glass, she was gripped by a wild, girlish panic. Below her there was nothing but blackness. Crypto had disappeared!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 57\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crypto bathrooms had no windows, and the darkness surrounding Susan Fletcher was absolute. She stood dead still for a moment trying to get her bearings, acutely aware of the growing sense of panic gripping her body. The horrible cry from the ventilation shaft seemed to hang all around her. Despite her effort to fight off a rising sense of dread, fear swept across her flesh and took control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flurry of involuntary motion, Susan found herself groping wildly across stall doors and sinks. Disoriented, she spun through the blackness with her hands out in front of her and tried to picture the room. She knocked over a garbage can and found herself against a tiled wall. Following the wall with her hand, she scrambled toward the exit and fumbled for the door handle. She pulled it open and stumbled out onto the Crypto floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere she froze for a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crypto floor looked nothing like it had just moments ago. TRANSLTR was a gray silhouette against the faint twilight coming in through the dome. All of the overhead lighting was dead. Not even the electronic keypads on the doors were glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Susan\u0027s eyes became accustomed to the dark, she saw that the only light in Crypto was coming through the open trapdoor-a faint red glow from the utility lighting below. She moved toward it. There was the faint smell of ozone in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she made it to the trapdoor, she peered into the hole. The freon vents were still belching swirling mist through the redness, and from the higher-pitched drone of the generators, Susan knew Crypto was running on backup power. Through the mist she could make out Strathmore standing on the platform below. He was leaning over the railing and staring into the depths of TRANSLTR\u0027s rumbling shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan eased onto the ladder. The hot air from below rushed in under her skirt. The rungs were slippery with condensation. She set herself down on the grated landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore did not turn. He continued staring down with a blank look of shock, as if in a trance. Susan followed his gaze over the banister. For a moment she could see nothing except wisps of steam. Then suddenly she saw it. A figure. Six stories below. It appeared briefly in the billows of steam. There it was again. A tangled mass of twisted limbs. Lying ninety feet below them, Phil Chartrukian was sprawled across the sharp iron fins of the main generator. His body was darkened and burned. His fall had shorted out Crypto\u0027s main power supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the most chilling image of all was not of Chartrukian but of someone else, another body, halfway down the long staircase, crouched, hiding in the shadows. The muscular frame was unmistakable. It was Greg Hale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 58\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punk screamed at Becker, \"Megan belongs to my friend Eduardo! You stay away from her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she?\" Becker\u0027s heart was racing out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an emergency!\" Becker snapped. He grabbed the kid\u0027s sleeve. \"She\u0027s got a ring that belongs tome. I\u0027ll pay her for it! A lot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-Tone stopped dead and burst into hysterics. \"You mean that ugly, gold piece of shit is yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker\u0027s eyes widened. \"You\u0027ve seen it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-Tone nodded coyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is it?\" Becker demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No clue.\" Two-Tone chuckled. \"Megan was up here trying to hock it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was trying to sell it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, man, she didn\u0027t have any luck. You\u0027ve got shitty taste in jewelry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure nobody bought it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you shitting me? For four hundred bucks? I told her I\u0027d give her fifty, but she wanted more. She was trying to buy a plane ticket-standby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker felt the blood drain from his face. \"Whereto?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuckin\u0027 Connecticut,\" Two-tone snapped. \"Eddie\u0027s bummin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connecticut?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, yeah. Going back to Mommy and Daddy\u0027s mansion in the burbs. Hated her Spanish homestay family. Three Spic brothers always hitting on her. No fucking hot water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker felt a knot rise in his throat. \"When is she leaving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-Tone looked up. \"When?\" He laughed. \"She\u0027s long gone by now. Went to the airport hours ago. Best spot to hock the ring-rich tourists and shit. Once she got the cash, she was flying out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dull nausea swept through Becker\u0027s gut. This is some kind of sick joke, isn\u0027t it? He stood a long moment. \"What\u0027s her last name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-Tone pondered the question and shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What flight was she taking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said something about the Roach Coach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roach Coach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Weekend red-eye-Seville, Madrid, La Guardia. That\u0027s what they call it. College kids take it \u0027cause it\u0027s cheap. Guess they sit in back and smoke roaches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Becker groaned, running a hand through his hair. \"What time did it leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two a.m. sharp, every Saturday night. She\u0027s somewhere over the Atlantic by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker checked his watch. It read 1:45 p.m. He turned to Two-Tone, confused. \"You said it\u0027s a two a.m. flight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punk nodded, laughing. \"Looks like you\u0027re fucked, ol\u0027 man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker pointed angrily to his watch. \"But it\u0027s only quarter to two!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-Tone eyed the watch, apparently puzzled. \"Well, I\u0027ll be damned.\" he laughed. \"I\u0027m usually not this buzzed till four a.m.!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the fastest way to the airport?\" Becker snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taxi stand out front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker grabbed a 1,000-peseta note from his pocket and stuff edit in Two-Tone\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, man, thanks!\" the punk called after him. \"If you see Megan, tell her I said hi!\" But Becker was already gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo-Tone sighed and staggered back toward the dance floor. He was too drunk to notice the man in wire-rim glasses following him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Becker scanned the parking lot for a taxi. There was none. He ran over to a stocky bouncer. \"Taxi!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bouncer shook his head. \"Demasiado temprano. Too early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo early? Becker swore. It\u0027s two o\u0027clock in the morning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pidame uno! Call me one!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man pulled out a walkie-talkie. He said a few words and then signed off. \"Veinte minutos,\" he offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty minutes?!\" Becker demanded. \"Y elautobus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bouncer shrugged. \"Forty-five minutos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker threw up his hands. Perfect!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a small engine turned Becker\u0027s head. It sounded like a chainsaw. A big kid and his chain-clad date pulled into the parking lot on an old Vespa 250 motorcycle. The girl\u0027s skirt had blown high on her thighs. She didn\u0027t seem to notice. Becker dashed over. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m doing this, he thought. I hate motorcycles. He yelled to the driver. \"I\u0027ll pay you ten thousand pesetas to take me to the airport!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid ignored him and killed the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty thousand!\" Becker blurted. \"I need to get to the airport!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid looked up. \"Scusi?\" He was Italian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aeroporto! Per favore. Sulla Vespa! Venti mille pesete!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Italian eyed his crummy, little bike and laughed. \"Venti mille pesete? La Vespa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cinquanta mille! Fifty thousand!\" Becker offered. It was about four hundred dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Italian laughed doubtfully. \"Dov\u0027e la plata? Where\u0027s the cash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker pulled five 10,000-peseta notes from his pocket and held them out. The Italian looked at the money and then at his girlfriend. The girl grabbed the cash and stuffed it in her blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grazie!\" the Italian beamed. He tossed Becker the keys to his Vespa. Then he grabbed his girlfriend\u0027s hand, and they ran off laughing into the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aspetta!\" Becker yelled. \"Wait! I wanted a ride!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-52.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM"}
