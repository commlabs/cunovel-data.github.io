You\u0026nbsp; can\u0027t seriously consider running for\u0026nbsp; mayor. Mob enthusiasm is apowerful thing, but it\u0027s notoriously fickle.\"\"Exactly!\" said Mallow, grimly,\u0026nbsp; \"so we must coddle it, and the best way todo that is to continue the show.\"\"Now what?\"\"You\u0027re to have Publis Manlio and Jorane Sutt arrested?\n\u003cbr\u003e \"What!\"\"Just what you hear.\u0026nbsp; Have the mayor arrest them! I don\u0027t care what threatsyou use.\u0026nbsp; I control\u0026nbsp; the mob, ÊùÖor today,\u0026nbsp; at any rate. He\u0026nbsp; won\u0027t dare facethem.\"\"But on what charge, man?\"\"On\u0026nbsp; the obvious\u0026nbsp; one. They\u0027ve\u0026nbsp; been inciting\u0026nbsp; the priesthood of\u0026nbsp; the outerplanets to\u0026nbsp; take sides in the factional\u0026nbsp; quarrels of the Foundation. That\u0027sillegal, by\u0026nbsp; Seldon. Charge them with \u0027endangering\u0026nbsp; the state.\u0027 And I don\u0027tcare about\u0026nbsp; a conviction any more\u0026nbsp; than they did in\u0026nbsp; my case. Just get themout of circulation until I\u0027m mayor.\"\"It\u0027s half a year till election.\"\"Not too\u0026nbsp; long!\" Mallow was on his feet, and his\u0026nbsp; sudden grip of Jael\u0027s armwas tight. \"Listen, I\u0027d seize the government by force if I had to ?the waySalvor Hardin\u0026nbsp; did a\u0026nbsp; hundred years ago.\u0026nbsp; There\u0027s still that\u0026nbsp; Seldon crisiscoming up, and when it comes I have to be mayor and high priest. Both!\"Jael\u0027s brow\u0026nbsp; furrowed. He\u0026nbsp; said, quietly, \"What\u0027s\u0026nbsp; it going to\u0026nbsp; be? Korell,after all?\"Mallow\u0026nbsp; nodded, \"Of\u0026nbsp; course.\u0026nbsp; They\u0027ll declare\u0026nbsp; war, eventually,\u0026nbsp; though I\u0027mbetting it\u0027ll take another pair of years.\"\"With nuclear ships?\"\"What\u0026nbsp; do you\u0026nbsp; think? Those\u0026nbsp; three merchant\u0026nbsp; ships we\u0026nbsp; lost in\u0026nbsp; their spacesector\u0026nbsp; weren\u0027t knocked\u0026nbsp; over\u0026nbsp; with compressed-air\u0026nbsp; pistols. Jael,\u0026nbsp; they\u0027regetting ships from the\u0026nbsp; Empire itself. Don\u0027t open your mouth like a fool. Isaid the\u0026nbsp; Empire! It\u0027s still there,\u0026nbsp; you know. It many\u0026nbsp; be gone here in thePeriphery but\u0026nbsp; in the Galactic center\u0026nbsp; it\u0027s still very much\u0026nbsp; alive. And onefalse move means that\u0026nbsp; it, itself, may be on our neck. That\u0027s why I must bemayor and high priest. I\u0027m the only man who knows how to fight the crisis.\"Jael swallowed dryly, \"How? What are you going to do?\"\"Nothing.\"Jael smiled uncertainly, \"Really! All of that!\"But Mallow\u0027s\u0026nbsp; answer was incisive,\u0026nbsp; \"When I\u0027m boss of\u0026nbsp; this Foundation, I\u0027mgoing to do nothing.
