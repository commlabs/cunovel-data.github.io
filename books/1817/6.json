I really pissed my mom off and that’s the last thing I wanted to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lesson learned. I understand the pain you’re going through over Hailey. Trust me, I’ve been there. But, screwing every woman that looks your way isn’t the answer to healing your broken heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and sighed. “I know and I don’t want to talk about Hailey. She’s my past and that’s where she’s staying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, but I want you to remember that everything happens for a reason. It’s hard to see it now, but you will someday.” She winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up from my seat and gave her a kiss on the cheek. “It’s a shame you don’t dig guys. You’re missing out on this.” I winked as I grabbed my crotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get the hell out of here before I call your daddy.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t.” I pointed before opening the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably not.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out of Mac’s office and down the hall to the elevators. I heard my phone beep and, when I pulled it from my pocket, I saw there was a message from Ellie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, hot stuff. I’m in the lobby at your hotel. Where the hell are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On my way, babe. Got held up at the office. Tell the hotel to let you in my room. I’ll be there in fifteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I arrived at the hotel, I opened the door and didn’t see Ellie. I walked into the bedroom of the suite and shook my head as I smiled and began to unbutton my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s about time, hot stuff. I was getting lonely in this big bed by myself.” She smiled as she lay there totally naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No worries. I’m here now and I can promise you that you won’t be lonely anymore,” I said with a smile as I grabbed the bottle of Jack, took down my pants, and climbed on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ringing sound of my phone was making my head hurt more than it already was. I rolled out from under Ellie’s arm and grabbed my phone from my pants pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you up?” my dad yelled into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you to head to the office and pick up the plans sometime today. Mackenzie is going to have the changes made and then we’ll be set to move ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Late night last night, Collin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Dad. Can I call you back later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, son. Call me back when you’re not so hung over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bye, Dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my phone back on the nightstand. I looked over at Ellie as she lay there sound asleep. We went out last night, drank too much, and had sex all night long. I missed Hailey and there was no denying it. Every time I would go to sleep with a girl, I thought about her. That was why I never slept with a girl unless I was drunk. If I was drunk, I didn’t have to think about her. If I was sober, I felt like I was cheating on her, even though she left me. I couldn’t help but think about Jacob and Diana. His appointment with the specialist was today and I thought maybe it would be cool to hang out after. Ellie started to stir when I got up and pulled on my sweatpants. I walked over to the window in the living area and opened the curtains. I looked out as the sun brightened the sky. After a few moments, I walked back into the bedroom and grabbed my phone. I pulled up Hailey’s name and began sending her a text message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, how have you—” I started to type. Looking at my half-typed message, I threw my phone down on the couch and ran my hands through my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong, hot stuff?” Ellie said as she wrapped her arms around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just have a lot on my mind. I have some things I need to do, so I’m going to take a shower and head out. You can order room service if you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, I’ll just grab my stuff and go. I had fun last night. How about we do it again tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and looked at her with a small smile. “I wish I could, but I can’t. I have something else to do tonight and my plane will be here early tomorrow. But, thank you for last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any time you’re in town, hot stuff!” She smiled as she kissed me on the cheek and walked back to the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped in the shower and, when I got out, Ellie was already gone. After getting dressed, I went to Diana’s room to see if they left for the specialist yet. There was no answer when I knocked so I walked down to the front desk and left a message for her and Jacob. I had the hotel bring a car around and, when I was on my way to Black Enterprises, Julia called me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s your head?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine; why do you ask?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I talked to Dad a few minutes ago and he said you had a late night again and you sounded like shit. I think he’s really worried about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and sighed. “There’s no need to worry about me. I’m fine. So what if I like to have fun. Maybe he should try it some time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m thinking that Dad sees himself in you when he was younger. You heard the rumors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too bad. I’m not him, and I’ll be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Promise me,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promise. Now I have to go because I’m at the office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed end and shook my head as I stepped out of the car. As I was walking into the building, Mac was coming out. She looped her arm around mine and turned me around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you have breakfast yet?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. You’re coming with me, then. I’m starving and we can go over the designs. I spoke with your dad last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled into the restaurant, ordered breakfast, and, as soon as we started going over the plans, my phone rang. I pulled it from my pocket and it was Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Collin, it’s Diana. The desk gave me your message.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Diana. I was wondering if maybe you and Jacob would like to hang out this afternoon. I thought maybe we could go to the Field Museum. I think Jacob would love it. I know I did when I was his age. Actually, I still do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s very nice of you, Collin, but we don’t want to impose on you. I know you’re a very busy man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I’m not that busy and I want to. Jacob will love it. I’ll be back to the hotel in a couple of hours. Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Collin. We’ll be here.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-6.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
