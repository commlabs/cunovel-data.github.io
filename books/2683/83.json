Except for candies and the very dim, very hip lighting and the chilly hues coming from the steel bar it\u0027s almost pitch black in the lounge, but then one of the spotlights outside on the street beams through the windows, scanning the room before disappearing again, only to beam back moments later, again bathing everything around us in a harsh, metallic glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My psychiatrist wears a tiara,\" Lauren says from beneath the patterned tablecloth. \"Her name is Dr. Egan and she wears a giant diamond tiara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m silent for a minute before I can say, \"That\u0027s... so depressing, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren struggles up out of the booth and, standing unsteadily, grabs he edge of the table for support, shakes her head to clear it and then lances slowly, gracelessly with herself across the raw concrete floor over to the pool table and I reach out and touch the strand of pearls I suddenly notice draped around her neck, trying to move with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing, Victor?\" she asks, dreamily. \"Dancing? Is that dancing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Squirming. It\u0027s called squirming, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t squirm, lovebutton,\" she pouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think there\u0027s quite a bit to squirm about tonight,\" I say tiredly. \"In fact, I think lovebutton\u0027s squirming is totally justified.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god, Victor,\" she groans, still swaying to the music. \"You were such a cute, sweet, normal guy when I first met you.\" A long pause. \"You were so sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a minute without moving, I clear my throat. \"Um, baby, I don\u0027t think I was ever any of those things.\" A realization. \"Except for, um, cute, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops dancing, considers this, then admits, \"That\u0027s probably the first honest thing you\u0027ve probably ever said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I ask, \"Did you mean what you said down there?\" Pause, darkness again. \"I mean about us.\" Pause. \"And all that,\" I add.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hand her the bottle of vodka. She takes it, starts to drink, stops, puts it on the pool table. The rays from the spotlight cross her face, illuminating it for seconds, her eyes closed, tearing, her head slightly turned; a hand is brought up to her mouth, and it\u0027s curled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I carefully move the icy bottle of vodka off the pool table so it won\u0027t leave a damp ring on the felt. \"Is this all too bummerish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods slowly and then moves her face next to mine and the sounds of horns from limos in gridlock and the relentless roar of the massive crowd outside is carried up in waves to where we\u0027re stumbling around clutching each other and I\u0027m muttering \"Dump Damien, baby\" into her ear as she pushes me away when she feels how hard I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that simple,\" she says, her back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey babe, I get it,\" I say casually. \"Lust never sleeps, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Victor.\" She clears her throat, walks slowly around the pool table. I follow her. \"It\u0027s not that. It\u0027s just not that simple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have... star quality, baby,\" I\u0027m saying, grasping, sending out a vibe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly rushes up to me and holds on, shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think everything happens for a reason?\" she\u0027s asking, breathing hard, moving against me. \"Don\u0027t you think everything happens for a reason, Victor?\" And then, \"Victor, I\u0027m so scared. I\u0027m so scared for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The time to hesitate is through,\" I whisper into her hair, pushing against her, easing her slowly against the pool table. \"Okay, baby?\" I\u0027m whispering while kissing her mouth, my hands reaching down below her waist, and she\u0027s whispering back \"Don\u0027t\" and I\u0027m reaching underneath her dress, unable to stop myself, not caring who sees us, who walks in through the door, immediately getting lost in the moment, my fingers grazing her panties, one finger slipping inside, touching first the hair there and then a crease and beyond that an entrance that I can actually feel dampen as my finger runs over it gently at first and then more insistently until another slips inside and Lauren\u0027s pressing herself against me, her mouth locked onto mine, but I push her back because I want to see the expression her face is making and now she\u0027s sitting on the pool table with both legs spread and raised up, her hands on the back of my neck grasping me closer, her mouth on my mouth again, making desperate noises that I\u0027m making too but suddenly she pulls back, looking past me, and when I turn around, visible in the darkness of the VIP room is a silhouette of a man standing backlit against the windows that look over Union Square. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-83.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
