Though the worst of the toxic event was over, the bay remained a poisonous cesspool. Even the gunmen knew better than to leave the safety of their boat. The masked men were using oars to pry the craft off the rocks, rather than climbing in themselves and lightening the load.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf even pirates refused to go into the water . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk suddenly began to question the wisdom of his own plan. Besides, he hated diving. He was a former Green Beret, not a friggin\u0027 Navy SEAL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Graff asked, reading something in Monk\u0027s expression. \"You don\u0027t think your plan is going to work, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let a man think already!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlumping down, Monk found himself staring back toward the worn Buddha statue under its lean-to, protected by its charred row of prayer sticks. He wasn\u0027t Buddhist, but he was not above praying to any god that would get him out of this scrape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes again settled to the burned prayer sticks. Without turning away, he spoke to Graff. \"How did these worshippers get here?\" he asked. \"There\u0027s no village for miles along the coastline, the beach is protected by reefs, and the cliffs appear too sheer to climb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff shook his head. \"What difference does it make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone lit those prayer sticks. Within the last day or so.\" Monk shifted up. \"Look at the beach. No footsteps but our own. You can see where someone knelt to light their smudge sticks, but no steps head out to the water or along the beach. That means they had to come down from above. There must be a path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe someone just raised and lowered a rope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk sighed, wishing for a more dim-witted companion, someone less able to poke holes in his reasoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Water or Buddha?\" Monk asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff visibly swallowed as the speedboat\u0027s engine throttled up. The pirates were almost free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff turned to Monk. \"Is . . . isn\u0027t it good luck to rub the belly of a Buddha?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk nodded. \"I think I read that on a fortune cookie somewhere. 1 hope that Buddha read the same cookie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk shifted around, raising his pistol. \"On my count, you haul ass. I\u0027m going to be at your heels, blasting at the boat. You just concentrate on getting to that Buddha and finding that path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll pray the worshippers didn\u0027t use a rope to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say it or you\u0027ll jinx us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff clammed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we go.\" Monk braced himself, bouncing a bit to get circulation into his legs. He counted off. \"Three . . . two . . . one . . . !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff took off, bolting out like a jackrabbit. A bullet rang off the rock at the man\u0027s heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk cursed and jerked up. \"You were supposed to wait for go,\" he mumbled, squeezing the trigger and firing toward the trapped boat. \"Civilians...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peppered the boat, driving the snipers onto their bellies. He watched one man throw his hands up and go toppling overboard. A lucky shot on Monk\u0027s part. Return fire consisted of a few wild blasts, fired in an angry panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, Graff reached the Buddha and skidded in the sand, slipping past the prayer sticks. Twisting around, he caught his balance and leapfrogged behind the lean-to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk took a more direct route and crashed through a sandy thornbush. He landed next to Graff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We made it!\" Graff gasped out with way too much surprise in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And pissed them off damn good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk pictured the man going overboard into the toxic soup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossibly in retribution, rifle blasts tore through the lean-to and exploded the vines and leaves draped along the cliff wall. Monk and Graff sheltered together, protected by Buddha\u0027s wide stone belly. Surely there was symbolism in this last act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was about all Buddha had to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk studied the cliffs behind the wooden shack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheer and unscalable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe one of us should have rubbed that belly when we ran up here,\" Monk said sourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your gun?\" Graff asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk hefted it up. \"One round. After that, I could always throw the pistol at them. That always works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them the boat finally freed itself with a roar of its engine. Worse yet, the boat was now on the island side of the reef, sidling toward the beach, sluicing through the bodies of the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long there would be another two bodies to add to the soup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA volley of shots peppered the Buddha and shattered through the lean-to. More vines were shredded. A ricochet sped past Monk\u0027s nose—but he didn\u0027t move. He watched one of the drapes of blasted vine fall away, revealing the mouth of a cave behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk crawled forward, keeping the statue between him and the appr oaching pirates. He nudged open the vines. Sunlight revealed a step, then another ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A tunnel! So much for your rope-ladder theory, Graff!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk turned and saw the doctor slumped to one side, a hand pressed to Ins shoulder. Blood welled between his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk hurried back to him. \"C\u0027mon. We\u0027ve no time to dress it. Can you walk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff spoke between clenched teeth. \"As long as they don\u0027t shoot me in the leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith some help, the two crawled through the vine drape and into the tunnel. The temperature dropped a full ten degrees. Monk kept a grip on Graff\u0027s elbow. The man trembled and shook, but he followed Monk\u0027s lead and hurried up the steps into the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them he heard the scrape of hull on sand and the victorious shouts of the pirates, confident their prey was trapped. Monk continued up, around and around, feeling in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would not take long for the pirates to find the tunnel. But would they pursue or simply take off? The answer came soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights flared below . . . along with more furtive barked orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk hurried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the anger in the voices below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had indeed pissed them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly the darkness overhead turned to gray. Walls became discernible. Their pace increased. Graff was mumbling under his breath, but Monk could not understand the man\u0027s words. A prayer, a curse ... he would take either if it would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last the upper end of the stairs appeared. The pair burst out of the tunnel and into the fringe of rain forest that frosted the cliff. Monk pushed onward, grateful for the dense cover of the jungle. As he entered the forest, he saw the toxic kill zone was not limited to the beach below. Dead birds littered the forest floor. Near his toes lay the furred body of a flying fox, crumpled like a crashed jet fighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not all the forest\u0027s denizens were dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk stared ahead. The forest floor churned and eddied in a red tide of its own. But this was no bacterial bloom. Millions of crabs covered the forest floor, every square inch. Some were latched onto trunks and vines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere were the missing Christmas Island red crabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk remembered his earlier study. Throughout the year, the crabs remained docile. Until aroused or stirred up. During their annual migration, the crabs were known to slash tires of passing cars with their razor-sharp claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk took a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirred up described the crabs at the moment. They climbed all over one another, agitated, snapping. In a feeding frenzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk now understood why the creatures were missing from the beach below. Why go down when there was plenty to eat up here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crabs not only feasted on the dead birds and bats—but also on their own brothers and sisters, in a cannibalistic free-for-all. At the men\u0027s appearance, massive claws lifted in warning, snapping like broken sticks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome to the party!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, from the tunnel opening, excited voices echoed forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pirates had spotted the tunnel\u0027s end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff took a step forward, clutching his shoulder. A large crab, hidden under a fern leaf, swiped at his toe and cleaved clear through the plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor retreated back, mumbling under his breath again. It was the same mantra as on the stairs, only now Monk understood it. . . and couldn\u0027t agree more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We really should have rubbed that Buddha\u0027s belly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmbush\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 5, 12:25 a.m. Takoma Park, Maryland\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Dad.\" Gray hurried with his father to close the carriage doors to the garage. \"But I intend to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two had hauled the assassin\u0027s motorcycle into the garage. Gray had not wanted the bike left in the open. In fact, he wanted no trace of Seichan left here. So far there had been no sign of whoever had shot her, but that didn\u0027t mean they weren\u0027t coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushed back to his mother. As a biology professor at George Washington University, his mother had taught plenty of pre-med students and knew enough to belly-wrap Seichan\u0027s wound in order to stanch any further hemorrhaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin hovered at the edge of consciousness, drifting in and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looked like the bullet passed clean through,\" his mother said. \"But she\u0027s lost a lot of blood. Is the ambulance on its way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments ago Gray had made an emergency call with his cell phone—but not to 911. Seichan could not be taken to any local hospital. A gunshot wound required answering too many questions. Still, he had to move her, get her medical attention as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the street, a door slammed. Gray listened, jumpy at any noises, his senses stretched to a piano-wire tautness. Someone called out, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gray, is the ambulance on its way?\" his mother persisted in a harder tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray just nodded, refusing to lie out loud. At least not to his mother. He turned to his father, who joined them, wiping his palms on his work jeans. His parents thought he was a laboratory technician for a D.C. research company, a lowly position after being court-martialed out of the Army Rangers for striking a superior officer. But that had not been the truth either. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-10.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
