We\u0027re trying to keep appearances as normal as possible.\" Amelia sent a tense, rueful smile to the Hunts. \"But our family has never been especially good at that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin stiffened as she saw Leo and Merripen enter the room. Leo came straight to her, while Merripen went to lurk in the corner as usual. He wouldn\u0027t meet her gaze. The room was filled with a charged silence that caused the down on the back of her neck to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t gotten herself into this all alone, Win thought with a flare of anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen would have to help her now. He would have to protect her with any means at his disposal. Including his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart began to pound so heavily that it almost hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It appears you\u0027ve been making up for lost time, Sis,\" Leo said flippantly, but there was a flicker of concern in his light eyes. \"We have to be quick about this, since people will talk even more in light of our collective absence. Tongues are wagging so fast, they\u0027ve created a strong breeze in the drawing room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hunt approached Amelia and Win. \"Winnifred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was very gentle. \"If this rumor is not true, I will take action at once to deny it on your behalf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin drew in a trembling breath. \"It is true,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hunt patted her arm and gave her a reassuring glance. \"Trust me, you are not the first nor will you be the last to find yourself in this predicament.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact,\" came Mr. Hunt\u0027s lazy drawl, \"Mrs. Hunt has firsthand experience in just such a-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Hunt,\" his wife said indignantly, and he grin-ned. Turning back to Win, Mrs. Hunt said, \"Winnifred, you and the gentleman in question must resolve this at once.\" A delicate pause. \"May I ask whom you were seen with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin couldn\u0027t answer. She let her gaze fall to the carpet, and she studied the pattern of medallions and flowers dazedly as she waited for Merripen to speak. The silence only lasted a matter of seconds, but it seemed like hours. Say something, she thought desperately. Tell them it was you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no movement or sound from Merripen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Julian Harrow stepped forward. \"I am the gentleman in question,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin\u0027s head jerked up. She gave him an astonished glance as he took her hand. \"I apologize to all of you,\" Julian continued, \"and especially to Miss Hathaway. I didn\u0027t intend to expose her to gossip or censure. But this precipitates something I had already resolved to do, which is to ask for Miss Hathaway\u0027s hand in marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin stopped breathing. She looked directly at Merripen, and a silent cry of anguish seared through her heart. Merripen\u0027s hard face and coal-black eyes revealed nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen had compromised her and now he was letting another man assume the responsibility for it. Letting someone else rescue her. The betrayal was worse than any illness or pain she had ever experienced before. Win hated him. She would hate him until her dying day and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat choice did she have but to accept Julian? It was either that or allow herself and her sisters to be ruined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin felt her face drain of all color, but she summoned a paper-thin smile as she glanced at her brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, my lord?\" she asked Leo. \"Should we ask your permission first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have my blessing,\" her brother said dryly. \"After all, I certainly don\u0027t want my pristine reputation to be marred by your scandals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin turned to face Julian. \"Then yes, Dr. Harrow,\" she said in a steady voice. \"I will marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frown notched between Mrs. Hunt\u0027s fine dark brows as she stared at Win. She nodded in a businesslike manner. \"I will go out and explain quietly to the appropriate parties that what they saw was a betrothed couple embracingâ€¦ a bit intemperate perhaps, but quite forgivable in light of a betrothal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go with you,\" Mr. Hunt said, coming to his wife\u0027s side. He extended a hand to Dr. Harrow and shook it. \"My congratulations, sir.\" His tone was cordial but far from enthusiastic. \"You are most fortunate to have won Miss Hathaway\u0027s hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Hunts left, Cam approached Win. She forced herself to stare directly into his perceptive hazel eyes, though it cost her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this what you want, little sister?\" he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sympathy nearly undid her. \"Oh yes.\" She set her jaw against a wretched quiver, and managed to smile. \"I\u0027m the luckiest woman in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when she brought herself to look at Merripen, she saw that he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a ghastly evening,\" Amelia muttered after everyone had left the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Cam led her into the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to the drawing room to make an appearance. Try to look pleased and confident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, good God.\" Amelia pulled away from him and strode to a large arched wall niche, where a Palladian window revealed a view of the street below. She pressed her forehead against the glass and sighed heavily. A repeated tapping noise echoed through the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerious as the situation was, Cam couldn\u0027t prevent a quick grin. Whenever Amelia was worried or angry, her nervous habit asserted itself. As he had once told her, she reminded him of a hummingbird tamping down her nest with one foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam went to her, and rested his warm palms on the cool slopes of her shoulders. He felt her shiver at his touch. \"Hummingbird,\" he whispered, and slid his hands up to the back of her neck to knead the small frozen muscles there. As her tension ebbed, the foot tapping gradually died away. Finally Amelia relaxed enough to tell him her thoughts. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-51.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM"}
