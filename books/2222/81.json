Visibility had improved, and the streetlamps, imperceptible before, had turned each puddle into a silver pool. I struggled with Debbie’s weight, staggering a few times as I carried her across the parking lot to the Jeep Cherokee. I leaned the nearly unconscious woman against the back door, holding her upright with my arm and shoulder while I fumbled for the front door latch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crack of a handgun—a sound as angry as thunder—caused me to drop to the wet asphalt, pulling Debbie down with me. She cried out so loudly that I thought at first she had been hit, but it was her injuries that caused the pain, not a bullet. I held her close, her face pressed against my wet shirt, and listened. Nothing. For a moment, I thought I had imagined the gunshot. Then I felt movement to my right. I spun toward it. There was no sound save the rumble of raindrops beating on the SUV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get under the car,” I told Debbie. She looked at me, but in the darkness I couldn’t read her expression. “Get under the car,” I repeated. She moaned and choked as I pushed her beneath the Cherokee. It was a tight fit, but there was just enough clearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised myself into a squatting position and leaned against the car door, gun in hand, and cautiously lifted my head above the hood. Raindrops caromed off the surface and splashed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you?” I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if in answer, the handgun exploded again and a bullet smacked the front quarter panel of the car directly behind me. I fired my gun in reply; fired at nothing, hit nothing. I fired it only for the sound it made. I wanted whoever was shooting at me to know I had a gun, too. I wanted him to know that I would use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ducked and rolled across the asphalt to the rear of the Cherokee. The rain had flattened my hair and soaked my jacket, shirt, and jeans; the shirt and jeans were sticking to my skin. None of that registered at the time as I moved quickly behind the row of vehicles, keeping low, moving in the direction of the gunshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain mixed with cold perspiration. Muscles tightened in my neck and shoulders; my lungs compressed until I was taking only short sips of air; the pounding of my heart was loud in my ears; fear built. Yet my mind remained clear and pliant. The moment held no confusion for me. I understood what I must do and how to do it. For that I said a silent prayer of thanks to my skills instructors at the police academy and for what experience I had gained over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI passed half a dozen cars and vans, poked my head up a second time. I saw nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you?” I asked again, dragging breath into my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved several more car lengths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a scream, loud and painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain I refused to panic. Instead of rushing to Debbie’s side, I moved slowly and cautiously in a half-crouch back to the SUV. I halted at the rear bumper. A man was standing between my car and the one parked next to it, his gun pointed more or less at the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come outta there,” Nye growled. His face was ominous, with thin lips curled over teeth made unearthly bright by the glow of the streetlamps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my nine and leveled it at his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drop the gun, put your hands in the air,” I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNye looked at me. I had surprised him. Except not enough to drop the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a single instant that seemed much, much longer, the blood behind my eyes pulsated with a terrible sense of déjà vu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease, God, not again, my inner voice pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, “DROP THE FUCKING GUN!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNye was as startled by my voice as I was. I was moving toward him now, never lifting the front sight of the Beretta from the center of his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DROP THE FUCKING GUN. DROP THE FUCKING GUN. I’LL KILL YOUR MOTHERFUCKING ASS! I’LL KILL YOU, MOTHERFUCKER!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNye dropped his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ON YOUR KNEES. ON YOUR KNEES. HANDS BEHIND YOUR FUCKING HEAD. DO IT NOW.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to scream at him until Nye knelt and laced his fingers behind his neck. I shoved him forward. He sprawled spread-eagle on the wet asphalt. I pressed my knee against his spine and jabbed the barrel of the nine against the base of his skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t shoot me, please, don’t shoot me,” Nye said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought how different my life might have been if only I had screamed obscenities at the first guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was cold. I tried not to shiver in my rain-drenched clothes, my arms wrapped tightly across my chest, only there was nothing for it. No one had offered me a dry jacket to put on, or a blanket, or even a towel to wipe away the water that dripped from my hair and sloshed in my shoes. Certainly no one could be bothered to turn down the air-conditioning that added to my discomfort. Yet I refused to ask for those things. I didn’t want these people to think I was a wimp. Instead, I chose to suffer in silence. Well, not in complete silence. My teeth chattered periodically, and try as I might I couldn’t silence them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4/page-81.html","bookId":2222,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM"}
