The building was cooler and damper than before, and fresh graffiti had been scrawled across the walls, but otherwise it was no different. I led the way down the long corridor where Mr Tall had sneaked up on Steve and me, appearing out of the darkness with that incredible speed and silence which had been his trademark. A left turn at the end. I noted the spot where Mr Tall had taken and eaten our tickets. Back then, blue curtains had been draped across the entrance to the auditorium. There were no curtains tonight - the only change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe entered the auditorium, two abreast, Vancha and Alice in front, Debbie and Evra next (Debbie pushing Darius in front of her), then Harkat and I. Evanna drifted along further back, detached from us by distance and attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was completely black inside the auditorium. I couldn\u0027t see anything. But I could hear deep, muffled breathing, coming from somewhere far ahead of us. \"Vancha,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he whispered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we move towards it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he replied. \"It\u0027s too dark. Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute passed. Two. Three. I could feel the tension rising, both in myself and those around me. But nobody broke rank or spoke. We stood in the darkness, waiting, leaving the first move to our foes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral minutes later, without warning, spotlights were switched on overhead. Everyone gasped and I cried out loud, hunching over, covering my extra-sensitive eyes with my hands. We were defenceless for a few vital seconds. That would have been the ideal time for an attack. I expected vampaneze and vampets to fall upon us, weapons flashing - but nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are your eyes OK?\" Debbie asked, crouching beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" I groaned, slowly raising my eyelids a fraction, just enough to see out of. Even that was agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding a hand over my eyes, I squinted ahead and caught my breath. It was a good job we hadn\u0027t advanced. The entire floor of the auditorium had been torn out. In its place, spreading from one wall to the other, running from a few metres ahead of us all the way to the foot of the stage, was a giant pit, filled with sharpened stakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impressive, isn\u0027t it?\" someone called from the stage. My eyes lifted. It was hard to see, because the lights were being trained on us from above the stage, but I gradually brought the scene into focus. Dozens of tall, thick logs clotted the stage, placed vertically, ideal cover. Sticking out from behind one log near the front was the grinning face of Steve Leopard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Vancha saw Steve, he drew a shuriken and threw it at him. But Steve had picked his spot carefully and the throwing star ended up buried in the wood of the log behind which he was standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad luck, Sire,\" Steve laughed. \"Care to make it the best throw out of three?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I can get him,\" Alice muttered, stepping up past Vancha. She raised her pistol and fired, but the bullet penetrated no deeper than the shuriken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the preliminaries out of the way, or do you want to take a few more pot shots?\" Steve called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could possibly leap the pit,\" Vancha said dubiously, studying the rows of stakes between him and the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" I grunted. Even vampires had their limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see anybody else,\" Debbie whispered, casting her eyes around the auditorium. The balcony above us - from where I\u0027d spied on Steve and Mr Crepsley - could have been swarming with vampaneze and vampets, but I didn\u0027t think so - I could hear nothing overhead, not even a single heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your army?\" Vancha shouted at Steve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Around and about,\" Steve replied sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you bring them with you?\" Vancha challenged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not tonight,\" Steve said. \"I don\u0027t need them. The only people sharing the stage with me are my fairy godfather - a.k.a. Gannen Harst - a certain Righteous Vampaneze, and a very scared young snake-boy. What\u0027s his name again, R.V.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shancus,\" came the reply from behind a log to Steve\u0027s left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shancus!\" Evra roared. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no reply. My heart sank. Then R.V. pushed Shancus out from behind the log, and we saw that although his hands were tied behind his back, and he was gagged, he was still very much alive, and he looked unharmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a spirited lad,\" Steve laughed. \"A bit loud though, hence the gag. Some of the language he uses? Shocking! I don\u0027t know where kids today pick up such filthy words.\" Steve paused. \"By the way, how\u0027s my own beloved flesh and blood doing? I can\u0027t see too well from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, Dad!\" Darius shouted. \"But they killed Morgan! The grey one cut off his head with an axe!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How grisly.\" Steve didn\u0027t sound the least bit upset. \"I told you they were savages, son. No respect for life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was revenge!\" Harkat yelled. \"He killed Mr Tall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence on the stage. Steve seemed lost for words. Then, from a log close by Steve, I heard Gannen Harst call out to R.V., \"Is this true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" R.V. mumbled. \"He shot him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know he killed him?\" Steve asked. \"Tall might have simply been wounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Evanna answered, her first word of the encounter. \"He is dead. Morgan James murdered him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that you, Lady Evanna?\" Steve asked uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not up to any mischief, I hope, like siding with the vampires?\" He said it flippantly, but his anxiety was evident - he didn\u0027t fancy a clash with the Lady of the Wilds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have never taken sides between the vampires and vampaneze, and have no intention of starting now,\" Evanna said coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s OK then,\" Steve chuckled, confidence returning. \"Interesting about Mr Tall. I always thought he couldn\u0027t be killed by ordinary weapons. I\u0027d have gone after him a long time ago if I\u0027d known he could be so easily bumped off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone after him for what?\" I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harbouring criminals,\" Steve giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the only criminal here,\" I retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve sighed theatrically. \"See how they slander me, son? They soil this world with their murderous presence, then point the finger of blame elsewhere. That\u0027s always been the vampire way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to respond, then decided I\u0027d be wasting my time. \"Let\u0027s cut the crap,\" I called instead. \"You didn\u0027t lead us here for a war of words. Are you coming out from behind that log or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not!\" Steve cackled. \"Do you think I\u0027m insane? You\u0027d cut me down dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did you bring us here?\" I looked around again, nervous. I couldn\u0027t believe he hadn\u0027t laid a trap, that there weren\u0027t dozens of vampaneze or vampets slithering up on us as we talked. Yet I didn\u0027t sense a threat. I could see Vancha was confused too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to chat, Darren,\" Steve said. \"I\u0027d like to discuss a peace treaty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to laugh at that - it was such a ludicrous notion. \"Maybe you want to become my blood-brother,\" I jeered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way, I already am,\" Steve said cryptically. Then his eyes narrowed slyly. \"You missed Tommy\u0027s funeral while you were recovering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cursed fiercely but quietly. \"Why kill Tommy?\" I snarled. \"Why drag him into your warped web of revenge? Didhe \u0027betray\u0027 you too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Steve said. \"Tommy was my friend. Even while others were bad-mouthing me, he stuck by me. I had nothing against him. A great goalkeeper too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why have him killed?\" I screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Darius cut in. \"You killed Tom Jones. Morgan and R.V. tried to stop you, but? That\u0027s right, isn\u0027t it, Dad?\" he asked, and I saw the first flickers of doubt stir in the boy\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, son,\" Steve replied, \"you can\u0027t believe anything a vampire says. Pay no attention to him.\" Then, to me, he said, \"Didn\u0027t you wonder how Tommy got his ticket to the Cirque Du Freak?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just assumed?\" I stopped. \"You set him up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Steve chuckled. \"Withyour help. Remember the ticket you gave to Darius? He passed it on. Tommy was opening a sports store, signing autographs. Darius went along and \u0027swapped\u0027 his ticket for a signed football. We still have it lying around somewhere. Could be a collector\u0027s item soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sick,\" I snarled. \"Using a child to do your dirty work - disgusting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" Steve disagreed. \"It just shows how highly I value the young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I knew Steve had given Tommy the ticket, my mind raced ahead, putting the pieces of his plan together. \"You couldn\u0027t have known for sure that Tommy would run into me at the show,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I guessed he would. If he hadn\u0027t, I\u0027d have worked out some other way to manoeuvre you together. I didn\u0027t need to, but I liked the idea. Him being here at the same time as us was providence. I\u0027m just slightly miffed that Alan wasn\u0027t here too - that would have made for a complete reunion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about my cup ticket? How did you find out about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I phoned Tommy that morning,\" Steve said. \"He was astonished - first he bumps into his old pal Darren, then he hears from his old buddy Steve. What a coincidence! I faked astonishment too. I asked all about you. Learnt that you were coming to the match. He invited me as well, but I said I couldn\u0027t make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very clever,\" I complimented him icily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not especially,\" Steve said with false modesty. \"I simply used his innocence to ensnare you. Manipulating the innocent is child\u0027s play. I\u0027m surprised you didn\u0027t see through it. You need to work on your paranoia, Darren. Suspect everyone, even those beyond suspicion - that\u0027s my motto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha edged up close to me. \"If you keep him talking, maybe I can slip out back and attack him from the rear,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded my head a fraction and Vancha slid away slowly. \"Tommy told me he\u0027d been in contact with you in the past,\" I said loudly, hoping to mask the sound of Vancha\u0027s footsteps. \"He said there was something about you that he had to tell me the next time we met, after the match.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can guess what that was,\" Steve purred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Care to share it with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" he said. Then, sharply, \"If you take one more step towards that door, Mr March, the snake-boy dies.\" Vancha stopped and shot Steve a look of disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave my son alone!\" Evra screamed. He\u0027d been holding himself in check, but Steve\u0027s threat proved too much. \"If you harm him, I\u0027ll kill you! I\u0027ll put you through so much agony, you\u0027ll pray for death!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My!\" Steve cooed. \"Such vindictiveness! You seem to have the knack of driving all your friends to violence, Darren. Or do you deliberately surround yourself with violent people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stuff it!\" I grunted. Then, tiring of his verbal games, I said, \"Are you going to fight or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ialready answered that question,\" Steve said. \"We\u0027ll fight soon, have no fear, but this is neither the time nor place. There\u0027s a rear tunnel - newly carved - which we\u0027ll leave by shortly. By the time you pick your way through the stakes, we\u0027ll be far out of reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what are you waiting for?\" I snarled. \"Get the hell out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Steve said, and hisvoice was hard now. \"There\u0027s the sacrifice to make first. In the old days, a sacrifice was always made before a large battle, to appease the gods. Now, it\u0027s true that the vampaneze don\u0027t have any official gods, but to be on the safe side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Evra screamed - it was as clear to him as to the rest of us what Steve meant to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t!\" I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gannen!\" Vancha roared. \"You can\u0027t allow this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no say in it, brother,\" Gannen Harst responded from behind his log. He hadn\u0027t shown his face yet. I had the feeling he was ashamed to show it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready, R.V.?\" Steve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure about this, man,\" R.V. replied uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t disobey me!\" Steve growled. \"I made you and I can break you. Now, you bearded, armless freak - are you ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short pause. Then R.V. answered softly, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha cursed and raced forward to force his way through the pit of stakes. Harkat lumbered after him. Alice and Debbie fired on the log protecting Steve, but their bullets couldn\u0027t pierce it. I stood, clutching my knife, thinking desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a voice behind me called out shakily, \"Dad?\" Everybody paused. I looked back. Darius was trembling. \"Dad?\" he called again. \"You\u0027re not really going to kill him, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be quiet!\" Steve snapped. \"You don\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But? he\u0027s just a kid? like me. You can\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Steve roared. \"I\u0027ll explain later! Just?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I interrupted, sliding up behind Darius. \"There won\u0027t be any \u0027later\u0027. If you kill Shancus, I\u0027ll kill Darius.\" For the second time that night I felt a dark spirit grow within me, and pressed the blade of my knife to the young boy\u0027s throat. Behind me, Evanna made a small cooing noise. I ignored her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re bluffing,\" Steve jeered. \"You couldn\u0027t kill a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could,\" Debbie answered for me. She stepped away. \"Darren was going to kill him earlier. Harkat stopped him. He said we\u0027d need the boy to trade for Shancus. Otherwise Darren would have killed him. Darius - is that the truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Darius moaned. He was weeping. Part of it was fear, but an equal part was horror. His father had raised him on lies and false heroics. Only now was he beginning to realize what sort of monster he\u0027d aligned himself with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Steve mutter something. He peered out from around his log, studying us from the heights of the stage. I made no threatening moves. I didn\u0027t need to. My determination was clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Steve snorted. \"Throw away your weapons and we\u0027ll swap the two boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think we\u0027ll entrust ourselves to your untender mercies?\" Vancha huffed. \"Release Shancus and we\u0027ll turn your son over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until you shed your weapons,\" Steve insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And allow you to mow us down?\" Vancha challenged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a short pause. Then Steve threw an arrow-gun away, far across the stage. \"Gannen,\" he said, \"am I carrying any other weapons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sword and two knives,\" Gannen Harst replied immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean those,\" Steve growled. \"Do I have any long-range weapons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Gannen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you and R.V.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have none either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you don\u0027t believe a word I say,\" Steve shouted to Vancha, \"but you trust your own brother, don\u0027t you? He\u0027s a pure vampaneze - he\u0027d kill himself before he\u0027d utter a lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Vancha muttered unhappily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then throw away your weapons,\" Steve said. \"We won\u0027t attack if you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha looked to me for advice. \"Do it,\" I said. \"He\u0027s tied, just like we are. He won\u0027t risk his son\u0027s life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha was dubious, but he slipped off his belts of throwing stars and tossed them aside. Debbie threw her pistols away and so, reluctantly, did Alice. Harkat only had an axe, which he laid down on the floor beside him. I kept my knife to Darius\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve stepped out from behind the log. He was grinning. I felt a great temptation to throw my knife at him - I might just have been able to strike him from this distance - but I didn\u0027t. As a Vampire Prince, and one of the hunters of the Vampaneze Lord, I should have. But I couldn\u0027t risk missing and enraging Steve. He\u0027d kill Shancus if I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out you come, boys,\" Steve said. Gannen Harst and R.V. emerged from behind their logs, R.V. shoving the bound Shancus ahead of him. Gannen Harst was typically grim-faced, but R.V. was smiling. At first I thought it was a mocking smile, but then I realized it was a smile of relief - he was delighted he hadn\u0027t been called upon to kill the snake-boy. R.V. was a twisted, bitter, crazy man, but I saw then that he wasn\u0027t entirely evil - not like Steve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take the reptile,\" Steve said, reaching for Shancus. \"You go get the plank and extend it across the pit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.V. handed Shancus to Steve and retreated to the rear of the stage. He started dragging a long plank forward. It was awkward for him - he couldn\u0027t get a decent grip, because of the hooks Mr Tall had torn off. Gannen went to help him, keeping one eye on us. The pair began feeding the plank across the pit, letting it rest on blunt-tipped stakes, which I could now see had been placed there specifically for this purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve watched us like a hawk while R.V. and Gannen were busy with the plank. He was holding Shancus in front of him, stroking the snake-boy\u0027s long green hair. I didn\u0027t like the way he was looking at us - I felt as though we were being X-rayed - but I said nothing, willing R.V. and Gannen to hurry up with the plank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve\u0027s eyes lingered on Evra a long moment - he was smiling hopefully, hands half-reaching out to his son - then settled on me. He stopped stroking Shancus\u0027s hair and gently placed a hand on either side of his head. \"Remember the games we played when we were children?\" he asked craftily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What games?\" I frowned. I had a terrible feeling - a sense of total doom - but I could do nothing but follow his lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Dare\u0027 games,\" Steve said, and something in his voice made R.V. and Gannen pause and look around. Steve\u0027s face was expressionless, but his eyes were alive with insane glee. \"One of us would say, \u0027I dare you to do this,\u0027 and stick his hand in a fire or jab a pin in his leg. The other would have to copy him. Remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I moaned. I knew what was coming. I knew I couldn\u0027t stop it. I knew I\u0027d been a fool and made a fool\u0027s mistake - I\u0027d assumed Steve was even the slightest bit human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dare you to do this, Darren,\" Steve whispered dreadfully. Before I could reply - before anything else could happen - he seized Shancus\u0027s head tightly and twisted it sharply to the left, then the right. Shancus\u0027s neck snapped. Steve dropped him. Shancus fell to the floor. Steve had killed him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-shadows-the-saga-of-darren-shan-11/page-22.html","bookId":2447,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM"}
