I was able to stop pretending I was something I wasn’t and finally be who I really wanted to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And he’s been a lot better tempered ever since,” Tad added with a smug grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicity gaped between the two of them before shaking her head. “Um…wow. Okay. Uh, that’s great, I guess. I’m happy for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett glanced at her, and for the first time that evening, he actually looked contrite. “I hope you can forgive me someday for the way I always treated you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh…” She nodded. “Okay. Yeah. Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that seemed to be that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever happened with City’s brother and his boyfriend after their attempt at making amends was pretty unremarkable. Either that or I was still too stunned from the first half of the conversation to pay much attention to the rest of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTad and Garrett drank a beer, and eventually left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they were gone, City whirled to me. “Was it just me, or was that totally bizarre?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was fucking bizarre,” I agreed, but at least I didn’t have to worry about her family, not the way I worried about mine. I glanced toward the stage. Rock was glaring at me from behind the drum set where he was currently playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted back to City to warn her once more to steer clear of him, but she was already moving away, and Eva was dodging in front of me. “Knox, I command you to come out here and dance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh…I’m working.” And the place was busy as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” Pick waved me away as he slid behind the counter. “Get out there on the dance floor, now, and give my woman what she wants. I got this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I let Eva lead me out to a spot where other couples were moving to the song’s fast beat. As I dragged my feet behind her, she motioned to Asher, who winked back. Then she turned to me and frowned when she saw my expression. “What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.” I shook my head. “It’s just…I’ve never danced with anyone but Felicity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile on Eva’s face softened. “Then you should definitely dance with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. “But I thought you wanted to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wanted you to dance,” she said, backing away. “It didn’t have to be with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one last grin, she hurried to where City was delivering a round of drinks to a table full of guys. Taking over her tray to serve them herself, Eva waved City toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrooking my finger, I motioned her to come closer. Smiling mischievously, she drew forward as Asher leaned into the microphone and announced, “This cover’s for the newest Forbidden couple. Enjoy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew my woman into my arms as the band started John Legends’ “All of me.” City shuddered and cuddled closer. “I love this song.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed her ear. “I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her face, she grinned at me and hugged her arms around my waist. “You have no idea how much I adore hearing that. I never thought I’d hear you say it to me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, get used to hearing it every day, because I plan on saying it to you at least that often.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnuggling against my chest, she pressed her mouth to my neck. “It might take a lot of days for me to get used to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I guess I’ll have to say it for years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glowed happily. “Works for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song came to an end way before I was ready, and Eva hurried over, looking frantic. “Okay, waitressing sucks. Felicity, take this damn thing back.” She poked the serving tray at City and then arched an eyebrow at me. “And you. Fetch me my Pick. I really do want to dance now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo City and I returned to our jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was feeling pretty good by the time closing came around. The other bartenders as well as all their women, along with Pick and Eva, lingered, telling stories while the rest of us cleaned. On stage, the band cleared their set. I’d been keeping an eye on Rock until Ten and Noel distracted me with a story about Pick beating the hell out of Skylar’s biological father when he caught him hitting Eva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Eva leaned into Pick and grinned up at him as she sighed, “My protective hero,” I shifted my attention toward City, but she was frowning at Pick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFolding her arms over her chest, she said, “Speaking of men and their overly protective instincts, would you finally like to confess to Knox here that no one’s been threatening me or leaving notes on my break room locker, Pick?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-144.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
