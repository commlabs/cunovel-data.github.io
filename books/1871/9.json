{"id":82769,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eI met Alexander at the Evans Park covered bridge the following night. The old pedestrian bridge was unused and unkempt. Wooden slatted shingles worn off over the years had gone unfixed. Paint had chipped away. Even the birds nests were forgotten. I always thought the bridge was beautiful. A trickling creek ran beneath it and a tiny broken bench overlooked a dead bed of flowers. Tonight, however, I found the bridge decorated with twinkling yellow and white lights, which hung like sparkling icicles, making it a truly romantic and magical scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crept inside to find a table with a flickering candelabra on it and two champagne glasses filled with soda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander emerged from the shadows, dreamy and gorgeous. I was breathless. There wasnt a place Id rather be than in Alexanders presence. I rushed to him and squeezed him with all my might. It seemed like ages since we had been alone, and I planned to take advantage of our solitude. My fingers begged to touch his skin, to feel my boyfriend close, sense his breath against mine. His strong hands grasped my smaller ones and he intently kissed them, as if he, too, had missed our moments together. I gently stroked his face and ran my fingers over his lips, my black nail polish in striking contrast to his alabaster skin and pale red mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander and I had only a short time for our date. Becky was in the safe company of Matt and the soccer snobs at a scrimmage, and Jameson was doing his best to keep Sebastian entertained with a newly purchased Guitar Hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI curled up in Alexanders arms. The electricity between the two of us seemed unbreakable. When he kissed my neck, I wondered if it was as much a torture for him as it was for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander had the power at any moment to turn mewhether I wanted him to or not. Was he thinking what it would be like to pierce his fangs into me and take my blood into his? But Alexander was thoughtful and cautious. If I were in the arms of another kind of vampire, perhaps like Jagger or Sebastian, I might have blood dripping down my neck. I wondered and admired how he could be so different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dont know how you do it. Sebastian cant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts not easy. Im sitting with the most gorgeous girl Ive ever seen in my life and she wants to be a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI melted at his compliment. It seems easy to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldnt help but want to be bittenif only to become a vampire before my best friend did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few pings of raindrops began to hit the roof of the bridge. A few moments later, it began to pour. It only added to our magically romantic night. I snuggled even closer to Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine it, I began. Wed live in the Mansion together. Id make you smoothies, and if we ran outthen youd have me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWed have a beautiful coffin together, I continued. Id decorate it with the most comfy pillows and blankets and tiny portraits that youd paint of us. And we could wire it so we could listen to morbidly melodic music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could take you to Romania and you could see my home, Alexander added. We would dine outside on our balcony overlooking the twinkling city lights with my parents, and Id take you into town and wed dance until dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was excited by Alexanders enthusiasm. Youd become a famous painter and Id be an editor of a gothic magazine, I continued. Wed travel to Paris for your showings and wed attend gothic fashion shows. Wed hang out all night long and sleep all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you do that now, he joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy myself. But if I were like youwed never have to be apart again, I said. Wed be together, hidden away from the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd holding hands in the moonlight, he imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoud never be alone. Not for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for one moment? he asked coyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, maybe one. If you wanted some space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForget it, he assured me. Ive been waiting for you all my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander kissed me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe wouldnt only have stolen moments like tonight, I urged. Wed be together longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaindrops continued to fall against the roof as he kissed my wrist. My vein showed prominently. Alexanders attention was drawn to my blue blood vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you ready? I asked. Were not on sacred ground, but we could go to the cemetery. We could finally be together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander paused. He stared deeply into my eyes, and so intently, I felt as if I were staring back into his soul. Then suddenly he turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts not fair, I said, clasping my hands. Sebastian wants to turn Becky and you dont want to turn me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander sat up. First of all, he doesnt. He feels strongly for herand now that hes crossed the line hes put all of us in jeopardy. He tasted her blood. He has a stronger pull to her than he already had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a mistake to have brought up Sebastian. Now Id distracted Alexander from his thoughts about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, I said. Its just that sometimes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaven, its hard enough for mewith you, as we are right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldnt push him any further. Id already spoiled his mood and the gorgeous night hed created for me. I could tell he was just as concerned for Sebastian as he was for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I shouldnt have let him in, he lamented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you kidding? Hes your best friend. Sebastian is a sweetie, I reassured Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHes much more impulsive than I am. Kind of like someone else I know, he said, lightening up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHes just fallen for the wrong girl, I said with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we have to find someone else for Sebastian to fall for, Alexander thought aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThats a great idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hasnt really had a steady girlfriend. Not only would this be helpful for Becky, but it would truly be helpful to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so touchednot only that Alexander was concerned for the welfare of my best friend, but that he felt such responsibility and loyalty for his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother mortal? I asked. I thought about the Dullsvillian girls who had plagued me all my life. Theres a bunch of cheerleaders at school that I certainly wouldnt miss, I offered. But on second thought, I refuse to let one of them be turned before I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, my boyfriend said. She has to be a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm afraid Im short on vampire girls here, I said. But then I had a thought. But in Hipsterville, theres a whole club full!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander lit up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know two very eligible ones. Onyx and Scarlet. One of them could be a perfect match!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do we get them here? he wondered aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, I have no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLets think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are party girls, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen well have a party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThats awesome! I love parties. Though truth be told, I havent hosted manyor, in fact, any. No one would show up besides Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be a small, intimate gathering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShall we have it at the cemetery?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander disagreed. Well have it at the Mansion. That way it will be discreet and no one will find out about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Alexander a huge hug. I was excited to be hosting a party and thrilled at the prospect of seeing Scarlet and Onyx again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how are we going to invite them? he finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached into my purse and took out my cell phone. I have them on speed dial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes of canoodling, I strolled outside the covered bridge to get more light from the streetlamp. I avoided a few puddles, as the rain had ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrolled to Scarlets contact number and pressed send. The line began to ring. And ring. And ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs she there? Alexander asked impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, someone picked up. I could hear the pounding of loud music with overloaded bass in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlet? I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello? I barely heard her voice. Hello?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the phone went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dont think she wants to speak to me, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think she probably cant hear you. That club can be deafening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIll try again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed redial and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time she picked up right away. Raven, is that you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! Can you hear me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavenis that you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think its Ravenbut I cant hear her, she said to someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlet? Onyx? Are you there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call was dropped. All I heard was my own voice shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess well have to try later, Alexander said, resigned. He wiped off the damp bench with a tissue he had in his pocket and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she cant hear my invite, then maybe she can see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down next to Alexander and texted as fast as I could. He peered over my shoulder, curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnyx and Scarlet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMansion Mayhem!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMansion on top of Benson Hill only a few towns away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday Night @ Sunset\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what? he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she sees the message, it could be within a minute.
