I need to be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave leaned back in his desk chair, continued to scan Phoebe\u0027s face. \"First, it\u0027s not my call. Second, this is Liz Alberta\u0027s case. You\u0027re the victim. If you have trouble remembering that, I can have a mirror brought in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew how she looked. A couple of days meant some of the bruising was turning from black to sickly yellow and storm-cloud purple. Her jaw and eye were angry watercolors. Still, the worst of it was decently hidden under her clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The victim needs it. I need to sit in that room, look Arnold Meeks in the eye so he knows I\u0027m not afraid of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough that I need to show him, and myself, that I\u0027m not going to be. You and I know how the pathology works. How it is for someone who\u0027s held against their will, threatened or injured in a situation beyond their control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t identifying an attacker in a lineup, Phoebe. Or facing the attacker in court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just more proactive. My mother faced Reuben in court. She got up on the stand to testify while he was only feet away from her, and I know that was nearly as terrifying for her as being trapped in that house with him all those hours. But she did it, and still she\u0027s trapped.\" All the affection and understanding he felt was there to read on his face. \"You\u0027re not your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, b u\u0027t...\" Phoebe fisted a hand on her heart. \"I feel her fear, and I don\u0027t want it living inside me. How can I do what I need to do if it finds a place to live in me? So this victim needs it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Observation,\" he began, though they both knew he was losing ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t enough.\" She shook her head. \"Face-to-face, and this time I know he won\u0027t be controlling the situation. The cop wants to be in that room with him because I may be able to help Liz get a confession out of him. I was there. Victim, witness, police officer. Makes me a triple threat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And still doesn\u0027t make it my call. It\u0027s up to Detective Alberta, her captain and the DA. The DA,\" Dave continued before she could speak, \"who fishes with Arnie\u0027s daddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever he fishes with, Parnell\u0027s always struck me as solid. Do you really think he\u0027ll ease off an investigation of an attack on a police officer because he\u0027s buddied up with the father of a suspect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a lot of who-you-know in Savannah, Phoebe, just like anywhere else. But I\u0027ll agree, Parnell\u0027s solid. Meeks is bringing his delegate and a lawyer in with him. Annie Utz is lawyered, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the more reason for me to give Liz-Detective Alberta-some backup-someone well invested who doesn\u0027t give a damn who Arnie\u0027s daddy drowns worms with. And I\u0027ll tell you something else. Having two women question him, put pressure on him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wandered the office as she spoke now, because she could feel it, she could see it. She could all but taste it. \"Oh, Arnie\u0027s not going to like that one little bit. He\u0027ll make a mistake. He\u0027ll end up leading with his ego, especially if I\u0027m in there. Not your call, Captain, but you could make one. You could reach out to Detective Alberta\u0027s captain or her lieutenant, ask that I get a seat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make a call, but I\u0027m not making any promises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any worthwhile negotiator\u0027s careful with his promises.\" She touched a hand to his shoulder. \"The call\u0027s enough. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you buy a ticket into the interrogation, have to deal with him that way, I might not have done you any favor. How\u0027s your family handling this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It shook them up. My mother... you know how it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. Would me coming by help things or add to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mama always feels better after a visit from you. We all do. Why don\u0027t you come to Sunday dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicked back in his chair. \"Would that mean sugar-glazed ham?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be arranged. Thanks for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phoebe...\" Straightening again, he cleared his throat. \"I want to say I regret there\u0027s been any speculation or gossip inside the department regarding an inappropriate relationship between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as me giving you bj\u0027s in your office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jesus.\" The tips of his ears went pink, as she knew they did when he was mortally embarrassed. \"I\u0027m old enough to be your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, you\u0027d have been a very precocious fifteen to have pulled that one off. Second, since when does age factor into inappropriate sexual behavior? Neither of us is responsible for the speculation of small, ugly minds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up a ballpoint pen, clicked it a few times. \"I opened you up for this when I asked you to take the desk in this department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave me an opportunity-which I grabbed-to do the work I\u0027m good at. Am I qualified for the desk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meeks, junior and/or senior, may push this into IAB.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we can both stand up to that, should that happen. Don\u0027t worry about me in this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did. Even as he lifted the phone to put in the call she\u0027d asked for, he worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe had a moment alone in Observation, studying Arnie Meeks through the two-way mirror. He looked careless, she decided. Carelessly confident. A kind of screw-you posture of a man who believes whatever he\u0027s done isn\u0027t going to stick to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d know he was being watched, or could be watched at any time. He didn\u0027t give a damn, Phoebe concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when she imagined his hands on her, his fingers inside her, her stomach rolled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave too much of a damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant.\" Liz stepped in with a tall, reed-thin brunette. \"ADA Monica Witt, Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant.\" Monica shook hands with Phoebe. \"How are you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better, thanks. I take it you\u0027ll be prosecuting the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you can make one. We have Annie Utz\u0027s statement, and her phone, which shows an outgoing call at nine fifty-eight. We can\u0027t tie that to Arnold Meeks. The number called was to a toss-away phone, untraceable. We don\u0027t have any physical evidence linking Meeks to the attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have motive. You have opportunity, and a pattern of insubordinate and threatening behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My boss wants more than that to charge a police officer with assault and battery, with sexual assault on a fellow officer. Get me more, and I\u0027ll charge him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men stepped in. Phoebe recognized Liz\u0027s lieutenant, nodded in acknowledgment. Just as she recognized, through the strong family resemblance, Arnie Meeks\u0027s father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was thicker than his son through the chest, stronger along the jawline, harder in the eyes. But there was no mistaking the relationship. Just as there was no mistaking the insulted anger that pumped off him despite his ramrod posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant Anthony and Sergeant Meeks will also be observing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get started.\" Liz walked to the door, held it open as Phoebe followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When my boy\u0027s clear of this,\" Sergeant Meeks said as he shifted to block Phoebe\u0027s path, \"and his suspension lifted, this won\u0027t be over for you, Lieutenant MacNamara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sergeant, you\u0027re here as a courtesy.\" Anthony laid a hand on his arm. \"Don\u0027t abuse that courtesy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe moved around him to the door of the interrogation room. \"Like father,\" she said under her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shake it off,\" Liz advised. \"I take the lead on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been this round before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a friendly reminder.\" Opening the door, she walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t spare Liz so much as a look, Phoebe noted. His eyes aimed straight for her, held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys.\" Liz smiled easily, with a nod toward the trio at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set the recorder, fed in the data, read Arnie his rights. \"You understand all that, Officer Meeks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve given the Miranda enough times, I better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I understand my rights. Shouldn\u0027t you be in bed somewhere with an ice pack and some Darvon?\" he asked Phoebe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arnie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArnie shrugged off the quiet warning from his attorney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised by your concern, Arnie,\" Liz began. \"The way I hear it, you\u0027re not Lieutenant MacNamara\u0027s biggest fan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think much of her as a cop. Then again, she\u0027s not much of one seeing as all she does is talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll save your definition of \u0027much of a cop\u0027 for later, if it\u0027s all the same to you.\" Smooth as top cream, Liz kept an easy smile on her face. \"The two of you-meaning you and Lieutenant MacNamara-have had a couple of set-tos recently. Is that true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My client stipulates that he and Lieutenant MacNamara hold opposing viewpoints and professional styles. Those are hardly motives for a physical attack on her person. The lack of evidence-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re talking here,\" Liz said. \"Just getting things out on the table. Arnie, you don\u0027t much like Lieutenant MacNamara. Is that fair to say?\" Arnie kept his smirk aimed at Phoebe. \"Yeah, that\u0027s fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have occasion to call Lieutenant MacNamara a bitch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I call them as I see them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, she\u0027s a bitch?\" At Arnie\u0027s shrug, Liz nodded. \"And you have no particular problem calling a superior officer a bitch? No problem threatening her when she took disciplinary action?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s only Lieutenant MacNamara\u0027s word on this alleged threat,\" the lawyer interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, and...\" Liz flipped through her file. \"The statements of two detectives who observed your client in the lieutenant\u0027s office behaving in what they believed was a threatening manner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their beliefs aren\u0027t fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arnie, do you remember why you were in Lieutenant MacNamara\u0027s office on Thursday last?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I do. She was covering her ass after she screwed up a hostage negotiation by suspending me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Liz turned round eyes on Phoebe. \"My goodness, if that was the case, who could blame you for calling her a bitch? Why don\u0027t we pull out a few statements and reports on that negotiation-at which you were the first responder-just to get the overview? Hmmm. FR did not call for backup. FR did not begin a log... Ah, here\u0027s a good one. FR antagonized the HT with threats. I like this one, too: Officer Meeks hampered and attempted to block Lieutenant MacNamara\u0027s contact with the HT.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArnie rocked back in his chair, balanced on its back legs, rocked up again. \"She can write anything she wants. Doesn\u0027t mean that\u0027s how it went down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, all those examples are from witnesses-civilian and law enforcement. Well now, reading all this, it looks like you screwed things up there, Arnie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had the situation under control until she pushed into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you just needed a little more time to resolve the matter, and she didn\u0027t give it to you.\" Lips pursed, Liz nodded. \"The guy blows his brains out, and you get the rap. Then, the bitch suspends you. I\u0027d be pissed, too. Hard to blame you for wanting to pay her back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArnie smiled, shoved his hand at his lawyer before the lawyer could speak. \"Just shut up. She\u0027s insulting me thinking she can bait me into saying something stupid. What about you?\" he said to Phoebe. \"Nothing to say for a change?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just sitting here wondering how your wife feels about all this. How she feels about you diddling with Annie Utz, for instance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smirk twisted his lips. \"Annie\u0027s cute, and thick as a brick. I flirted, I admit it. Every guy in the squad did. But when she came on to me, when she wanted to take it past a wink, I set her straight. Got her feelings hurt, so I guess she figured to pay me back with this wild story. Or you pushed her to lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe looked over at Liz. \"The man\u0027s surrounded by liars and bitches. It\u0027s a wonder he gets through the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how he gets out of bed in the morning. So Annie\u0027s lying when she states you and she had a sexual relationship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned widely, shook his finger. \"I never had sex with that woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cute,\" Liz acknowledged. \"And really adorable when you consider Annie states that relationship was limited to oral sex. A blurry line, I grant you. She \u0027came on\u0027 to you, that\u0027s what you said, and that\u0027s funny, too. In her statement she uses that same phrase. You told her Lieutenant MacNamara came on to you. And when you, being the moral, upstanding type, turned her down, she got her feelings hurt and looked for payback. My God, man, the women just make your life a living hell. I have to tell you, I\u0027m actively restraining myself from coming on to you right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it up, Detective,\" the lawyer warned, \"and this interview is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just going with what seems to be a pattern. You were in the building Monday morning between nine and ten A.M., Officer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. I had some things I wanted out of my locker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It took you an hour to get some things out of your locker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hung around. I\u0027m a cop,\" he said with some irritation. \"This is my house. I\u0027m supposed to be here. I\u0027m supposed to be doing the job. And I would be if it wasn\u0027t for her and the stick up her ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now she\u0027s a bitch with a stick up her ass who came on to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I call them like I see them, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was Annie who said Lieutenant MacNamara came on to you.\" Liz smiled pleasantly when annoyance crossed Arnie\u0027s face. \"I think you\u0027re getting your excuses and lies mixed up here. But it\u0027s easy to see why. It\u0027s hard to tell one bitch from the other, isn\u0027t it? We\u0027re all pretty much the same. You didn\u0027t need to see Phoebe\u0027s face when you punched your fist into it. You didn\u0027t need to hear her scream or cry or curse you when you shoved her down, ripped her clothes to shreds. Of course, it didn\u0027t take any balls to do that, not when her hands were cuffed. I guess one man\u0027s payback is another man\u0027s cowardice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m man enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man enough to use one woman to ambush another.\" The sugary tone was a thing of the past now as Liz whipped out the words. \"Man enough to lie in wait like a snake in the grass. And the only way you could put your hands on her was to cuff her, to knock her down. That\u0027s the only way you could get her naked and put hands on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was never in that stairway,\" Arnie shot back. \"I never touched her. I got better things to do with my time. I sure got better things to do with my fingers.\" He flipped the middle one at Phoebe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She never said anything about fingers,\" Phoebe said quietly. \"She said hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat back. \"Hands, fingers. Same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really not.\" There was a hot ball jammed between her belly and her heart, hard and hot. She needed it to break apart and dissolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe victim needed it, she thought, to kill the fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You rammed them inside me. You son of a bitch.\" She surged to her feet, ignoring the lawyer\u0027s objections as she leaned across the table. \"You smelled like baby powder, just like you do now. Under the sweat. Because you\u0027re starting to sweat, Arnie. Do you remember what you said to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t remember something I didn\u0027t say. I wasn\u0027t there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you didn\u0027t fuck my kind. I figure you didn\u0027t use your dick because it\u0027s too small to make an impression. Your kind can\u0027t get it up half the time anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad you didn\u0027t break your neck in the fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This interview\u0027s over,\" the lawyer announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should\u0027ve pushed me harder. Maybe if I\u0027d broken something, you\u0027d have gotten a decent boner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should\u0027ve kicked you down the damn stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eased back, nodded as that hard, hot ball began to dissolve. \"Your mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said, this interview is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine.\" Liz rose. \"We\u0027ll just move right along, then. Officer Meeks, you\u0027re under arrest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe went straight to her office, closed herself in, and did something she rarely did. She lowered and closed her blinds. Carefully, she sat behind her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything seemed to be throbbing at once. Emotional upheaval, stress, she told herself. All of it pushing the physical discomfort up several notches. She couldn\u0027t take a pill, not here. They made her sleepy and fuzzy-headed, so she settled for four Motrin. And watched her hands shake on the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, the ball was dissolving, she thought, and there was a price to pay for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer the knock on her door, and thought only, Go away. Give me five damn minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the door opened, and Liz stepped in. \"Sorry. How you holding up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got the shakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t have them in there, when it counted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looked at me, he looked me right in the eye. He was glad he hurt me. He only wished he\u0027d hurt me more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s what did him,\" Liz pointed out. \"I don\u0027t care how coached he is by his lawyer, it\u0027s going to show. He can\u0027t resist, he can\u0027t control it. When this goes to trial-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not going to trial, Liz. We both know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz walked around the desk, sat on the edge. \"Okay, yeah. They\u0027ll make a deal. The department, the DA, nobody\u0027s going to want a public trial, and the publicity that goes with it. And even with what happened in interrogation, the case is a little shaky. Strong enough so Arnie\u0027s lawyer knows to take a deal when it\u0027s offered. He\u0027s going to lose his badge, Phoebe, and he\u0027s going to be disgraced. Is that going to be enough for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll have to be. I appreciate all you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You pulled plenty of the weight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Phoebe said when Liz got up. \"I know this nice bar-Irish pub on River Street. I\u0027d like to buy you a drink. I need a few days\u0027 grace on it, until my vanity lets me go out in public.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, just let me know. Take care, Phoebe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown in Holding, Arnie paced his cell. They\u0027d arrested him, booked him. Goddamn useless lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddamn bitches screwed it all up. Assault, battery, sexual molestation. Railroading him, that\u0027s what they were doing, all because that cunt couldn\u0027t handle a few bruises she\u0027d damn well earned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wouldn\u0027t stick. No possible way they could make it stick. He whipped around when the door slid open, and bit back the words that wanted to spew out only because his father shook his head when he came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Arnie held them in until the guard stepped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t make this bullshit stick,\" Arnie began. \"She\u0027s not going to get away with locking me up like this, with embarrassing me in front of my fellow officers. That bitch-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down. Shut up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArnie sat, but he couldn\u0027t shut up. \"You see how they put a girl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eADA on it? Circle the fucking wagons. What\u0027s Chuck thinking, for God\u0027s sake?\" Arnie demanded, speaking of the DA. \"Why didn\u0027t he just kick this in the first place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s getting the arraignment pushed up, and he\u0027s going to recommend ROR.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Jesus, that\u0027s just great.\" In disgust Arnie threw his hands up. \"I get charged for this bullshit, but released on my own recogni zance, and that makes it okay? Fuck that, Pa. I could lose my badge. You need to reach out to IAB, get an investigation on MacNamara. You know McVee\u0027s dipping his wick in that. You know that\u0027s why I\u0027m in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMouth tight, Sergeant Meeks stared down at his son. \"You\u0027re in here because you couldn\u0027t keep your mouth shut, just like now. I\u0027m going to ask you one time. Just you and me. I\u0027m going to ask this one time, and I want the truth. You lie, I\u0027ll see it. I see it, and I walk out of here, and that\u0027s the last I\u0027ll do for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger faded away into shock, and the first trickle of fear. \"Christ, Pa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you do this thing? You look at me, Arnie. Did you do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you lucking lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She suspended me. She used me as a goat. You taught me to stand up for myself, not to take shit off anyone. If you got to kick an ass, you kick it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeeks stared. \"Did I teach you to use your fists on a woman, boy? Did I teach you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wouldn\u0027t get off my back. She-\" He broke off, eyes watering, burning, when his father\u0027s hand slapped across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I teach you to jump a superior officer from behind, like a coward? I taught you to be a man, goddamn it, not to hide in some stairwell and beat on a woman. You\u0027re a disgrace to me, to the family name, to the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They come at you, you come back harder. That\u0027s what you taught me. That\u0027s what I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t see the difference, there\u0027s nothing I can say.\" Wearily, Meeks got to his feet. \"I\u0027ll use what I\u0027ve got to fix this for you, the best\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can. You\u0027re my son, so I\u0027ll do it for you, for your mother, for my grandson. But you\u0027re done on the job, Arnie. If I could fix that, I wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how are you going to hold your head up, if you don\u0027t have your son following you on the job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll get you out of this, the best I can. After that, I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only did what I thought you\u0027d do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I believed that, I\u0027d feel sicker than I do now.\" Meeks walked over to the cell door, set his jaw. \"On the gate!\" he called, then left his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Sunday, Phoebe decided to ditch the sling. She was tired of it, tired of the meds, tired of the bruises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she had to admit she was tired of having to fight back the need to whine and complain so that she could ease her family back into routine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she felt better when she stepped out of the shower, especially if she avoided any glimpse of herself in the mirror. She managed to get her robe on without too much of a struggle, and decided she\u0027d probably not only last through Sunday dinner, but maybe even make it until the crazy hour of ten o\u0027clock that night before her energy just drained out like water from a sieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked into her bedroom just as her sister-in-law walked through the door. \"Knock, knock,\" Josie said with a big smile. \"How\u0027s the patient today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve crossed myself off the disabled list, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be the judge of that. Let her drop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Josie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie\u0027s smile only widened. She was barely five-two, weighed in at maybe one-ten fully dressed, and behind that angelic smile was a hardass that would make Nurse Ratched tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop the robe, sweets, or I\u0027ll tell your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t I know. I\u0027m going to run away to Atlanta, get myself an apartment and leave no forwarding address.\" But Phoebe dropped the robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSympathy shone in Josie\u0027s big brown eyes, but her voice was brisk. \"Bruising\u0027s fading. The hip looks a lot better. That shoulder has to be painful yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s coming along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the range of motion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m still grateful I\u0027ve got some front-hook bras, but it\u0027s improving.\" Josie took Phoebe\u0027s hands, turned them over. If truth be told, those injuries hurt her heart more than the rest. \"Wrist lacerations look pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitching sore if you want the truth. Can I regain my modesty now?\" Josie picked up the robe, helped Phoebe into it. \"Any trouble with your vision in that eye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s clear. And before you ask, the headaches are fewer and less intense. I can poke at my jaw without feeling like I\u0027ve drilled a spike through it and into my brain. All in all, not too bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re healing well. Helps that you\u0027re young and in excellent physical shape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew those damn Pilates were good for something. You didn\u0027t have to come by to check on me, Jo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get the bonus round because I came early so Ava can teach me to bake lemon meringue pie. Which you know she\u0027s making because it\u0027s Dave\u0027s favorite. Why doesn\u0027t she just jump that man and get the ball rolling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I knew.\" Phoebe moved to her dresser for underwear. \"In all these years it\u0027s the first time they\u0027ve both been free at the same time. His divorce has been final for almost two years now. But they\u0027re both still playing just friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could set them up on a blind date. You know, you tell him you\u0027ve got somebody, and I tell her, and we don\u0027t tell either the somebodies are each other. And then-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both get our butts burned for meddling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie pouted. \"That\u0027s what Carter said when I tried the idea out on him. Well, I\u0027m giving them six months more, then I\u0027m risking my butt. Want me to help you get dressed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just between us now?\" Josie watched Phoebe\u0027s range of motion as Phoebe eased into a shirt, and judged it improved. \"How are you doing otherwise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I know the symptoms of posttraumatic stress. I\u0027ve had some unpleasant dreams. It\u0027s natural.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s also natural for stress to bottle up when you feel obligated to keep it inside and not upset the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I need to spew, I have my ways. Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m back on the job full-time next week. That helps me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Call if you need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo prove to herself as well as her family that things were approaching normal, Phoebe dressed with some care. The bold blue color of the shirt cheered her up enough to nudge her into taking some time with makeup. Then more time as she realized if she just kept blending, the bruises went from a shout to a murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she got downstairs, the kitchen was full of women cooking. It didn\u0027t hurt her feelings at all to be banished out to the courtyard and the sunshine with Carter and Carly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mama!\" Carly flew across the bricks. \"I kicked Uncle Carter\u0027s butt at jacks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a sissy game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says that when he loses,\" Carly announced. \"Do you want to play the champ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m up to sitting on the ground yet, baby. Give me another week, and we\u0027ll see whose butt gets kicked. You better practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going in for a drink, okay? Whipping Uncle Carter was thirsty work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart-mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarly grinned at her uncle and ran for the door. With a sigh, Phoebe sat on the circular bench around the courtyard\u0027s little fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, she could not only see Ava\u0027s roses but smell them. She could hear the birds sing, and admire the tenacity of the thyme and chamomile that spread between the cracks of the pavers, the sweet faces of the violas that danced around a copper birdbath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, with the brick walls and wrought-iron gates, Ava had created a personal sanctuary where shade dappled through moss onto benches and tea olives perfumed the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God! It feels good to sit outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josie give you the thumbs-up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat, slipped an arm around Phoebe\u0027s shoulders. \"We get to worry about you. It\u0027s part of the package.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned her head on his shoulder. \"We all had a scare. It\u0027s over now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember how long it took me to get over being scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carter, you were just a little guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter, and you know it. You looked after me. And you stood between me and Cousin Bess for years after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old bitch. Which is mean and ungrateful, however true, when we\u0027re sitting here in her pretty courtyard while other people are baking pies and ham in the kitchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Ava\u0027s courtyard,\" Carter said, and made Phoebe smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is. And really, even during the tyrant\u0027s reign, it was Ava\u0027s. Do you ever think how she was younger than we are now when she started working here? Barely twenty-two, wasn\u0027t she? And to have the spine to stick it out, to stand up to Cousin Bess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had it at twelve,\" Carter reminded her. \"And you\u0027re still looking after us. She knew you\u0027d stay because Mama has to. She could\u0027ve left Mama the house, after all Mama did for her, but she put it on you, with strings. Locked you in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no point in denying the truth, every word of truth. And still, it was too lovely a day for bitter old memories. \"Locked me in this beautiful house, where my daughter thrives. It\u0027s not what we can call a sacrifice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is. It always was. You let me walk away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a firm grip on his hand. \"Not very far. I don\u0027t think I could stand it if you went very far away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, pressed his lips to her hair. \"I\u0027d miss you too much. But I\u0027ll tell you one thing, Phoebs, I never knew how much I needed to move out of this house until I did it. You never really had a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had my time away.\" College, Quantico, my disaster of a marriage. \"I\u0027m happy to be back. I especially like being able to sit out here while three other women put Sunday dinner together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s only because you\u0027re a lousy cook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lousy\u0027s an exaggeration. I\u0027m an unreliable cook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re reliably lousy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and poked him in the ribs. \"You burn even the thought of food, so you\u0027re one to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why they invented takeout and delivery. You won\u0027t need to cook if you play your cards right with the rich guy. He\u0027s probably got a couple of chefs on staff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to you.\" She gave him another, zestier poke. \"Playing my cards. Plus, I don\u0027t think he actually has a staff.\" She frowned over that a moment. She didn\u0027t think he had one, but really, how would she know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see he sent more flowers. Looked like a few thousand of them in the parlor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple dozen lilacs.\" That smelled so, so lovely. \"He seems to be a man who likes to make gestures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got the look from Josie when she saw them.\" Hissing out a breath, Carter narrowed his eyes at the kitchen windows. \"Guys who make gestures make other guys make gestures, and now I\u0027m going to have to remember to bring home flowers next week like I thought of it myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ought to think of it yourself. I have no sympathy for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought her home her favorite panini and a cheap bottle of wine just a few days ago, and I ought to get credit for it. But I\u0027m outdone by some forest of lilacs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You used the cheap wine to get lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"\u0027Course I did. Well, megabucks aside, and having only met him once, I already like him more than I did Roy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never liked Roy at all, so that\u0027s not saying much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted, pointed in that smug, brotherly way. \"And who was right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. \"You were. Shut up. Besides, I got the grand prize out of the bastard.\" She looked over as the door slammed open and Carly raced out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mama! Uncle Dave\u0027s here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute he stepped out, the instant Phoebe saw his face, she knew. She kept her own blank as she pushed to her feet. \"Carter, I want to talk to Dave just a minute. Can you take Carly in, keep her occupied?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Hey, Dave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t shake as many men did, or do the one-armed, backslapping man hug as others did. They hugged, Phoebe thought; as always it made her smile. It was a good, strong embrace; it was father to son. \"You\u0027ll have to excuse me and Carly. I have to reestablish my dominance and whoop her at WWE SmackDown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if!\" Hooting with challenge, Carly raced back inside the house. \"You look better,\" Dave began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m told. Over and over. What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They made a deal. I wanted to tell you in person. Phoebe, there was a lot of pressure from the brass on this, from the DA\u0027s office-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" She sat again, needed to sit again. \"What did they give him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s off the job, immediately. No benefits. He pleads guilty to simple assault-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Simple assault,\" she repeated. She\u0027d prepared herself, and still she was stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It carries one-to-three, suspended. He\u0027ll get probation. He\u0027ll be required to take anger management and serve twenty hours\u0027 community service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he have to write on the blackboard a hundred times: \u0027I promise to be a good boy\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Phoebe.\" He crouched in front of her, laid a hand on her knee. \"It\u0027s a bad deal. They want to put it away. You don\u0027t have to put it away. If you decide to file civil charges against him, I\u0027ll stand behind you on it. And I won\u0027t be the only one in the department who does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t put my family through that. Honestly, I don\u0027t know if I could put myself through it.\" She closed her eyes and reminded herself that not all deals were fair, not all deals settled the score. \"He did what he did. Everyone who counts knows it.\" She let out a long breath before looking Dave in the eye again. \"He can\u0027t be a cop anymore. The rest, it\u0027s not important. He\u0027s off the job, and that\u0027s what\u0027s right. That\u0027s what\u0027s needed. I\u0027m okay with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027re a better man than I, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m pissed. I\u0027m seriously pissed, but I can live with it. We\u0027re going to eat sugar-glazed ham and lemon meringue pie. And Arnie Meeks? He\u0027s going to be eating disgrace for a very long time.\" She nodded. \"Yeah.
