I never once went into the village alone, and my training left little time for walks through the woods and fields. Village boys? I never knew they existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould I have been susceptible to Pryce’s charms at that age? I was glad I’d never had the chance to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gwen wouldn’t open her door or listen to me. Over and over, she demanded to return home. That’s all she would say. And so I sent her home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab stood. “Your sister did see what she believes she saw: She saw the boy’s slashed throat, felt his blood on her arms and face. Yet she’ll never believe the rest. She wouldn’t listen to me. She didn’t believe the village constable, who said there was no such boy in Rhydgoch. She didn’t believe your father, who tried to tell her about demi-demons.” Mab sighed. “And should you try to explain, she won’t believe you, either. I concluded twenty years ago that Gwen was lost to me. Her recent actions confirm that. I’m afraid there’s nothing anyone can do about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was that. Mab moved toward me. I stepped aside to let her pass. She opened the door and went into the living room, saying over her shoulder, “You need to return that phone call. It was from a Detective Costello, and he said it was urgent.” She picked up her book and resumed reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane’s face appeared in the kitchen doorway. “We’re good,” I told him. “Everything’s fine.” But nothing felt fine. My heart ached for Gwen, who for twenty years had been forced to carry a ghastly secret because no one would believe her. And for Mab, branded a murderer by the niece whose life she’d saved, shut out of Gwen’s life, her family. There ought to be something I could do to bridge the chasm between them. But they’d lived on their opposite sides of that chasm for twenty years. The tragedy of the situation was fresh to me; it had long ago been woven into the fabric of their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the problem aside for now and went into the kitchen. I’d call Daniel and see if he’d learned anything that might help Juliet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up on the first ring. When he heard it was me, he dropped his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t talk now. I need to get to a secure location. You’re at home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t go anywhere. I’ll call back within five minutes.” He hung up abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel’s voice sounded strange, I reflected as I waited, phone in hand, for his call. Tense, but also with a coldness I’d never heard from him before. When the phone rang, I answered immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you get that sample you gave me?” Daniel demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why, what—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m asking the questions. Where did you get it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered how much I should tell him. Juliet was still wanted by the police, and I wouldn’t bring her into this unless I had to. “From a fight. The sample was from the blade of a sword I took from my opponent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did it cut you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but what—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where, Vicky? Whose was it? Why did you swab the blade? That’s a pretty unusual thing to do, wouldn’t you say? I need details.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head spun from his rapid-fire questions. I picked the one that seemed safest to answer. “The sword belonged to one of the Old Ones, those creatures who stole Pryce’s body after the Paranormal Appreciation Day concert. Remember I told you about Myrddin? They’re working with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s working with the Reaper. Shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daniel, what’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you brought me that cotton ball, did you have any idea what was on that blade?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some kind of poison, I thought.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s worse than poison. It’s a virus—a variant of the virus that caused the zombie plague.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone fell from my hand. It hit my boot and skated across the kitchen floor. I chased it and snatched it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daniel? Daniel? Are you there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The whole lab is under quarantine. I’m lucky they didn’t stick me in quarantine with them. I managed to convince them I didn’t come into direct contact with the specimen. But you can bet I got a grilling about where it came from.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told them it was left anonymously in my mailbox, and I thought I’d better check it out.” I let out my breath in a rush of relief. He hadn’t linked the sample to me. I started to thank him, but he cut me off. “No more off-the-record stuff, Vicky. I can’t do you any more favors. This is way too serious for amateur detectives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bristled a little at his suggestion that I was playing Miss Marple, but I let it go. He had a right to be angry. “Did anyone get sick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet.” That was good news. The original plague had killed its victims within minutes of exposure. “Don’t tell anyone. We’re trying to keep this out of the news to prevent widespread panic.” I bet his girlfriend the TV reporter wasn’t happy about that. “Each hour that goes by without symptoms is encouraging. This virus is a variant, so it may not be contagious to humans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like the zombie plague hadn’t been contagious to paranormals. My heart stopped. This virus hadn’t infected any norms, but it sure as hell was affecting Juliet. “I’ve got to go, Daniel.” I cut the connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone began ringing again almost immediately, but I ignored it. I skidded into the living room. Kane was at my heels, wondering what the hell was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t you going to answer that?” Mab asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Mab, do you know of any viruses that can infect paranormals?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of paranormal? When you were a teenager, I recall you were ill for a week with chicken pox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vampires. What about vampires?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considered, then shook her head. “I can’t say I’ve ever heard of one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone stopped ringing. Next the Goon Squad would be pounding on the door. We had to hurry. “You know that wound of Juliet’s? The one that won’t heal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and held up her book. “Yes, I’ve been reading about the toxicity of certain silver compounds, and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forget that. The blade that cut Juliet was coated with a variant of the zombie virus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab’s mouth dropped open. Kane sat on the floor. Both of them stared at me as though I’d just announced the beginning of the apocalypse. Maybe I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The human victims of that plague were dead for three days before they rose again,” I said. “Juliet was attacked three days ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab was already up and pulling on her coat. A minute later we were out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT WAS A LITTLE AFTER SEVEN IN THE EVENING, TOO EARLY for Creature Comforts to be open. I’d lost the key Axel had given me when those vampire junkies grabbed me, so I pounded on the back door, praying Axel would open it. He did. He didn’t say a word when we rushed past him and opened the secret door. As I sprinted down the stairs, I wondered what we’d find: Juliet, awake and somehow changed? Or Juliet, reduced to a pile of grave dust?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither. She was still unconscious. There was no change at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank into a chair; Mab took another. I rubbed my temples. Ever since I’d hung up on Daniel, I’d been trying to figure out why the Old One who’d burst into Juliet’s cell would carry a virus-coated sword. Was the blade tainted with the virus on purpose? If so, did that mean the Old Ones were behind the original plague? It made sense. Juliet had said they were experimenting with a formula for eternal life. What if that formula was a virus, one that killed its victims and then reanimated them? It would explain why there had been only a single outbreak of the virus, and in only one place—the Old Ones, damn them, had loosed it on downtown Boston and then sat back to see what happened. But that experiment failed. The virus infected only humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI voiced these thoughts to Mab. “I’ve been considering along the same lines,” she said. “It seems they’ve been trying out different magical formulas and somehow binding them to a virus. The virus part would be important. It gets inside the body’s cells and allows the formula to replicate there, spreading throughout the body. If the formula confers eternal life, every cell becomes eternal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the Old Ones are basically vampires. Viruses don’t affect them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that’s precisely what went wrong with the Old Ones’ first attempt at an eternity virus—it didn’t affect its true target. And it failed. The Old Ones don’t want to become zombies. They want to become gods, with their former youth and beauty restored. In the years since that experiment, I’d wager they’ve been working to perfect the formula.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo thousand people, along with their families and friends, had suffered—were still suffering—because the Old Ones had decided to use Bostonians as their guinea pigs. The callousness of it floored me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they weren’t finished yet. “Juliet said they killed four vampires with their recent experiments.” And that was just the number she knew of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe they’ve added silver to the mix somehow,” Mab said. “Silver actually kills many viruses, but if they’ve found a way to make it work . . . The silver would weaken the vampire’s immune system, making the vampire vulnerable to the virus and allowing infection to occur.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s why Juliet’s wound isn’t healing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “The Old Ones themselves are highly vulnerable to silver right now, but that’s a good thing from their point of view: The silver will take them into death; the virusbased formula will bring them out of it. If they can get the balance right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they were trying out that balance on Juliet, no matter what it did to her. The whole point of breaking into the Goon Squad facility must have been to infect her, and then grab her and take her back to their lair—with one leg or two, it didn’t matter to them—to observe what happened. Shit. Her odds didn’t look good. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodstone-deadtown-3/page-37.html","bookId":2611,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:26 PM"}
