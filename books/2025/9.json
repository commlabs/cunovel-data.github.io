{"id":107902,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eWE ENDED UP ON THE BEACH AGAIN, WANDERING AIMlessly. Jacob was still full of himself for engineering my escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think they\u0027ll come looking for you?\" he asked, sounding hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I was certain about that. \"They\u0027re going to be furious with me tonight, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up a rock and chucked it into the waves. \"Don\u0027t go back, then,\" he suggested again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie would love that,\" I said sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet he wouldn\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. Jacob was probably right, and that made me grind my teeth together. Charlie\u0027s blatant preference for my Quileute friends was so unfair. I wondered if he would feel the same if he knew the choice was really between vampires and werewolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the latest pack scandal?\" I asked lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob skidded to a halt, and he stared down at me with shocked eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? That was a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" He looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for him to start walking again, but he seemed lost in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a scandal?\" I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob chuckled once. \"I forget what it\u0027s like, not having everyone know everything all the time. Having a quiet, private place inside my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked along the stony beach quietly for a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what is it?\" I finally asked. \"That everyone in your head already knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated for a moment, as if he weren\u0027t sure how much he was going to tell me. Then he sighed and said, \"Quil imprinted. That\u0027s three now. The rest of us are starting to get worried. Maybe it\u0027s more common than the stories say. . . .\" He frowned, and then turned to stare at me. He gazed into my eyes without speaking, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you staring at?\" I asked, feeling self-conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob started walking again. Without seeming to think about it, he reached out and took my hand. We paced silently across the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of how we must look walking hand and hand down the beach - like a couple, certainly - and wondered if I should object. But this was the way it had always been with Jacob. . . . No reason to get worked up about it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is Quil\u0027s imprinting such a scandal?\" I asked when it didn\u0027t look like he was going to go on. \"Is it because he\u0027s the newest one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t have anything to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s another one of those legend things. I wonder when we\u0027re going to stop being surprised that they\u0027re all true?\" he muttered to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to tell me? Or do I have to guess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d never get it right. See, Quil hasn\u0027t been hanging out with us, you know, until just recently. So he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehadn\u0027t been around Emily\u0027s place much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quil imprinted on Emily, too?\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I told you not to guess. Emily had her two nieces down for a visit . . . and Quil met Claire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t continue. I thought about that for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emily doesn\u0027t want her niece with a werewolf? That\u0027s a little hypocritical,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I could understand why she of all people might feel that way. I thought again of the long scars that marred her face and extended all the way down her right arm. Sam had lost control just once when he was standing too close to her. Once was all it took. . . . I\u0027d seen the pain in Sam\u0027s eyes when he looked at what he\u0027d done to Emily. I could understand why Emily might want to protect her niece from that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you please stop guessing? You\u0027re way off. Emily doesn\u0027t mind that part, it\u0027s just, well, a little early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean early?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob appraised me with narrowed eyes. \"Try not to be judgmental, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire is two,\" Jacob told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain started to fall. I blinked furiously as the drops pelted my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob waited in silence. He wore no jacket, as usual; the rain left a spatter of dark spots on his black T-shirt, and dripped through his shaggy hair. His face was expressionless as he watched mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quil . . . imprinted . . . with a two-year-old?\" I was finally able to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happens.\" Jacob shrugged. He bent to grab another rock and sent it flying out into the bay. \"Or so the stories say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s a baby,\" I protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me with dark amusement. \"Quil\u0027s not getting any older,\" he reminded me, a bit of acid in his tone. \"He\u0027ll just have to be patient for a few decades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . don\u0027t know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trying my hardest not to be critical, but, in truth, I was horrified. Until now, nothing about the werewolves had bothered me since the day I\u0027d found out they weren\u0027t committing the murders I\u0027d suspected them of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re making judgments,\" he accused. \"I can see it on your face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I muttered. \"But it sounds really creepy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like that; you\u0027ve got it all wrong,\" Jacob defended his friend, suddenly vehement. \"I\u0027ve seen what it\u0027s like, through his eyes. There\u0027s nothing romantic about it at all, not for Quil, not now.\" He took a deep breath, frustrated. \"It\u0027s so hard to describe. It\u0027s not like love at first sight, really. It\u0027s more like . . . gravity moves. When you see her, suddenly it\u0027s not the earth holding you here anymore. She does. And nothing matters more than her. And you would do anything for her, be anything for her. . . . You become whatever she needs you to be, whether that\u0027s a protector, or a lover, or a friend, or a brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quil will be the best, kindest big brother any kid ever had. There isn\u0027t a toddler on the planet that will be more carefully looked after than that little girl will be. And then, when she\u0027s older and needs a friend, he\u0027ll be more understanding, trustworthy, and reliable than anyone else she knows. And then, when she\u0027s grown up, they\u0027ll be as happy as Emily and Sam.\" A strange, bitter edge sharpened his tone at the very end, when he spoke of Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t Claire get a choice here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. But why wouldn\u0027t she choose him, in the end? He\u0027ll be her perfect match. Like he was designed for her alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked in silence for a moment, till I paused to toss a rock toward the ocean. It fell to the beach several meters short. Jacob laughed at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t all be freakishly strong,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you think it will happen for you?\" I asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer was flat and immediate. \"Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not something you can control, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for a few minutes. Unconsciously, we both walked slower, barely moving at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not supposed to be,\" he admitted. \"But you have to see her - the one that\u0027s supposedly meant for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think that if you haven\u0027t seen her yet, then she\u0027s not out there?\" I asked skeptically. \"Jacob, you haven\u0027t really seen much of the world - less than me, even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t,\" he said in a low voice. He looked at my face with suddenly piercing eyes. \"But I\u0027ll never see anyone else, Bella. I only see you. Even when I close my eyes and try to see something else. Ask Quil or Embry. It drives them all crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped my eyes to the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe weren\u0027t walking anymore. The only sound was of the waves beating against the shore. I couldn\u0027t hear the rain over their roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I\u0027d better go home,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" he protested, surprised by this conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at him again, and his eyes were anxious now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the whole day off, right? The bloodsucker won\u0027t be home yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No offense intended,\" he said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I have the whole day. But, Jake . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his hands. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"I won\u0027t be like that anymore. I\u0027ll just be Jacob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"But if that\u0027s what you\u0027re thinking . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about me,\" he insisted, smiling with deliberate cheer, too brightly. \"I know what I\u0027m doing. Just tell me if I\u0027m upsetting you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, Bella. Let\u0027s go back to the house and get our bikes. You\u0027ve got to ride a motorcycle regularly to keep it in tune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t think I\u0027m allowed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By who? Charlie or the blood - or him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob grinned my grin, and he was suddenly the Jacob I missed the most, sunny and warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help grinning back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain softened, turned to mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t tell anyone,\" he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except every one of your friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head soberly and raised his right hand. \"I promise not to think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"If I get hurt, it was because I tripped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rode our motorcycles on the back roads around La Push until the rain made them too muddy and Jacob insisted that he was going to pass out if he didn\u0027t eat soon. Billy greeted me easily when we got to the house, as if my sudden reappearance meant nothing more complicated than that I\u0027d wanted to spend the day with my friend. After we ate the sandwiches Jacob made, we went out to the garage and I helped him clean up the bikes. I hadn\u0027t been here in months - since Edward had returned - but there was no sense of import to it. It was just another afternoon in the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is nice,\" I commented when he pulled the warm sodas from the grocery bag. \"I\u0027ve missed this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, looking around at the plastic sheds bolted together over our heads. \"Yeah, I can understand that. All the splendor of the Taj Mahal, without the inconvenience and expense of traveling to India.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Washington\u0027s little Taj Mahal,\" I toasted, holding up my can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched his can to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember last Valentine\u0027s Day? I think that was the last time you were here - the last time when things were still . . . normal, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"Of course I remember. I traded a lifetime of servitude for a box of conversation hearts. That\u0027s not something I\u0027m likely to forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed with me. \"That\u0027s right. Hmm, servitude. I\u0027ll have to think of something good.\" Then he sighed. \"It feels like it was years ago. Another era. A happier one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t agree with him. This was my happy era now. But I was surprised to realize how many things I missed from my own personal dark ages. I stared through the opening at the murky forest. The rain had picked up again, but it was warm in the little garage, sitting next to Jacob. He was as good as a furnace. His fingers brushed my hand. \"Things have really changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said, and then I reached out and patted the back tire of my bike. \"Charlie used to like me. I hope Billy doesn\u0027t say anything about today. . . .\" I bit my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t. He doesn\u0027t get worked up about things the way Charlie does. Hey, I never did apologize officially for that stupid move with the bike. I\u0027m real sorry about ratting you out to Charlie. I wish I hadn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. \"Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really, really sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me hopefully, his wet, tangled black hair sticking up in every direction around his pleading face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, fine! You\u0027re forgiven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Bells!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe grinned at each other for a second, and then his face clouded over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know that day, when I brought the bike over . . . I\u0027ve been wanting to ask you something,\" he said slowly. \"But also . . . not wanting to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held very still - a reaction to stress. It was a habit I\u0027d picked up from Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you just being stubborn because you were mad at me, or were you really serious?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\" I whispered back, though I was sure I knew what he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at me. \"You know. When you said it was none of my business . . . if - if he bit you.\" He cringed visibly at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake . . .\" My throat felt swollen. I couldn\u0027t finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \"Were you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was trembling just slightly. His eyes stayed closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob inhaled, slow and deep. \"I guess I knew that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at his face, waiting for his eyes to open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what this will mean?\" He demanded suddenly. \"You do understand that, don\u0027t you? What will happen if they break the treaty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll leave first,\" I said in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flashed open, their black depths full of anger and pain. \"There wasn\u0027t a geographic limit to the treaty, Bella. Our great-grandfathers only agreed to keep the peace because the Cullens swore that they were different, that humans weren\u0027t in danger from them. They promised they would never kill or change anyone ever again. If they go back on their word, the treaty is meaningless, and they are no different than any other vampires. Once that\u0027s established, when we find them again -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Jake, didn\u0027t you break the treaty already?\" I asked, grasping at straws. \"Wasn\u0027t part of it that you not tell people about the vampires? And you told me. So isn\u0027t the treaty sort of moot, anyhow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob didn\u0027t like the reminder; the pain in his eyes hardened into animosity. \"Yeah, I broke the treaty - back before I believed any of it. And I\u0027m sure they were informed of that.\" He glared sourly at my forehead, not meeting my shamed gaze. \"But it\u0027s not like that gives them a freebie or anything. There\u0027s no fault for a fault. They have only one option if they object to what I did. The same option we\u0027ll have when they break the treaty: to attack. To start the war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made it sound so inevitable. I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, it doesn\u0027t have to be that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth ground together. \"It is that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence after his declaration felt very loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you never forgive me, Jacob?\" I whispered. As soon as I said the words, I wished I hadn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t want to hear his answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t be Bella anymore,\" he told me. \"My friend won\u0027t exist. There\u0027ll be no one to forgive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds like a no,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe faced each other for an endless moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this goodbye then, Jake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked rapidly, his fierce expression melting in surprise. \"Why? We still have a few years. Can\u0027t we be friends until we\u0027re out of time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Years? No, Jake, not years.\" I shook my head, and laughed once without humor. \"Weeks is more accurate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not expecting his reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was suddenly on his feet, and there was a loud pop as the soda can exploded in his hand. Soda flew everywhere, soaking me, like it was spraying from a hose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake!\" I started to complain, but I fell silent when I realized that his whole body was quivering with anger. He glared at me wildly, a growling sound building in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze in place, too shocked to remember how to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shaking rolled through him, getting faster, until it looked like he was vibrating. His shape blurred. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Jacob gritted his teeth together, and the growling stopped. He squeezed his eyes tight in concentration; the quivering slowed until only his hands were shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weeks,\" Jacob said in a flat monotone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t respond; I was still frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes. They were beyond fury now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to change you into a filthy bloodsucker in just a few weeks!\" Jacob hissed through his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo stunned to take offense at his words, I just nodded mutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face turned green under the russet skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Jake,\" I whispered after a long minute of silence. \"He\u0027s seventeen, Jacob. And I get closer to nineteen every day. Besides, what\u0027s the point in waiting? He\u0027s all I want. What else can I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d meant that as a rhetorical question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words cracked like snaps of a whip. \"Anything. Anything else. You\u0027d be better off dead. I\u0027d rather you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recoiled like he\u0027d slapped me. It hurt worse than if he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as the pain shot through me, my own temper burst into flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027ll get lucky,\" I said bleakly, lurching to my feet. \"Maybe I\u0027ll get hit by a truck on my way back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed my motorcycle and pushed it out into the rain. He didn\u0027t move as I passed him. As soon as I was on the small, muddy path, I climbed on and kicked the bike to life. The rear tire spit a fountain of mud toward the garage, and I hoped that it hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got absolutely soaked as I sped across the slick highway toward the Cullens\u0027 house. The wind felt like it was freezing the rain against my skin, and my teeth were chattering before I was halfway there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMotorcycles were too impractical for Washington. I would sell the stupid thing first chance I got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked the bike into the Cullens\u0027 cavernous garage and was unsurprised to find Alice waiting for me, perched lightly on the hood of her Porsche. Alice stroked the glossy yellow paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t even had a chance to drive it.\" She sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I spit through my rattling teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like you could use a hot shower,\" she said, offhand, as she sprang lightly to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pursed her lips, taking in my expression carefully. \"Do you want to talk about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded in assent, but her eyes were raging with curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to go to Olympia tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Can\u0027t I go home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind, Alice,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll stay if it makes things easier for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she sighed in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to bed early that night, curling up on his sofa again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still dark when I woke. I was groggy, but I knew it wasn\u0027t near morning yet. My eyes closed, and I stretched, rolling over. It took me a second before I realized that the movement should have dumped me onto the floor. And that I was much too comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled back over, trying to see. It was darker than last night - the clouds were too thick for the moon to shine through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he murmured so softly that his voice was part of the darkness. \"I didn\u0027t mean to wake you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed, waiting for the fury - both his and mine - but it was only quiet and calm in the darkness of his room. I could almost taste the sweetness of reunion in the air, a separate fragrance from the perfume of his breath; the emptiness when we were apart left its own bitter aftertaste, something I didn\u0027t consciously notice until it was removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no friction in the space between us. The stillness was peaceful - not like the calm before the tempest, but like a clear night untouched by even the dream of a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I didn\u0027t care that I was supposed to be angry with him. I didn\u0027t care that I was supposed to be angry with everyone. I reached out for him, found his hands in the darkness, and pulled myself closer to him. His arms encircled me, cradling me to his chest. My lips searched, hunting along his throat, to his chin, till I finally found his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward kissed me softly for a moment, and then he chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was all braced for the wrath that was going to put grizzlies to shame, and this is what I get? I should infuriate you more often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a minute to work up to it,\" I teased, kissing him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait as long as you want,\" he whispered against my lips. His fingers knotted in my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath was becoming uneven. \"Maybe in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you prefer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome home,\" I said while his cold lips pressed under my jaw. \"I\u0027m glad you came back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a very good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm,\" I agreed, tightening my arms around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand curved around my elbow, moving slowly down my arm, across my ribs and over my waist, tracing along my hip and down my leg, around my knee. He paused there, his hand curling around my calf. He pulled my leg up suddenly, hitching it around his hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped breathing. This wasn\u0027t the kind of thing he usually allowed. Despite his cold hands, I felt suddenly warm. His lips moved in the hollow at the base of my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to bring on the ire prematurely,\" he whispered, \"but do you mind telling me what it is about this bed that you object to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could answer, before I could even concentrate enough to make sense of his words, he rolled to the side, pulling me on top of him. He held my face in his hands, angling it up so that his mouth could reach my throat. My breathing was too loud - it was almost embarrassing, but I couldn\u0027t care quite enough to be ashamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bed?\" he asked again. \"I think it\u0027s nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s unnecessary,\" I managed to gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled my face back to his, and my lips shaped themselves around his. Slowly this time, he rolled till he hovered over me. He held himself carefully so that I felt none of his weight, but I could feel the cool marble of his body press against mine. My heart was hammering so loudly that it was hard to hear his quiet laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s debatable,\" he disagreed. \"This would be difficult on a couch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold as ice, his tongue lightly traced the shape of my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head was spinning - the air was coming too fast and shallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you change your mind?\" I asked breathlessly. Maybe he\u0027d rethought all his careful rules. Maybe there was more significance to this bed than I\u0027d originally guessed. My heart pounded almost painfully as I waited for his answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sighed, rolling back so that we were on our sides again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous, Bella,\" he said, disapproval strong in his voice - clearly, he understood what I meant. \"I was just trying to illustrate the benefits of the bed you don\u0027t seem to like. Don\u0027t get carried away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too late,\" I muttered. \"And I like the bed,\" I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" I could hear the smile in his voice as he kissed my forehead. \"I do, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I still think it\u0027s unnecessary,\" I continued. \"If we\u0027re not going to get carried away, what\u0027s the point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed again. \"For the hundredth time, Bella - it\u0027s too dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like danger,\" I insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" There was a sour edge to his voice, and I realized that he would have seen the motorcycle in the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s dangerous,\" I said quickly, before he could move to a new topic of discussion. \"I\u0027m going to spontaneously combust one of these days - and you\u0027ll have no one but yourself to blame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to push me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I objected, clinging to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protecting you from combustion. If this too much for you. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle it,\" I insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let me worm myself back into the circle of his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I gave you the wrong impression,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to make you unhappy. That wasn\u0027t nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, it was very, very nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath. \"Aren\u0027t you tired? I should let you sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not. I don\u0027t mind if you want to give me the wrong impression again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s probably a bad idea. You\u0027re not the only one who gets carried away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am,\" I grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. \"You have no idea, Bella. It doesn\u0027t help that you are so eager to undermine my self- control, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to apologize for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I apologize?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were angry with me, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I was wrong. It\u0027s much easier to have the proper perspective when I have you safely here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms tightened around me. \"I go a little berserk when I try to leave you. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll go so far again. It\u0027s not worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"Didn\u0027t you find any mountain lions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did, actually. Still not worth the anxiety. I\u0027m sorry I had Alice hold you hostage, though. That was a bad idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said easily. He was already forgiven. \"But slumber parties do have their advantages. . . .\" I curled myself closer to him, pressing my lips into the indentation over his collarbone. \"You can hold me hostage any time you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm,\" he sighed. \"I may take you up on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So is it my turn now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your turn?\" his voice was confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To apologize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you have to apologize for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you mad at me?\" I asked blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded like he really meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my eyebrows pull together. \"Didn\u0027t you see Alice when you got home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes - why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to take her Porsche back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. It was a gift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I could see his expression. His voice sounded as if I\u0027d insulted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want to know what I did?\" I asked, starting to be puzzled by his apparent lack of concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt him shrug. \"I\u0027m always interested in everything you do - but you don\u0027t have to tell me unless you want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I went to La Push.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I ditched school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared toward the sound of his voice, tracing his features with my fingers, trying to understand his mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did all this tolerance come from?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I decided that you were right. My problem before was more about my . . . prejudice against werewolves than anything else. I\u0027m going to try to be more reasonable and trust your judgment. If you say it\u0027s safe, then I\u0027ll believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And . . . most importantly . . . I\u0027m not willing to let this drive a wedge between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my head against his chest and closed my eyes, totally content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he murmured in a casual tone. \"Did you make plans to go back to La Push again soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. His question brought back the memory of Jacob\u0027s words, and my throat was suddenly tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe misread my silence and the tension in my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just so that I can make my own plans,\" he explained quickly. \"I don\u0027t want you to feel like you have to hurry back because I\u0027m sitting around waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said in a voice that sounded strange to me. \"I don\u0027t have plans go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. You don\u0027t have to do that for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m welcome anymore,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you run over someone\u0027s cat?\" he asked lightly. I knew he didn\u0027t want to force the story out of me, but I could hear the curiosity burning behind his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I took a deep breath, and then mumbled quickly through the explanation. \"I thought Jacob would have realized . . . I didn\u0027t think it would surprise him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward waited while I hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t expecting . . . that it was so soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" Edward said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he\u0027d rather see me dead.\" My voice broke on the last word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was too still for a moment, controlling whatever reaction he didn\u0027t want me to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he crushed me gently to his chest. \"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d be glad,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad over something that\u0027s hurt you?\" he murmured into my hair. \"I don\u0027t think so, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and relaxed, fitting myself to the stone shape of him. But he was motionless again, tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused for a minute. \"It might make you angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"I could quite literally kill him for saying that to you.

His arms held me tighter, restraining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Must I always be the responsible one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned in the darkness. \"No. Let me be in charge of responsibility for a few minutes . . . or hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodnight, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait - there was something else I wanted to ask you about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was talking to Rosalie last night. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body tensed again. \"Yes.

But I was interested in something much more pressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She told me a little bit . . . about the time your family lived in Denali.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a short pause; this beginning took him by surprise. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She mentioned something about a bunch of female vampires . . . and you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, though I waited for a long moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" I said, after the silence had grown uncomfortable. \"She told me you didn\u0027t . . . show any preference. But I was just wondering, you know, if any of them had. Shown a preference for you, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain he said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, and not quite managing. \"Or was there more than one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer. I wished I could see his face, so I could try to guess what this silence meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice will tell me,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll go ask her right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms tightened; I was unable to squirm even an inch away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s late,\" he said. His voice had a little edge to it that was something new. Sort of nervous, maybe a little embarrassed. \"Besides, I think Alice stepped out. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s bad,\" I guessed. \"It\u0027s really bad, isn\u0027t it?\" I started to panic, my heart accelerating as I imagined the gorgeous immortal rival I\u0027d never realized I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, Bella,\" he said, kissing the tip of my nose. \"You\u0027re being absurd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I? Then why won\u0027t you tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because there\u0027s nothing to tell. You\u0027re blowing this wildly out of proportion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one?\" I insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Tanya expressed a little interest. I let her know, in a very courteous, gentlemanly fashion, that I did not return that interest. End of story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my voice as even as possible. \"Tell me something - what does Tanya look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like the rest of us - white skin, gold eyes,\" he answered too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, of course, extraordinarily beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt him shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose, to human eyes,\" he said, indifferent. \"You know what, though?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" My voice was petulant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his lips right to my ear; his cold breath tickled. \"I prefer brunettes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a blonde. That figures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strawberry blonde - not at all my type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that for a while, trying to concentrate as his lips moved slowly along my cheek, down my throat, and back up again. He made the circuit three times before I spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess that\u0027s okay, then,\" I decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" he whispered against my skin. \"You\u0027re quite adorable when you\u0027re jealous. It\u0027s surprisingly enjoyable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s late,\" he said again, murmuring, almost crooning now, his voice smoother than silk. \"Sleep, my Bella. Dream happy dreams. You are the only one who has ever touched my heart. It will always be yours. Sleep, my only love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to hum my lullaby, and I knew it was only a matter of time till I succumbed, so I closed my eyes and snuggled closer into his chest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-9.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
