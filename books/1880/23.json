I feel dizzy and see spots before my eyes despite the blood blinding me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m conscious—but barely—when I hear the click of the lock on the door. It opens and I hear Jack Henry talking as he comes into our room. \"I\u0027m sorry that took so long, babe. I wasn\u0027t getting a good signal in the room so I had to…\" He stops midsentence when he sees the scene before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis response time is so fast, it feels nonexistent. Once the weight of Blake is off me, I roll to my back and gasp to fill my lungs with the precious air they\u0027ve been deprived of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear crashing noises all around the room and a sound I\u0027m sure is Jack Henry\u0027s fist slamming against Blake\u0027s face over and over. It feels like it goes on forever before I\u0027m able to turn my head. I see that Blake isn\u0027t fighting back and I\u0027m suddenly afraid of how far Jack Henry\u0027s anger has driven him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, stop before you kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice reaches him and he looks at me with his fist drawn back. He drops Blake\u0027s limp body to the floor and rushes to me. \"I\u0027m so sorry, baby. Tell me where you\u0027re hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My head,\" I tell him as I reach up to touch the source of the bleeding. \"And my face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helps me to the bed before he walks over to pick up the hotel phone from the floor. \"I need an ambulance and the police in room 3255.\" He sees my panties on the floor and adds, \"There\u0027s been an assault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he places the phone back on the receiver, he sits next to me and examines my face. \"You have a pretty nasty laceration on your forehead. There\u0027s already too much dried blood for me to tell if you\u0027ll need stitches.\" He touches his thumb to the side of my face. \"And I imagine you\u0027ll have an impressive shiner on this cheek.\" He watches my eyes. \"Are you hurt anywhere else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both know what he\u0027s asking without saying the words. \"No. He didn\u0027t. You got here before he was able to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls me to him. \"That\u0027s him, isn\u0027t it? Blake Phillips?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck!\" he yells as he beats his fist into the bed. \"This wouldn\u0027t have happened if I\u0027d been in the room like I said I would be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You don\u0027t get to blame yourself for this.\" I put my hand on his arm. \"What he did isn\u0027t your fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t have gone downstairs. I told you I would meet you in the room. I should\u0027ve been here like I promised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t sit in this room and look at Blake for another minute. \"Get me out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes me to the hall and we slide down the wall to sit on the floor as we wait for the police and ambulance to arrive. He holds me and we don\u0027t say anything, but it\u0027s all I need to feel safe. He\u0027s all I\u0027ll ever need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s ridiculous how long it takes for the police and the hospital to release me. By the time I\u0027m free to go, I don\u0027t care about any of my belongings at the hotel. There\u0027s not a single thing there that I can\u0027t replace. I just want to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandy cancels our shows for the rest of the week and says we\u0027ll announce that I have the flu or something similar. It pisses me off and makes me wonder if he\u0027s planning to try and sweep this under the rug since Blake is his friend. He won\u0027t if he knows what\u0027s good for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Henry has taken care of everything. He has a car and driver waiting to take us back to Nashville. I\u0027m drowsy from the sedative I was given in the emergency room and I end up sleeping the whole ride home, but I\u0027m glad. At least sleep allows me to take my mind off what Blake did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m relieved when we finally walk through the door of my apartment. It\u0027s been weeks since I was home and I miss being here. I\u0027m glad Jack Henry is with me. I\u0027m not sure I could\u0027ve come home if I didn\u0027t have him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel dirty—like I have Blake all over me—and it makes me sick. I remember the touch of his hand between my legs as he grabbed my underwear and a rigor involuntarily shakes me. \"I\u0027m going to take a shower before I lie down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Would you like something to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m too nauseated to eat. \"I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m still sleepy from the medicine they gave me. I\u0027ll probably go straight to bed after my shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re still groggy, do you think it\u0027s a good idea to be in the shower? I don\u0027t want you to fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine. I\u0027ll call for you if I feel weak or if I need anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe agrees but reluctantly. I go into the bathroom and shut the door because I need walls between us. I feel tears coming and I don\u0027t want him to see me like that. He already feels terrible for not being there to protect me from Blake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start the shower and the tiny bathroom almost immediately fills with steam. I lift my tattered dress over my head before I toss it in the trash. I stand naked in front of the mirror to assess the damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touch the large bruise still forming on the side of my face. It\u0027s tender. Scrapes and blue discoloration mark my arms and upper body. The cut on my forehead is held together with adhesive and makes me feel as though I\u0027m a piece of broken glass that can be put back together with a little glue—except I don\u0027t feel put back together at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t look at myself anymore, so I step into the shower and begin the process of trying to cleanse tonight\u0027s events away. I wash my body repeatedly but what I\u0027m feeling refuses to be scoured off. And I\u0027m afraid it won\u0027t be for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn back the bed so it\u0027ll be ready when Laurelyn\u0027s out of the shower. I remember she didn\u0027t take clothes into the bathroom with her, so I open a few drawers in search of the things she might need. I find bras and knickers in the top dresser drawer and I recognize many of the lacy ones she used to wear for me. I hold up a pair and smile as I recall the way she looked wearing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are some beautiful damn memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI delve through more drawers and find the pink jogging pants with the word LOVE across the bum. I love these pants and I know she wears them when she wants to be comfortable, so I take them out. I\u0027ve missed seeing her in them. After I take them from the drawer, I notice a man\u0027s T-shirt beneath and a sickening envy immediately strikes me. I pluck it from her drawer for a better look and recognize it as one of my own. I never missed it being gone. The discovery makes my heart swell until it\u0027s almost ready to burst. She missed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom door is closed and I knock lightly instead of walking in unannounced, but I don\u0027t like it. We stopped closing doors not long after our relationship began and I\u0027m feeling a little uneasy about her reasons behind doing it tonight. I don\u0027t want her to close me off. I\u0027m afraid this attack might cause her to put up some of those old walls it took so long for me to tear down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom is full of steam and it rushes toward me when I walk in. \"I brought you some clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t answer at first—and I wonder if she heard me—but then I hear her answer with the softest voice. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand waiting for her to tell me what she needs, but she doesn\u0027t. \"What do you need, babe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I can sit with you while you finish your shower.\" I shut the lid on the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I need you in here with me—in the shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admit that\u0027s unexpected. She\u0027s just been attacked and almost raped. I wouldn\u0027t expect her to have sharing a shower in mind. Maybe she just wants to be close so she can feel safe. \"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Positive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t make myself believe this is normal, but it\u0027s what she\u0027s asking. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strip and pull the curtain back before stepping into the hot water with her. She reaches for me and puts her arms around my midsection. She places the side of her face against my chest and the water pelts down over both of us. \"Please don\u0027t think I\u0027m crazy for what I\u0027m about to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I know you\u0027re not crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the way I\u0027m feeling isn\u0027t logical. It\u0027s all in my head but I feel like I can\u0027t get him washed off my body. I feel dirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not dirty, love.\" I think what she\u0027s feeling is completely natural. I don\u0027t know what to do to make it better for her, but I decide to do the only thing I think might help. \"Turn around for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach for the shampoo as she circles and squeeze a generous portion into my hand. \"I\u0027m going to wash your hair and when I\u0027m finished, I\u0027m going to wash every trace of him from your body. You\u0027ll never have to feel him on your skin again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea if touching her is the wrong thing to do or if it will cause her more harm than good. I want to think it\u0027s the right thing since she asked me to come into the shower, but I have no way of knowing until I do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI massage her scalp gently as I shampoo her hair. I hear her sigh and I take that as a good sign, so I repeat the process with the conditioner before moving on to her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI begin by massaging her back with body wash because it feels like a safe place to start. And because that\u0027s where I found him when he was attacking her—lying against her back holding her face down against the floor. I\u0027m furious all over again as I see the image of him attempting to rape her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head as though it will make the image go away. It doesn\u0027t, but I can\u0027t let Laurelyn know what\u0027s on my mind. It will only upset her more to know I\u0027m picturing her attack, replaying what I saw almost happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tense muscles gradually begin to relax and I\u0027m encouraged. Laurelyn is the medicine that heals all my pain, so I don\u0027t know why I questioned being the same kind of relief for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m still standing behind her when I move my soapy bare hands up to her neck. She lifts her chin and rests her head against my chest as I make my way down her body. I circle her breasts and her nipples become hard pebbles beneath my fingers. She leans harder against me and I tell my cock to behave because it isn\u0027t the right time. He doesn\u0027t listen. He never does when it comes to her. And I can\u0027t really blame him—she\u0027s wet and naked and pressing her beautiful body against mine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-23.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
