He told you to have a car and I presume he told you to have the money ready-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, strangely enough he happened to mention it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"- but he didn\u0027t give any indication of where he\u0027s going to want you to drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. \"What concerns me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is walking into something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got the same concern. It\u0027s like walking point, you\u0027re out there and they can just bang away at you. It\u0027s bad enough paying ransom, but who knows if we\u0027re even gonna get what we pay for? It could wind up being a hijack, and they could waste us while they\u0027re at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would they do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. \u0027Dead men tell no tales.\u0027 Isn\u0027t that what they say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they do, but murder brings heat.\" I was trying to concentrate, and I wasn\u0027t thinking as clearly as I wanted to. I asked if I could have a beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jesus, where\u0027s my manners? What do you want, bourbon, cup of coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think just a beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip went to get it. While he was gone his partner said, \"This is crazy. It\u0027s unreal, you know what I mean? Stolen books, extortion, voices over the phone. It has no reality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The money has no reality. I can\u0027t relate to it. The number-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip brought me a bottle of Carlsberg and a bell-shaped glass. I sipped a little beer and frowned in what was supposed to be thought. Skip lit a cigarette, offered the pack to me, then said, \"No, of course you don\u0027t want one, you don\u0027t smoke,\" and put the pack in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"It shouldn\u0027t be a hijack. But there\u0027s one way it could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they haven\u0027t got the books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they got the books. The books are gone and there\u0027s this voice on the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose someone hasn\u0027t got the books, but knows that they\u0027re missing. If he doesn\u0027t have to prove possession of them, he\u0027s got a chance to take a few dollars off you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few dollars,\" John Kasabian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip said, \"Then who\u0027s got the books? The Feds? You mean they could have them all along and be preparing a case and in the meantime we\u0027re paying ransom to somebody who hasn\u0027t got shit.\" He stood up, walked around the desk. \"I fuckin\u0027 love it,\" he said. \"I love it so much I want to marry it, I want to have babies with it. Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a possibility, but I think we have to guard against it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How? Everything\u0027s set for tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he calls, you have him read a page from the books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me. \"You just thought of that? Just now? Nobody move.\" Kasabian asked him where he was going. \"To get two more of those Carlsbergs,\" he said. \"The fucking beer stimulates thought. They should use it in their advertising.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE brought back two bottles. He sat on the edge of the desk with his feet swinging, sipping his beer straight from the brown bottle. Kasabian stayed in his chair and peeled the label from his bottle. He was in no hurry to drink it. We had our war council, making what plans we could. John and Skip were both coming along, and so of course was I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I was thinking Bobby\u0027d come,\" Skip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruslander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my best friend, he knows what\u0027s happening. I don\u0027t know if he could do much if the shit hit the fan, but who could? I\u0027m gonna be armed, but if it\u0027s a trap I suppose they\u0027ll shoot first, so a lot of fucking good a gun\u0027s gonna do me. You got anybody you want to bring in on this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKasabian shook his head. \"I thought of my brother,\" he said. \"First person I thought of, but what does Zeke need with this shit, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does anybody need with it? Matt, you got anybody you want to bring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking maybe Billie Keegan,\" Skip said. \"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s good company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. When you think about it, who the hell needs good company? What we need is heavy artillery and air support. Set up the meet and lay down a mortar barrage on their position. John, tell him about the spades with the mortar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Kasabian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was just something I saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something he saw. Listen to this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was whenever it was, a month or so ago. I was at my girl\u0027s house, she\u0027s on West End in the Eighties, I\u0027m supposed to walk her dog, and I come out of the building and diagonally across the street there are these three black guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he turns around and goes back in the building,\" Skip offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they didn\u0027t even look in my direction,\" Kasabian said. \"They\u0027re wearing fatigue jackets, like, and one\u0027s got a cap. They look like soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him what they did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s hard to believe I really saw this,\" he said. He took off his glasses, massaged the bridge of his nose. \"They took a look around, and if they saw me they decided I was nothing to worry about-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shrewd judges of character,\" Skip put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"- and they set up this mortar, like they\u0027ve done this drill a thousand times before, and one of them drops a shell in, and they lob a round into the Hudson, nice easy shot, they\u0027re on the corner and they can see clear to the river, and we all like check it out, and they still don\u0027t pay any attention to me, and they nod to each other and strip the mortar down and pack it up and walk off together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happened so fast,\" he said, \"and with so little fanfare, I wondered if I imagined it. But it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did the round make a lot of noise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not a whole lot. There was the sort of whump! sound a mortar makes on firing, and if there was an explosion when the round hit the water I didn\u0027t hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a blank,\" Skip said. \"They were probably, you know, testing the firing mechanism, checking out the trajectory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, shit,\" he said. \"You never know when you\u0027re gonna need a mortar in this town.\" He tipped up his beer bottle, drank deeply, and drummed his heels against the side of the desk. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said, \"I\u0027m drinking this stuff but I\u0027m not thinking any better than before. Matt, let\u0027s talk about money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought he was referring to the ransom. But he meant money for me, and I was at a loss. I didn\u0027t know how to set a price, said something about being a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"So? This is what you do for a living, right? Do favors for friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re doing us a favor. Kasabian and I don\u0027t know what the hell we\u0027re doing. Am I right, John?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not gonna give Bobby anything for coming, he wouldn\u0027t take it, and if Keegan comes along it won\u0027t be for the money. But you\u0027re a professional and a professional gets paid. Tillary\u0027s paying you, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a friend of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he isn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in the same way. In fact I like him less and less. He\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s an asshole,\" Skip said. \"No argument. Makes no difference.\" He opened a drawer in the desk, counted money, folded the bills, handed them to me. \"Here,\" he said. \"That\u0027s twenty-five there. Tell me if it\u0027s not enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said slowly. \"Twenty-five dollars doesn\u0027t seem like much, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s twenty-five hundred, you dumb fuck.\" We all started laughing. \" \u0027Twenty-five dollars doesn\u0027t seem like much.\u0027 Johnny, why did we have to hire a comedian? Seriously, Matt, is it okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously, it seems a little high.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what the ransom comes to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Everybody\u0027s been careful not to mention it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you don\u0027t mention rope in the house of the hanged, do you? We\u0027re paying those cocksuckers fifty grand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name came up already,\" Kasabian said. \"He a friend of yours, by any chance? Bring him along tomorrow, he\u0027s got nothing else on for the evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to make it an early night. I went home and went to bed, and somewhere around four I knew I wasn\u0027t going to be able to sleep. There was enough bourbon on hand to knock myself out, but I didn\u0027t want that, either. I didn\u0027t want to be hung over when we dealt with the blackmailers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and tried sitting around, but I couldn\u0027t sit still and there was nothing on television I was willing to watch. I got dressed and went out for a walk, and I was halfway there before I realized my feet were taking me to Morrissey\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the brothers was on the downstairs door. He gave me a bright smile and let me in. Upstairs, another brother sat on a stool opposite the door. His right hand was concealed beneath his white butcher\u0027s apron, and I had been given to understand that there was a gun in it. I hadn\u0027t been to Morrissey\u0027s since Tim Pat had told me of the reward he and his brothers were offering, but I\u0027d heard that the brothers took turns at guard duty, and that anyone who walked in the door was facing a loaded weapon. Opinions differed on the sort of weapon; I\u0027d had various reports, ranging from revolver to automatic pistol to sawed-off shotgun. My thought was that you\u0027d have to be crazy to plan on using a shotgun, sawed-off or otherwise, in a roomful of your own customers, but no one had ever established the Morrisseys\u0027 sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked in and looked around the room, and Tim Pat saw me and motioned to me, and I took a step toward him when Skip Devoe called my name from a table in the front near the blacked-out window. He was sitting with Bobby Ruslander. I held up a hand, indicating I\u0027d be with them in a minute, and Bobby put his hand to his mouth and a police whistle pierced the room, cutting off all conversation as cleanly as a gunshot. Skip and Bobby laughed, and the other drinkers realized the noise had been a joke, not an official raid, and, after a few people had assured Bobby he was an asshole, conversation resumed. I followed Tim Pat toward the rear of the room, where we stood on opposite sides of an empty table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve not seen you here since we spoke,\" he said. \"Do you bring me news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him I didn\u0027t have any news to bring him. \"I just came in for a drink,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ve heard nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a thing. I went around, I talked to some people. If there were anything in the air I would have had word back by now. I think it must be some kind of Irish thing, Tim Pat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An Irish thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Political,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we should have heard tell of it. Some braggart would have let a word slip.\" His fingertips caressed his beard. \"They knew right where to go for the money,\" he mused. \"And they even took the few dollars from the Norad jar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I thought-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it was Proddies we should have heard tell. Or if it was a faction of our own.\" He smiled without humor. \"We have our factional disagreements, don\u0027t you know. The Cause has more than one voice speakin\u0027 for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it were an \u0027Irish thing,\u0027 \" he said, pronouncing the phrase deliberately, \"there would be other incidents. But there\u0027s been only the one.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-20.html","bookId":2324,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM"}
