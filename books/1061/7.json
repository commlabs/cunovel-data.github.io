Having reached the platform they shouted at the top of their voices and clapped their hands.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Their view extended down the hillside divided into brown and green squares of cultivated fields. Woods and mountains lay dimly blue against the distant horizon.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Little sister,” cried George, “little sister, look at the whole wide world!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The world is very big,” said Honey-Bee. “My teachers,” said George, “have taught me that it is very big; but, as Gertrude our housekeeper says, one must see to believe.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They went the round of the platform.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Here is something wonderful, little brother,” cried Honey-Bee. “The castle stands in the middle of the earth and we are on the watch-tower in the middle of the castle, and so we are standing in the middle of the earth. Ha! ha! ha!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And, indeed, the horizon formed a circle about the children of which the watch-tower was the centre.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We are in the middle of the earth! Ha! ha! ha!” George repeated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whereupon they both started a-thinking.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What a pity that the world is so big!” said Honey-Bee, “one might get lost and be separated from one’s friends.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n George shrugged his shoulders.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How lucky that the world is so big! One can go in search of adventures. When I am grown up I mean to conquer the mountains that stand at the ends of the earth. That is where the moon rises; I shall seize her as she passes, and I will give her to you, Honey-Bee.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” said Honey-Bee, “give her to me and I will put her in my hair.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then they busied themselves searching for the places they knew as on a map.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I recognise everything,” said Honey-Bee, who recognised nothing, “but what are those little square stones scattered over the hillside?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Houses,” George replied. “Those are houses. Don’t you recognise the capital of the Duchy of Clarides, little sister? After all, it is a great city; it has three streets, and one can drive through one of them. Don’t you remember that we passed through it last week when we went to the Hermitage?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And what is that winding brook?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is the river. See the old stone bridge down there?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The bridge under which we fished for crayfish?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That’s the one; and in one of the niches stands the statue of the ‘Woman without a Head.’ One cannot see her from here because she is too small.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I remember. But why hasn’t she got a head?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Probably because she has lost it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Without saying if this explanation was satisfactory, Honey-Bee gazed at the horizon.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Little brother, little brother, just see what sparkles by the side of the blue mountains? It is the lake.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is the lake.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They then remembered what the Duchess had told them of these beautiful and dangerous waters where the nixies dwell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We will go there,” said Honey-Bee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n George was aghast. He stared at her with his mouth wide open.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But the Duchess has forbidden us to go out alone, so how can we go to this lake which is at the end of the earth?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How can we go? I don’t know. It’s you who ought to know, for you are a man and you have a grammar-master.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This piqued George who replied that one might be a man, and even a very brave man, and yet not know all the roads on earth. Whereupon Honey-Bee said drily with a little air of scorn which made him blush to his ears:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I never said I would conquer the blue mountains or take down the moon. I don’t know the way to the lake, but I mean to find it!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n George pretended to laugh.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You laugh like a cucumber.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Cucumbers neither laugh nor cry.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If they did laugh they would laugh like you. I shall go along to the lake. And while I search for the beautiful waters in which the nixies live you shall stay alone at home like a good girl. I will leave you my needle-work and my doll. Take care of them, George, take good care of them.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n George was proud, and he was conscious of the humiliation with which Honey-Bee covered him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gloomily and with head bowed he cried in a hollow voice:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, then, we will go to the lake.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3033/83847.html","bookId":1061,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:34:59 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:34:59 AM"}
