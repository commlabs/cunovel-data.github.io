I paced around the room until I found the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton, was there something you wanted to say to me?\u0027 the disembodied voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not a thing,\u0027 I said sullenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I see. Now add \"glad to serve, your honour\" to that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m not glad. And there\u0027s nothing to be done about it. . . your honour.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boss paused for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton, I really would like you to take this situation we have on our hands a bit more seriously. All right? I expect you to report back in the morning, in any case. And . . . good luck.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t exactly feel ashamed. But I wasn\u0027t feeling quite so irritated any more. I put my mobile phone in my jacket pocket, opened the cupboard in the hallway and wondered for a while what I ought to take to round out my kit. I had a few novel items of equipment that friends had given me the previous week. But I settled on the usual lot anyway – it\u0027s fairly compact and gives pretty good all-round coverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus the minidisc walkman. I don\u0027t need my sense of hearing for anything, and boredom is an implacable enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I went out I took a long look at the staircase through the spy-hole. Nobody there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the beginning of one more night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rode the metro for about six hours, switching aimlessly from line to line without any system, sometimes dozing, letting my conscious mind take a break and my senses roam. There was nothing going down. Well, I did see a few interesting things, but they were all utterly ordinary, tame beginner\u0027s stuff. It wasn\u0027t until about eleven, as the metro got less crowded, that things changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sitting there with my eyes closed, listening to Manfredini\u0027s Fifth Symphony for the third time that evening. The minidisc in the player was totally wild; a personal selection, medieval Italian composers and Bach alternating with the rock group Alisa, Richie Blackmore and Picnic. It\u0027s always interesting to see which music comes up for which event. Today it was Manfredini.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt this sudden cramp — all the way up from my toes to the back of my head. I even hissed as I opened my eyes and glanced round the carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked the girl out straight away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery pretty, young. In a stylish fur coat, with a little handbag and a book in her hands. And with a black vortex spinning above her head like I hadn\u0027t seen for at least three years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose the look I gave her must have made me look insane. The girl sensed it, glanced back at me and immediately turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTry looking up instead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, of course she\u0027s not going to see the twister anyway. The most she could possibly feel is a slight sensation of alarm. And she can\u0027t get any more than the vaguest glimpse of that flickering above her head, out of the corner of her eye . . . like a swarm of midges swirling round and round, like the air trembling above the tarmac on a hot day . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe can\u0027t see a thing. Not a thing. And she\u0027ll go on living for another day or two, until she misses her step on the black ice, falls and bangs her head so hard it kills her. Or ends up under a car. Or runs into a thug\u0027s knife in the hallway, a thug who has no real idea why he\u0027s killing this girl. And everyone will say: \u0027She was so young, with her whole life ahead of her, everybody loved her . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Of course. I believe it, she\u0027s a very good person, kind. There\u0027s weariness there, but no bitterness or spite. When you\u0027re with a girl like that you feel like a different person. You try to be better, and that\u0027s a strain. Men prefer to be friends with her kind, flirt a bit, share confidences. Men don\u0027t often fall in love with girls like that, but everybody loves them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from one person, who\u0027s hired a Dark Magician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black vortex is actually fairly ordinary. If I looked closely, I could make out another five or six hanging above other passengers\u0027 heads. But they were all blurred and pale, barely even spinning. The results of perfectly standard, non-professional curses. Someone had simply yelled after someone else: \u0027I hope you die, you bastard.\u0027 Someone had put it even more simply and forcefully: \u0027Go to hell, will you?\u0027 And a little black whirlwind had moved over from the Dark Side, draining good fortune and sucking up energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut an ordinary, amateurish, formless curse lasts no more than an hour or two, twenty-four hours at most. And its consequences may be unpleasant, but they\u0027re not fatal. That black twister hanging over the girl was the genuine article, stabilised and set in motion by an experienced magician. The girl didn\u0027t know it yet, but she was already dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI automatically reached for my pocket, then remembered where I was and frowned. Why don\u0027t mobile phones work in the metro? Don\u0027t the people who have them ride underground?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I was torn between my principal assignment, which I had to carry through, even with no hope of success, and the doomed girl. I didn\u0027t know if she could still be helped, but I had to track down whoever had created that vortex . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust at that point I got a second jolt. But this time it was different. There was no cramp or pain, my throat just went dry and my gums went numb, the blood started pounding in my temples and my fingertips started itching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the timing couldn\u0027t have been worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up – the train was already breaking as it pulled into a station. I walked past the girl and felt her eyes on me, following me. She was afraid. There was no way she could see the black vortex, but it was obviously making her feel anxious, making her pay close attention to the people around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was why she was still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying not to look in her direction, I put my hand into my pocket and fingered the amulet – a smooth cylinder carved out of cool onyx. I hesitated for a moment, trying to come up with some other plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, there was no other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed the amulet tight in my hand, feeling a prickly sensation in my fingers as the stone began to warm up, giving out its accumulated energy. The sensation was no illusion, but you can\u0027t measure this heat with any thermometer. It felt as if I was squeezing a coal hot from a fire ... it was covered with cold ash, but still red hot at the centre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d drained the amulet completely, I glanced at the girl. The black twister was shuddering, leaning over slightly in my direction. This vortex was so powerful that it even possessed a rudimentary intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there\u0027d been any Others in the carriage, or even anywhere in the train, they\u0027d have seen a blinding flash that could pierce through metal or concrete with equal ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never tried striking at a black vortex with such a complex structure before. And I\u0027d never used an amulet with such a powerful charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effect was totally unexpected. The feeble curses hanging over other people\u0027s heads were completely swept away. An elderly woman who\u0027d been rubbing her forehead looked at her hand in amazement: her vicious migraine had suddenly disappeared. A young guy who\u0027d been gazing dully out the window shuddered. His face relaxed and the look of hopeless misery disappeared from his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black vortex above the girl was tossed back five metres, it even slipped halfway out of the carriage. But it maintained its structure and came zigzagging back through the air to its victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was real power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith real perseverance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey say, though I\u0027ve never actually seen it myself, that if a vortex is pushed even two or three metres away from its victim, it gets disoriented and attaches itself to the nearest person it can find. That\u0027s a pretty lousy thing to happen to anyone, but at least a curse meant for someone else has a much weaker effect, and the new victim has a good chance of escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this vortex just came straight back, like a faithful dog running to its master in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train was stopping. I threw one last glance at the vortex – it was back in place, hanging there above the girl\u0027s head, it had even started to spin faster . . . And there was nothing, absolutely nothing I could do about it. The target I\u0027d been hunting all over Moscow for a week was somewhere close, right here in the station. My boss would have eaten me alive . . . and maybe not just in the figurative sense . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the doors parted with a hiss, I gave the girl a final glance, hastily memorising her aura. There wasn\u0027t much chance of ever finding her again in this vast city. But even so, I would have to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly not right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped out of the carriage and looked around. It was true, I was a bit short of field work experience, the boss was quite right about that. But I didn\u0027t like the method he\u0027d chosen for training me at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow in hell\u0027s name was I supposed to find the target?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot one of the people I could see with my normal vision looked even slightly suspicious. There were plenty of them still jostling against each other here – it was the circle line, after all, Kursk station, there were passengers who\u0027d just arrived on the main line, street traders making their way home, people in a hurry to change trains and head for the suburbs . . . But if I closed my eyes I could see a more intriguing picture. Pale auras, the way they usually are by evening, and in among them the bright scarlet blobs of fury, the strident orange glow of a couple obviously in a rush to get to bed, the washed-out brownish-grey stripes of the disintegrating auras of the drunks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no sign of the target. Apart from the dryness in my throat, the itching in my gums, the insane pounding of my heart. The faint taste of blood on my lips. A mounting sense of excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe signs were all circumstantial, but at the same time they were too obvious to ignore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was it? Who?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train started moving behind me. The feeling that the target was near didn\u0027t get any weaker, so we still had to be close to each other. Then a train going in the opposite direction appeared. I felt the target tremble and start moving towards it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForward!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed the platform, weaving between the new arrivals staring up at the indicator boards, then set off towards the back of the train – and my sense of the target began to get weaker. I ran towards the front of the train – there it was again . . . closer . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like that children\u0027s game, first I was \u0027cold\u0027, then I was \u0027warm\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were boarding the carriages. I ran along the train, feeling sticky saliva filling up my mouth, my teeth starting to ache, my fingers starting to cramp up. The music was roaring in my earphones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the shadow of the moon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe danced in the starlight,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhispering a haunting tune\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the night. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow appropriate. The song was bang on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was a bad omen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped in through the closing doors and froze, concentrating on what I could feel. Had I guessed right or wrong? I still couldn\u0027t get a visual fix on the target. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d guessed right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train hurtled on round the circle line. My instincts were raging, calling to me: \u0027Right here! Beside you!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I\u0027d even got the right carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave my fellow passengers a surreptitious looking-over and dropped the idea. There was no one here worth taking any interest in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d just have to wait, then . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel no sorrow, feel no pain,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel no hurt, there\u0027s nothing gained . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly love will then remain,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Marx Prospect I sensed the target moving away from me. I jumped from the carriage and set off toward the other line. Right here, somewhere right beside me . . . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-2.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
