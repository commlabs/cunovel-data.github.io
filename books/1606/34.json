Nick is beside her with a swollen face. His look tells me he wants to talk to me alone. I hug Anna and lead her into my room, \"Sleep in here for a bit. You need to sleep to get better again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs, \"I know. I\u0027m just tired of being tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hug her, \"You\u0027ll feel better soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezes me back, \"I just wanted something of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss her cheek and whisper, \"You have his heart, Anna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe starts to cry again, nodding, \"I know.\" I give Nick a look. He stays in the hall as I take her into the room and tuck her into my bed. I kiss her forehead. Leo growls in the hallway and saunters in, jumping on the bed. He curls into a ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rub his huge ears, \"You stay with her, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yawns and nestles into her better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closes her eyes, making tears stream down her cheeks. I leave, closing the door and leaning against it. Nick looks down, \"I\u0027m sorry, Em. I tried so hard, but there was no way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"You said the cervix was closed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and closes his puffy eyes, \"I\u0027m scared it was me, putting my hand up there and touching it, might have made it worse. Sometimes examining a woman who is about to lose a baby seals the deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a hand out on his arm, \"Just keep her and Will alive. I don’t give a shit about babies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorts and looks at me. I swear his blue eyes have a hint of green in them and look similar to mine. He nods at me, \"You really are cold sometimes. I see that hate fill you, like the breeder babies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze narrows, \"Why don’t you have that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I don’t know. Some do and some don’t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down the hall, \"I don’t think Star has it naturally. I\u0027ve seen it develop in her. She used to be different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"It might be something that triggers in us, when we need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, I hope you never get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs bitterly, \"Me too.\" His look darkens, \"How did you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arrow to the eye and then blew the house up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"Wow, so the whole place is gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"It is. The breeder babies that were with him are gone too, mostly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stare meets mine again, \"I will keep them safe and earn your trust. I swear it. I just want to be part of something good for a change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see. But make no mistake…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cuts me off, \"I know. You\u0027ll kill me and gut me like a fish, and burn me, and drag me behind a horse in the field. I\u0027ve seen it, Emma—you’re badass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and slap his arm, \"I\u0027ve never had a real brother before. This might be fun, as long as you don’t make me kill you.\" I walk past him to the yard and pray that he is the good person I\u0027m betting he isn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at them and wink. I like the winking thing. It makes me feel like I know something I definitely don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk from the woods, past the broken branches I did last time, and cross the broken highway where the bloodstains are still splattered on the cracked road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t like being without my weapons, but I don’t imagine the rules of the towns have changed much. What has changed is the blue-eyed guy next to me this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looks nervous and smiles, \"So we just walk in? They won\u0027t shoot us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at him and smirk, \"That’s how it works usually. They want the trade so they don’t normally kill the customers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t look like it eases him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe cross the road and I hear it; it still makes my stomach turn to stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screams of the men who rip and tear fill the air. I see them running for us, hoping to rob us of whatever we have and rape me, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake turns to run but I grab his hand. As the first ones get close, I see the bullets hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drop mid-run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands into the air so the guards see that it isn’t me. Jake copies me, looking anxious and ready to run. The last couple thieves stop when they see the ten dead men on the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at Jake, \"This is easier with Mitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows, \"Was it like this last time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. My eyes sparkle, \"It was worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see him understand what I did for him as he shakes his head but has nothing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe cross into the gates. The guard flashes me a grin, \"Smart girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a grin, \"That wasn’t me. Maybe it was God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorts, \"Welcome to the trading post.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerchants don’t rush at me like last time. They watch me from the lean-tos and shanties. I walk to the one where the old lady was. She sees me and scowls. I smile, \"Surprised to see me alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe mutters, \"And yet, you came back.\" She sees Jake behind me and instantly her face splits into a grin, \"But this time you brought me something I would be willing to trade for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at Jake. He gives me a clueless look. I smirk, \"Yeah, he\u0027s not for sale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs, \"Too bad. We would pay by the pound for something that beautiful and that size.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake frowns, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"I need needles and if you have any of the antibiotics left, I need that too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slow smile creeps along her old face, \"Well, someone went and destroyed all the farms and labs so the antibiotics are all gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand lashes out fast, grabbing her throat and lifting her to her toes, \"I have things to trade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gags and sputters but breaks out into a laugh. I toss her back into the stacks of trash bags. \"I know where your son is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widen, \"LIAR!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I know where he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scrambles up, \"How—how do you know where he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remain stoic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can get you needles but the antibiotics are gone. Everything is gone. The power hasn’t been on here in a while, but I can get you the needles. Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabs for me, but I shove her back, \"He\u0027s dead. I killed them all. You want to know who ended the power and the farms? It was me. I murdered every doctor I saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screams and leaps for me, but I drop her skinny body to the ground and hold her there, \"I did it especially for you. You and the other people of this shit hole, who traded the girls to the farms and camps.\" I get off of her. She is trembling and twitching, but still manages to pull a knife from under her dress. She leaps at me but Jake grabs her arm and bends it to stab the knife into her chest. He freezes and steps back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gags and opens her mouth to scream but she can\u0027t; he must have stabbed into her lung. Blood fills her mouth and she drops to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s about to freak out. I point his face at mine, \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops, realizing he saved me. His eyes dart back to the dying woman. I shake my head, \"Trust me, she earned this fate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows and nods, \"Okay.\" He doesn’t believe me, but he never sat in the woods, terrified and listening to the screaming girls begging for death over the farms and being loaded into the trucks. I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body stops making sounds. I step over her and start to rifle through her cabinets. I open a drawer and a moth flies out. I wave it away and see the needles with plastic wrap on them still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"Found them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake points at the now-dead woman, \"What about her? They\u0027re going to know we killed her. The guards will kill us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk at him, \"I know another way out. Come on.\" I drag her body to the back of the so-called store and bury her in the bags of garbage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuff the needles in my sack and walk out into the street. The noise of the town is louder than before. People are bustling about and the merchants are shouting about their goods. I walk to the inn, keeping my head down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady with the nice teeth smiles up from behind the bar, but doesn’t really look at me, \"No purchase, no room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to tell you that my virtue is no longer at risk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes lift and her face breaks into a huge grin, \"You\u0027re still alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile back, \"Not for long. I just killed that old lady who betrayed me last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winces, \"Oh, that was a bad move. You came here right afterwards?\" I nod. She shakes her head, \"Thanks, kid.\" She gives Jake a sly smile, \"Now tell me that was the person you were buying antibiotics for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"It was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes roam his whole body slowly, \"That was worth it then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance back at Jake and smile. His face is bright red but his eyes are still processing the fact he murdered a woman. I know some of the spark that makes him shiny and fun is going to die out. For him, killing her was like rubbing the magic dust off of a butterfly; he won\u0027t ever fly as high as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need the tunnel, just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winks, \"What have you got for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"Freedom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze narrows, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I killed Michael and burned the city to the ground and we have created a small village, where people are free and equal. I am offering you a place to live there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes shine. She looks like she might turn me down, but she ducks behind the counter and comes up with a sack. She hurries around the counter, \"I knew saving you would be a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe points to the stairs, \"Hurry up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run up the stairs and enter the bedroom I slept in last time. She follows and closes the door. Jake looks lost, but as she opens the closet, his jaw drops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudge him, \"Her husband was a government man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts a hand out, \"I\u0027m Stella, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"Emma, and this is Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe licks her red lips, \"Well Jake, you are a tall drink of water, aren’t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cheeks are burning, \"Yeah, I get that a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"I bet you do.\" I lead the way down the stairs into the tunnel and she closes everything up. I run, dragging my hand along the wall until I see the circle of light again. I climb the small ladder and push the hatch slowly. Nothing moves as I open it fully, and climb out into the fading light of the sun. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-34.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
