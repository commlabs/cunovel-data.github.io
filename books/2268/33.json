The cops were right, Brent thought with disgust, the man was a jerk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head and feeling irritation sweep over him, he hurried on. Haggerty was apparently trying to follow in Tom Garfield\u0027s footsteps. A loner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, maybe he was right. Staying alive wasn\u0027t always an easy thing to do. Especially for an FBI man. Still…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrimly, he decided he wanted to know more about the guy. Adam would be able to help him. And they would be forewarned in the future, should Harrison Investigations come across the man working any future projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking off the unpleasant encounter with Haggerty, Brent jogged to catch a trolley and make it over to Lafayette Number 1. Glancing at his watch, he was amazed to see that it was only eleven-thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, winced and decided it was time to make a painful visit of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you voting for, Mitch? Can you vote? Did we give the vote to Yankees yet?\" Patricia said teasingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch made a face. \"Of course I can vote! I\u0027m a resident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who are you voting for?\" Nathan pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, I don\u0027t know. On the one hand, we\u0027ve got an old liar. On the other hand, we\u0027ve got a young liar,\" Mitch said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s pretty cynical,\" Nikki said as they walked idly down the street. The area was, beyond a doubt, even busier than usual. And there were cops on every corner as crowds headed toward Jackson Square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many times have you seen a politician carry through with a promise after he\u0027s been elected?\" Mitch asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s harder to carry out a promise than it is to make one,\" Nikki suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s the thing—someone out there should be an honest politician. Tell the truth. No, I can\u0027t change the world, but I can take a few little steps,\" Mitch said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki laughed. \"Well, if you acted as if you couldn\u0027t change much, no one would vote for you at all, probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped to look at a flyer that had been pasted to a light pole. It was for Billy Banks. Nice looking, good smile, lots of charisma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch slipped an arm around her shoulders. \"He\u0027s a cutie, huh? That\u0027ll make you vote for him, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch, that\u0027s insulting. I\u0027m voting for the best man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So which one is the best man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t, either. And I\u0027m not here to listen to the debate. There\u0027s Contessa Moodoo\u0027s Hoodoo Voodoo. I\u0027m going in,\" Patricia said, having had it with politics for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki hesitated on the street, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in the crowd had distracted her. Something that she\u0027d seen with her peripheral vision that had caused a little jump somewhere in the back of her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t know what it was. She watched as people streamed down the street. She saw tourists in shorts, young women in halter tops, others in T-shirts. Men in business attire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could have bothered her about the group that had just passed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething had been oddly familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave her head a shake, grateful that at least it hadn\u0027t been Andy, and followed the others into the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile her friends chatted, looking over Contessa\u0027s wares, Nikki realized that she was uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that Contessa was watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the others were checking out the potions, Nikki wandered into the part of the shop dedicated to the history of voodoo and those who currently practiced the art. She felt someone near her and tensed, always afraid now that she was going to see someone who couldn\u0027t possibly be there, and that sooner or later she would simply scream, fall down and be committed to an asylum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Contessa, her marbled eyes deeply concerned. \"She died, yes? Your friend, she is no longer with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she died. And you knew she was going to die,\" Nikki said. It was an accusation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContessa shook her head. \"There was a color around her, and it was dark. It boded great danger. I didn\u0027t know she was going to die. She did not die by her own hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most believe that she did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was not a question. I was telling you what is so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki nodded. \"Well, I agree with you on that. I think she was murdered.\" She grimaced. \"You don\u0027t happen to know by who or why, do you?\" she queried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContessa shook her head. \"But—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nikki,\" Patricia called. \"We\u0027ve got to get going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki nodded. \"But what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContessa hesitated, just briefly. The others were heading for the door, calling out their thanks and waving for Nikki to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what?\" Nikki persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marbled eyes, deep and grave, touched hers. \"You are in danger, too. The same danger. The same color, a deep, angry purple… it is around you, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking into the cemetery, Brent hesitated. He opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were so many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who acknowledged him and those who did not. Those who sat around, looking morose, lost, and those who seemed angry, purposeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had moved on long ago. Years ago now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made his way to the grave, aware that several tours were gathering and that there were a number of people about who had come specifically to join the Myths and Legends of New Orleans group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know who exactly, and it didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tomb was a single sarcophagus, always maintained—he saw to it. She had loved her church, and there were still nuns who kept the grave up while Brent was away. A statue of a weeping angel rose above the head of the concrete and brick bed where she now lay for eternity. Her name was written across the tomb, along with the dates of her birth and death, and the simple words \"Daughter, wife, forever beloved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his head, and he tried for the sense of peace he should feel. There had been justice at least. Her killer had gone to jail for life. Brent\u0027s bitterness had been so great that he had longed for Louisiana to make use of its capital punishment law, but that had not been the case. She had been killed by a stray bullet, in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer killer had been murdered by a fellow inmate. Stabbed in the throat, his dying had been long and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Brent had discovered that vengeance, however decreed from above, didn\u0027t end the pain of loss. He should have possessed a greater ability to heal than most people, but the simple effect of death, no matter what a man\u0027s beliefs, was to leave human beings missing those they had loved. There were those without any extra abilities who dealt with the injustices of life better than he did because they were blessed with such deep and abiding faith. No matter. Nothing could change the fact that life here must be lived without the loved one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had loved Tania. Her brilliant smile, her laughter, the sound of her voice, the very essence of her. She could laugh and tease, and then, when the moment called for it, say the most profound words. She could look at the world without judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed his hand on the tomb and wished that her spirit was still present. Here he was; a man who could see and speak with ghosts, but his own wife had moved on. What remained of her was in his heart, his mind, his memories. He was grateful she had moved on, for if ever there had been a deserving soul, it had been hers, and yet…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many lingered. So many stayed, some not even knowing why, what they needed, what they searched for, what could bring them peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Tania.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for her sake, he was glad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor his own…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor ten years he had been the one to wander the earth like a wraith, lost and alone, a pale shadow of himself. But there had also been moments when he could feel that he had a purpose. That his life counted. And it was true that time was the greatest healer of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I could feel you, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn\u0027t. Nor had he reached either of his parents, ever again, after the night they had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he felt, standing there, was the sadness that would always remain. But he had moved on now, and he knew it. And that made him feel a twinge of guilt, something he hadn\u0027t experienced before. He had known, laughed with and enjoyed other women since he had lost Tania.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027d never cared again, nor felt so alive, as he had when he\u0027d been with Nikki. He\u0027d never—even with Tania—felt such an instant bond, such an electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was deeply caught in his inner thoughts; it was as if he were surrounded by nothing but air and shadow. The world receded until there was darkness around him and the grave he stood before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the world came back. And he knew that Nikki was there even before she cleared her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to her. She looked pale, distraught, sympathetic and a little uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your… wife?\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been a very long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You… um… you might have told me that you\u0027d been married and that your wife was buried here,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never noticed this grave?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winced. \"It\u0027s new. We usually tell tales about older grave sites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and saw that Nikki gave a little involuntary shudder. She stared at him, eyes wide. \"Is she… does she… do you… ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she walk the cemetery? Like Andy?\" he suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"She\u0027s not here. She never has been. I mean, she\u0027s buried here. But… she\u0027s gone on. Long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" she asked gently. She had moved a short distance from him, on the other side of the sarcophagus, as if she felt that respect for the dead demanded that she do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stray bullet,\" he told her briefly. \"She happened to be on the wrong street at the wrong time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki winced, lowering her head. \"I would think… I would think that… \" She looked up at him. \"I would think that would make her stay. It\u0027s so horrible. So traumatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man was caught, sent to prison. He died there,\" he said simply. He heard a bird chirping and felt the breeze. \"You would have liked her. She would have liked you. But she\u0027s gone. She wasn\u0027t the type who could hold a grudge. She was full of life and faith and… serenity. Whatever lies beyond, she\u0027s chosen it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-33.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
