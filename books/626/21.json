Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class! she suddenly remembered. She sighed with relief. For the last six days she\u0027d been trying to remember where she came from.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In her mind she went through everybody in her former class. She didn\u0027t want to forget again. As she thought about each person, tears filled her eyes. She missed them very much. Even Jason. They were all so wonderful in their own special ways.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the two-minute break came, she talked to Mark again.

She shivered as it all came together for her. Miss Zarves assigns us lots of busy work so we don\u0027t have time to think. She makes us memorize stupid things so that we don\u0027t think about the important things. And then she gives us good grades to keep us happy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves walked around the room. \"Very good, Virginia,\" she said. \"You are doing so well. Excellent, Ray!
