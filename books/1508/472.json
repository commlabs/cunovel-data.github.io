But, none of them had ever heard of a Houtian martial artist being able to defeat a Revolving Core martial artist.

This was also a feat that the legendary Emperor Shakya would have been able to achieve. However, in these short three to four months, it was difficult to imagine that Lin Ming’s strength had risen to this degree.

If he had opened the Heretical God Force a moment ago, or even burned the blood of the Ancient Phoenix, then he would have been able to ruthlessly kill him instead of just severely wounding him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut whether it was the Heretical God Force or the blood of the Ancient Phoenix, he could only maintain it for a few dozen breaths of time once it was activated.

For these past tens of thousands of years, there were countless Great Desolate Blood Halberd replicas that had been forged.

A Houtian realm being able to fight a Revolving Core realm…” Another Supreme Mystery Temple disciple gulped. He was also an outstanding heroic elite of his generation, and originally had thoughts that he might one day compete with Lin Ming. But in this current situation, he could only ruefully smile.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the waves of wonder passed through the crowd and many eyes filled with disbelief, Lin Ming grasped the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, silent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe had already expected that his status would be revealed in this battle.

The Xuan bloodline clan were the direct descendants of the Netherworld Great emperor, and the Lian bloodline were the descendants of one of the top Devil Generals underneath the Netherworld Great Emperor. Between the two great clans, there were many disputes. Not just that, but the South Sea Demon Region and Divine Phoenix Island had been at war for over a year with countless casualties on both sides. It was natural for someone to die, and if anyone wanted revenge, then that would all depend on their own strength to attain it. Thus, the Xuan bloodline did not help the Lian bloodline.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut Lin Ming was the one who had killed Xuan Ji. Xuan Ji was the most outstanding youth of their Xuan bloodline, and also the cherished great grandson of the top person within the South Sea Demon Region – Xuan Wuji. They absolutely had to take revenge for this grudge. Otherwise, they would be criticized and looked down upon. Not to mention the loss of face that would occur, but once they returned, Xuan Wuji would absolutely not forgive them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough the Xuan bloodline had only sent out two Elders, one of them was at the middle Revolving Core realm – his strength was no worse than Lian Chengji’s!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSuddenly, the pressure on everyone increased by many times!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You are Lin Ming?” The middle Revolving Core Elder known as Xuan Zhan asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes!” At this time there was no need to play games, Lin Ming directly admitted it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You once killed a man called Lei Mubai.

If he used his full strength here, killing Lin Ming would be as simply as turning his hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming smiled, “Oh? I killed him? And so what? Not to mention the South Sea war, but just in this bloody wilderness, how many disciples of other sects have you South Sea Demon Region martial artists killed? Killing someone and robbing them here is common practice. Since your grandson attacked me, did you want me to stretch out my neck so he could finish me faster?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLian Chengji’s eyes gleamed with a cold light as he heard this. “You killed my grandson and you even dare to admit this in front of me! Good! This old man will use strength to teach you a lesson. Those that are weak can only stretch out their necks to die, and any resistance will be met with immediate death!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lian Chengji spoke, he reached out a claw towards Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTrue essence formed into a bloody claw, and the faint rumble of wind and thunder rolled in the air. Wherever the claw went, countless particles of bloody sand formed, turning into a swirling crimson tornado.

As one reached the Revolving Core realm, there existed a massive gap between every level. It was common for Houtian or Pulse Condensation juniors to jump levels and fight those with higher cultivation, but in the Revolving Core realm, those that could leap over levels to fight were few. Even crossing over a small boundary to do so was insanely difficult.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s expression was somber.

A massive pit was blasted into the ground, and bloody grains of sand shot into the skies. The true essence shockwaves caused all of the surrounding martial artists to step back again and again. For a fight of this caliber to happen in this broken world where their true essence was suppressed to 20% was unimaginable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Heavens!

But at this time, Lin Ming’s expression was grim. In that collision a moment ago, his 14 Blood Drinking Seals had instantly disintegrated.
