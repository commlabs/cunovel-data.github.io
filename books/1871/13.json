Alexanders in the paper!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyelids shot open like a rocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere is it? I scoured the countertop and dinette. Do you have it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Billy read it last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly? You let Billy touch it? I was horrified. How could you! I know he got his snotty paws all over it! He probably mangled the whole thing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm down, my father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stormed upstairs to find my brothers door locked. I banged so hard, my fist pulsed with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eItll cost you, I heard him yell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will cost youan arm and a leg!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slowly opened and I pushed myself inside. Billy was nowhere to be found. I jerked open his closet door, then heard his nerdy little voice from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says he sleeps in a coffin! he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around. Billy was standing at his door with the Gazette in his smarmy little hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm not sure who took off first. We both tore down the stairs as Billy cried, Mom, shes trying to kill me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNerd Boy I screeched, as Id done all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadnt called him that name in months, but in my anger it just naturally rang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tackled him before he reached the kitchen. I tried to wrangle the paper out of his hand as he pleaded with my parents for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a while since we had a major sibling blowout bodyslam event, and he had grown stronger. It took all my might to hold him at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaven, get off him, my dad shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly, give your sister the paper! my mom ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShes sitting on my chest! Billy hollered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad pulled me off my brother by my woven belt, and I grabbed the paper from his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took off for my room, locked the door behind me, and hopped onto my bed. I spread out the paper and carefully tried to smooth the wrinkles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring back at me on the front page of the Arts section was my boyfriend, with the caption An Artist Amongst Us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is so handsome! I cheered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOUR TOWNS BEST-KEPT SECRET. A budding young artist, hiding out on Benson Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eId always heard ghost stories about the Mansion on Benson Hill, but I didnt see any spirits wandering through the halls. I was invited into an old-fashioned estate with a reclusive teen. Homeschooled his whole life, Alexander spends his days and nights painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is his inspiration? I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl named Raven, he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I only saw the first floor, the rest of the Mansion appeared the same. He claims to sleep in a coffin and have a wine cellar straight from Transylvania. This artist might as well be a writer, too. But this interviewer wasnt fooled. The only thing he was really hiding was his talent. Though Alexander Sterling may be able to spin a yarn, he is also able to paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is more to this artist than could ever be told. It has to be seen. All you need to do is take a look at one of his paintings. You can see how he loves this town and the people who inhabit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you want to be famous? Like Picasso, Dal��Monet? I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he said. I just want to be likeme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI riffled through my desk and found some tape. I placed my boyfriends article right over my headboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven wrinkled, Alexander Sterling was still the most gorgeous guy Id ever seen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-13.html","bookId":1871,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:54 PM"}
