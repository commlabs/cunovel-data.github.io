When he opened the text, he nearly choked on his food. Receiving a message to say expect a wedding invitation wasn\u0027t anything out of the ordinary, and he could\u0027ve understood if this was news from his younger brother. Wynn had been seeing someone steadily for a couple of years now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if a woman had convinced Cole, the eldest, to walk down the aisle, she must be a special lady, indeed. Dex looked forward to meeting -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flicked to the top of the message for a name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it looked as if the youngest of the Hunter clan - five-year-old Tate - was about to pay that visit, which meant finally making good on that promise to do Disneyland. Tate was expected in L.A. a week from today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDex\u0027s face fell and he spluttered on a mouthful of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne week!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought up his calendar, starting this Sunday. A premiere he couldn\u0027t miss, a couple of charity events, meetings with financial directors... Oh, joy. He\u0027d just need to rearrange some things, was all. And hire a babysitter for Tate, Dex thought as he lifted his cup again. Didn\u0027t matter what she looked like, as long as she was maternal and tuned in to his little brother\u0027s whirlwind personality. Hell, she could be old and toothless for all he cared. Hairy and bowlegged, made no difference to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thump on his back sent Dex\u0027s espresso splashing over the tablecloth. The dropped cup clattered into its saucer as Dex shook out his scorched wet hand and a concerned voice came from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no. Oh, God, are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA waitress with luxurious hair, the color of polished mahogany and set in pigtails, skirted around to stand before him. Wearing white flats and a uniform that offered little justice to her obvious curves, she dragged a cloth from her apron\u0027s pouch and dabbed at his hand and his sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t tell anyone,\" she whispered, darting a nervous glance around. Her eyes were green, bright and fringed with naturally thick lashes. \"I\u0027ve already dropped a plate of tacos today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDex didn\u0027t fall back on his obvious and, in his case, warranted, line too often. However, now he couldn\u0027t help but ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever considered a career in movies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept dabbing. \"I couldn\u0027t act my way out of a paper bag. I didn\u0027t come to L.A. for that. Although I have put my name down at a couple of agencies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDex cocked a brow. So she was new to town? When she straightened, he took in her height, those cheekbones - that aura - and surmised. \"Modeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nannying. I want to work with kids.\" She flashed a big white smile. \"Children like me. I like them, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling back, already making plans, Dex pulled out a business card. Someone was watching over him today. Clearly this union was meant to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatch for Dex\u0027s story, the next in THE HUNTER PACT series, coming from Harlequin Desire in 2013!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep reading for an excerpt of Up Close and Personal by Maureen Child!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hope you enjoyed this Harlequin Desire story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0027t help it - you\u0027re attracted to power!
