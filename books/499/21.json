Not you, LeClarc, not you.\" \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They\u0027d been ushered into the main lounge of the Frank Buck, a ship of about the Gordak\u0027s dimensions, but two or three years older. LeClarc stood there with his neutron gun, watching them carefully. In a few moments, Schuyler Barling joined them, a greasy salve covering the discoloration on his jaw. The jaw looked painfully swollen too, and Barling rubbed it speculatively. \"I won\u0027t forget this,\" he growled briefly to Teejay, then turned to LeClarc. \"Kevin McGann I know, but what about this man?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stedman?\" said LeClarc. \"You\u0027ll want him, because he\u0027s the extra-zoo man on the Gordak. If you took McGann and the woman alone, they still might be able to do their work on Carmical\u0027s ship. But with Stedman your prisoner as well, their hands are tied over there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is this?\" Teejay demanded defiantly. \"What\u0027s the meaning of—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you be quiet and let me do the talking?\" Barling interrupted her. \"It was LeClarc who radioed and told me your coin had two heads. If you wanted to play the game that way, I wasn\u0027t going to stand by and let you. So—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So,\" LeClarc took up the thread for him, \"we got together, Mr. Barling and I.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you, LeClarc,\" said Kevin. \"You\u0027d jump through a fire-hoop into a pit of acid if Captain Moore told you to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Would I?\" LeClarc chuckled softly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. Yes, you would.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps there was a time I\u0027d have done that, McGann. Perhaps. But then I thought the Captain needed me, and wanted me to help her, too. Now, with you and Stedman—well, LeClarc isn\u0027t so important, is he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So that\u0027s it!\" Kevin roared. \"You\u0027re jealous. Not jealous the way a man should be, when he loves a woman, but jealous because you believed Captain Moore had discarded you—had decided you weren\u0027t such an essential cog in the Gordak machine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Shut up.\" LeClarc took a quick step toward Kevin and hit him, hooking his left fist at the bigger man\u0027s jaw. Kevin staggered but did not go down. Bellowing, he charged at LeClarc, but the Frenchman waved him off with the neutron gun.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stop it, LeClarc!\" Barling snapped. \"I didn\u0027t have you bring them here to make a shambles of the lounge. Just stand off in the corner—that\u0027s right, there—and watch them. I\u0027ll do the talking.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You realize, of course,\" Teejay told him calmly, \"that this is kidnapping.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is it? Who is to say? You never entered the Gordak; LeClarc met you within the airlock. For all your crew knows, the three of you are out on Ganymede somewhere—with not much air left. After a time, they\u0027ll have to give you up as dead. With the Captain gone, and the Exec, and the expert on Extra-terrestrial zoology—their expedition won\u0027t amount to much. It looks to me like old man Carmical will be without a circus this year, unless he resorts to a strictly terrestrial shindig.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What happens then?\" Teejay wanted to know.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I\u0027ll be frank with you. I haven\u0027t decided. I can\u0027t simply return you to civilization, of course.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course,\" Teejay echoed him acidly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you\u0027d be able to holler \u0027kidnapper\u0027. It would seem that you give me only one alternative. Ah—excuse me a moment.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A trio of men had entered the lounge and the leader, a stocky man of about thirty-five, was beaming. \"We\u0027ve got three,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Splendid, splendid. In that case, nothing remains to keep us on Ganymede.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Chief, I\u0027m sure glad of that. This place can give you the heebies, and you never know why. Those three anthrovacs should be a fine core to build your circus around, though.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Three anthrovacs?\" Teejay cried, her composure fading for the first time. \"You\u0027ve got three anthrovacs?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Barling nodded. \"LeClarc here was good enough to tell us Stedman\u0027s plan. A first-rate idea, as you can see, only we were able to carry it out. Frankly, I wasn\u0027t so optimistic at first.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let\u0027s get back to us,\" Teejay suggested. \"You were saying...?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Umm-mm, yes. There\u0027s only one alternative, and much as I regret—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is it? What\u0027s the alternative?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Please, must I say it? I think you know, and there\u0027s no need for me to—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I want to hear it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Suit yourself,\" said Barling. \"The only solution is this: we\u0027ll have to eliminate you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The sooner the better. But Captain Moore, you\u0027re making me feel—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s all I wanted to know!\" Teejay cried, and hurled herself at Barling. \"We might as well try to escape while we still have a chance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2816/77861.html","bookId":499,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:39:08 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:39:08 AM"}
