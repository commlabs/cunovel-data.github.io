{"id":63269,"no":57,"title":"Page 57","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"And you never told your dad about what happened to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I rolled the stem of my wineglass between my fingers. \"He knows I was an angry troublemaker with self-esteem issues, but he doesn\u0027t know about Nathan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he can\u0027t change what happened. Nathan was lawfully punished. His father paid a large sum for damages. Justice was served.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon spoke coolly. \"I disagree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What more can you expect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drank deeply before replying. \"It\u0027s not fit to describe over dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Because that sounded ominous, especially when paired with the ice of his gaze, I returned my attention to the food in front of me. There was no menu at Masa, only omakase, so every bite was a surprise delight, and the dearth of patrons made it seem almost as if we had the whole place to ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, he said, \"I love watching you eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a look. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You eat with gusto. And your little moans of pleasure make me hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bumped my shoulder into his. \"By your own admission, you\u0027re always hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your fault,\" he said, grinning, which made me grin, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon ate with more deliberation than I did and didn\u0027t bat an eye at the astronomical check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we stepped outside, he slid his jacket over my shoulders and said, \"Let\u0027s go to your gym tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at him. \"Yours is nicer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it is. But I\u0027ll go wherever you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someplace without helpful trainers named Daniel?\" I asked sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me with an arched brow and a wry curving of his lips. \"Watch yourself, angel. Before I think of a suitable consequence for mocking my possessiveness where you\u0027re concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noted he didn\u0027t threaten me with a spanking again. Did he understand that administered pain with sex was a major trigger for me? It took me back to a mental place I never wanted to return to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ride back to Gideon\u0027s place, I curled into him in the back of the Bentley, my legs slung over one of his thighs and my head on his shoulder. I thought about the ways Nathan\u0027s abuse still affected my life - my sex life in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many of those ghosts could Gideon and I exorcise together? After that brief glimpse of toys I\u0027d seen in the hotel room drawer, it was clear he was more experienced and sexually adventurous than I was. And the pleasure I\u0027d derived from the ferocity of his lovemaking on the couch earlier proved to me that he could do things to me no one else could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I trust you,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms tightened around me. With his lips in my hair, he murmured, \"We\u0027re going to be good for each other, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I fell asleep in his arms later that night, it was with those words in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t...No. No, don\u0027t.... Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon\u0027s cries had me jackknifing up in the bed, my heart thudding violently. I fought for breath, glancing wild-eyed at the man thrashing next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snarled like a feral beast, his hands fisted and his legs kicking restlessly. I moved back, afraid he\u0027d strike out at me unknowingly in his dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off of me,\" he panted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gideon! Wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get...off...\" His h*ps arched upward with a hiss of pain. He hovered there, teeth gritted, his back bowed as if the bed was on fire beneath him. Then he collapsed, the mattress jolting as he bounced off of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gideon.\" I reached for the bedside lamp, my throat burning. I couldn\u0027t reach it, had to throw the tangled blankets off to get closer. Gideon was writhing in agony, thrashing so violently he shook the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room lit up in a sudden flare of illumination. I turned toward him...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd found him masturbating with shocking viciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis right hand gripped his c**k with white knuckled force, pumping brutally fast. His left hand clenched the fitted sheet. Torment and pain twisted his beautiful face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFearing for his safety, I shoved his shoulder with both hands. \"Gideon, goddamn it. Wake up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy scream broke through the nightmare. His eyes flew open and he jerked upright, his eyes darting frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he gasped, his chest heaving. His face was flushed, his lips and cheeks red with arousal. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\" I shoved my hands through my hair and slid out of bed, snatching up the black robe I\u0027d hung over the footboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was in his mind? What could make someone have such violently sexual dreams?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice shook. \"You were having a nightmare. You scared the hell out of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva.\" He looked down at his erection and his color darkened with shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him from my safe place by the window, tying the sash of my robe with a yank. \"What were you dreaming about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, his gaze lowered with humiliation, a vulnerable posture I didn\u0027t know or recognize in him. It was as if someone else had taken over Gideon\u0027s body. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit. Something\u0027s in you, something\u0027s eating at you. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rallied visibly as his brain struggled free of sleep. \"It was just a dream, Eva. People have them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, hurt blooming that he would take that tone with me, as if I was being irrational. \"Screw you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders squared, and he tugged the sheet over his lap. \"Why are you mad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest expanded on a deep breath; then he released it in a rush. \"I\u0027m sorry I woke you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pinched the bridge of my nose, feeling a headache gathering strength. My eyes stung with the need to cry for him, to cry for whatever torment he\u0027d once lived through. And to cry for us, because if he didn\u0027t let me in, our relationship had nowhere to go. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-57.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
