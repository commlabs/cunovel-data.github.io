If Beverly Ethridge ever stood trial, I would probably have to testify, but that wouldn\u0027t be for months, if ever, and the prospect of testifying didn\u0027t bother me. I\u0027d given testimony on enough occasions in the past. There was nothing more to do. Huysendahl was free to become governor or not, depending upon the whims of political bosses and the public at large, and Beverly Ethridge was up against the wall, and Henry Prager was going to be buried in a day or so. The moving finger had written and he had written himself off, and my role in his life was as finished as his life itself. He was another person to light meaningless candles for, that was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Anita.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the money order,\" she said. \"I appreciated it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say there\u0027s more where that came from,\" I said. \"Except there isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound different. I don\u0027t know how exactly, but you sound different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been a long week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. Our conversations are usually marked by pauses. Then she said, \"The boys were wondering if you wanted to take them to a basketball game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Boston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Knicks are out of it. The Celtics destroyed them a couple of nights ago. It was the highlight of my week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Nets,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they\u0027re in the finals. Against Utah or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I can never remember that New York has a second basketball team. I don\u0027t know why. I\u0027ve taken my sons to the Nassau Coliseum to watch the Nets and I still tend to forget they exist. \"When are they playing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a home game Saturday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I\u0027ll get a calendar watch next time I think of it. What\u0027s today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thursday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tickets will probably be hard to get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they\u0027re all sold out. They thought you might know somebody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Huysendahl. He could probably swing tickets without much trouble. He would also probably have enjoyed meeting my sons. Of course, there were enough other people who could manage to obtain last-minute tickets, and who wouldn\u0027t mind doing me a favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s cutting it kind of close.\" But what I was thinking was that I didn\u0027t want to see my sons, not in just two days\u0027 time, and I didn\u0027t know why. And I was also wondering if they really wanted me to take them to the game or if they simply wanted to go to it and knew that I would be able to root out a source of tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked if there were any other home games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thursday. But that\u0027s a school night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s also a lot more possible than Saturday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I hate to see them stay out late on a school night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could probably get tickets for the Thursday game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t get tickets for Saturday, but I could probably get something for Thursday. It\u0027ll be later in the series, a more important game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, so that\u0027s the way you want to do it. If I say no because it\u0027s a school night, then I\u0027m the heavy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ll hang up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t do that. All right, Thursday is fine. You\u0027ll call if you can get tickets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said I would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT was odd-I wanted to be drunk but didn\u0027t much want a drink. I sat around the room for a while, then walked over to the park and sat on a bench. A couple of kids ambled rather purposefully to a bench nearby. They sat down and lit cigarettes, and then one of them noticed me and nudged his companion, who looked carefully toward me. They got up and walked off, glancing back periodically to make sure I was not following them. I stayed where I was. I guessed that one of them had been about to sell drugs to the other, and that they had looked at me and decided not to conduct the transaction under the eyes of someone who looked like a policeman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know how long I sat there. A couple of hours, I suppose. Periodically a panhandler would brace me. Sometimes I\u0027d contribute toward the next bottle of sweet wine. Sometimes I\u0027d tell the bum to fuck off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I left the park and walked over to Ninth Avenue, St. Paul\u0027s was closed for the day. The downstairs was opening up, however. It was too late to pray but just the right hour for bingo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmstrong\u0027s was open, and it had been a long dry night and day. I told them to forget the coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE next forty hours or so were pretty much of a blur. I don\u0027t know how long I stayed in Armstrong\u0027s or where I went after that. Sometime Friday morning I woke up alone in a hotel room in the Forties, a squalid room in the kind of hotel to which Times Square streetwalkers take their johns. I had no memory of a woman and my money was all still there, so it looked as though I had probably checked in alone. There was a pint bottle of bourbon on the dresser, about two-thirds empty. I killed it and left the hotel and went on drinking, and reality faded in and out, and sometime during that night I must have decided I was done, because I managed to find my way back to my hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday morning the telephone woke me. It seemed to ring for a long time before I roused myself enough to reach for it. I managed to knock it off the little nightstand and onto the floor, and by the time I managed to pick it up and get it to my ear I was reasonably close to consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Guzik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hard to find,\" he said. \"I been trying to reach you since yesterday. Didn\u0027t you get my messages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t stop at the desk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gotta talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I see you. I\u0027ll be over in ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him to give me half an hour. He said he\u0027d meet me in the lobby. I said that would be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood under the shower, first hot, then cold. I took a couple of aspirin and drank a lot of water. I had a hangover, which I had certainly earned, but aside from that I felt reasonably good. The drinking had purged me. I would still carry Henry Prager\u0027s death around with me-you cannot entirely shrug off such burdens-but I had managed to drown some of the guilt, and it was no longer as oppressive as it had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the clothes I\u0027d been wearing, wadded them up, and stuffed them into the closet. Eventually I\u0027d decide whether the cleaner could restore them, but for the moment I didn\u0027t even want to think about it. I shaved and put on clean clothes and drank two more glasses of tap water. The aspirin had polished off the headache, but I was dehydrated from too many hours of hard drinking, and every cell in my body had an unquenchable thirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got down to the lobby before he arrived. I checked the desk and found that he\u0027d called four times. There were no other messages, and no mail of any importance. I was reading one of the unimportant letters-an insurance company would give me a leather-covered memorandum book absolutely free if I would tell my date of birth-when Guzik came in. He was wearing a well-tailored suit; you had to look carefully to see he was carrying a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came over and took a chair next to me. He told me again that I was hard to find. \"Wanted to talk to you after I saw Ethridge,\" he said. \"Jesus, she\u0027s something, isn\u0027t she? She turns the class on and off. One minute you can\u0027t believe she was ever a pross, and the next minute you can\u0027t believe she was anything else but.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s an odd one, all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. She\u0027s also getting out sometime today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She made bail? I thought they\u0027d book her for Murder One.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bail. Not booking her for anything, Matt. We got nothing to hold her on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him. I could feel the muscles in my forearms tightening. I said, \"How much did it cost her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, no bail. We-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did it cost her to buy out of a murder charge? I always heard you could wash homicide if you had enough cash. Never saw it done, but I heard about it, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was almost ready to swing, and I was by God hoping he would do it, because I wanted an excuse to put him through the wall. A tendon stood out on his neck, and his eyes narrowed to slits. Then he relaxed suddenly, and his face regained its original color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Well, you would have to figure it that way, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Nothing to hold her on,\" he said again. \"That\u0027s what I was trying to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about Spinner Jablon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her bully boy did. Her pimp, whatever the hell he was. Lundgren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way,\" Guzik said. \"He was in California. Town called Santa Paula, it\u0027s halfway between L.A. and Santa Barbara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He flew here and then flew back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way. He was there from a few weeks before we fished Spinner out of the river until a couple of days afterward, and nobody\u0027s gonna shake that alibi. He did thirty days in Santa Paula city jail. They tagged him for assault and let him plead to drunk and disorderly. He did the whole thirty days. Just no way on earth that he was in New York when Spinner got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So maybe she had another boyfriend,\" he went on. \"We figured that was possible. We could try to turn him up, but does it make any sense that way? She wouldn\u0027t use one guy to hit Spinner and another to go after you. It doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the assault on me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it?\" He shrugged. \"Maybe she put him up to it. Maybe she didn\u0027t. She swears she didn\u0027t. Her story is she called him for advice when you put the screws to her and he flew out to see if he could help. She said she told him not to get rough, that she thought she would be able to buy you off. That\u0027s her story, but what can you expect her to say? Maybe she wanted him to kill you and maybe she didn\u0027t, but how can you put enough together to make a case out of it? Lundgren is dead, and nobody else has any information that absolutely implicates her. There\u0027s no evidence to tie her to the attack on you. You can prove she knew Lundgren and you can prove she had a motive for wanting you dead. You can\u0027t prove any kind of an accessory or conspiracy charge. You can\u0027t come up with anything to get an indictment returned, you can\u0027t even get anything that would make anybody in the District Attorney\u0027s office take the whole thing seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no way the Santa Paula records are wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way. Spinner would have had to spend a month in the river, and it didn\u0027t happen that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He was alive within ten days of the time the body was found. I spoke to him on the telephone. I don\u0027t get it. She had to have another accomplice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Polygraph says no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She agreed to take a lie-detector test?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We never asked her to. She demanded it. It gets her completely off the hook as far as Spinner was concerned. It\u0027s not quite as clear as far as the attack on you was concerned. The expert who administered the test says there\u0027s a little stress involved, that his guess would be she did and didn\u0027t know Lundgren was going to try to take you out. Like she suspected it but they hadn\u0027t talked about it and she\u0027d been able to avoid thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those tests aren\u0027t always a hundred percent.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2/page-20.html","bookId":2321,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:58 PM"}
