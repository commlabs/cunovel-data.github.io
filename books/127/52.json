Each little\u0026nbsp; sub-secretary required soothing and conciliation.\n\u003cbr\u003e Each required careful and\u0026nbsp; nauseating milking for the flourishing signaturethat was the pathway to the next official one higher up.\n\u003cbr\u003e For\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; first\u0026nbsp; time, Ponyets\u0026nbsp; found\u0026nbsp; his\u0026nbsp; trader\u0027s identification\u0026nbsp; papersuseless.\n\u003cbr\u003e I Now, at last, the Grand Master was on the other side of the Guard-flankedgilded door ?and two weeks had gone.\n\u003cbr\u003e Gorov was\u0026nbsp; still a prisoner and Ponyets\u0027 cargo\u0026nbsp; rotted useless in the holdsof his ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Grand Master was\u0026nbsp; a small man; a small man with a balding head and verywrinkled\u0026nbsp; face, whose\u0026nbsp; body seemed\u0026nbsp; weighed down\u0026nbsp; to motionlessness\u0026nbsp; by thehuge, glossy fur collar about his neck.\n\u003cbr\u003e His fingers moved on\u0026nbsp; either side, and the line of armed men backed away tofor\u0026nbsp; a passage,\u0026nbsp; along which\u0026nbsp; Ponyets strode\u0026nbsp; to the\u0026nbsp; foot of the\u0026nbsp; Chair ofState.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t speak,\"\u0026nbsp; snapped the Grand Master,\u0026nbsp; and Ponyets\u0027 opening lips closedtightly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s right,\" the Askonian ruler relaxed visibly, \"I can\u0027t endure uselesschatter. You cannot threaten\u0026nbsp; and I won\u0027t abide flattery. Nor is there roomfor injured\u0026nbsp; complaints. I have lost count of\u0026nbsp; the times you wanderers havebeen warned that your\u0026nbsp; devil\u0027s machines are not wanted anywhere in Askone.\"\"Sir,\" said Ponyets, quietly, \"there is no attempt to justify the trader inquestion.

Come,\u0026nbsp; surely not.\"Ponyets winced\u0026nbsp; without showing it.\u0026nbsp; He said, doggedly, \"If\u0026nbsp; the attempt totrade was deliberate, your Veneration, it was most injudicious and contraryto the strictest regulations of our Guild.\"\"Injudicious,\u0026nbsp; yes,\" said\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; Askonian, curtly.\u0026nbsp; \"So much\u0026nbsp; so,\u0026nbsp; that yourcomrade is likely to lose life in payment.\"Ponyets\u0027 stomach knotted. There was no irresolution there. He said, \"Death,your Veneration, is so absolute and irrevocable a phenomenon that certainlythere must be some alternative.\"There was\u0026nbsp; a pause before the\u0026nbsp; guarded answer came, \"I\u0026nbsp; have heard that theFoundation is rich.\"\"Rich? Certainly.\u0026nbsp; But our\u0026nbsp; riches are that\u0026nbsp; which you refuse\u0026nbsp; to take.
