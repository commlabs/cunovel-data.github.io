The roses came in four colors: white, yellow, red, and pink, and the subtleties of their meaning were parsed and analyzed by the female population to no end. Mimi had always understood it thus: white for love, yellow for friendship, red for passion, and pink for a secret crush. Every year on Valentine\u0027s Day, Mimi was the recipient of the biggest and most elaborate bouquets. One of her human familiars had once bought five dozen red roses to declare his undying devotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi perched on her stool in Chem lab, her first class that morning, and waited for the floral tidal wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe student council flunkies arrived with their buckets of flowers. \"Happy Valentine\u0027s Day!\" they chirped to a harried Mr. Korgan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead, get it over with,\" he complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the girls received several small bouquets--most were yellow roses, which meant the girls had spent their money on each other, in the way girls do to make themselves feel better about not having a Valentine on that holiest of holidays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler, sitting at her usual table--they had rotated around so that she was back with Oliver again--accepted a pretty yellow bouquet. Oliver had sent her one last year as well, and sure enough, the accompanying card had his precise handwriting on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Ollie,\" she smiled, inhaling the fresh blooms. \"And here\u0027s one for you, Mr. Hazard-Perry,\" the freshman delivery girl said, handing him a bouquet of pink roses. Oliver colored. \"Pink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A secret crush!\" Schuyler teased. She had decided to send him the pink flowers since they always traded yellow roses, and it was getting too predictable. Why not spice it up a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha. Right. I know they\u0027re just from you, Sky,\" Oliver said, plucking the card from the top. He read it aloud: \"Oliver, will you be my secret valentine? Love, Sky.\" He placed it back in the envelope and couldn\u0027t look at Schuyler for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler wanted to peer inside his mind. She had been successful in accomplishing the first factor of the glom-telepathy-- but Oliver had been taking lessons as well, and as soon as he had mastered the antidote to telepathy--occludo, which meant closing your mind to external influence--Schuyler couldn\u0027t get a read on him anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss, who was sitting with Kingsley, received two red bouquets of similar size. \"Ah, I have a rival I see,\" Kingsley drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing. It\u0027s just from some guy I don\u0027t even know that well,\" Bliss mumbled. Sure enough, the second bouquet was from Morgan, who had ordered the flowers all the way from his dorm room in Rhode Island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are always on my mind. Love, M.\" his card read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley handed his bouquet to her personally. \"I wish these were green, they would suit you better. The color clashes with your hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine,\" Bliss muttered. She still didn\u0027t know how she felt about Kingsley. Being with him seemed like a betrayal to Dylan\u0027s memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving handed out all the middle-size bouquets, the floral messengers were now bringing out the big guns. The three or four dozen mega-arrangements, roses of the deepest scarlet, all of which seemed to have Mimi Force\u0027s name on their cards. Soon, the area around her desk looked like a funeral parlor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like that\u0027s it,\" Mr. Korgan grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait we have one left,\" the runner said, bringing out what was surely the most expensive bouquet of all: a three- foot-tall arrangement of two hundred white roses, in the palest ivory color. All the girls swooned. Almost no boys bought white roses ever. It was too big a sign of commitment. But this one practically trumpeted a captured heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe runner set the bouquet in front of Schuyler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi raised an eyebrow. She had always won the roses lottery. What was this all about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For me?\" Schuyler asked, awestruck by the size of the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the card from the tallest stem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Schuyler, who doesn\u0027t like love stories.\" It was not signed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi glared at her red bouquets; the flowers seemed to wilt a little at her stare. She didn\u0027t have to guess who had sent the dazzling white flowers to the little beast. White for light. White for love. White for forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time for her plan was at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she walked by Schuyler\u0027s desk, she pretended to trip, and caught a strand of Schuyler\u0027s dark hair under her fingertips as she steadied herself on Schuyler\u0027s chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch!\" Schuyler yelped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch it,\" Mimi sniffed, the strand of hair securely in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wouldn\u0027t be long now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-31.html","bookId":2120,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM"}
