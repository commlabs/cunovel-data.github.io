Good—I messed with him without cursing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s not dressed like a moron, so why should I?” I motion to the designer jeans and starched Catholic-schoolgirl shirt disgracing my body. Per Scott’s request to play nice with Allison, I stepped out of the dressing room to look at this atrocity in the full-length mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I returned, my clothes were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, I’m searching for a pair of scissors and bleach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott censures me by subtly shaking his head. I have close to a whole year of this bull in front of me, and the woman I’m trying to protect I can’t even see—my mom. A part of my brain tingles with panic. How is she? Did her boyfriend hit her again? Is she worried about me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to love it here,” says Taco Bell Boy—I mean Ryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure I am.” My tone indicates I’m going to love this place as much as I’d love getting shot in the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott clears his throat again and I wonder if he cares that people will assume he’s diseased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ryan’s father owns a construction business in town and he’s on the city council.” Underlying message to me: don’t screw this moment up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” Of course. Story of my freaking life. Ryan’s the rich boy that has everything. Daddy who owns the town. Daddy who owns the business. Ryan, the boy who thinks he can do anything he wants because of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan flashes me an easygoing grin and it’s sort of hypnotizing. As if he created it just for me. It’s a glorious grin. Perfect. Peaceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a hint of dimples. It promises friendship and happiness and laughter and it makes me want to smile back. My lips start to curve into an answer and I stop myself abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do I do this to myself? Guys like him don’t go for girls like me. I’m a toy to them. A game. And these types of guys, they all have the same rules of play: smile, trick me into thinking that they like me, then toss me to the side once I’ve been used. How many countless losers do I have to stupidly make out with only to regret it in the morning? Over the past year—too many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while listening to Ryan easily digress into a conversation with Scott about baseball, I swear that I’m done with loser guys. Done with feeling used. Just done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this time, I won’t break the promise— no matter how lonely I get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Ryan says to Scott as if I’m not standing right here, as if I’m not important enough to involve in conversation. “I think the Reds have a shot this year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I hate Ryan. Standing there all perfect with his perfect life and perfect body and perfect smile, pretending he never laid eyes on me before. He glances at me from the corner of his eye and I realize why he’s pouring on the charm. Ryan wants to impress Scott. Guess what? Misery definitely loves company. My life shouldn’t be the only one that sucks. “He hit on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence as my words kill the moronic baseball conversation. Scott rubs his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just met him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not now. Friday night. He hit on me and he stared at my ass while he did it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy. Utter joy. Okay, not utter, but the sole joy I’ve had since Friday night. Ryan yanks off his hat, runs his hand through his mess of sandy-blond hair, and shoves the hat back on. I like him better with his hat off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this true?” Scott asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” stutters Ryan. “No. I mean yes. I asked for her phone number, but she didn’t give it to me. But I was respectful, I swear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You stared at my ass. A lot.” I turn and lean over a little so I can give a demonstration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember, there was a rip right along here.” I slide my finger along the back of my leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bought me tacos afterward. And a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I’m assuming you must have enjoyed the view.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear muffled male comments and I peek at the crowd of men farther down the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first genuine smile slips across my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott’s going to love a show. Maybe if I push hard enough I’ll be home in Louisville by dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elisabeth.” Scott drops his voice to trailer-park pissed. “Turn around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve different shades of red blotch Ryan’s cheeks. He doesn’t even look at my ass, but at my uncle. “Okay…yes, I asked her out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott does a double take. “You asked her out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey now. Why’s he surprised? I’m not a dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” says Ryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wanted to take her on a date?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh. Scott sounds happy. No. I’m not going for happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Ryan holds out his hands. “I thought…I thought…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That I would be easy?” I snap, and Scott winces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That she was funny,” Ryan says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. I’m sure that’s exactly what he thought. “More like you thought it would be fun to screw with me. Or just plain screw.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough,” hisses Scott. His narrowing blue eyes rage at me as I thrust my hands in the stiff pockets of the new jeans. Scott lowers his head and pinches the bridge of his nose before forcing that fake relaxed grin into place. “I apologize for my niece. She’s had a rough weekend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want him to apologize for me to anyone. Especially not to this arrogant ass. My mouth drops open, but the brief white-trash glance Scott gives me shuts it. Scott becomes Mr. Superficial again. “I understand if you don’t want to help Elisabeth at school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan has this blank, way too innocent expression. “Don’t worry, Mr. Risk. I’d love to help Elisabeth. ” He turns to me and smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis smile isn’t genuine or heartwarming, but cocky as hell. Bring it, jock boy. Your best won’t be good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE WALLS OF OUR KITCHEN used to be burgundy. As kids, Mark and I would race home from the bus stop and when we’d burst into the kitchen we’d be greeted by the aroma of freshly baked cookies. Mom would ask us about our day while we dunked the hot cookies in milk. When Dad came home from work, he’d sweep Mom into his arms and kiss her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom’s laughter in Dad’s arms was as natural as Mark’s and my constant banter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an arm still wrapped around her waist, he’d turn to us and say, “How are my boys?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Mark and I didn’t exist without each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to the renovations Dad finished last week, the kitchen walls are gray now. And thanks to my brother’s announcement and my father’s reaction to the announcement this summer, the loudest sound in the kitchen is the clink of knives and forks against china.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gwen came to your game,” says Mom. It’s only the third time she’s mentioned it in the past twenty-four hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, with Mike. “Uh-huh.” I shove a hunk of pot roast into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her mom said she still talks about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop mid-chew and glance at Mom. Proud for earning a reaction from me, she smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave him alone,” Dad says. “He doesn’t need a girl distracting him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom purses her lips and we enter another five minutes of clinking forks and knives. The silence stings…like frostbite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to stomach the tension much longer, I clear my throat. “Did Dad tell you we met Scott Risk and his—” psychotic “—niece?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” My mother stabs at the cherry tomato rolling around in her salad bowl. The moment she spears the small round vegetable, Mom glares at Dad. “He has a niece?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad holds her gaze with irritated indifference and follows it up with a drink from his longneck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gave you a wineglass,” Mom reminds him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad places the longneck, which drips with condensation, next to said glass right on the wood of the table—without a coaster. Mom shifts in her seat like a crow fluffing out its wings. The only thing she’s missing is the pissed-off caw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the last few months, Dad and I have been eating our dinners in the living room while watching TV. Mom gave up food after Mark left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom and Dad began marriage counseling a few weeks ago, though they have yet to directly tell me. The need to project perfection won’t allow them to admit to a flaw like their marriage needing help from an outside source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I found out the same way I discover anything in this house: I overheard them fighting in the living room while I lay in bed at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, their marriage counselor recommended that Mom and Dad try to do something as a family. They fought for two days over what that something should be until they settled on Sunday dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s why I invited Mark. We haven’t had a dinner together since he left and if he’d showed, maybe the four of us could have found a way to reconnect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if Mom and Dad feel the emptiness of the chair next to mine. Mark possessed this charm that kept my parents from fighting. If they were annoyed with each other, Mark would tell a story or a joke to break the chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arctic winter in my house never existed when he was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, he has a niece,” I say, hoping to move the conversation forward and to fill the hollowness inside me. “Her name is Elisabeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth.” And she’s making my life hell—not too different from suffering through this dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tear a biscuit apart and slather on some butter. Beth embarrassed me in front of Scott Risk and I lost a dare because of her. I drop the biscuit—the dare. A spark ignites in my brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris and I never set a time limit on it, which means I can still win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom straightens the napkin on her lap, disrupting my thoughts. “You should be friendly with her, Ryan, but maintain your distance. The Risks had a reputation years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad’s chair scrapes against the new tile and he makes a disgusted noise in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Mom demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad rolls his shoulders back and focuses on his beef instead of answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have something to say,” prods Mom, “say it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad tosses his fork onto his plate. “Scott Risk has some valuable contacts. I say get close to her, Ryan. Show her around. If you do a favor for him, I’m sure he’d do one for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” says Mom. “Give him advice that goes directly against mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad begins talking over her and their combined raised voices cause my head to throb. Losing my appetite, I slide my chair away from the table. It’s gut-wrenching, listening to the ongoing annihilation of my family. There is absolutely no worse sound on the face of the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil the phone rings. My parents fall silent as all three of us look over at the counter and see Mark’s name appear on the caller ID. A rocky combination of hope and hurt creates a heaviness in my throat and stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let it go,” Dad murmurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom stands on the second ring and my heart beats in my ears. Come on, Mom, answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could talk to him,” she says as she stares at the phone. “Tell him that as long as he keeps it a secret he can come home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I say, hoping that one of them will change their minds. Maybe this time Mark would choose to stay and fight instead of leaving me behind. “We should answer.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dare-you-to-pushing-the-limits-2/page-10.html","bookId":2753,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:14 PM"}
