In a split second he turned to race along the river bank, leaping over small logs and bushes. At the first bend of the river, he caught a glimpse of Lucia\u0027s body coming toward him. Diving in, he swam frantically to reach her, struggling against the powerful current. It was almost impossible. He felt himself being pulled away. Lucia was only ten feet away from him, but it seemed like miles. He made one last heroic effort and grabbed her arm, his fingers almost slipping away. He held her in a death grip as he grappled his way to the safety of the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Rubio finally reached the river bank, he pulled Lucia up on the grass and lay there, fighting for breath. She was unconscious and not breathing. Rubio turned her over on her stomach, straddled her, and began to apply pressure to her lungs. A minute went by, then two, and just as he was beginning to despair, a stream of water gushed out of her mouth and she groaned. Rubio uttered a prayer of thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept up the pressure, gentler now, until her heartbeat was steady. When she began to shiver from the cold, Rubio hurried over to a clump of trees and pulled down handfuls of leaves. He carried them over to her and started to dry her body with them. He was also wet and cold, and his clothes were soaked, but he paid no attention. He had been panicky with fear that Sister Lucia would die. Now, as he gently rubbed her naked body with the dry leaves, unworthy thoughts came into his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has the body of a goddess. Forgive me, Lord, she belongs to You, and I must not think these wicked thoughts...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia was gradually awakened by the gentle stroking of her body. She was on the beach with Ivo, and his soft tongue was moving down her body. Oh, yes, she thought. Oh, yes. Don\u0027t stop, caro. She was aroused even before she opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lucia had fallen into the river, her last thought had been that she was going to die. But she was alive, and she found herself looking up at the man who had saved her. Without even thinking, she reached out and pulled Rubio down to her. There was a look of shocked surprise on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister - \" he protested. \"We can\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips were on his, fierce and hungry and demanding, and her tongue was exploring his mouth. It was too much for Rubio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry,\" Lucia whispered. \"Hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched as Rubio nervously stripped off his wet clothes. He deserves a reward, she thought. So do I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Rubio moved hesitantly toward her, he said, \"Sister, we shouldn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia was in no mood for conversation. She felt him join his body to hers in a timeless, mindless ritual, and she gave herself up to the glorious sensations that flooded her. It was all the sweeter because of her close brush with death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio was a surprisingly good lover, both gentle and fierce at the same time. He had a vulnerability that took Lucia completely by surprise. And there was a look of such tenderness in his eyes that she felt a sudden lump in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope the big oaf isn\u0027t falling in love with me. He\u0027s so eager to please me. When was the last time a man cared about pleasing me? Lucia wondered. And she thought of her father. And she wondered how he would have liked Rubio Arzano. And then she wondered why she wondered whether her father would have liked Rubio Arzano. I must be crazy. This man is a farmer. I\u0027m Lucia Carmine, the daughter of Angelo Carmine. Rubio\u0027s life has nothing to do with my life. We were thrown together by a stupid accident of fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio was holding her and saying over and over, \"Lucia. My Lucia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the shining in his eyes told her everything he felt. He\u0027s so dear, she thought. And then: What is the matter with me? Why am I even thinking about him like this? I\u0027m running away from the police and - She suddenly remembered the gold cross and gasped. Oh, my God! How could I have forgotten it even for a moment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up quickly. \"Rubio, I left a - a package on the bank of the river back there. Would you bring it to me, please? And my clothes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia sat there waiting, frantic that something might have happened to the cross. What if it was gone? What if someone had come along and picked it up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was with an enormous feeling of relief that Lucia watched Rubio return with the wrapped cross under his arm. I mustn\u0027t let it out of my sight again, she thought. \"Thank you,\" she said to Rubio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio handed Lucia her clothes. She looked up at him and said softly, \"I won\u0027t need these right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun on her naked skin made Lucia feel lazy and warm, and being in Rubio\u0027s arms was a wonderful comfort. It was as though they had found a peaceful oasis. The dangers they had been running away from seemed light-years away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about your farm,\" Lucia said idly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face lit up, and there was pride in his voice. \"It was a small farm outside a little village near Bilbao. It was in my family for generations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression darkened. \"Because I am Basque, the government in Madrid punished me with extra taxes. When I refused to pay, they confiscated the farm. That was when I met Jaime Miro. I joined him to fight against the government for what is right. I have a mother and two sisters, and one day we will have our farm back, and I will run it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia thought of her father and two brothers locked away in a prison forever. \"Are you close to your family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio smiled warmly. \"Of course. Families are our first love, are they not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Lucia thought. But I will never see mine again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about your family, Lucia,\" he said. \"Before you joined the convent, were you close to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation was taking a dangerous turn. What can I tell hhm? My father is a Mafioso. He and my two brothers are in prison for murder. \"Yes - we are very close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does your father do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He - he\u0027s a businessman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have brothers and sisters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have two brothers. They work for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucia, why did you enter the convent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the police are looking for me for murdering two men. I\u0027ve got to stop this conversation, Lucia thought. Aloud she said, \"I needed to get away.\" That\u0027s close enough to the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You felt the world was - was too much for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no right to say this, Lucia, but I am in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rubio - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to marry you. In all my life, I have never said that to another woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something so touching and earnest about him. He doesn\u0027t know how to play games, she thought. I must be careful not to hurt him. But the idea of Angelo Carmine\u0027s daughter being a farmer\u0027s wife! Lucia almost laughed aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio misunderstood the smile on her face. \"I will not live in hiding forever. The government will have to make peace with us. Then I will return to my farm. Querida - I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy. We will have many children and the girls will all look like you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t let him go on like this, Lucia decided. I should stop him now. But somehow she could not bring herself to do it. She listened to Rubio paint romantic pictures of their life together, and she found herself almost wishing it could happen. She was so tired of running away. It would be wonderful to find a haven where she could be safe, taken care of by someone who loved her. I must be losing my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not talk about it now,\" Lucia said. \"We should be moving on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey traveled northeast, following the winding banks of the Duero River, with its hilly countryside and lush green trees. They stopped at the picturesque village of Villalba de Duero to buy bread, cheese, and wine, and had an idyllic picnic in a grassy meadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia felt content at Rubio\u0027s side. There was a quiet strength about him that seemed to give her strength. He\u0027s not for me, but he\u0027s going to make some lucky woman very happy, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had finished eating, Rubio said, \"The next town is Aranda de Duero. It\u0027s a fairly large city. It would be best if we skirted around it to avoid the GOE and the soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the moment of truth, time to leave him. She had been waiting for them to reach a large city. Rubio Arzano and his farm were a dream; escaping to Switzerland was the reality. Lucia knew how much she was going to hurt him, and she could not bear to look into his eyes when she said, \"Rubio - I\u0027d like us to go into town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"That could be dangerous, querida. The soldiers - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t be looking for us there.\" She thought quickly. \"Besides, I - I need a change of clothes. I can\u0027t keep going on in this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of entering the city disturbed Rubio, but all he said was, \"If that is what you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, the walls and buildings of Aranda de Duero loomed before them like a manmade mountain hewn out of the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio tried one more time. \"Lucia - you\u0027re sure you must go into the city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them crossed the long bridge that led to the main street, Avenida Castilla, and headed for the center of town. They passed a sugar factory and churches and poultry shops, and the air was thick with a variety of smells. Shops and apartment buildings lined the avenue. They walked slowly, careful not to draw attention to themselves. Finally, to her relief, Lucia saw what she had been looking for - a sign that read CASA DE EMPEnOS - a pawnshop. She said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the village square, with its shops and markets and bars, and they passed the Taberna Cueva, with its long bar and wooden tables. There was a jukebox inside, and hanging from the oak-beam ceiling were hams and strings of garlic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia saw her opportunity. \"I\u0027m thirsty, Rubio,\" she said. \"Can we go in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her arm and led her inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were half a dozen men crowded around the bar. Lucia and Rubio took a table in the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like, querida?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Order a glass of wine for me, please. I\u0027ll be right back. There\u0027s something I have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose and walked out into the street, leaving Rubio staring after her, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Lucia turned and hurried back to the Casa de Empenos, clutching her tightly wrapped package. Across the street she saw a door with a black sign in white lettering that read POLICiA. She stared at it a moment, her heart skipping a beat, then skirted it and entered the pawnshop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shrunken man with a large head stood behind the counter, barely visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buenos dias, senorita.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buenos dias, senor. I have something I would like to sell.\" She was so nervous, she had to press her knees together to keep them from shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia unwrapped the gold cross and held it out. \"Would - would you be interested in buying this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pawnbroker took it in his hands, and Lucia watched the light that came into his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask where you acquired this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was left to me by an uncle who just died.\" Her throat was so dry she could hardly speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man fingered the cross, turning it over in his hands slowly. \"How much are you asking for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dream was coming to life. \"I want two hundred fifty thousand pesetas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned and shook his head. \"No. It is worth only a hundred thousand pesetas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would sell my body first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I could go as high as one hundred fifty thousand pesetas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would rather melt it down and let the gold run in the streets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hundred thousand pesetas. That is my last offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia took the gold cross from him. \"You are robbing me blind, but I will accept it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see the excitement in his face. \"Bueno, senorita.\" He reached for the cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia pulled it back. \"There is a condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What condition would that be, senorita?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My passport was stolen. I need a new one in order to get out of the country to visit my stricken aunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was studying her now, his eyes wise. He nodded. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you can help me with my problem, then the cross is yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Passports are difficult to come by, senorita. The authorities are very strict.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia watched him, saying nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see how I can help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you anyway, senor.\" She started toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let her reach it before he said, \"Momentito.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something has just occurred to me. I have a cousin who is sometimes involved in delicate matters like this. He is a distant cousin, you understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could speak to him. When do you require this passport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large head nodded slowly. \"And if I can do this thing, we have a deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I get my passport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed. Come back at eight o\u0027clock and my cousin will be here. He will arrange to take the necessary photograph and insert it in the passport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia could feel her heart pounding. \"Thank you, senor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to leave the cross here for safekeeping?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be safe with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight o\u0027clock, then. Hasta luego.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left the shop. Outside she carefully avoided the police station and headed back to the tabema, where Rubio was waiting. Her footsteps slowed. She had finally succeeded. With the money from the cross, she would be able to get to Switzerland and freedom. She should have been happy, but instead she felt strangely depressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s wrong with me? I\u0027m on my way. Rubio will get over me soon enough. He\u0027ll find someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she remembered the look in his eyes when he had said, \"I want to marry you. In all my life, I have never said that to another woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn the man, she thought. Well, he\u0027s not my problem. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-25.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
