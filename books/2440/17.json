They were exactly what I needed to perk me up after the disturbing visit to the Halls of Cremation and Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarious contests took place in each of the three Halls. They were mostly games of physical combat - wrestling, boxing, karate, weight lifting, and so on - though speed chess was also strongly favored, since it sharpened one\u0027s reactions and wits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda found seats for us near a wrestling circle, and we watched as vampires tried to pin their opponents down or toss them out of the ring. You needed a quick eye to keep up with the action - vampires move far faster than humans. It was like watching a fight on video while keeping the fast-forward button pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bouts weren\u0027t just faster than their human equivalents - they were more violent, too. Broken bones, bloody faces, and bruises were the order of the night. Sometimes, Kurda told me, the damage was even worse - vampires could be killed taking part in these games, or injured so badly that a trip to the Hall of Death was all they had to look forward to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t they wear protective clothing?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t believe in it,\" Kurda said. \"They\u0027d rather have their skulls cracked than wear helmets.\" He sighed morosely. \"There are times when I think I don\u0027t know my people at all. Maybe I\u0027d have been better off if I\u0027d remained human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe moved to another ring. In this one, vampires jabbed at each other with spears. It was a little like fencing - you had to prick or cut an opponent three times to win - only a lot more dangerous and bloody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s horrendous.\" I gasped as a vampire had half his upper arm sliced open, only to laugh and compliment his enemy for making a good strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should see it when they play for real,\" someone said behind us. \"They\u0027re just warming up at the moment.\" Turning, I saw a ginger-haired vampire who had only one eye. He was clad in a dark blue leather tunic and pants. \"They call this game the eyeballer,\" he informed me, \"because so many people lose an eye or two playing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that how you lost yours?\" I asked, staring at his empty left eye socket and the scars around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He chuckled. \"I lost mine in a fight with a lion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honest?\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren, this is Vanez Blane,\" Kurda said. \"Vanez, this is -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren Shan.\" Vanez nodded, shaking my hand. \"I know him from the gossip. It\u0027s been a long time since one his age trod the Halls of Vampire Mountain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vanez is a games master,\" Kurda explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in charge of the games?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly in charge,\" Vanez said. \"The games are beyond the control of even the Princes. Vampires fight - it\u0027s in our blood. If not here, where their injuries can be tended to, then in the open, where they might bleed to death unaided. I keep an eye on things, that\u0027s all.\" He grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He also trains vampires to fight,\" Kurda said. \"Vanez is one of our most valued instructors. Most Generals of the last hundred years have studied under him. Myself included.\" He rubbed the back of his head and grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still sore about that time I knocked you unconscious with a mace, Kurda?\" Vanez inquired politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t have had the chance if I\u0027d known what it was in advance,\" Kurda sulked. \"I thought it was a bowl of incense!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVanez bellowed with laughter and slapped his knees. \"You always were a bright one, Kurda - except when it came to the tools of war. One of my worst pupils,\" he told me. \"Fast as an eel, and wiry, but he hated getting his hands bloody. A shame, as he would have been a wonder with a spear if he\u0027d set his mind to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing wonderful about losing an eye in a fight,\" Kurda huffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is if you win,\" Vanez disagreed. \"Any injury\u0027s acceptable as long as you emerge victorious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watched the vampires cutting each other to pieces for another half an hour - nobody lost an eye while we were there - then Vanez led us around the Halls, explaining the games to me and how they served to toughen vampires up and prepare them for life in the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll sorts of weapons hung from the walls of the Halls - some antiques, some for general use - and Vanez told me their names and how they were used; he even got a few down to demonstrate. They were fearsome instruments of destruction - jagged spears, sharp axes, long and glinting knives, heavy maces, blade-edged boomerangs that could kill from eighty yards, clubs with thick spikes sticking out of them, stone-head war hammers that could cave in a vampire\u0027s skull with one well-placed blow. After a while I noticed there were no guns or bows and arrows, and I asked about their absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires only fight hand to hand,\" Vanez informed me. \"We do not use missile devices, such as guns, bows, or slings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never!\" he said firmly. \"Our reliance on hand weapons is sacred to us - to the vampaneze as well. Any vampire who resorted to a gun or bow would be held in contempt for the rest of his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things used to be even more backward,\" Kurda chimed in. \"Until two hundred years ago, a vampire was only supposed to use a weapon of his own making. Every vampire had to make his own knives, spears, and clubs. Now, thankfully, that\u0027s no longer the case, and we can use store-bought equipment; but many vampires still cling to the old ways, and most of the weapons used during Council are handmade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving away from the weapons, we stopped beside a series of overlapping narrow planks. Vampires were balancing on the planks and crossing from one to another, trying to knock their opponents to the ground with long, round-ended staffs. There were six vampires in action when we arrived. A few minutes later, only one remained aloft - a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done, Arra.\" Vanez clapped. \"Your sense of balance is as awesome as ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female vampire leaped from the plank and landed beside us. She was dressed in a white shirt and beige pants. She had long, dark hair, tied behind her back. She wasn\u0027t especially pretty - she had a hard, weathered face - but after so much time spent staring at ugly, scarred vampires, she looked like a movie star to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kurda, Vanez,\" she greeted the vampires, then fixed her cool, gray eyes on me. \"And you are Darren Shan.\" She sounded decidedly unimpressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren, this is Arra Sails,\" Kurda said. I stuck out a hand but she ignored it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arra doesn\u0027t shake the hands of those she doesn\u0027t respect,\" Vanez whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she respects precious few of us,\" Kurda said aloud. \"Still refusing to shake hands with me, Arra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will never shake the hand of one who does not fight,\" she said. \"When you become a Prince, I will bow to you and do your bidding, but I will never shake your hand, even under threat of execution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think Arra voted for me in the election,\" Kurda said humorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t vote for you either,\" Vanez said, with a wicked grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See what an average day is like for me, Darren?\" Kurda groaned. \"Half the vampires here love to rub my nose in the fact that they didn\u0027t vote for me, while the half who did almost never admit it in public, for fear the others would look down their noses at them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\" Vanez chuckled. \"We\u0027ll all have to kowtow to you when you\u0027re a Prince. We\u0027re just getting our digs in while we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it illegal to make fun of a Prince?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as such,\" Vanez said. \"It just isn\u0027t done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI examined Arra while she was picking a splinter off of one of the rounded ends of her staff. She seemed to be as tough as any male vampire, not as burly, but just as muscular. While I was studying her, I got to thinking about how few female vampires I\u0027d seen, and asked about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. The two men looked embarrassed. I was going to let the matter drop when Arra glanced at me archly and said, \"Women do not make good vampires. The entire clan\u0027s barren, so the life doesn\u0027t appeal to many of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barren?\" I inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t have children,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What- none of you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s something to do with our blood,\" Kurda said. \"No vampire can sire or bear a child. The only way we can add to our ranks is by blooding humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned. Of course, a long time ago I should have stopped to wonder why there were no vampire children, and why everyone was so surprised to meet a young half-vampire. But I had so much else on my mind, I never really stopped to consider it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that rule apply to half-vampires, too?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so,\" Kurda said, frowning. \"Larten never mentioned it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head numbly. I couldn\u0027t have children! It wasn\u0027t something I\u0027d thought about much - seeing as how I aged at a fifth the human rate, it would be a long time before I was ready to become a parent - but I had always assumed I\u0027d have the choice. It was alarming to learn that I could never father a son or daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is bad,\" Kurda muttered. \"This is very, very bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires are supposed to inform new recruits of such things before they blood them. It\u0027s one of the reasons we almost never blood children - we prefer new vampires to know what they\u0027re getting into and what they\u0027re giving up. To blood a boy your age was bad enough, but to do it without telling you all the facts...\" Kurda shook his head glumly and shared an uncertain look with Arra and Vanez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to tell the Princes about this,\" Arra said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must be informed,\" Kurda agreed, \"but I\u0027m sure Larten means to tell them himself. I\u0027ll wait and let him speak. It would be unfair to jump in before he has a chance to put his side of the story forward. Will you two keep this to yourselves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVanez nodded and, moments later, Arra did, too. \"But if he doesn\u0027t make mention of it soon...,\" Arra growled threateningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" I said. \"Will Mr. Crepsley get into trouble for blooding me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda shared another glance with Arra and Vanez. \"Probably not,\" he said, trying to make light of it. \"Larten\u0027s a sly, old vampire. He knows the ropes. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be able to explain it away to the satisfaction of the Princes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Vanez said before I could ask any more questions, \"how would you like to try out the bars with Arra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean have a go on the planks?\" I asked, thrilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure we can find a staff to suit you. How about it, Arra? Any objections to fighting a smaller opponent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be a novel experience,\" the vampiress mused. \"I\u0027m accustomed to tackling men larger than myself. It will be interesting to fight one smaller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hopped up onto the planks and twirled her staff over her head and under her arms. It spun faster than my eyes could follow, and I began having second thoughts about getting up there with her; but I\u0027d look like a coward if I backed out now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVanez found a staff small enough for me and spent a few minutes showing me how to use it. \"Hold it in the middle,\" he instructed. \"That way you can attack with either end. Don\u0027t swing too hard or you\u0027ll leave yourself open to a counterstrike. Jab at her legs and stomach. Forget about her head - you\u0027re too short to aim so high. Try tripping her. Go for her knees and toes - those are the soft points.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about defending himself?\" Kurda interrupted. \"I think that\u0027s more important. It\u0027s been eleven years since Arra was beaten on the bars. Show him how to stop her cracking his head open, Vanez, and forget the other stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVanez showed me how to block low jabs and sideswipes and overhead cuts. \"The trick is keeping your balance,\" he said. \"Fighting on the bars isn\u0027t like fighting on the ground. You can\u0027t just block a blow - you have to stay steady on your feet, so you\u0027re ready for the next. Sometimes it\u0027s better to take a strike than duck out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" Kurda snorted. \"Duck all you like, Darren - I don\u0027t want to cart you back to Larten on a stretcher!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t really hurt me, will she?\" I asked, alarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVanez laughed. \"Of course not. Kurda\u0027s only winding you up. She won\u0027t go easy on you - Arra doesn\u0027t know how to take things easy - but I\u0027m sure she won\u0027t set out to seriously harm you.\" He glanced up at Arra and muttered under his breath, \"At least, I hope she won\u0027t!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-mountain-the-saga-of-darren-shan-4/page-17.html","bookId":2440,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:38 PM"}
