Finn seemed bigger to her in the confines of the rental car. He started the engine and asked her where she wanted to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nowhere fancy,” she said. “How about Nelson’s? They have the best fish and chips in town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I remember,” he said. As he pulled out of the lot, he asked, “What did you do today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Today was quiet,” she answered, “which was great, because I had some thinking to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, about what?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember my uncle Len?” she asked. “He used to come to the house every now and then when you lived next door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do remember him. What about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told him all about Bishop’s Cove and Len’s proposition. As she described the crystal white sand that surrounded the resort, her enthusiasm made him smile. Finn could feel the tension ease from his shoulders and his mood lighten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You drive over the bridge, and there you are. It’s really beautiful. You should come see it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe promised to visit someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someday? That means you’ll probably never get around to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t argue with her, knowing there was a good possibility that she was right. They went into the restaurant and found an empty booth near the back. It was more of a dive than a restaurant, and Peyton made sure there wasn’t any grease on the seat before she sat down. She realized how hungry she was when the food was placed in front of her. She ate every bit of the fish and most of the fries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you live now?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“San Francisco.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a long way away.” She said the thought out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A long way from where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here . . . home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t lived here in a long time, Peyton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s still your home. You were born in Texas. Your roots are here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, roots,” he said, smiling. “Then you’ll be happy to know there’s a good chance I’ll be moving to Dallas next month. I fly out on a lot of assignments, and getting in and out of San Francisco is difficult on the best of days. Dallas will probably be as bad, but at least it’s more centrally located.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you do for the FBI?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long minute passed and she didn’t think he was going to answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a drink, put the glass down, and quietly said, “I get people to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited a minute and then said, “And . . . ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbellish, for Pete’s sake, she wanted to say. He apparently wasn’t going to tell her anything more, and she decided not to press. He looked so solemn all of a sudden, and she felt as though he was closing up on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want to change the subject?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I do,” he said. “Is there anyone special in your life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t had much luck dating, so I’ve given it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look he gave her told her he thought she was joking. She decided to prove that she wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like cats?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question caught him off guard. “I don’t know. I guess so. I’ve never thought about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the boys I went out with asked me if I liked cats. Turned out he had seven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn was in the process of taking a drink when she said the number, and he nearly spit it out. She handed him a napkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about ferrets?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set his glass down. “What about them?” A hint of a smile creased the corners of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I went out with a boy who had—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me guess. Seven?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “No, just one. Before I agreed to meet him for dinner, I asked him if he had any cats, but I didn’t think to ask him about ferrets. My mistake,” she added. “He kept it in his coat pocket. We were at dinner when it poked its head out and looked around. I saw it and screamed, and, FYI, ferrets don’t like loud noises. At least this one didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn couldn’t stop laughing. He kept picturing Peyton’s reaction. “In his pocket?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turned out he never left home without it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton loved watching Finn laugh. He’d been so serious, and it was nice to see him let go and relax. “What about you?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got me beat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No stories to share about the women you’ve dated?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral hilarious stories popped into his head, but he couldn’t share them because they all had to do with getting na*ed and having hot, steamy sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “None that I can tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard you were thinking about getting married a couple of years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who did you hear that from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother told my mother who told everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was three years ago, and I was going to ask the woman I was dating to marry me, but I changed my mind and broke it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t see any reason not to tell her. “The drama. I got tired of it. My job can get . . . tense, and I didn’t want to come home to that every night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress put the bill on the table, and Finn reached for his wallet as he said, “I used to think I wanted marriage and kids, but not anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, she said, “You want peace when you come home, right? You have to deal with serious issues, and when you finally get home you want peace and quiet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pleased she understood. “Yes, that’s exactly what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. “Boring, Finn. You want boring. What you need is excitement and fun. Love and laughter. You need to balance the bad with the good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah? And what do you need?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answer was immediate. “Normal. I need normal. Did you find any bullets in my car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he answered. “Come on. Let’s get out of here before the rain starts. The clouds are black. We’ll talk in the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe offered her eleven dollars to help with the check and laughed at his exasperated expression. They just made it to the car before the skies opened and the rain poured down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t think you’d find anything,” she said. “I’ve thought about what happened, and I’ve decided I made all the wrong choices. When the guy was chasing me, I should have called nine-one-one, and after he drove into the field, I should have waited by the side of the highway for the police or highway patrol to come. I guess I was afraid it would take forever for anyone to get to me. I never got a good look at his face, but if I’d stayed, the police would have searched his car and found his gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You also didn’t know that he had a gun and was shooting at you,” he reminded. “You know what I think? You should have gotten the hell out of there, and that’s exactly what you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was making her feel better about her decisions. “I was so angry when I left, I thought about sending the recording to the Internet and being done with it,” she admitted. “Mimi talked me out of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad she did,” he said. “Once you put it out there, it becomes as much about you as it is about Drew Albertson. You don’t want that. What is it you do want to accomplish?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To look Randolph Swift in the eye while he listens to the recording and to hear what he will do about Drew. If he doesn’t get rid of him, I’ll sue. You’re right,” she added. “The recording is leverage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Albertson and his wife should be pretty complacent by now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure Eileen has been checking her father’s e-mail while they’re in Europe, and I’ll bet she has someone checking his phone while they’re away. They’ve also had plenty of time to fill his head with stories about me, don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t matter,” he assured her. He turned on the engine, then reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper. He handed it to her and said, “If you decide to sue, this is the attorney you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate the idea of suing. There will be mudslinging, and the publicity will be terrible. It’s more complicated now because of Bishop’s Cove,” she added. “Swift Publications has never been sued, and their attorneys will come out swinging. They’ll try to destroy my credibility and maybe go after the restaurants in the Cove. Anything is possible.” She stared out her window, reflecting on the ramifications if she retaliated against the Albertsons. Taking a deep breath, she said, “It doesn’t matter. I’ll do what I have to do to stop him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. He watched Peyton for several seconds without saying a word. Who was this amazing woman? She was breathtakingly gorgeous. That was obvious to anyone who looked at her—he’d barely been able to take his eyes off her luscious mouth all through dinner—and she was also funny and smart and caring. He was used to game players, but Peyton wasn’t coy or pretentious. She was refreshingly honest, and maybe that was why he liked being with her so much. No, he decided, it wasn’t just her honesty. He liked everything about Peyton Lockhart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to get back,” he said as he put the key in the ignition and backed the car out of the parking space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn was quiet on the drive to the apartment. At first Peyton felt comfortable with the silence, but after several minutes, she looked over at him. He seemed lost in thought and she wondered what he could be thinking that would make him so pensive. Maybe he was thinking about a case he was working on, she surmised, or maybe he was mulling over her dilemma with the Albertsons. Oh God, she thought, maybe he was thinking about saying good-bye to her. That was it. He was trying to figure out a way to say good-bye without her throwing herself at him again. How humiliating! She’d have to think of a way to let him know she didn’t expect anything from him, to let him leave without making it awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he pulled up to her apartment building, the rain was coming down in torrents. Finn ran around the car and opened her door, and they made a mad dash up the steps. Standing in the small recess at her front door, they were barely inches apart and soaking wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finn . . . ,” she began. She looked up into his eyes and lost her train of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About the kiss the other day,” she blurted. “I’m really sorry . . . I don’t know what came over me . . . I guess I was just glad to see you after all these years . . . I don’t want you to think I do that all the time . . . I don’t blame you at all . . . it was all my fault . . . I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer rant stopped when his mouth covered hers. Pulling her to him, he kissed her like she’d never been kissed before, a long, hot, ravenous kiss, and then he turned and hurried out into the rain leaving her weak-kneed and dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn decided he was out of his mind. He had to be, he reasoned, because there he stood outside Peyton’s door. It had been several days since he’d left her, and flying back to Brentwood for the sole purpose of seeing her again was crazy. He knew it was, yet he still did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was leaving for Philadelphia tomorrow afternoon. He could have taken a direct flight from San Francisco, but he left a day earlier so that he could stop in Texas. For her. He wanted to see her one more time before she left for Bishop’s Cove and he moved on with his own carefully structured life. No, that wasn’t quite right. He didn’t want to see her; he needed to. He couldn’t stop thinking about her, and, yes, that was one of the reasons he was sure he’d lost his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would be surprised to see him, and if she asked him why he was here, he didn’t know what he would say. That he was drawn to her? That he felt the same peace and joy with her that he did when he was in the water? Or maybe he’d give her a little more of the truth. That every nerve in his body wanted her. Craved her. He wondered how she would react to that chunk of honesty. When he’d scheduled that flight, had he planned to have sex with her? He told himself no, yet he’d put a condom in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a little after seven. He knocked on her door and waited. Maybe she still worked at that restaurant. No, she’d told him she had one more week to go and then she was finished. And the week was up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the door just as he was about to knock again. His intention was to ask her if she would like to go out to dinner with him, and if she told him she had other plans, he would try to figure out a way to talk her into changing them. It wasn’t a great strategy, and he was feeling a little nervous about it, but as soon as he saw her, he relaxed. She wasn’t dressed to go anywhere. Her hair was wet, and she was wearing a baggy, long sweatshirt over a pair of leggings. Her face was scrubbed clean. Her cheeks were rosy, and so were her lips. She smelled wonderful, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, letting him know she was happy to see him, but she also looked surprised. “I didn’t expect to see you so soon. Is everything all right? Why are you back in Brentwood?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to check on you.” Yeah, right. That was as believable as “I was in the neighborhood.” What would she think if he told her the truth, that he had made the detour because he couldn’t stay away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re just in time. Come in,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In time for what?” he asked. He shut the door and locked it. He saw all the boxes against the wall and asked, “Do you want me to help you pack?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh no, I’ve got that covered. You’re just in time to eat,” she explained. “I’ve been cooking . . . experimenting on three new dishes. Two have shrimp in them. Do you like shrimp?” she asked as she moved a stack of folded laundry from the sofa. “The third dish is chicken. Will you try them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton thought she’d done an adequate job of acting casual about his sudden appearance, considering her heartbeat was going wild. She’d been so shocked and happy to see him, it took all of her control not to throw herself into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come into the kitchen,” she said. She nervously threaded her fingers through her hair to separate the strands. God, it must look like hell. “What would you like to drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn took off his jacket and draped it over a chair. “What have you got?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, he said, “I’ll have water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer recipe book with notes sticking out every which way was spread open on the table. She moved it to one side and got two bottles of water out of the refrigerator. Finn found the utensils and napkins while she prepared the first entrée. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hotshot-buchanan-renard-11/page-13.html","bookId":1826,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:40 PM"}
