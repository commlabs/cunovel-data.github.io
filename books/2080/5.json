The woman screaming was Sada, her mother\u0027s sister^ and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirl who was stumbling beside her was Ryl, Hana\u0027s little cousin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyl was a pretty girl, ten years old. But right now she looked dazed and almost unconscious. And her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneck and the front of her leather tunic were smeared with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Hana gasped, running to put her arms around her cousin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was out looking for new greens. I found her lying on the ground-I thought she was dead!\" Sada\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eface contorted in grief. She was speaking rapidly, almost incoherently. \"And look at this-look at her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Ryl\u0027s pale neck, in the center of the blood, Hana could just make out two small marks. They looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike the marks of sharp teeth-but only two teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had to be an animal,\" Ket breathed from behind Hana. \"But what animal only leaves the marks of two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eteeth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana\u0027s heart felt tight and oddly heavy at once- like a stone falling inside her. Sada was already\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espeaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t an animal! She says it was a man, a boy! She says he threw her down and bit her-and he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edrank her blood.\" Sada began to sob, clutching Ryl to her. \"Why would he want to do that? Oh, please,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomebody help me! My daughter\u0027s been hurt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyl just stared dazedly over her mother\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKet said faintly, \"A boy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana gulped and said, \"Let\u0027s take her to Old Mother ...\" But then she stopped and looked toward the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eriver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men were driving the stranger up the bank. He was snarling, terrified and angry-but when he saw\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyl, his expression changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, his wounded animal eyes sick and dismayed. To Hana, it seemed as if he could hardly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estand to look at her, but he couldn\u0027t look away. His gaze was fixed on the little girl\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he turned away, his eyes shut, his head falling into his hands. Every movement showed anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if all the fight had gone out of him at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana looked back and forth in horror from the girl with blood on her throat to the stranger with blood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon his mouth. The connection was obvious and nobody had to make it out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why? she thought, feeling nauseated and dizzy. Why would anybody want to drink a girl\u0027s blood?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo animal and no human did that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must be a demon after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArno stepped forward. He gripped Ryl\u0027s chin gently, turning her head toward the stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he the one who attacked you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyl\u0027s dazed eyes stared straight ahead-and then she suddenly seemed to focus. Her pupils got big and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe looked at the face of the stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she started screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreaming and screaming, hands flying up to cover her eyes. Her mother began to sob, rocking her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the men began to shout at the stranger, jabbing spears at him, overcome with shock and horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the sounds merged together in a terrifying cacophony in Hana\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana found herself trembling. She reached automatically for little Ryl, not knowing how to comfort her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKet was crying. Sada was wailing as she held her child. People were streaming out of the limestone cave,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyelling, trying to find out what all the noise was about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd through it all, the stranger huddled, his eyes shut, his face a mask of grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArno\u0027s voice rose above the others. \"I think we hunters know what to do with him. This is no longer a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ematter for shamans!\" He was looking at Hana as he said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana looked back. She couldn\u0027t speak. There was no reason for her to care what happened to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estranger-but she did care. He had hurt her cousin... but he was so wretched, so unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he couldn\u0027t help it, she thought suddenly. She didn\u0027t know where the idea came from, but it was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe kind of instinct that made Old Mother say she should be a shaman. Maybe ... he didn\u0027t want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto do it, but something drove him to. And now he\u0027s sorry and ashamed. Maybe... oh, I don\u0027t know!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill trembling, she found herself speaking out loud again. \"You can\u0027t just kill him. You have to take him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto Old Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s none of her business!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s her business if he\u0027s a demon! You\u0027re just co-leader, Arno. You take care of the hunting. But Old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother is the leader in spiritual things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArno\u0027s face went tight and angry. \"Fine, then,\" he said. \"We take him to Old Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJabbing with their spears, the men drove the stranger into the cave. By then, most of the people of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclan had gathered around and they were muttering angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Mother was the oldest woman in the clan- the great grandmother of Hana and Ryl and almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverybody. She had a face covered with wrinkles and a body like a dried stick. But her dark eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efull of wisdom. She was the clan\u0027s shaman. She was the one who interceded directly with the Earth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddess, the Bright Mother, the Giver of Life who was above all other spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened to the story seriously, sitting on her leather pallet while the others crowded around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana edged close to her and Ryl was placed in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want to kill him,\" Hana murmured in the old woman\u0027s ear when the story was over. \"But look at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis eyes. I know he\u0027s sorry, and I think maybe he didn\u0027t mean to hurt Ryl. Can you talk to him, Old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Mother knew a lot of different languages; she\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etraveled very far when she had been young. But now, after trying several, she shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Demons don\u0027t speak human languages,\" Arno said scornfully. He was standing with his spear ready .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealthough the stranger squatting in front of the old woman showed no signs of trying to run away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not a demon,\" Old Mother said, with a se--veie glance at Amo. Then she added slowly, \"But he\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecertainly not a man, either. I\u0027m not sure what he is. The Goddess has never told me anything about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then obviously the Goddess isn\u0027t interested,\" Arno said with a shrug. \"Let the hunters take care of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana gripped the old woman\u0027s thin shoulder. Old Mother put a twiglike hand on Hana\u0027s. Her dark eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere grave and sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one thing we do know is that he\u0027s capable of great harm,\" she said softly. \"I\u0027m sorry, child, but I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink Arno is right.\" Then she turned to Arno. \"It\u0027s getting dark. We\u0027d better shut him up somewhere\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etonight; then in the morning we can decide what to do with him. Maybe the Goddess will tell me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething about him as I sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hana knew better. She saw the look on Arno\u0027s face as he and the other hunters led the stranger\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway. And she heard the cold and angry muttering of others in the clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning the stranger would die. Unpleasantly, if Arno had his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was probably what he deserved. It was none of Hana\u0027s business. But that night, as she lay on her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleather pallet underneath her warm furs, she couldn\u0027t sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the Goddess were poking her, telling her that something was wrong. Something had to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edone. And there was nobody else to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana thought about the look of anguish in the stranger\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe ... if he went somewhere far away ... he couldn\u0027t hurt other people. Out on the steppes there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere no people to hurt. Maybe that was what the Goddess wanted. Maybe he was some creature that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad wandered out of the spirit world and the Goddess would be angry if he were Jailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana didn\u0027t know; she wasn\u0027t a shaman fef. All she knew was that she felt pity for the stranger and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t keep still any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short time before dawn she got up. Very quietly, she went to the back of the cave and picked up a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espare waterskin and some hard patties of traveling food. Then she crept to the side cave where the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estranger was shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunters had set a sort of fence in front of the cave, like the fences they used to trap animals. It was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade of branches and bones lashed together with cords. A hunter was beside the fence, one hand on his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espear. He was leaning back against the cave wall, and he was asleep with his mouth open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana edged past him. Her heart was pounding so loudly she was certain it would wake him up. But the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunter didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, carefully, Hana pulled one side of the fence outward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the darkness inside the cave, two eyes gleamed at her, throwing back the light of the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana pressed fingers against her mouth in a sign to be quiet, then beckoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only then that she realized exactly how dangerous what she was doing was. She was letting him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout-what was to stop him from rushing past her and into the main cave, grabbing people and biting them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the stranger did no such thing. He didn\u0027t move. He sat and his two eyes glowed at Hana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s not going to come, she realized. He won\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe beckoned again, more urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger still sat. Hana\u0027s eyes were getting used to the darkness in the side cave and now she could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esee that he was shaking his head. He was determined to stay here and let the clan kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana got mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalancing the fence precariously, she jabbed a finger at the stranger, then jerked a thumb over her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshoulder. You-out! the gesture meant. She put behind it all the authority of a descendant of Old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother\u0027s, a woman destined to be co-leader of the clan someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when the stranger didn\u0027t obey immediately, she reached for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat scared him. He shrank back, seeming more alarmed than he had at anything else that had happened\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso far. He seemed afraid for her to touch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfraid he might hurt me, Hana thought. She didn\u0027t know what put the idea into her mind. And she didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewaste time wondering about it. She simply pressed her advantage, reaching for him again, using his fear\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto make him go where she wanted him to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe herded him into the main cave and through it. They both moved like shadows among the shelters\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebuilt along either side of the cave, Hana feeling certain that they were about to be caught any minute. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enobody caught them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they got outside she guided him toward the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she pointed downstream. She put the food and the waterskin in his hands and made far-flung\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egestures that meant, Go far away. Very far away. Very, very far. She was going into a pantomime\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eindicating what Arno would do with his spear if the stranger ever came back when she noticed the way\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe was looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon was up and so bright that she could see every detail of the strange boy\u0027s face. And now he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas looking at her steadily, with the quiet concentration of a hunting animal, a carnivore. At the same time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere was something bleak and terribly human in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana stopped her pantomime. All at once, the space around the cave seemed very large, and she felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003every small. She heard night noises, the croaking of frogs and the rushing of the river, with a peculiar\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eintensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should never have brought him out here. I\u0027m alone with him out here. What was I thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause while they stood looking at each other silently. The stranger\u0027s eyes were very\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edark, as bottomless and ageless as Old Mother\u0027s. Hana could see that his eyelashes were long and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erealized again, dimly, that he was handsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the packet of traveling food, looked at it, then with a sudden gesture he threw it on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did the same with the waterskin. Then he sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana was bristling, going from fear to annoyance and back again. What was he doing? Did he think she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas trying to poison him? She picked up the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efood packet, broke a piece of traveling food off and put it in her mouth. Chewing, she extended the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epacket toward him again. She made gestures from packet to mouth, saying out loud, \"You need to eat,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efood. Eat! Eat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was watching her steadily. He took the packet from her, touched his mouth, and shook his head. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edropped it at his feet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe means it isn\u0027t food to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana realized it with a shock. She stood and stared at the strange boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe food isn\u0027t food to him and the water isn\u0027t drink. But Ryl\u0027s blood ... he drank that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood is his food and drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another long pause. Hana was very frightened. Her mouth was trembling and tears had come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto her eyes. The stranger was still looking at her quietly, but she could see the fangs indenting his lower lip\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow and his eyes were reflecting moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was looking at her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re out here alone ... he could have attacked me at any time, Hana thought. He could attack me right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow. He looks very strong. But he hasn\u0027t touched me. Even though he\u0027s starving, I think. And he looks so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrieved, so sad... and so hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts were tumbling like a piece of bark tossed on the river. She felt very dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt Ryl... but it didn\u0027t kill Ryl. Ryl was sitting up and eating before we all went to sleep tonight. Old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother said she\u0027s going to get well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it didn\u0027t kill her, it wouldn\u0027t kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana swallowed. She looked at the strange boy with the glowing animal eyes. She saw that he wasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing to move toward her even though a fine trembling had taken over his body and he couldn\u0027t seem to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elook away from her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat good does it do to send him off starving? There\u0027s no other clan near here. He\u0027ll just have to come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback. And I was right before; he doesn\u0027t want to do it, but he has to do it. Maybe somebody put a curse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon him, made it so he starves unless he drinks blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s nobody else to help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery slowly, her eyes on the stranger, Hana lifted the hair from one side of her neck. She exposed her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethroat, leaning her head back slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunger sparked in the strange boy\u0027s eyes-and then something blazed in them so quickly and so hot that it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eswallowed up the hunger. Shock and anger. He was staring at her face, now, not her neck. He shook his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehead vehemently, glaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana touched her neck and then her mouth, then made the far-flung gestures. Eat. Then go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for the Goddess\u0027s sake, hurry up, she thought, shutting her eyes. Before I panic and change my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emind. She was crying now. She couldn\u0027t help it. She clenched her fists and her teeth and waited grimly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrying to hang on to her resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he touched her for the first time, it was to take her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana opened her eyes. He was looking at her with such infinite sadness. He smoothed out her fist gently,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen kissed her hand. Among any people, it was a gesture of gratitude... and reverence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it sent startling tingles through Hana. A feeling that was almost like shivers, but warm. A lightness in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher head and a weakness in her legs. A sense of awe and wonder that she\u0027d only ever felt before when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Mother was teaching her to communicate with the Goddess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see startled reaction in the stranger\u0027s eyes, too. He was feeling the same things, and they were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eequally new to him. Hana knew that. But then he dropped her hand quickly and she knew that he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealso afraid. The feelings were dangerous-because they drew the two of them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne long moment while they stood and she saw moonlight in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana watched him, her throat aching, knowing he was going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd somehow that wrenched her insides in a way she\u0027d never experienced before. Although she kept\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eherself standing still, with her head high, she could feel the tears running down her cheeks. She didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow why she felt this way-but it hurt her terribly. It was as if she were losing something... infinitely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprecious... before she\u0027d had a chance to know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe future seemed gray, now. Empty. Lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold and desolate, she stood by the rushing river and felt the wind blow through her. So alone...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah! Hannah! Wake up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was shouting, but it wasn\u0027t a voice from her cave. It sounded-faraway-and seemed to come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom all directions, or maybe from the sky itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was saying her name wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah, wake up! Please! Open your eyes!\" The faraway voice was frantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was another voice, a quiet voice that seemed to strike a chord deep inside Hana. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evoice that was even less like sound, and that spoke in Hana\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah, come back. You don\u0027t have to relive all this. Wake up. Come back, Hannah-now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHana of the Three Rivers dosed her eyes and went limp. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-5.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM"}
