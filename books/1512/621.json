It had similar properties to the Force of the Soul but stronger and more enigmatic. The power scaled proportionally to a person’s beliefs and would generate various effects to accommodate the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan had used the Lambda Driver with different effects. In Transformers, he wrapped himself in the power and jumped on an energy beam, which defied the laws of physics. The effect he wanted right now was merely a push, to push Zheng through the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strong corrosive liquid washed Zheng’s whole body when he was devoured by the slab of flesh. He looked wretched with his clothes and hair gone. If it wasn’t for the resistance in Dragon form, the corrosion might have eaten him all the way through. Fortunately, he could break himself free from the flesh once he activated Qi and Blood Energy even without Xuan’s help. When the shots hit him, the Qi and Blood Energy had just started moving and protected his body. The shots then pushed him out of the flesh unharmed and straight ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng traveled for several hundred meters before he registered what just happened. The land below him was collapsing. It wouldn’t take long before the lava consumed it, which would include all the Cultivation manuals and those who had no ability to fly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Luckily there’s Imhotep. He relies on himself for flying just like my wings. Without him, I would have no choice but to give up on the heritage in order to save the team.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speed propelled by the power of the Lambda Driver was nearly double that of Soru. It was simply incredible. No normal person could catch sight of him under this speed and even the players only saw a trail he left behind. Zheng crossed ten thousand meters in an extremely brief period of time. The propelling force then faded away when he was only a thousand meters away from the Sky Tower. Zheng stepped onto the ground and immediately used Soru to dash forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar behind him was the slab of flesh still growing without regulation. It would be almost four hundred meters tall if it were to stand like its humanoid form. The two shots from Xuan crushed a section off the flesh but the shattered pieces continued to grow on the ground. They then merged back into the main body. Looking at the slab of flesh from afar, the rest of the group witnessed a rolling sea of meat, disgusting and terrifying. Once Zheng flew far enough away, this sea of meat was squirming toward Xuan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am going vegetarian for the next year. Isn’t this beyond disgusting?” ChengXiao was looking down at the flesh from inside the whirlwind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImhotep had a limit to the number of people he could carry inside the whirlwind, which was four. He had to rise over a thousand meters high after all. It felt that the land was enclosed within an invisible bubble with a radius of a thousand meters. Once you crossed outside this bubble, you could fly without restriction. ChengXiao, Zero, Anck-Su-Namun and Jonathan were the first ones to go up. Once they ascended over the thousand meter point, the Sky Stick in ChengXiao’s hand moved and he jumped on top of it. The other three followed him onto the board. It was crowded but they managed to stay afloat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImhotep dived back down without a moment of pause. The land carrying the Sky Tower was breaking up more by the second. The cracks then extended onto the other piece of land. Not much time was left for the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose still on the ground had some sort of AOE abilities. Heng was firing energy volleys with all his might. WangXia was expending all his demon energy on plasma mines. No one thought about conserving any amount of energy or stamina. They wanted to stop the slab of flesh outside of their land after seeing Zheng came out without a single strand of hair. If this flesh were to devour them, what they would lose might not be just hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The energy has always been inside its body. The crystal was likely a control system that regulates its energy, or its processor in another word. Once the control system was destroyed, the body gains all the energy and begin to grow. This might be the god’s true power.” Xuan was looking at the flesh with the Gauss pistols in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the flesh crossed the area of Heng and WangXia’s attacks, Xuan finally opened fire. The devastating power of the Lambda Driver defended the flesh from coming onto their land and devouring all those who lay asleep behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xuan… I know this is not the time to complain but can you hide that crazed expression during the battle? It sends chills down our spines.” WangXia said with a bitter smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng immediately nodded. He looked out of energy. The lightning explosive shot had expended most of his energy. The volleys afterward used up every last bit of energy he had. It was purely willpower that kept him still standing. He would collapse at the next second without this willpower. Even so, he forced his arms to draw the arrow. His body stood without shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s cool, right?” ChengXiao said to YanWei, who was on another Sky Stick piloted by TengYi. LiuYu and Kampa were also on this board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanWei was surprised. She looked over to ChengXiao then back down at the ground. Her stats were still on the level of normal people so all she could see were tiny dots from this height. Heng’s figure was so unclear yet she nodded, as if in agreement with ChengXiao’s question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A man… has to walk his own road to maturity. This road could be as simple as getting beat up when he was a kid, or break up with his lover. But some men need to go through life and death trials, suffer through despair and experience great joy to mature.” ChengXiao looked down and muttered. “What kind of man is Heng? What kind of man is the one you wish for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanWei’s eyes seemed lost. She squinted her eyes as she looked below her feet. The tiny dots were fading as the land continued to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only two thousand meters between the lava and the land. The fall was still accelerating and the land began to split. The flesh had grown to a size that the three people below could no longer hold off. Continuing at this rate, the flesh would crush onto the land with just its size and weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng was four hundred meters from the Sky Tower at this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-16-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-16-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-16-02","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
