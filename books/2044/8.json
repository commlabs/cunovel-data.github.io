If you want a plate of pasta, you go to North Beach. Need some dim sum, powdered shark vagina, or ginseng root? Chinatown is your man. Hankering for stupidly expensive shoes? Union Square. Want to enjoy a mojito with an attractive, young professional crowd, well you\u0027ll want to head for the Marina or the SOMA. But if you\u0027re looking for some crack, a one-legged whore, or a guy sleeping in a puddle of his own urine, you can\u0027t beat the Tenderloin, which was where Rivera and Cavuto were investigating the report of a missing person. Well-persons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The theater district seems somewhat deserted today,\" said Cavuto as he pulled the unmarked Ford into a red zone in front of the Sacred Heart Mission. The Tenderloin was, in fact, also the theater district, which was convenient if you wanted to see a first-rate show in addition to drinking a bottle of Thunderbird and being stabbed repeatedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all at their country homes in Sonoma, you think?\" Rivera said, with a sense of doom rising inside him like nausea. Normally at this time of the morning, the Tenderloin sidewalks ran with grimy rivers of homeless guys looking for their first drink of the day or a place to sleep. Down here you did most of your sleeping during the day. Night was too dangerous. There should have been a line around the block at Sacred Heart, people waiting for the free breakfast, but the line barely reached out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they walked into the Mission, Cavuto said, \"You know, this might be the perfect time for you to get one of those one-legged whores. You know, with demand down, you could probably get a freebie, being a cop and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera stopped, turned, and looked at his partner. A dozen raggedy men in the line looked, too, as Cavuto was blocking the light in the doorway like a great, rumpled eclipse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will bring the little Goth girl to your house and film it when she makes you cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto slumped. \"Sorry. It\u0027s all kind of getting to me. Teasing is the only way I know to take my mind off of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera understood. For twenty-five years he\u0027d been an honest cop. Had never taken a dime in bribes, never used unnecessary force, had never given special favors to powerful people, which is why he was still an inspector, but then the redhead happened, and her v-word condition, and the old one and his yacht full of money, and it wasn\u0027t like they could tell anyone anyway. The two hundred thousand that he and Cavuto had taken wasn\u0027t really a bribe, it was, well, it was compensation for mental duress. It was stressful carrying a secret that you could not only not tell, but that no one would believe if you did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you know why there\u0027s so many one-legged whores in the Tenderloin?\" asked one guy who was wearing a down sleeping bag like a cape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera and Cavuto turned toward the hope of comic relief like flowers to the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuggin\u0027 cannibals,\" said the sleeping bag guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot funny at all. The cops trod on. \"If you only knew,\" said Rivera over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, where is everybody?\" asked a woman in a dirty orange parka. \"You fuckers doing one of your round-ups?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not us,\" said Cavuto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved past the cafeteria line and a sharp young Hispanic man in a priest\u0027s collar caught their eyes over the heads of the diners and motioned for them to come around the steam tables to the back. Father Jaime. They\u0027d met before. There were a lot of murders in the Tenderloin, and only a few sane people who knew the flow of the neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way,\" said Father Jaime. He led them through a prep kitchen and dish room into a cold concrete hallway that led to their shower room. The father extended a set of keys that were tethered to his belt on a cable and opened a vented green door. \"They started bringing it in a week ago, but this morning there must have been fifty people turning stuff in. They\u0027re freaked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Jaime flipped on a light and stood aside. Rivera and Cavuto entered a room painted sunny yellow and lined with battleship gray metal shelves. There was clothing piled on every horizontal surface, all covered, in varying degrees, with a greasy gray dust. Rivera picked up a quilted nylon jacket that was partially shredded and spattered with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that jacket, Inspector. Guy who owns it is named Warren. Fought in Nam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera turned it in the air, trying not to cringe when he saw the pattern of the rips in the cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Jaime said, \"I see these guys every day, and they\u0027re always wearing the same thing. It\u0027s not like they have a closet full of clothes to choose from. If that jacket is here, then Warren is running around in the cold, or something happened to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you haven\u0027t seen him?\" asked Cavuto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one has. And I could tell you stories for most of the rest of these clothes, too. And the fact that clothing is even being turned in means that there\u0027s lot of it out there. Street people don\u0027t have a lot, but they won\u0027t take what they can\u0027t carry. That means that this is just what people couldn\u0027t carry. Everyone in that dining room is looking for a friend he\u0027s lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera put down the jacket and picked up a pair of work pants, not shredded, but covered in the dust and spattered with blood. \"You said that you can link these clothes to people you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s what I told the uniformed cop first thing this morning. I know these people, Alphonse, and they\u0027re gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera smiled to himself at the priest using his first name. Father Jaime was twenty years Rivera\u0027s junior, but he still spoke to him like he was a kid sometimes. Being called \"Father\" all the time goes to their head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other than being homeless, did these people have anything in common? What I mean is, were they sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sick? Everyone on the street has something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean terminal. That you know of, were they very sick? Cancer? The virus?\" When the old vampire had been taking victims, it turned out that nearly every one of them had been terminally ill and would have died soon anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. There\u0027s no connection other than they were all on the street and they\u0027re all gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto grimaced and turned away. He started riffling through the clothing, tossing it around as if looking for a lost sock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Father, can you make us a list of the people these clothes belong to. And add anything you can remember about them. Then I can start looking for them in the hospitals and jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only know street names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay. Do your best. Anything you can remember.\" Rivera handed him a card. \"Call me directly if anything else comes up, would you? Unless there\u0027s something in progress, calling the uniforms will just put unnecessary steps in the investigation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, sure,\" said Father Jaime, pocketing the card. \"What do you think is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera looked at his partner, who didn\u0027t look up from a dusty pair of shoes he was examining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure there\u0027s some explanation. I don\u0027t know of any citywide relocation of the homeless, but it\u0027s happened before. They don\u0027t always tell us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Jaime looked at Rivera with those priest\u0027s eyes, those guilt-shooting eyes that Rivera always imagined were on the other side of the confessional. \"Inspector, we serve four to five hundred breakfasts a day here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Father. You do great work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We served a hundred and ten today. That\u0027s it. Those in line now will be it for today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do our best, Father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved back through the dining room without looking anyone in the eye. Back in the car, Cavuto said, \"Those clothes were shredded by claws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not just hunting the sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Rivera said. \"They\u0027re taking anyone on the street. I\u0027m guessing anyone who gets caught out alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of those people in the cafeteria saw something. I could tell. We should come back and talk to some of them when the priest and his volunteers aren\u0027t around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need, really, is there?\" Rivera was scratching out numbers on his notepad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll talk to the paper,\" Cavuto said, pulling in behind a cable car on Powell Street, then sighing and resolving himself to move at nineteenth-century speed for a few blocks as they made their way up Nob Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, first it will be covered as amusing stuff that crazy street people say, then someone is going to notice the bloody clothes and it\u0027s all going to come out.\" Rivera added another figure, then scribbled something with a flourish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t have to come back to us,\" Cavuto said hopefully. \"I mean, it\u0027s not really our fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter if we get blamed,\" said Rivera. \"It\u0027s our responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying that we\u0027re going to be defending the City against a horde of vampire cats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that you said it, it\u0027s real.\" Cavuto was whining a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to call that Wong kid and see if he has my UV jacket done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Rivera said. \"If you go by Father Jaime\u0027s example, they\u0027ve eaten about three-quarters of the Tenderloin\u0027s homeless in, let\u0027s call it a week. If you figure maybe three thousand street people in the City, you\u0027re talking about twenty-two hundred dead already. Someone\u0027s going to notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you were calculating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I was trying to figure out if we had enough money to open the bookstore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been the plan. Early retirement, then sell rare books out of a quaint little shop on Russian Hill. Learn to golf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t,\" Rivera said. He started to dial Foo Dog when his phone chirped, a sound it hadn\u0027t made before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fuck was that?\" asked Cavuto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Text message,\" said Rivera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how to text?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027re going to Chinatown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little early for eggrolls, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The message is from Troy Lee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Chinese kid from the Safeway crew? I don\u0027t want to deal with those guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CATS.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I not ask you not to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The basketball court off Washington,\" Rivera said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have that Wong kid make me one of those sunlight jackets. Fifty long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get that many lights on you they\u0027ll have you flying over stadiums playing Goodyear ads on your sides.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bite-me-a-love-story-a-love-story-3/page-8.html","bookId":2044,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:42:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:42:03 PM"}
