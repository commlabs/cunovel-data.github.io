This was mainly because no one could be like Lin Ming and simultaneously possess an extremely powerful sense and combat strength.

After all, that was just how strong Lin Ming was. He had even easily defeated a one-star Asura. Moreover, Lin Ming’s cultivation had been the lowest of all the trial challengers that entered, so the prey he had to face would be weaker.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this sort of situation, it could be said that gathering the 50 skull badges for the blue soul level reward was as easy as taking a stroll through the park, with absolutely no difficulties at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf the people present had to sum it up, they were simply on a completely different level from Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for the zenith black level reward, that degree of difficulty caused all the martial artists present to feel daunted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the City of Discord, let alone collecting a hundred badges to obtain a zenith black level reward, even collecting 60 or 70 badges was a rarity that had almost never occurred.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThroughout the entire history of this city, there might not be anyone who had accomplished that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePerhaps in ancient times there were some people that had obtained a hundred skull badges in the City of Discord, but that sort of knowledge was long lost in the dust of time.

He was thinking to somehow conceal the fact that he won the zenith black level drawing reward, but with the method to get the reward the way it was, he was doomed to be unable to hide it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the City of Discord, being too high profile wasn’t a good thing. This was especially true if it was known he had obtained something like a zenith black level reward. After all, this was bound to arouse the jealousy of others and even bring life-threatening dangers onto himself. In the City of Discord there were always those that were stronger, for instance, Holy Lord level martial artists.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming took a deep breath and placed all the badges in the Wheel of Destiny.

At Lin Ming’s level, a blue soul level drawing reward wasn’t too valuable to him. He was aiming towards completing over 90% of the Asura Road’s smelting trial. To him, only the second drawing mattered.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming stood before the Wheel of Destiny.

It grasped the destiny of the world and controlled strange and profound Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAccording to a trial challenger’s destiny, three types of drawings were possible.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe worst drawing choice was to obtain a blue soul level mission badge. The next possibility was to obtain a rare blue soul level god rune. As for the best reward, that was also the most mysterious. That was to draw ‘Destiny’. In these last several millions of years, no one had ever managed to do this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter two-star and three-star Asuras made their drawing, even they were unable to draw the third possibility. The most they obtained was a rare blue soul level rune. This was already an extremely good result.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t hesitate in front of the Wheel of Destiny.

A normal person would take several deep breaths and pray to the heavens before starting their draw. After all, a person can only obtain a reward once in their lifetime in the Hunter Game, so how could they not avoid all chances of being careless.

It spun faster and faster, reaching incredible speeds. Then, it slowly decelerated. The lights lit up over and over, and the final shining rune would indicate just what Lin Ming would obtain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter 10 breaths of time, the Wheel of Destiny stopping spinning.

After all, besides the most ancient of times, in the last several hundred million years of the City of Discord’s history, there had never been a person who appeared that was able to obtain the zenith black level reward. This caused everyone to subconsciously think that no matter what happened, Lin Ming would never succeed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, all of them watched as the Wheel of Destiny began to spin around, as if it was screaming to them that all their previous thoughts were wrong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Wheel of Destiny rapidly spun, yet Lin Ming maintained his calm.

With it, he could directly increase his own destiny! In a crucial life or death moment, or perhaps in the danger zones of a mystic realm, he could rely on this rune to turn bad luck into good, saving himself from the precipice of doom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Lin Ming also believed that no matter how wonderful this Blessing of God was, it could not increase his destiny infinitely.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDestiny was illusory and ephemeral. Empyreans, and even True Divinities, could not fully unravel it. But, there was something that everyone knew, and that was that destiny was not endless, whether it was for a sect, a dynasty, or even an unrivalled martial arts master. If they freely spent their destiny then they would eventually overdraw it and it would slowly exhaust itself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was what others meant when they said that one’s destiny was over, that their days had come to an end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDestiny needed to be accumulated. For a sect to raise a peak supreme elder, that could take hundreds of thousands or even millions of years of accumulated destiny. And once they succeeded, this would also greatly exhaust their destiny. Perhaps after that extreme supreme elder died, the sect would begin to decline. This was the so-called decline after the flourish; what goes up, must eventually come down.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhether it was a sect or a dynasty, this sort of phenomenon would occur because their destiny was exhausted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming made his first drawing, not only did he suppress the power of the Blessing of God, but he also only activated the Wheel of Destiny with true essence. His goal was to not pull out anything good.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut this time, he pushed the Blessing of God to the limit and activated the spinning of the Wheel of Destiny with his strongest energy – Three Essences as One.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe believed that since the Asura Road Master also cultivated the Concept of the 33 Layered Heavens, then using the combined power of essence, energy, and divine would allow him to obtain the approval of the Wheel of Destiny much more easily.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn addition, there was the Blessing of God that he had obtained from the Hunter Game.
