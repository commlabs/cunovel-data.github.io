Garcia undogged the inner hatch, led the way out onto the upper catwalk of the engine room. Silently, they stripped the suits from their bodies, returned to the control deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow met them at the door. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All done,\" said Garcia. \"Fourteen is linked to twenty-two. They\u0027ll both fire on twenty-two\u0027s stud. They\u0027ll seek a northerly course and hold about ten fathoms off bottom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow looked at Ramsey, who nodded. The skipper turned back to Garcia. \"Run into any trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Johnny\u0027s the electronics man. He did all the work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow turned to Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was fairly easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia said, \"Johnny\u0027s safety line snagged on the way in, but I freed it. Outside of that, it was a quiet swim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All quiet in here, too,\" said Sparrow. He nodded toward a cot on the far side of the control room, Bonnett stretched out on it. \"Les is getting some shut-eye. You two had better do the same. We\u0027re going to sit here for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Righto,\" said Garcia. \"The swim made me tired. Let\u0027s go, Johnny boy.\" He ducked through the door, went down the companionway, Ramsey following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia stopped at the door of his room, turned and smiled at Ramsey. \"Pleasant dreams . . . head thumper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey brushed past him into his own room, locked the door behind him, and leaned against it. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould feel his heart thumping heavily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn that man!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fought himself into a semblance of calmness, went to the telemeter box, examined the new lengths of tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow was still locked in icy control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey reset the box, turned off his lights, fell into his bunk and into a restless sleep. It seemed that he had just closed his eyes when he was aroused by the buzzer. He got up stiffly, went forward to the control deck. The others already were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take over the search board,\" said Sparrow. He waited for Ramsey to comply, depressed the firing-board stud at number twenty-two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, Ramsey picked up the beat of it on his instruments. He felt Sparrow move into position beside him. Together, they stared at the scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good job,\" said Sparrow. \"Looks just like our pip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey rotated the outside bell-detector of the ranging system. \"No sign of a stake-out,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be a bitter one,\" said Garcia. \"All of our yeoman efforts out there gone for nought.

Abruptly, the instruments gyrated wildly as the decoy\u0027s scrambler system was activated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain they waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA distant double thump resonated against the Ram\u0027s hull and simultaneously, the scrambler signal stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now track every one of them,\" said Sparrow. \"If those EPs all leave, we\u0027ve made it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey watched the signals. \"Pack quartering over the explosion area. Four departing.\" He waited. \"Two more. Courses southwest. There go the last ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tracked them until they went off his instruments, turned with a triumphant smile and looked at Sparrow. \"Just as you planned it, Skipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ummmm, yes.\" He turned away. \"Well wait here another four hours before going on into the well area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ram crept up the fissure at quarter speed, lifted out in six hundred feet of water and slid upslope like a giant fish seeking its dinner in the bottom mud. Inside, Sparrow stood at the helm, Garcia with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s the ledge,\" said Sparrow. He nodded toward the screen above them. It showed a pie slice of illumination cut from the dark waters by the bow lights, a rocky outcropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I call the others?\" asked Garcia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia pressed the call button. Ramsey acknowledged from the electronics shack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing in the electronics shack?\" asked Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t rest, so I --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My orders that we were to work only in double teams didn\u0027t interest you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skipper, I had an idea about --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a moment.\" Sparrow pointed to the screen above him, a starfish-shaped mound. \"Right on, Joe.\" He disengaged the drive, drifted up on the mound, past it, grounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hundred and five pounds even, Skipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow nodded, plugged in the side-eyes, examined the bottom, \"Plenty of mud for ballast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett entered. \"Skipper, are we --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve arrived,\" said Sparrow. \"Les, will you go aft to the shack and check on Johnny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t he --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been in the shack for some time . . . alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett whirled around, disappeared down the companionway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not be responsible for revealing the site of this well,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" asked Garcia. \"You don\u0027t think I --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow froze him with a look. \"Mr. Garcia, we\u0027ve been shipmates since you were a chief machinist and I was a dryback ensign; but right now I wouldn\u0027t trust you as far as I could see you. One of Security\u0027s men was trapped and killed aboard my ship. The EPs got spy beams aboard us. Someone did it. Do I make myself clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" Garcia turned back to the search board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the electronics shack, Ramsey held up the tube on which he had been working. This has to be how they set off their spy beam, he thought. And it means they could have another one ready to go any second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand trembled as he reached out to plug the tube into a test socket. The hand was abruptly knocked aside and a fist crashed into the side of his jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dirty spying bastard!\" growled Bonnett. Again his fist crashed into Ramsey\u0027s jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey -- bent backward over the bench -- tried to dodge aside. \"Les, wait! I --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gonna save us the price of a trial,\" gritted Bonnett. He crashed an elbow into Ramsey\u0027s mouth, lifted a knee to the groin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God! He means to kill me! thought Ramsey. He fought back desperately, chopping an arm at Bonnett\u0027s throat. Nausea from the groin blow clutched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett dodged Ramsey\u0027s blow, sent another fist into the electronics officer\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake!\" screamed Ramsey. \"I\u0027m no spy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dirty, lying, sneaking --\" Bonnett stepped back, chopped the side of his hand into the curve of Ramsey\u0027s neck, sent a fist crashing into Ramsey\u0027s jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey felt himself going blank, waved his arms futilely in front of him. Something crashed against the side of his head. He felt a sledge-hammer blow over his heart and blacked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came to Ramsey from somewhere at the top of a long black hole. He tried to ignore them, moved his head. Pain shot through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s coming around.\" Garcia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here. Make him drink this.\" Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why waste it?\" Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not satisfied that you\u0027re correct.\" Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tell you, Skipper, I saw him putting that spy-beam tube into a socket and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know it was a spy beam? One of you stepped on it and crushed it during that fracas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looked damned suspicious, Skipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looked . . . schmooked.\" Garcia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHand under his neck.

Sparrow bent over him, supporting his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett and Garcia stood beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey\u0027s eyes focused on the rest of his surroundings: rec room, cot, table, and first-aid kit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to Bonnett and Garcia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett glowering, perhaps a bit uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia faintly worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey groped toward his jaw with one hand, felt a lance of fire shoot through his head. \"I c\u0027n talk a li\u0027l,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow brought some pillows up behind Ramsey, eased him back onto them. \"What were you doing in the shack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tube!

More uncertainty in Bonnett\u0027s expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By someone on board?\" asked Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. This\u0027s urgen\u0027, Skipper.

What --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This\u0027s special. You gave me idea.\" Ramsey passed his tongue over his thickened lips, forced himself to speak clearly. \"Go\u0027to un\u0027erstan\u0027me,\" he said. \"Resonance. EPs are sending out a harmonic on th\u0027 plate frequency of our L-4 tubes. Eventually, it breaks \u0027em down so they become microphonic. Th\u0027 tubes we found were just amplifiers. Spy beam actually comes from th\u0027 L-4s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if we\u0027ve taken out all the amplifiers --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough L-4s sending and they\u0027d interact in feedback,\" said Garcia. \"Wouldn\u0027t need an amplifier. They\u0027d set up a howl that could be heard anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the peri-box?\" asked Sparrow. Then he said, \"Of course: they have to get a clear strong signal into us and the peri-box is the only road that isn\u0027t damped by a plasteel hull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Granting that you\u0027re telling the truth and that this is so, how can --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rig a substitute for the L-4s,\" said Garcia. \"That\u0027s the weak spot in the system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I was testing when Les jumped me,\" said Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett scowled. \"This could be a trick, Skipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia said, \"Can it, Les?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit all!\" shouted Bonnett. \"Yesterday you were both telling me how suspicious --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll discuss it another time,\" said Sparrow. He turned to Garcia. \"What do you think, Joe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds right, Skipper.\" Garcia held up a hand, ticked off items on his fingers. \"It has the advantage of simplicity: all they\u0027d have to know is the plate frequency factor of a suitable tube and they could channel all their efforts toward breaking down that one unit. If the actual signal originates with them and is merely rebroadcast from our system, they\u0027d have the essential elements of a sonoran system: pin-point accuracy in locating us. And what would be harder to detect? Their broadcast would be a constant sound in the ether; so every time we raised our peri-box, our board filters would automatically cut out that signal as nondangerous and we wouldn\u0027t be listening at all on the wave length that would be likely to give us away!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Bonnett was nodding in agreement as Garcia finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia looked at Ramsey. \"Is that the way you had it figured?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-21.html","bookId":2676,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM"}
