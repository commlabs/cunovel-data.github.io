The dragon had lived for centuries, gaining wisdom as dragons do, and in that depth of wisdom, Hephaestus recognized that it should not be staring at the brilliance of the Crystal Shard\u0027s released energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dragon could not turn away from the brilliance, from the sheerest and brightest, the purest power it had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wyrm marveled as a skeletal shadow rolled out of the brilliantly glowing object, then another, and a third, and so on, until the specters of seven long-consumed liches danced about the destroyed Crystal Shard, as they had danced around the object during its dark creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, one by one, they dissipated into nothingness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon stared incredulously, feeling the honest emotions as clearly as if it were empathically bound to the next form that flowed out of the artifact, the shadow of a man, hunched and broken with sadness. The stolen soul of the long-dead sheik sat on the floor, staring at the stone forlornly, an aura so devastated flowing out from the shadow that Hephaestus the Merciless felt a twinge in its cold heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last specter, too, thinned to nothingness, and, finally, the light of the Crystal Shard dimmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did Hephaestus recognize the depth of its mistake. Only then did the ancient red dragon realize that it was now totally blind, its eyes utterly destroyed by the pureness of the power released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon roared-how it roared! The greatest scream of anger, of rage, that ever-angry Hephaestus had ever issued. In that roar, too, was a measure of fear, of regret, of the realization that the wyrm could not dare go forth from its lair to pursue the intruders who had brought this cursed item before it, could not go out from the confines to the open world where it would need its eyes as well as those other keen senses to truly thrive, indeed to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHephaestus\u0027s olfactory senses told the wyrm that it had at least destroyed the drow and the illithid that had been standing in the corridor a few moments before. Taking that satisfaction in the realization that it was likely the only satisfaction Hephaestus could hope to find this day, the wyrm retreated to the large chamber secretly and magically concealed behind its main sleeping hall, the chamber where there was only one possible entrance, and the one where the dragon kept its piled hoard of gold, gems, jewels, and trinkets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere the outraged but defeated wyrm curled up again, desiring sleep, peaceful slumber among its hoarded riches, hoping that the passing years would cure its burned eyes. It would dream, yes it would, of consuming those intruders, and it would set its great intelligent mind to work at solving the problem of blindness if the slumber did not bring the desired cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly nearly leaped for joy when the form came rushing out of the tunnels, but when he recognized the running man for who he was, Artemis Entreri, and noted that the woman slung across his shoulders was hardly moving and was covered in blood, his heart sank fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d ye do to her?\" Ivan roared, starting forward, but he found that he was moving slowly, as if in a dream. He looked to Pikel and found that his brother, too, was moving with unnatural sluggishness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be at ease,\" Jarlaxle said to them. \"Danica\u0027s wounds are not of Entreri\u0027s doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can ye know?\" Ivan demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He would have left her dead in the darkness,\" the drow reasoned, and the simple logic of it did indeed calm the volatile brothers a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly, though, ran on. As he was beyond the parameters of Jarlaxle\u0027s spell when it was cast, he was not slowed in the least. He rushed up to Entreri, who, upon seeing his approach, had stopped and turned one shoulder down, moving Danica to a standing, or at least leaning, position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drow blade,\" the assassin said as soon as Cadderly got close enough to see the wound-and the feeble attempt at tying it off the assassin had made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest went to work at once, falling into the song of Deneir, bringing forth all the healing energies he could find. Indeed, he discovered to his absolute relief that his love\u0027s wounds were not so critical, that she would certainly mend and quickly enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he finished, the Bouldershoulders and Jarlaxle had arrived. Cadderly looked up at the dwarves and smiled and nodded, and turned a puzzled expression on the assassin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her actions saved me in the tunnels,\" Entreri said sourly. \"I do not enjoy being in anyone\u0027s debt.\" That said, he walked away, not once looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly and his companions, including Danica, caught up to Entreri and Jarlaxle later on that day, after it became apparent, to everyone\u0027s relief, that Hephaestus would not be coming out of its lair in pursuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are returning to the Spirit Soaring with the same spell that brought us here,\" the priest announced. \"It would be impolite, at least, if I did not offer you magical transport for the journey back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle looked at him curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No tricks,\" Cadderly assured the cagey drow. \"I hold no trials over either of you, for your actions have been no less than honorable since you came to my domain. I do warn you both, however, that I will tolerate no-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would we wish to return with you?\" Artemis Entreri cut him short. \"What in your hole of falsehood is for our gain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly started to respond-in many directions all at once. He wanted to yell at the man, to coerce the man, to convert the man, to destroy the man-anything he could do against that sudden wall of negativism. In the end, he said not a word, for indeed, what at the Spirit Soaring would be for the benefit of these two?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch, he supposed, if they desired to mend their souls and their ways. Entreri\u0027s actions with Danica did hint that there might indeed be a possibility of that in the future. On a whim, the priest entered Deneir\u0027s song and brought forth a minor spell, one that revealed the general weal of those he surveyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick look at Entreri and Jarlaxle was all he needed to confirm that the Spirit Soaring, Carradoon, Shilmista Forest, and all the region about that section of the Snowflake Mountains would be better off if these two went in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Farewell, then,\" he said with a tip of his hat. \"At least you found the opportunity to do one noble act in your wretched existence, Artemis Entreri.\" He walked by the pair, Ivan and Pikel in tow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica took her time, though, eyeing Entreri with every step. \"I am not ungrateful for what you did when my wound overcame me,\" she admitted, \"but neither would I shy from finishing that which we started in the tunnels below Hephaestus\u0027s lair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri started to say, \"To what end?\" but changed his mind before the first word had escaped his lips. He merely shrugged, smiled, and let the woman pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A new rival for Entreri?\" Jarlaxle remarked when the four had gone. \"A replacement for Drizzt, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly,\" Entreri replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is not worthy, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin only shrugged, not caring enough to try to determine whether she was or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle\u0027s laugh brought him from his contemplation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Growth,\" the drow remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I warn you that I\u0027ll tolerate little of your judgments,\" Entreri replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle laughed all the harder. \"Then you plan to remain with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri looked at him hard, stealing the mirth, considering a question that he could not immediately answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, then,\" Jarlaxle said lightheartedly, as if he took the silence as confirmation. \"But I warn you, if you cross me, I will have to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will be difficult to do from beyond the grave,\" Entreri promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle laughed once more. \"When I was young,\" he began, \"a friend of mine, a weapon master whose ultimate frustration was that he believed I was the better fighter- though in truth, the one time I bested him was more good fortune than superior skill-remarked to me that at last he had found one who would grow to be at least my equal, and perhaps my superior, a child, really, who showed more promise as a warrior than any before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That weapon master\u0027s name was Zaknafein-you may have heard of him,\" Jarlaxle went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The young warrior he spoke of was none other than Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" Jarlaxle explained with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri tried hard to show no emotion, but his inner feelings at the surprise betrayed him a tiny bit, and certainly enough for Jarlaxle to note it. \"And did the prophecy of Zaknafein come true?\" Entreri asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it did, does that hold any revelation for Artemis Entreri?\" Jarlaxle asked slyly. \"For would discovering the relative strength of Drizzt and Jarlaxle tell Entreri anything pertinent? How does Artemis Entreri believe he measures up against Drizzt Do\u0027Urden?\" Then the critical question: \"Does Entreri believe he truly defeated Drizzt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri looked at Jarlaxle long and hard, but as he stared, his expression inevitably softened. \"Does it matter?\" he answered, and that indeed was the answer that Jarlaxle most wanted to hear from his new, and, to his way of thinking, long-term companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are not yet done here,\" Jarlaxle announced then, changing the subject abruptly. \"There is one group lingering about, fearful and angry. Their leader has decided that he cannot leave yet, not with things as they stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri didn\u0027t ask, but just followed Jarlaxle as the dark elf made his way around the outcroppings of mountain stone. The assassin fell back a few steps when he saw the group Jarlaxle had spoken of: four dark elves led by a dangerous psionicist. Entreri put his hands immediately to the hilt of his deadly dagger and sword. A short distance away, Jarlaxle and Kimmuriel spoke in the drow tongue, but Entreri could make out most of their words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we battle now?\" Kimmuriel Oblodra asked when Jarlaxle neared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rai-guy is dead, the Crystal Shard destroyed,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"What would be the purpose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri noted that Kimmuriel did not wince at either proclamation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, but I guess that you have tasted the sweetness of power, yes?\" Jarlaxle asked with a chuckle. \"You are seated at the head of Bregan D\u0027aerthe now, it would seem, and you suppose all by yourself. You have little desire to relinquish your garnered position?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKimmuriel started to shake his head-it was obvious to Entreri that he was about to try to make peace here with Jarlaxle-but the surprising Jarlaxle cut short Kim-muriel\u0027s response. \"Very well then!\" Jarlaxle said dramatically. \"I have little desire for yet another fight, Kimmuriel, and I accept and understand that my actions of late have likely earned me too many enemies within the ranks of Bregan D\u0027aerthe for my return as leader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are surrendering?\" Kimmuriel asked doubtfully, and he seemed even more on his guard then, as did the foot- soldiers standing behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly,\" Jarlaxle replied with another chuckle. \"And I warn you, if you continue to do battle with me, or even to pursue me and track my whereabouts, I will indeed challenge you for the position you have rightly earned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntreri listened intently, shaking his head, certain that he must be getting some of the words, at least, very wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKimmuriel started to respond, but stuttered over a few words, and just gave up with a great sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do well with Bregan D\u0027aerthe,\" Jarlaxle warned. \"I will rejoin you one day and will demand of you that we share the leadership. I expect to find a band of mercenaries as strong as the one I now willingly leave behind.\" He looked to the other three. \"Serve him with honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any reunion between us will not be in Calimport,\" Kimmuriel assured him, \"nor anywhere else on the cursed surface. I am bound for home, Jarlaxle, back to the caverns that are our true domain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle nodded, as did the three foot-soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you?\" Kimmuriel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe former mercenary leader only shrugged and smiled again. \"I cannot know where I most wish to be because I have not seen all that there is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Kimmuriel could only stare at his former leader curiously. In the end, he merely nodded and, with a snap of his fingers and a thought, opened a dimensional portal through which he and his three minions passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Entreri asked, moving up beside his unexpected companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Jarlaxle echoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have returned with them,\" the assassin clarified, \"though I\u0027d have never gone with you. You chose not to go, not to resume control of your band. Why would you give that up to remain out here, to remain beside me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle thought it over for a few moments. Then, using words that Entreri himself had used before, he said with a laugh, \"Perhaps I hate drow more than I hate humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, Artemis Entreri could have been blown over by a gentle breeze. He didn\u0027t even want to know how Jarlaxle had known to say that. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-26.html","bookId":2138,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:35 PM"}
