Even Dan looked impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch your place, young lady!\" Beatrice warned. \"Do the responsible thing or else!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or else what?\" Dan asked innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatrice\u0027s face turned bright red. \"Or else, you little upstart, I will disown you and leave you to Social Services. You will be penniless orphans, and I\u0027ll make sure no Cahill ever helps you again! This whole business is absurd. You\u0027ll take the money and wash your hands of my sister\u0027s ridiculous scheme for finding the -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finding the what?\" Dan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never you mind,\" Beatrice said. With a shock, Amy realized Aunt Beatrice was scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just make the right choice, or you will never have my support again!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe marched off. Amy looked at Dan, but before she could say anything, Mr. McIntyre rang a little bell. Slowly, the wrangling and arguing in the Great Hall died down. The assembly took their seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is time,\" Mr. McIntyre said. \"I must warn you that once the choice is made, there is no turning back. No changing minds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a moment, William,\" Alistair Oh said. \"This isn\u0027t fair. We know almost nothing about the challenge. How are we to judge whether it is worth the gamble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. McIntyre pursed his lips. \"I am limited in what I can say, sir. You know that the Cahill family is very large ... very old. It has many branches. Some of you, until today, did not even realize you were Cahills. But as Madame Grace said in her video address, this family has been instrumental in shaping human civilization. Some of the most important figures in history have in fact been Cahills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcited muttering filled the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy\u0027s mind was racing. She\u0027d always known the Cahills were important. A lot of them were rich. They lived all over the world. But shaping human civilization? She wasn\u0027t sure what Mr. McIntyre meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Historical figures?\" Mr. Holt bellowed. \"Like who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. McIntyre cleared his throat. \"Sir, you would be hard-pressed to name a major historical figure in the last few centuries who was not a member of this family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abraham Lincoln,\" Cousin Ingrid shouted out. \"Eleanor Roosevelt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mr. McIntyre said simply. \"And yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stunned silence fell in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry Houdini!\" Madison Holt shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lewis and Clark!\" her sister, Reagan, suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes, and yes,\" Mr. McIntyre said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on!\" Mr. Holt yelled. \"That\u0027s impossible!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree!\" Uncle Jose said. \"You\u0027re putting us on, McIntyre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am completely serious,\" the old lawyer assured him. \"And yet, all the previous accomplishments of the Cahill clan are nothing compared to the challenge that now faces you. It is the time for you to discover the greatest secret of the Cahills, to become the most powerful members of the family in history -- or to die trying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy felt something cold and heavy in her stomach, like she\u0027d swallowed a cannonball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she be related to all those famous people? How could Grace possibly have thought Amy could become more powerful than them? She got nervous just thinking about it. There was no way she\u0027d have the courage for a dangerous quest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if she and Dan didn\u0027t accept the challenge ... She remembered Beatrice clutching their arms, telling them to take the money. Beatrice would find a way to steal their two million dollars. Amy wouldn\u0027t be able to stand up to her. They would go back to their dreary little apartment and nothing would change, except Grace would be gone. No weekend trips to look forward to, nothing to remember her by. Amy never thought anything could be worse than when her parents died, but this was. She and Dan were totally alone. The only way out was this crazy idea that they were part of a great historical family ... part of some mysterious contest. Amy\u0027s hands started to sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Embarking on this quest,\" Mr. McIntyre was saying, \"will lead you to the treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut only one of you will attain it. One individual\" -- his eyes flickered across Amy\u0027s face -- \"or one team will find the treasure. I can tell you no more. I do not, myself, know where the chase will lead. I can only start you on the path, monitor your progress, and provide some small measure of guidance. Now -- who will choose first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Beatrice stood. \"This is ridiculous. Any of you who play this silly game are fools. I\u0027ll take the money!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. McIntyre nodded. \"As you wish, madam. As soon as you leave this room, the numbers on your voucher will become active. You may withdraw your money from the Royal Bank of Scotland at your leisure. Who\u0027s next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral more stood up and took the money. Uncle Jose. Cousin Ingrid. A dozen other people Amy didn\u0027t recognize. Each took the green voucher and became an instant millionaire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Ian and Natalie Kabra rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We accept the challenge,\" Ian announced. \"We will work as a team of two. Give us the clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Mr. McIntyre said. \"Your vouchers, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan and Natalie approached the table. Mr. McIntyre took out a silver cigarette lighter and burned the million-dollar papers. In return, he handed Ian and Natalie a manila envelope sealed with red wax. \"Your first clue. You may not read it until instructed to do so. You, Ian and Natalie Kabra, will be Team One.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Mr. Holt objected. \"Our whole family\u0027s taking the challenge! We want to be Team One!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re number one!\" the Holt kids started chanting, and their pit bull, Arnold, leaped into the air and barked along with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. McIntyre raised his hand for silence. \"Very well, Mr. Holt. Your family\u0027s vouchers, please. You shall be Team ... uh, you shall also be a team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made the trade -- five million-dollar vouchers for one envelope with a clue, and the Holts didn\u0027t even bat an eye. As they marched back to their seats, Reagan bumped Amy in the shoulder. \"No pain, no gain, wimp!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, Alistair Oh struggled to his feet. \"Oh, very well. I can\u0027t resist a good riddle. I suppose you may call me Team Three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the Starling triplets rushed forward. They put their vouchers on the table and three million more dollars went up in flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Da,\" Irina Spasky said. \"I, also, shall play this game. I work alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, yo, wait up.\" Jonah Wizard sauntered forward like he was pretending to be a street punk, the way he did on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho Wants to Be a Gangsta?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was kind of ridiculous since he was worth about a billion dollars and lived in Beverly Hills. \"I\u0027m all over this.\" He slapped his voucher on the table. \"Hand me the clue, homes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d like to film the contest,\" his dad piped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Mr. McIntyre said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cause it would make great TV,\" the dad said. \"I could talk to the studios about a percentage split -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. McIntyre insisted. \"This is not for entertainment, sir. This is a matter of life and death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. McIntyre looked around the room and focused on Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else?\" he called. \"Now is the time to choose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy realized she and Dan were the last ones undecided. Most of the forty guests had taken the money. Six teams had taken the challenge -- all of them older or richer or seemingly more likely to succeed than Amy and Dan. Aunt Beatrice glared at them, warning them that they were about to get disowned. Ian was smiling smugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you weren\u0027t as important to the old woman as you thought, eh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy remembered what his annoying sister, Natalie, had said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace just knew they weren\u0027t up to the challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy\u0027s face felt hot with shame. Maybe the Kabras were right. When the Holts turned her brother upside down, she hadn\u0027t fought back. When the Kabras insulted her, she\u0027d just stood there tongue-tied. How could she handle a dangerous quest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then she heard another voice in her head:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will make me proud, Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly she knew:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was what Grace had been talking about. This was the adventure Amy was supposed to take. If she didn\u0027t, she might as well crawl under a rock and hide for the rest of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her brother. Despite how annoying he was, they had always been able to communicate just by looking at each other. It wasn\u0027t telepathy or anything, but she could tell what her brother was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a lot of money, Dan told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of awesome baseball cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom and Dad would want us to try, Amy replied with her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what Grace wanted us to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, but a Babe Ruth and a Mickey Mantle...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan and Natalie will hate it, Amy coaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Aunt Beatrice will probably blow a gasket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile crept across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess Babe Ruth can wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy took his voucher. They walked to the desk together and she picked up Mr. McIntyre\u0027s lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in,\" she told him, and she sent two million dollars up in smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan felt a dizzy rush, like the time he ate twenty packs of Skittles. He couldn\u0027t believe how much money they\u0027d just thrown away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since he was little, he\u0027d dreamed about doing something that would make his parents proud. He knew they were dead, of course. He barely remembered them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill... he thought if he could just accomplish something amazing -- even cooler than making the ultimate basebal card collection or becoming a ninja lord -- his parents would somehow know. And they\u0027d be proud. This competition to become the greatest Cahill sounded like the perfect chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus he liked treasure. And it was a real bonus that Aunt Beatrice\u0027s face turned completely purple as she stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the Great Hall was empty except for the seven teams and Mr. McIntyre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a tense silence, the old lawyer said, \"You may open your envelopes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRIP, RIP, RIP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clue was written in black calligraphy on crème paper. It read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRESOLUTION:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fine print to guess,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeek out Richard S___\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Todd Holt screeched. \"That\u0027s all we get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten words,\" Eisenhower Holt muttered. \"That\u0027s -- \" He started counting on his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roughly $500,000 per word,\" Alistair Oh supplied, \"since your family gave up five million dollars. I got a bargain. Each word only cost me $100,000.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s stupid!\" Madison Holt said. \"We need more clue!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Richard S -- ,\" Ian mused. \"Now who could that be?\" He looked at his sister, and they both smiled like they were sharing a private joke. Dan wanted to kick them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute.\" Jonah Wizard\u0027s dad scowled. \"Did everyone get the same clue?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause my son insists on exclusive material. It\u0027s in his standard contract.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thirty-nine clues,\" Mr. McIntyre said, \"are the major stepping stones to the final goal. They are the same for each team. The first one, which you have received, is the only one that will be so simple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Simple?\" Alistair Oh raised his eyebrows. \"I\u0027d hate to see the difficult ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"However,\" Mr. McIntyre continued, \"there are many paths to each clue. Hints and secrets have been buried for you to find -- clues to the clues, if you will.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-maze-of-bones-the-39-clues-1/page-4.html","bookId":1546,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:27 PM"}
