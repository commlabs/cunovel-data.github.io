What does that mean? I\u0027ve never been on the Honor Roll before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means I was better than perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And modest. Must\u0027ve worked pretty hard to get there, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I worked my ass off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and goes back to filling in the ravine with his pencil. A couple of minutes pass and I wonder what he\u0027s getting at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" I ask. \"Aren\u0027t you going to ask me what happened or how I went from top to bottom in such a devastatingly short amount of time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you really making out with Chris in the change room? And that\u0027s why he and Becky are on a break?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I say. \"Hey, that wouldn\u0027t be why Chris isn\u0027t in art today, would it? He\u0027s not off somewhere crying about it, is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Jake can answer, a burst of static and white noise fills the room. Everyone quiets and the secretary\u0027s voice explodes over the PA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Norton, would you please send Parker Fadley down to the guidance office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard that, Fadley,\" Norton says. He gives me this look like I\u0027ve done something wrong, but that\u0027s okay, since it is the only reason I ever get called down to the office anymore. \"Get down there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my books and make my way out of the room, Jake\u0027s eyes on me as I go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not Friday--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop talking as soon as I enter the office. This is unexpected: Grey and Henley are sharing space behind Grey\u0027s desk and both of them look superformidable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even more unexpected than that is Chris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s sitting in a chair in the corner looking so guilty I know I\u0027ll have to kill him when this is over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force a winning smile at all three of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the occasion?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenley and Grey say it in unison, but judging by the looks on their faces, they don\u0027t mean to. I shoot myself in the foot and laugh. They both frown at me and I sit. Chris stares at his shoes. I ignore the knot in my stomach. I\u0027m a great improviser, but I generally prefer having an idea of what I\u0027m getting into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrey starts us off: \"Parker, do you have any idea why you\u0027re here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt comes to me like that: the math homework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am.\" Pause. \"Ma\u0027ams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenley stands. She never wastes time, ever. She may have told my parents she was wholly committed to getting me back on the right track, but she has a school to run. I can trick Grey into chasing her tail, but Henley I can\u0027t trick into doing anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ellory has informed us you copied his last unit\u0027s worth of math homework--homework you were supposed to have completed on your own.\" She rests her hands on the desk and leans forward, nearly elbowing Grey in the face. I have the sense not to laugh this time. \"Homework Mrs. Jones was generous enough to grant you an extension on to complete. On your own. What do you have to say for yourself, Fadley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI concentrate on not blinking. I hear that\u0027s a sign of weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what\u0027s Chris\u0027s punishment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head snaps up. \"My punishment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just did what everyone expected me to do,\" I tell him. \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s not supposed to enable me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts spluttering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, just a minute here,\" Grey breaks in with that watery voice of hers. \"What Parker means is--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough.\" Henley\u0027s voice is as hard as her face. \"Fadley\u0027s right, Ellory. You\u0027re not supposed to be enabling her and I speak for Ms. Grey and myself when I say we\u0027re disappointed in you. However, given the nature of your relationship with Fadley and her penchant for manipulating people, the fault does not entirely rest with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris exhales. That\u0027s when Henley focuses on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker, everyone in this room is on your side. You\u0027re a smart girl; you know that. Did you really think you\u0027d get away with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe someone as smart as Henley would be stupid enough to ask that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously, I did,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get smart with me--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I am smart; you just said it yourself.\" I\u0027d better quit while I\u0027m ahead. \"Look, I wouldn\u0027t have done it if Chris hadn\u0027t offered. It\u0027s all his fault for giving me the option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris sits up. \"If I hadn\u0027t, you would\u0027ve found someone else--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really? Like who, Chris? I find it pretty fucking amazing--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Language, Fadley!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you\u0027re sitting here acting like a victim of my calculating mind considering what I had to do to get that math homework--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She came to school hungover!\" Chris blurts out before I can tell everyone he used his homework to get my goods. This is so great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrey and Henley stare at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was this?\" Henley asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thinks I came to school hungover,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will kill him. Grey looks all disappointed. \"Oh, Parker. Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thinks I came to school hungover,\" I repeat. \"And besides, what I do in the privacy of my home is my business. You can\u0027t penalize me or take away my diploma for anything I do on my own time, in my own house, outside of--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you\u0027re caught drinking at school again, you will be expelled and you won\u0027t graduate. You know that,\" Henley says sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, yes, yes. I know that. I know that. I know that. I bite my cheek and nod, my chest tightening. I want to snap my fingers, but I won\u0027t do that in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which brings us back to the issue at hand: copying Chris\u0027s math homework.\" Like I said, Henley doesn\u0027t waste time. She paces in the narrow space behind Grey\u0027s desk. \"I only have one question, Parker. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s not like I didn\u0027t try to get caught up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not a total lie. There were a few nights where I stared at the homework and considered doing it. That should count for something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like every day I get further behind, no matter how hard I try to catch up, and it\u0027s all I can think about because I actually do want to graduate, but when I sat down and tried to do that stupid math unit it seemed so impossible, it made me want to kill myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt figures the last thing I should say is the first thing out of my mouth. The room gets so quiet I can hear the faint sounds of the chemistry teacher shouting formulas all the way down the hall through two closed doors. Henley stops pacing and glances at Grey, and Chris looks like I\u0027ve slapped him across the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ellory,\" Henley says. \"You\u0027re excused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forces himself out of the chair and looks all sad because of what I\u0027ve said. I\u0027d feel bad about it, but it\u0027s technically his fault I said it in the first place. As soon as he\u0027s gone, I put on my best sorry face, because this has the potential to get way out of hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean that,\" I say. \"You don\u0027t need to call my parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to call your parents now,\" Grey says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said anything I say in this room is totally confidential, so we can trust each other! Don\u0027t you want me to trust you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never trust me, Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess Grey\u0027s not as stupid as I thought or she looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can\u0027t let her do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t tell my parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough,\" Henley says again. The bell rings. \"Ms. Grey, call her parents; arrange a meeting. In the meantime, I\u0027ll be discussing what to do about this math situation with Mrs. Jones. Go eat lunch, Parker. You\u0027re excused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris is waiting for me at the end of the hall when I come out. I maneuver my way around students on their way to the caf to get to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you told them even after I made myself kiss you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you said you wanted to kill yourself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t have said it if you hadn\u0027t told!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t tell!\" Chris yells. People stare at us. He grabs me by the elbow, drags me down the hall and pulls me into an empty classroom. As soon as the door is shut, he turns to me. \"Becky told.\" I cross my arms and wait. He looks nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she was mad at you, because of what we did--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come she wasn\u0027t in the office with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have perfected the way to say his name when I want information he doesn\u0027t want to give. I hit exactly the right tone, frequency, whatever, and it never fails: he caves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She told Henley and Grey she was afraid of you because you\u0027re so... volatile, and then she cried until they let her go. But you can\u0027t blame them for believing her and--hey! Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate her. I hate her. I hate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet walk me to the gym at top speed while a terrified Chris follows ten paces behind and I keep thinking about my parents. My parents. I don\u0027t even want to guess what I\u0027ll have to sit through when I get home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am going to end Becky Halprin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push through the gym doors so hard they whack against the wall. The basketball players--Jake among them--stop playing and the cheerleaders\u0027 heads snap up from their carrot sticks and water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Becky!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI storm across the court. Becky drops her carrot stick and stands, all white-faced and wide-eyed. She smooths her skirt and moves to meet me halfway. When I\u0027m close enough and she\u0027s close enough, I reach out and shove her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit,\" one of the basketball players says behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other members of the squad flank Becky instantly, but it doesn\u0027t matter. I only needed to shove her once, put the fear of God into her, that sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd like I\u0027d rob myself of the opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker, don\u0027t,\" Chris says. I ignore him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just realized it must really suck to be you,\" I say. \"And it\u0027s all my fault.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-13.html","bookId":1897,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM"}
