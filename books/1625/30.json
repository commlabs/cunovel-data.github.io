And there was the ghost routine that Vitoller had cut out of Please Yourself, saying they couldn\u0027t afford the muslin. And perhaps he could put Death in, too. Young Dafe would make a damn good Death, with white makeup and platform soles . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How far away did he say he\u0027d come from?\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Ramtops,\u0027 said the playmaster. \u0027Some little kingdom no-one has ever heard of.

Hwel looked at the floor. Anything was better, just at that moment, than looking at each other\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s what you said,\u0027 said the boy. \u0027When you did a tour of the mountains, you said.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, but I can\u0027t remember where,\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027All those little mountain towns looked the same to me. We spent more time pushing the lattys across rivers and dragging them up hills than we ever did on the stage.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I could take some of the younger lads and we could make a summer of it,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027Put on all the old favourites. And we could still be back by Soulcake Day. You could stay here and see to the theatre, and we could be back for a Grand Opening.\u0027 He grinned at his father. \u0027It\u0027d be good for them,\u0027 he said slyly. \u0027You always said some of the young lads don\u0027t know what a real acting life is like.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hwel\u0027s still got to write the play,\u0027 Vitoller pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHwel was silent. He was staring at nothing at all. After a while one hand fumbled in his doublet and brought out a sheaf of paper, and then disappeared in the direction of his belt and produced a small corked ink pot and a bundle of quills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched as, without once looking at them, the dwarf smoothed out the paper, opened the ink pot, dipped a quill, held it poised like a hawk waiting for its prey, and then began to write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVitoller nodded at Tomjon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking as quietly as they could, they left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround mid-afternoon they took up a tray of food and a bundle of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tray was still there at teatime. The paper had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours later a passing member of the company reported hearing a yell of \u0027It can\u0027t work! It\u0027s back to front!\u0027 and the sound of something being thrown across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround supper Vitoller heard a shouted request for more candles and fresh quills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomjon tried to get an early night, but sleep was murdered by the sound of creativity from the next room. There were mutterings about balconies, and whether the world really needed wave machines. The rest was silence, except for the insistent scratching of quills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, Tomjon dreamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now.

Now, what\u0027s this. “Round about the cauldron go, In the poisoned entrails throw . . .” What are these supposed to be?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Our Jason slaughtered a pig yesterday, Esme.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027These look like perfectly good chitterlin\u0027s to me, Gytha.

Outside a few stars pierced the mists of the city, and there was the occasional whistle of burglars and footpads as they went about their strictly lawful occasions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence from the next room, but he could see the light of a candle under the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the turgid river the Fool had also awakened. He was staying in the Fool\u0027s Guild, not out of choice but because the duke hadn\u0027t given him any money for anything else, and getting to sleep had been difficult in any case. The chilly walls had brought back too many memories. Besides, if he listened hard he could hear the muted sobs and occasional whimpers from the students\u0027 dormitories, as they contemplated with horror the life that lay ahead of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe punched the rock-hard pillow, and sank into a fitful sleep. Perchance to dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Slab and grue, yes. But it doesn \u0027t say how slab and grue.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Goodie Whemper recommended testing a bit in a cup of cold water, like toffee.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How inconvenient that we didn\u0027t think to bring one, Magrat.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I think we should begettingon, Esme. The night\u0027s nearly gone.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just don\u0027t blame me if it doesn\u0027t work properly, that\u0027s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLessee . . . “Baboon hair and . . .” Who\u0027s got the baboon hair? Oh, thank you, Gytha, though it looks more like cat hair to me, but never mind. “Baboon hair and mandrake root”, and if that\u0027s real mandrake I\u0027m very surprised, “carrot juice and tongue of boot”, I see, a little humour, I suppose . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Please hurry!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All right, all right. “Owl hoot and glow-worm glimmer.

That was them again, the same faces, the bickering voices, distorted by tune and space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after he looked out of the window, where fresh daylight was streaming through the city, he could still hear the voices grumbling into the distance, like old thunder, fading away . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I for one didn\u0027t believe it about the tongue of boot.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s still very runny.

Either he\u0027s on his way, or he isn \u0027t. . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and doused his face in the washbasin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence rolled in swathes from Hwel\u0027s room. Tomjon slipped on his clothes and pushed open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked as though it had snowed indoors, great heavy flakes that had drifted into odd corners of the room. Hwel sat at his low table in the middle of the floor, his head pillowed on a pile of paper, snoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomjon tiptoed across the room and piled up a discarded ball of paper at random. He smoothed it out and read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKING: Now, I\u0027m just going to put the crown on this bush here, and you will tell me if anyone tries to take it, won\u0027t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGROUNDLINGS: Yes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKING: Now if I could just find my horsey . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(1st assassin pops up behind rock.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAUDIENCE: Behind you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(1st assassin disappears.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKING: You\u0027re trying to play tricks on old Kingy, you...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lot of crossing out, and a large blot. Tomjon threw it aside and selected another ball at random.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKING: Is this a duck knife dagger I see behind beside in front of before me, its beak handle pointing at me my hand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1ST MURDERER: I\u0027faith, it is not so.

Oh, yes it is!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudging by the creases in the paper, this one had been thrown at the wall particularly hard. Hwel had once explained to Tomjon his theory about inspirations, and by the look of it a whole shower had fallen last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFascinated by this insight into the creative processes, however, Tomjon tried a third discarded attempt:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQUEEN: Faith, there is a sound without! Mayhap it is my husband returning! Quick, into the garderobe, and wait not upon the order of your going!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMURDERER: Marry, but your maid still has my pantoufles!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMAID (opening door): The Archbishop, your majesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRIEST (under bed): Bless my soul!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Divers alarums)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomjon wondered vaguely what divers alarums, which Hwel always included somewhere in the stage directions, actually were. Hwel always refused to say. Perhaps they referred to dangerous depths, or lack of air pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sidled towards the table and, with great care, pulled the sheaf of paper from under the sleeping dwarfs head, lowering it gently on to a cushion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top sheet read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerence Felmet Small God\u0027s Eve A Night Of Knives Daggers Kings, by, Hwel of Vitoller\u0027s Men.

Through it all he ran with his arms open in desperation, knowing that none of this really existed or ever would exist and all he really had was a few square yards of planking, some canvas and some paint on which to trap the beckoning images that invaded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly in our dreams are we free.

It consisted of half a dozen long spindles, covered in complex canvas spirals painted in shades of blue and green and white, and stretching the complete width of the stage.
