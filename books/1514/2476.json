Sharp Celestial Gales were just like blades as they ravaged the ground in all directions. Every gale in this place appeared to be like a sharp divine object. In fact, it was so sharp that it could cut through one’s Yuan Power defence. Hence, if one was struck by it, even a perfect Profound Death stage expert would wound up with serious injuries.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePresently, countless light figures were fearlessly charging into the desolate plains, which was permeated by strong gales.

However, just as the light ray was about to escape, it would be caught by the gales. Following which, a miserable cry of despair would sound, indicating that a powerful individual had truly lost his life at this spot.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTherefore, given how dangerous this place is, it’s no wonder that no one typically dared to come.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough the gales were powerful, there was no shortage of capable individuals here. Many of them moved quickly as they cautiously dodged those extremely sharp gales. Only when they had no other choice, would they use their skills to fight the gales head on. Even though they still suffered, they were in a much better state compared to those unlucky fellows.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAmidst the glowing figures, a ray of light was charging forward with a powerful momentum. If one was to carefully look at that ray of light, one would realize it was actually a miniature palace. Light gathered around that palace and that light seemed quite powerful. When those sharp gales tried to slice it, they were only able to create ripples on its surface. Its powerful defence caused many individuals, who were bitterly duking it out, to feel envious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThat palace was naturally the Mysterious Divine Palace belonging to Lin Dong.

It is rumoured that it sealed many Yimo kings in the past. Unexpectedly, it has landed in your hands.” First elder Zhu Li smilingly looked at this ancient palace. He could detect some ancient symbols on the surrounding walls.

My strength is lacking and I cannot completely unleash the strength of the Mysterious Divine Palace. Killing a Yimo king is not something that I can do as of now.” Lin Dong smiled. Even someone as powerful as Qing Zhi had to use the King Destroying Heavenly Plate in order to successfully kill a Yimo king. Furthermore, there was still a huge gap between him and Qing Zhi.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“There is no rush. Once you obtain the Devouring Master’s inheritance, you should be able to breach that gap.

He waved his sleeve before the space in front of him rippled and displayed what was going on in the outside world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“The desolate plains is exceptionally vast and it is constantly covered by Celestial Gales. It is difficult to determine one’s location in this place.

Staring at the outside world through the spatial ripples, he said, “The closer one gets to the deepest part of the desolate plains, the stronger the gales become. Hence, it would be very troublesome if we encounter a Celestial Tempest. Additionally, we have to be wary of the Demonic Beasts here. They are not to be trifled with.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong nodded. He had always been an extremely cautious person. Therefore, there was no way he would let his guard down in a place like this. His mind quickly sunk into the Mysterious Divine Palace before he took control of it. Then, he swiftly dodged the many incoming gales as he directly headed towards the deepest part of the desolate plains.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlong the way, Lin Dong met many powerful practitioners. These practitioners were all using various techniques in order to dodge the sharp gales. This caused Lin Dong to quietly sigh in amazement. The Demon Region was truly filled with many hidden and powerful talents.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough Lin Dong intentionally spoke in a humble manner when he spoke to first elder Zhu Li previously, his Mental Energy had already reached the Symbol Grandmaster level. Therefore, it was extremely easy for him to control the Mysterious Divine Palace. As such, the increasingly powerful gales along the way did not pose any obstruction to him. This continued until four hours later…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Trouble up ahead.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWithin the Mysterious Divine Palace, Lin Dong suddenly opened his gently shut eyes, before a grave expression flashed across his face. The image reflected by the spatial ripples in front of him showed that there was a dark green swirling tempest, which connected the sky and ground, a short distance away from them. Meanwhile, it was rotating at a frightening speed and the sharpness of the gales within, caused Lin Dong to feel a chill on his skin.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Celestial Tempest.

Then, he sat down before he extended his mind. Immediately, he took control of the Mysterious Divine Palace. When he did so, the many ancient symbols within the palace also began to flicker, before powerful ripples were emitted from them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSwoosh swoosh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe dark green tempest in the outside world, was just like an endlessly long python, as it raged continuously.

Therefore, although it was difficult to deal with the Ten Thousand Horn Beast, it was not sufficient to stop them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong nodded. A thought passed through his mind before the speed of his Mysterious Divine Palace once again increased. At this moment, he no longer cared about the damage suffered by the divine objects, as he completely unleashed its defence and allowed the gales to shatter the various divine objects.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHiss!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Ten Thousand Horn Beast below roared towards the sky. Meanwhile, its numerous horns were covered with blood. Clearly, it had already killed many powerful individuals. Its huge eyes stared at the Mysterious Divine Palace, which was located in the tempest, before ten thousand horns accompanied by sharp gales whistled forward and ruthlessly swept towards the Mysterious Divine Palace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Humph, bastard, you should stop your nonsense!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, a cold snort was suddenly emitted just as ten thousand horns surrounded the Mysterious Divine Palace. Following which, vast and mighty Yuan Power pillars whizzed out. These Yuan Power pillars contained the scent of Reincarnation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSizzle sizzle!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThese two Yuan Power pillars, which contained the scent of Reincarnation, whistled forth. Immediately, the thousand feet large horns that came into contact with them were directly ripped apart, before blood spurted forth. It was just like a bloody rain.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRoar!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Ten Thousand Horn Beast released a miserable screech after it was struck by those powerful attacks. Meanwhile, its attacks became increasingly wild and fearsome. However, those two Yuan Power pillars guarded the Mysterious Divine Palace and made it an impregnable fortress. Therefore, regardless of how fearsome the attacks from the Ten Thousand Horn Beast were, they were still unable to breach the Mysterious Divine Palace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Does this damned beast know how to stop?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWithin the Mysterious Divine Palace, Zhu Li and Liu Qing frowned. As they were located in the tempest, half of the Yuan Power that they unleashed were used to tear through the tempest. Therefore, only the remaining half were used to deal with the Ten Thousand Horn Beast. As such, they had to expend twice the effort in order to achieve the same result. As such, this was taking quite a toll on their Yuan Power.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Young brother Lin Dong, how long more before we leave the tempest?” Duan Tao hurriedly asked upon seeing this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Ten minutes.” Lin Dong replied without turning his head.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Zhu Li duo nodded.

However, all of them were frowning. They were well aware of just how powerful the Celestial Tempest was. If they lost the protection of the Mysterious Divine Palace, they would definitely be separated even if they could escape. At that time, their speed would also be greatly reduced.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Mysterious Divine Palace was silent. After approximately ten minutes, Lin Dong suddenly opened his tightly shut eyes. A smile, which indicated that he was relieved of a huge burden, appeared on his face.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEveryone rejoiced upon seeing this. Then, they cast their attention towards the spatial ripples and saw that they had already left the raging tempest far behind them.

He waved his sleeve before his Mysterious Divine Palace vanished. After which, everyone once again appeared in the outside world. Their eyes surveyed their surroundings instinctively after they appeared. Soon after, their bodies stilled. Meanwhile, their eyes were filled with excitement as they looked in front of them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the sky in front of them, there was a tens of thousands of feet large black crack slowly opening.
