The thought that it might be because she still loved some man long in the grave made Josh want to pound the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlast something out of the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d thought often enough if she would only be honest with him, he could have handled his gripping frustration better. He\u0027d even reached deep to tell her about the holiday siege at his college in hopes she would open up. No dice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now here they were all open and chatty, and he didn\u0027t feel one damned bit better. \"Don\u0027t the magazines all say a percentage of sex is in the woman\u0027s head? I figured the problem had more to do with how much we were apart. You needed more, hell, I don\u0027t know. Time. Time to be comfortable with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo forget about the other guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared down at her booted feet, not so much avoiding but seeming to absorb his words without having to meet his eyes. \"Why didn\u0027t you say something before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And willingly have this discussion? Shit. I\u0027m screwed no matter what I say here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she looked up, so much pain and remorse in her eyes, he had to restrain himself from gathering her against him—the fastest way he could think of to send her running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd damned if maybe he might want to hear the rest of this conversation after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t you, Josh. It\u0027s me. I guess I\u0027m one of those percentages of women who just don\u0027t—\" \"You could.\" And, man, he wanted a second chance to prove that to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, you are so arrogant. Where is it written that whoever has the most orgasms wins? Do you really believe cl**axing equates with love? If so, I\u0027m not so sure I like what that says about you.\" Her pain swelled, mixing with typical Alicia fire and bravado. \"What? You don\u0027t have an answer for that, genius?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis momentary flash of hope at a second chance fizzled, replaced by a dawning sense of how much deeper their problems went than miscommunication in bed. Because still she wasn\u0027t being straight up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to wonder if maybe he was hoping for too much from life. He could toss all the wisecracks out there and somehow there would still be a wall between him and the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh canted closer, his mouth hovering just over hers. \"Maybe it\u0027s you who thinks coming equals love, otherwise why fake it? Why not be honest with me?\" The answer unfolded too easily in his head,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estomping that ember of hope dead even as her chin tipped to bring her lips nearer. \"You thought I\u0027d walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m not so sure I like what that says about what you think of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand clamped around the back of his head. She yanked him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh jolted in surprise. He should have seen it coming, if for no other reason than it made zero sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia was all about the unexpected, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arched against him, her mouth open, hot and needy under his just as he remembered from so many times before with her. The hot pulse of lust surged through him, lust and something else he didn\u0027t want in his life anymore. Her tongue met and tangled with his, stroking insistently with a moist heat that warmed him from the inside out. Little whimpers tore from her throat, vibrating against him and assuring him nobody was faking anything at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlastering herself to him, Alicia locked her arms around his neck, her body flattened to his until he could almost swear their layers of clothes melted away. He pressed her against the tree, no clue where this was going but unable to scrounge the will to stop after weeks without the feel of her against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fresh gust of wind battered his back, but he barely felt it. Rustling branches overhead sounded too much like rustling sheets for his comfort level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSplat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept sheets didn\u0027t dump snow on his head. The cold thud brought a needed splash of reality. His fogged brain cleared enough for him to sense the desperation and frenzy in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh eased away. \"We need to stop and find cover for the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia\u0027s hold stayed strong. \"No. Later,\" she mumbled, tracing his bottom lip with her tongue. \"Soon. Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backed away from the tree. From her. From the temptation to say screw it all and keep kissing her instead of talking, because he knew well the woman enjoyed the hell out of kissing him. \"Come on. We are done with this topic of conversation. And anything else, for that matter. I\u0027m going to find somewhere to camp and you\u0027d damn well better follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swiped aside a branch and forced his feet forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like what I\u0027m thinking about you? Well you did walk, Joshua Rosen.\" Her accusation full of pain chased him on the wind. \"You\u0027re walking now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh? He stopped without turning. \"Are you saying you didn\u0027t want me to move out of the apartment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she didn\u0027t answer, he glanced back over his shoulder. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic flared in her eyes along with poorly shielded hurt. \"Um, you know, I think you were right earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0027t the time to discuss anything important. The one-in-four-decisions-sucking rule, remember?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, the longer we stand around, the longer we\u0027re cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to snap right back, then hesitated. He\u0027d seen his wife face enemy fire without flinching, yet now her voice trembled from fear over...what? Not the cold, but something else that apparently he\u0027d been too wrapped up in his own bruised ego to notice before. If he ever expected to move on with his life, he needed to bank his anger and settle things with her one way or another. He couldn\u0027t live in this limbo any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, he planted his boots and stood his ground. \"I asked you a question. Were you just pissed and not serious when you told me to get the hell out and don\u0027t come back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears pooled and crystallized in the corners of her eyes. Tears—holy hell—from Alicia?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Josh. And I really do mean that. I thought that...\" She paused, struggling for words. \"That what we had would be enough. That I could get past— That I could be—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTipping her face to the sky, she blinked fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped closer. \"Alicia—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop.\" She held up a shaky hand as if to place fresh barriers between them. As if there weren\u0027t enough already. \"This isn\u0027t going to get us anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you or were you not serious?\" \"I meant every word.\" \"Do you still mean them?\" She hesitated a second too long. \"Yes. Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot buying it. \"Maybe we should—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she insisted, both hands up, palms facing out to stop him this time. \"I know you. You resent not being able to decipher something. Figuring me out has become a challenge to you. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently she understood him pretty well. \"I\u0027ll admit to that. But it\u0027s not the whole picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Regardless, how about I clear up the mystery for you? This isn\u0027t something you can fix. The problem is mine and it\u0027s not fixable,\" she insisted with a strength that suddenly seemed brittle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you so damned sure? Maybe I might have an answer for you, but we\u0027ll never know for sure since you\u0027re holding out on me, and I don\u0027t mean in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stilled. \"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you do. Even if we end up in divorce court, we meant something to each other. I do not want to spend the rest of my life wondering where the hell I screwed up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many times do I have to repeat myself?\" Her voice cracked. \"It wasn\u0027t you. You need all the facts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFine. Eight years ago, I was dating a man. Ben. We were thinking about getting married. But I imagine my blabbermouth sister has already told you that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t bother acknowledging the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What my sister didn\u0027t know was that over Christmas break, I turned down his surprise gift of a two-carat solitaire engagement ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurned down?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe definitely hadn\u0027t seen this twist coming. \"So why does this guy still have such a hold over you?\" \"His possessiveness had become smothering.\" She forced the facts out on labored wafts of air, but with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshoulders braced. \"He didn\u0027t take it well. But I was prepared for that and it didn\u0027t worry me. After all, I was only a semester away from being a commissioned officer. A warrior. I could protect myself. Or so I thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer he\u0027d been waiting for roared to life inside him ahead of the rest of her words. He knew what would come next. And no. Hell, no! He wanted to back up this conversation, somehow roll back time eight years to wipe out what he was now certain had happened to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilious rage burned up his throat, only to be frozen into a choking chunk of frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia met his gaze dead-on, warrior strong even when wounded, her face as wind-raw as her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I told him it was over, he attacked me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia held herself still and tall, so brittle inside she feared the building winds might shatter her. Even more than the storm winds, she feared Josh\u0027s reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze raked from the hard lines of his stoic face to his fisted gloves, all the way down to his mukluks planted in the snow, while she waited for him to absorb the words she\u0027d never told anyone. Snow pouring from the sky collected on his shoulders while he waited for her to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever said confiding heartache lessened the burden had been a big, fat fraud. She didn\u0027t feel one bit better. In fact, the burden so overpowered her right now, she longed to sink into a drift or climb up one of those towering trees again and hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot behavior worthy of her uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to remember that night from eight years ago, much less talk about it. But somehow Josh slipped past her defenses, pushed her buttons, pushed her until the words had spilled free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently she hadn\u0027t kept him in the dark after all. A mortifying thought. She wasn\u0027t totally inexperienced. She knew enough to realize Josh was good in bed. Really good. Generous and sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just wished she could fully benefit, that they both could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe deserved an explanation. But why did it have to be now? Although something about this stark, ends-of-the-earth landscape echoed the rawness inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh\u0027s silence left her fidgeting until finally she blurted, \"He didn\u0027t assault me sexually, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re thinking. You can relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax?\" He shook his head slowly, still not moving otherwise. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was he thinking? She forced words up her throat, each one scraping like icy shards. \"He was...be yond upset. But somehow I still didn\u0027t see the first punch coming—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rustling sounded from behind her, and how she welcomed the distraction as a chance to gather her thoughts. Her instincts kicked in, and survival thoughts took over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh\u0027s head jerked up. He shoved past and ahead of her, predictably protecting. Rather than argue, she decided to watch his back. The man needed it whether he realized it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dipped her hand inside her parka to pull her flare gun from her survival vest. Steps stealthy, they dodged larger drifts, minimizing the crunching of snow as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart pounded in her ears, pumped in her chest so hard surely her jacket must be pulsing. Branches swayed and crackled ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down,\" Josh ordered in a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped to her stomach beside him. Birch boughs swept wide. She tensed, hand gripping the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground trembled under her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaribou raced into sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe exhaled a gust of relief. The small herd loped past, kicking up a cloud of dusty snow behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension seeped from her. Rolling to her side, she steadied her heart and studied her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOops, not the best way to steady her heart, but still she couldn\u0027t help but stare at him to reassure herself he was whole and not seconds away from meeting some illegal miner\u0027s rifle. \"Josh? Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look.\" He pointed to the gaping tunnel formed by broken branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragging her eyes from him, she looked ahead, squinting. Slowly, the fragmented landscape came into focus to showcase a small clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rusty metal Quonset hut filled the area, apparently abandoned. Leaving her with no other excuses to avoid the rest of her discussion with her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh rechecked his newly fashioned lock on the door inside the Quonset hut. Not exactly the Hilton in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawaii, but more welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wedged a piece of wood against the door, which was pounded by battering winds and sheeting ice that picked up force and speed with each passing minute. He\u0027d managed the best he could with security and was fast running out of tasks to keep his mind off Alicia behind him preparing to wash. Taking off her ice-caked clothing and draping it over fishing wire strung across the lone room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocus on survival, not the sound of rustling clothes and water trickling into a metal basin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePadding along the wood floor in his bare feet, he surveyed the twenty-by-ten-foot metal shelter, which looked more like half a rusty metal cylinder dropped onto the ground. But it blocked the howling snowstorm kicking back up full force. The single door also made guarding their backs from intruders a helluva lot easier, not that anyone would be coming their way until the renewed blizzard passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woodstove already snapped with a fire, cranking the temp inside up to a balmy fifty degrees while melting a second basin tub of ice. The open grate allowed the flames to cast a low haze of light through the room, along with dwindling sun through the thick Plexiglas window in the door. They would be able to conserve their flashlight batteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily law enforcement and other government agencies kept such buildings stocked with rudimentary survival supplies, a routine part of the state budget. Rarely were the places looted. There wasn\u0027t much to take, anyway, just a small box of dehydrated foods, a couple of aluminum washtubs, a woodstove\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewelded to the floor with stacks of wood beside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd four sleeping-bag bedrolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d think about the bed part later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fishing line swayed under the weight of the drying winter gear, his parka and snow pants as well as hers, creating a makeshift curtain to conceal Alicia while she washed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept it didn\u0027t block all of her from view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer feet shuffled in a semicircle—in toe socks patterned with reindeer sporting neon noses. The festive garb seemed out of synch with the stark setting and yet so...her. Somehow that view of her tempted him as much as if the curtain vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhaustion swamped him. He must be near dead on his feet, otherwise he wouldn\u0027t be standing around gawking at her socks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing left to do but strip down, too. Survival first. Clothes damp from snow and sweat were killers out here. He peeled off his flight suit, socks, thermal shirt and pants. Washed, shaved. Dumped in more buckets of ice to melt. And still Alicia hadn\u0027t come out. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/soldier-s-christmas-wingmen-warriors-8/page-7.html","bookId":2640,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:46 PM"}
