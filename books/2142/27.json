He put Sunrise into swift pursuit, and the pegasus, seeming no less excited than he, flew off after the target with all speed. Just a few seconds later, Drizzt knew that he, too, had been spotted, for his counterparts turned his way and Sunset\u0027s wings beat the air with no less fervor than those of Sunrise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after, both Drizzt and Innovindil confirmed that it was indeed the other. The two winged horses swooped by each other, circled, and came back. Neither rider controlled the mounts then, as Sunrise and Sunset flew through an aerial ballet, a dance of joy, weaving and diving side by side, separating with sudden swerving swoops and coming back together in a rush that left both Drizzt and Innovindil breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, they put down upon the stone, and the elf and the drow leaped from their seats and charged into each other\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you lost to me!\" Innovindil cried, burying her face in Drizzt\u0027s thick white hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt didn\u0027t answer, other than to hug her all the tighter. He never wanted to let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnovindil put him out to arms\u0027 length, stared at him, shaking her head in disbelief, then crushed him back in her hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside them, Sunrise and Sunset pawed the ground and tossed their heads near to each other, then galloped off, leaping and bucking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you rescued Sunrise,\" Innovindil breathed, again moving back from the drow - and when she did, Drizzt saw that her cheeks were streaked with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one way to explain it,\" he answered, deadpan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnovindil looked at him curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a tale to tell,\" Drizzt promised. \"I have battled with King Obould.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s somber silence was all the answer he needed to give.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am surprised to find you out here,\" he said a moment later. \"I would have thought that you would return to the Moonwood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, only to find that most of my people have marched across the river to the aid of Mithral Hall. The dwarves have broken out of the eastern gate, and have joined with Citadel Felbarr. Even now, they strengthen their defenses and have begun construction of a bridge across the River Surbrin to reconnect Mithral Hall to the other kingdoms of the Silver Marches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good news,\" the drow remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obould will not be easily expelled,\" Innovindil reminded him, and the drow nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were flying south, then, to the eastern gate?\" Drizzt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Innovindil replied. \"I have been scouting the lands. When I go before the assembly at Mithral Hall, I wish to give a complete accounting of Obould\u0027s movements here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what you have seen is not promising.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obould will not be easily expelled,\" the elf said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have seen as much,\" said Drizzt. \"Gerti Orelsdottr informed me that King Obould has sent a large contingent of orcs northeast along the Spine of the World to begin construction of a vast orc city that he will name Dark Arrow Keep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gerti Orelsdottr?\" Innovindil\u0027s jaw drooped open with disbelief as she spoke the name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt grinned at her. \"I told you I had a tale to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two moved to a quiet and sheltered spot and Drizzt did just that, detailing his good fortune in escaping the underground river and the surprising decisions of Gerti Orelsdottr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guenhwyvar saved your life,\" Innovindil concluded, and Drizzt didn\u0027t disagree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the frost giants showed surprising foresight,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is good news for all the land,\" said Innovindil. \"If the frost giants are abandoning Obould\u0027s cause, then he is far weaker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt wasn\u0027t so certain of that estimation, given the level of construction on defensive fortifications he had witnessed in flying over the region. And he wasn\u0027t even certain that Gerti was truly abandoning Obould\u0027s cause. Abandoning Obould, yes, but the greater cause?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely my people, the dwarves, and the humans will fare better against orcs alone than against orc ranks bolstered by frost giants,\" Innovindil said to the drow\u0027s doubting expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True enough,\" Drizzt had to admit. \"And perhaps this is but the beginning of the greater erosion of the invading army that we all believe will occur. Orc tribes, too, have rarely remained loyal to a single leader. Perhaps their nature will reveal itself in the form of battles across the mountaintops, orc fortress against orc fortress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should increase the pressure on the pig-faced creatures,\" Innovindil said, a sly grin creasing her face. \"Now is the time to remind them that perhaps they were not wise in choosing to follow the ill-fated excursion of Obould Many-Arrows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s lavender eyes sparkled. \"There is no reason that we have to do all of our scouting from high above. We should come down, now and again, and test the mettle of our enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And perhaps weaken that resolve?\" Innovindil asked, her grin widening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt rubbed his fingers together. Fresh from his defeat at the hands of Obould, he was quite anxious to get back into battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the sun set that very same day, a pair of winged horses bore their riders above a small encampment of orc soldiers. They came down powerfully, side by side, and both drow and moon elf rolled off the back of their respective mounts, hit the ground running and in balance and followed the thundering steeds right through the heart of the camp, scattering orcs as they went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Drizzt and Innovindil managed a few strikes in that initial confusion, but neither slowed long enough to focus on any particular enemy. By the time Sunset and Sunrise had gone out the other side of the small camp, the two elves were joined, forearm to forearm, blades working in perfect and deadly harmony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t kill all twenty-three orcs in that particular camp, though so confused and terrified were the brutes at the onset of battle, more intent in getting out of the way than in offering any defense, that the devastating pair likely could have. The fight was as much about sending a message to their enemies as it was to kill orcs. Through all the wild moments of fighting, Sunset and Sunrise played their role to perfection, swooping in and kicking at orc heads, and at one point, crashing down atop a cluster of orcs that seemed to be forming a coherent defensive posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon enough, Drizzt and Innovindil were on their mounts again and thundering away, not taking wing for twilight was upon them, but running off across the stony, snowy ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir message had been delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orc stared down the end of its bloody blade, to its latest victim squirming on the ground. Three swipes had brought it down, had taken its arm, and had left long, deep gashes running nearly the length of the dying orc\u0027s torso. So much blood soaked the fallen orc\u0027s leather tunic that anyone viewing the creature would be certain that it had been cut more than three times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the beauty of Khazid\u0027hea, though, for the wicked sword did not snag on leather ties or bone, or even thin metal clasps. Cutter was its nickname, and the name the sentient sword was using when communicating with its current wielder. And Cutter was a name that newest wielder understood to be quite apropos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral orcs had challenged the sword-wielder for the blade. All of them, even a pair who attacked the sword-wielder together, and another orc thought to be the best fighter in the region, lay dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there anything that we cannot accomplish? the sword asked the orc, and the creature responded with a toothy smile. Is there any foe we cannot defeat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, Khazid\u0027hea thought the orc a rather pitiful specimen, and the sword knew that almost all of the orcs it had killed in its hands might have won their battle had the sword-wielder been holding a lesser weapon. At one point against the most formidable of the foes, Khazid\u0027hea, who was telepathically directing its wielder through the combat, had considered turning the orc the wrong way so that its opponent would win and claim the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the moment, Khazid\u0027hea didn\u0027t want to take those risks. It had an orc that was capable in combat, though minimally so, but was a wielder Khazid\u0027hea could easily dominate. Through that orc, the sentient sword intended to find a truly worthy companion, and until one presented itself, the orc would suffice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword imagined itself in the hands of mighty Obould Many-Arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that pleasant thought in mind, Khazid\u0027hea contented itself with its current wielder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last fight, this last dead orc, marked the end of any immediate prospective challengers, for all the other orcs working at the defensive fortification had made it quite clear that they wanted nothing to do with the sword-wielder and his new and deadly toy. With that, Khazid\u0027hea went back into its sheath, its work done but its hunger far from sated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hunger could never be sated. That hunger had made the sword reach out to Delly Curtie so that it could be free of Catti-brie, a once-capable wielder who would not see battle again anytime soon, though a war waged outside her door. That hunger had made Khazid\u0027hea force Delly into the wild North, for the region beyond the great river was mired in peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhazid\u0027hea hated peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so the sword became quite agitated over the next few days, when no orcs stepped forth to challenge the sword\u0027s current wielder. Khazid\u0027hea thus began to execute its plan, whispering in the thoughts of the orc, teasing it with promises of supplanting Obould.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there anything we cannot do? the sword kept asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Khazid\u0027hea felt a wall of surprisingly stubborn resistance every time it hinted about Obould. The orc, all the orcs, thought of their leader in terms beyond the norm. It took some time for Khazid\u0027hea to truly appreciate that in compelling the orc to supplant Obould, it was asking the orc to assume the mantle of a god. When that reality sank in, the sentient sword backed away its demands, biding its time, hoping to learn more of the orc army\u0027s structure so that it could choose an alternative target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn those days of mundane labor and boring peace, Khazid\u0027hea heard the whisper of a name it knew well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re saying that the drow elf is Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, friend of King Bruenor,\" another orc told a group that including the sword\u0027s current wielder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sentient sword soaked it all in. Apparently, Drizzt and a companion were striking at orc camps in the region, and many had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the sword-wielder left that discussion, Khazid\u0027hea entered its mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow great will you be if you bring Drizzt Do\u0027Urden\u0027s head to King Obould? the devilish sword asked, and it accompanied the question with a series of images of glory and accolades, of a hacked drow elf lying dead at the orc champion\u0027s feet. Of shamans dancing and throwing their praise, and orc females swooning at the mere sight of the conquering champion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can kill him, the sword promised when it sensed doubt. You and I together can defeat Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. I know him well, and know his failings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, the sword-wielder began to ask more pointed questions of the orc who had relayed the rumors of the murderous dark elf. Where had the attacks occurred? Were they certain that the drow had been involved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, Khazid\u0027hea in its hand and in its thoughts, the sword-wielder slipped away from its companions and started off across the stony ground, seeking its victim and its glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for Khazid\u0027hea, the search was for a new and very worthy wielder. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-27.html","bookId":2142,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:47 PM"}
