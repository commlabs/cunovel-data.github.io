Once upon a time, a year was weighty, substantial. It was filled with possibilities: of meeting the love of your life, of having children, of dying. It was a stepping-stone on the path of life - a path that I no longer walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year was one thing. Twenty years ago, when my entire world turned upside down, was something else entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year ago, I came to England, a land so steeped in history it makes the prospect of eternity seem less overwhelming. And although the setting had changed, I stayed the same. I still looked like I had the day I turned into a vampire, and the same thoughts - of Katherine, who turned me, of Damon, my brother, of the death and destruction that I could never, ever seem to erase - still haunted my dreams. Time had been steadily\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egalloping forward, but I remained as before, a demon desperate for redemption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were a human, I\u0027d be comfortably in middle age by now. I\u0027d have a wife, children, perhaps even a son I\u0027d prepare to take over my family business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Salvatore family business became murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a legacy I\u0027ve spent the past twenty years trying to correct, hoping that somehow an eternity of good deeds could make up for the mistakes I have made, the blood I have shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in some ways, it has; England was good for me. Now, I\u0027m an honest man - or as honest as a man can be when his past is as wretched as mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI no longer feel guilty for draining the blood of woodland creatures. I am, after all, a vampire. But I am not a monster. Not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, time does not touch me as it does humans, nor does each new year turn over with the breathless anticipation of those who live. All I can hope is that each year will carry me further and further from the destruction of my youth with no fresh pain on my conscience. If I could have that, it would be my salvation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-ripper-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-1.html","bookId":2112,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:15 PM"}
