You are hurting, if the mention of Victorian underwear will get you worked up. I know a girl . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Ben. What do you mean, Jon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen O\u0027Callahan, the green-eyed, dark-haired legal advisor for K\u0026amp;A who had a passion for fast, expensive cars and extreme bed-sport, grinned, but closed his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon moved one hand in a thoughtful stroke along the satin surface of the table, as if recalling something entirely different and far more sensual. \"I put a hand on the small of her back when I opened the door for her. She\u0027s tall, but somehow delicate, too. I did it on instinct. Expected her to take a bite out of me, but she just thanked me. You know we notice women. The details. She was wearing a corset beneath her clothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Devil is in the details.\" Ben flashed a look across the table that matched the comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does she look like?\" Lucas asked in what he hoped was a casual voice, even as he battled back a baffled desire to take Jon\u0027s hand off for thinking it was okay to touch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re about to find out.\" Matthew Lord Kensington, K\u0026amp;A\u0027s CEO, entered the conference room. The expression on his aristocratic yet rugged features—the combination of an Italian mother of noble lineage and oil-rich Texan father—was that of an alpha wolf initiating a hunting party. \"Alice said she just arrived in the lobby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Warning, guys,\" Jon said. \"Now that I\u0027ve got you all worked up thinking about her underwear, it\u0027s only fair to tell you she\u0027s all business. Don\u0027t mix it up with her. She\u0027s extremely good at this, and could pull the rug right from beneath us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt slanted a calculated glance at Lucas. \"Sounds like we need your A-game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Fucking great. He saw the concern in Matt\u0027s eyes that matched Jon\u0027s. Matt was his best friend as well as his boss. No one had pressed Lucas about his attitude, but they\u0027d all noticed. It was time to shrug it off. Worry it like a terrier on his own time. Because there was no way it was the same girl. He wasn\u0027t entirely skeptical of kismet, but the idea of a stranger he\u0027d met entirely by chance, halfway across the country—in the middle of a fucking forest, for Chrissakes—waltzing into this business meeting, was more than fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt smacked of burning-bush, freaking miracles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Alice, Matt\u0027s admin, greeting their visitor. When the woman responded, his reaction bounced through his chest and slammed right down into the base of his testicles as if she\u0027d kicked him in the balls. It was her. He knew it, even though she\u0027d only said about six sentences to him that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arranged his legal pad, pen, and PDA at his chair^ though he usually put everything away, anything that he might toy with and give away his thoughts. He didn\u0027t take notes because he\u0027d remember, if it was important. Yeah. He could see himself reporting on the smell of her perfume, the way the blond cascade of her hair glimmered when the sunshine hit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, seriously.\" Jon laid a hand on his shoulder, bringing his unusual wave of serenity with it. Guy should have been a damn guru instead of an executive suit. \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was Jon, Lucas relented. He didn\u0027t compromise business for personal pride. \"I think I know this girl. If I stumble, watch my back, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always do,\" Jon said. \"Though you\u0027ve never asked me to do it when a woman was involved. I\u0027m going to have to give her a closer look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just keep your hands to yourself this time,\" Lucas said dryly. \"I\u0027ll handle any door opening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon Forte was laughing at something as she stepped into the room. When Cassandra had reviewed the data and photos for the K\u0026amp;A team on her computer, she\u0027d knocked a lukewarm coffee off the desk. It had doused the cat, whose ire was compounded when she jumped up and trod on the poor creature\u0027s tail. It had taken her a half-hour to get Nate back to sleep from the commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas Adler, CFO of Kensington \u0026amp; Associates, college roommate of Matthew Lord Kensington. At first, she\u0027d try to convince herself she was wrong. In that news clipping he\u0027d had much longer hair, fine golden strands just above his shoulders, but streaked with lighter shades from exposure to the sun. Sitting in a board room, he\u0027d looked relaxed as he gave an interview about being part of what had been dubbed over the past years as Kensington\u0027s wunderkind. Five young men who\u0027d turned K\u0026amp;A into a global and domestic manufacturing empire out of the unlikely New Orleans base of operations, though they\u0027d moved to this satellite office in Baton Rouge in the aftermath of Katrina. Lucas was key to identifying and pursuing acquisitions of seemingly unprofitable plants, which then had a spotless track record of becoming success stories in the team\u0027s hands. When she\u0027d searched for other data about him, her hope she was mistaken dropped like an elevator car with a broken cable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas Adler was also an amateur cyclist, who\u0027d placed high enough in several marathons to be mentioned in a handful of news stories. He stated he challenged himself to break his own records, always asking more of himself. Conquering the unconquerable. The quote tied into his approach to his career, but it sent a thrill of inappropriate excitement through her vitals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been bullshitting herself on the team review. She\u0027d recognized him in the first photo. The first heartbeat. She needed to put it behind her, once and for all. There was no reason that day should have lingered with her the way it had. She\u0027d put it down to excessive sexual deprivation, even when she found her mind drifting to an analysis of his face, his every expression, the flickers of emotion in his eyes during their brief meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Berkshires had been one of those crazy things. They were both adults, about to be thrown together for several days, the primary players in the start-up plans that would combine the resources of Josh Johnson\u0027s industrial hoist system operation with Kensington\u0027s. That should be her focus. Not the overwhelming disbelief that fate had delivered this guy right back into her lap. Okay, not the best visual if she wanted to concentrate on business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas Adler. A name to go with the hands, the mouth she couldn\u0027t forget. At the time, she\u0027d thought it smart not to allow herself to touch him. Ever since, she\u0027d felt like a kid deprived of candy. She couldn\u0027t listen to Foreigner at all without getting achy with need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he was great fantasy fodder. She could handle it. Even though his voice still stroked her nerves, running through her head fifty times a day. The way he\u0027d realized she was getting short of breath and immediately moved to help. A man with that kind of hard-on was supposed to be oblivious to a woman\u0027s respiratory needs. Then the crowning moment—the way he\u0027d anticipated her bolting. He hadn\u0027t stopped her from leaving, but he\u0027d made sure she knew she hadn\u0027t gotten away with anything. Damn if that hadn\u0027t really tugged at her interest, keeping it piqued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just the perversity of a woman\u0027s heart, she knew. She preferred to control all the elements of her environment, particularly men. Yet a man who could overwhelm her, take control of the situation, bring her pleasure and compel her submission, not only terrified her but made her want him so much she couldn\u0027t imagine ever wanting anything more. Ridiculous. A dangerous inclination she would never indulge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing all that away, she stepped into the K\u0026amp;A board room, dominated by one wall of windows and a conference table shaped like a lotus pool. Potted Japanese maples with their delicate red lace leaves were arranged in several places. There were Asian prints on the wall, along with several Samurai blades rumored to be there so that those on the receiving end of Matt Kensington\u0027s displeasure could opt for ritual suicide. While the surroundings might intimidate most, they steadied her, reminded her of the job she was here to do. This was her environment, her playing field. She\u0027d given up about a decade of sleep to make it so, and was forever grateful for the chance Steve Pickard had given her, taking the talents of a college intern and throwing her into lion dens like this one. Until she\u0027d built a foundation for her own self-confidence, he\u0027d assured her, over and over, that she had the gift of diplomacy and mediation. As well as an exceptional business acumen that allowed her to grasp the full range of financial, manufacturing, legal and management dynamics that made her an effective problem solver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reminded herself she\u0027d had articles written about her as well, one claiming she had almost psychic insight in knowing when to mend fences and when to disembowel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother noted she was so unflappable she could walk the floor of Congress buck naked, not a hair out of place, to deliver an address on world economics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Matt courteously gestured her in ahead of him, she schooled her face into a polite mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs riveting as Lucas had been that day, he was more impressive now, dressed for success in a custom-tailored gray suit. The white dress shirt and silver tie emphasized his silver-gray eyes and the gold of his hair. He\u0027d have made any woman\u0027s tongue tangle. When he met her gaze across the table, the shock of the contact detonated through her, leaving more than her tongue at loose ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had just been sex. Not even actual sex. Just a sexual encounter. She was repeating herself. Not a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you and Jon have already met.\" Matt was making the introductions as Jon came around the table, followed by Lucas. She could see the athlete in the way he moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she put her hands on his chest, she\u0027d feel that hard body beneath the thin shirt. The heat of his mouth had been between her legs, his long-fingered hands bracketing her rib cage, as close and lovingly as the corset she wore now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook Jon\u0027s hand, said the appropriate things, and then there was no avoiding it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas extended his hand. Smoothly, without hesitation or hurry, she put her hand into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor. He definitely felt a tremor. Her color was up. Not enough for anyone to notice, but he did. Under a trim blue suit jacket, she wore one of those thin silky blouses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath it he could see the faint outline of the corset she was wearing. This one was strapless, a faint floral pattern in a sheen of silver leaf that added to the embellishment of the shirt. The blouse\u0027s neckline showed a modest dent of cleavage, likely because of the lift of the corset. He suspected it might also give him a glimpse of lace and flesh, if he was a cad and strained. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/controlled-response-knights-of-the-board-room-2/page-5.html","bookId":1901,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:28 PM"}
