{"id":86703,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003eKatie said, \"So what\u0027s up? You avoid Trystan all day like I said?\" I didn\u0027t answer. \"Mari! What\u0027d you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I replied not wanting to talk about it. The truth was I had no idea what happened. One moment Trystan was going to tell me something about Day Jones, the next he says he\u0027s having girl issues. If I didn\u0027t know better, I would have thought he was talking about me. But that\u0027s impossible. I pushed aside the thought. It was a little too close to a dream to even consider. Things that raised my hope, that teeter on the edge of impossibility, only hurt harder when you smack face-first into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie stopped walking. We were standing in front of the school where the buses drop off. There wasn\u0027t anyone else around. \"Stop letting him screw with your head. The guy\u0027s a player Mari. Look at his best friend for chrissakes. Seth Sexbot.\" She shook her head, her eyebrows rising with her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not like that,\" the words slipped out of my mouth before I realized what I was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie grabbed both my shoulders and shook me, \"Do you hear yourself? He\u0027s not like that? Is there anyone in that entire group of theater girls that he hasn\u0027t nailed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me,\" I said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" she said forcefully. Katie had always been like a sister to me. She said what I needed to hear, which wasn\u0027t always what I wanted to hear. This time, I definitely did not want to hear it. It was like she could tell. Her hands flew as she spoke, \"Wake up Mari. He\u0027s not that kind of guy. You\u0027re the only one. Get a clue. If he\u0027s paying attention to you, now you know why. Seth and him aren\u0027t that different, it just looks different for the girl. Trystan\u0027s seduction is more tempting, but in the end you\u0027re just another chick to check off the list.\" Her words smashed into me. I didn\u0027t want to hear them. It felt like she was throwing bricks at my stomach. I wanted to double over and cry. Katie wrapped her arm around my shoulders. I didn\u0027t shirk her off. Softly, she said, \"He\u0027ll hurt you.\" The quiver in her voice was like being doused by cold water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first boyfriend hurt me. He was the only one I was serious about and Katie knew it. Trystan was not a step up. If anything, he was a step down and backwards. He\u0027d hurt me. In the end, he would. It\u0027s the way he was. Katie was right. I\u0027d seen it over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting next to him in the prop room I\u0027d asked him once, \"Why is your life expectancy on relationships so short? They don\u0027t die that fast, you know. There\u0027s more there than sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d looked at me with those glittering blue eyes. A wicked grin lined his lips. \"Not that I\u0027ve seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t stayed long enough to find out.\" His answer had upset me. As if he could tell, he looked around to make sure no one saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he leaned in close to my ear he said, \"I haven\u0027t found anyone worth staying for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because you\u0027re dating the skank squad, Trystan.\" I rolled my eyes as I said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027d be different?\" he said amused. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer him that day. I dated with my whole heart and there was no way I was giving it to someone who would tear it out of my chest without a backward glance. Katie thought Trystan was that person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded at Katie, \"I know you\u0027re right. I\u0027m just having trouble getting my head and my heart in the same place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie slid her arm down and side hugged me, practically squeezing me to death. \"Ah, I know how to fix that. Your heart is easily confused. Let\u0027s toss some chocolate at it and next time you get a free period, come and drool at Mathboy with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal,\" I said, not bothering to explain that it wouldn\u0027t be for a week. If she knew I was stuck with Trystan for several additional hours every day, she\u0027d insist that I transfer to a new school. Maybe it was inevitable. Maybe Trystan was destined to break my heart. I didn\u0027t want to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~TRYSTAN~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan slipped away from practice as soon as humanly possible. There was no food at home. He\u0027d have to run into the deli and hope Sam was still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door chimed as he walked inside the small shop. The deli wasn\u0027t big, but the owner was great. Trystan called out, \"Sam? You here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small man with dark skin walked out of the back room, \"Trystan Scott. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we barter this week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam walked up to the counter and looked at Trystan. He knew the kid was on his own and had been for some time. Whatever so-called parent was supposed to be taking care of him deserved a punch in the face. Trystan was a good kid. \"Sure, grab whatever you need and set it up here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan went through the shop grabbing what he needed, checking dates, and trying to pick up things that had been reduced. When he was done, there were two bags filled with food. Sam tallied the items as he put them in. \"Not bad. Only $45. You can work that off in one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan had done the math in his head as he picked up the items. \"No charity, Sam. You shaved off nine bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam\u0027s face reddened a little. He looked down at his pad and said, \"It\u0027s not charity. I was going to throw those things out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do this every couple weeks, Sam. I try to get as little as possible and you always forget to add something in. Come on, I don\u0027t want a hand out. I\u0027m good for it. I\u0027ll work Saturday and Sunday, the 5:00am shift. I\u0027ll see you then.\" Trystan reached for the bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam pushed the groceries toward the young man. \"You\u0027re a good kid. Don\u0027t let anyone tell you otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan smiled at the old guy. It was a lopsided grin, filled with pride. Sam was one of the few people who could evoke that emotion. Trystan nodded and headed out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he arrived home, he swallowed hard. His dad was home. The lights were blazing in the windows, the sound of the television wafted out the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan pulled opened the rusted screen, balancing the paper bag on his hip. Nights like this made him what he was - an actor, a liar. His dad was a thin man well past his prime. He sat in a tee shirt and shorts in front of the TV with a beer can in his hand. It was still early. He\u0027d move onto the hard stuff later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the hell have you been?\" Dad grumbled not bothering to look at his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"School. Then I stopped at the store for some food. I got some of that pasta you like. I thought I\u0027d make it for us for dinner.\" It felt like he was walking on egg shells. Dad worked to pay the bills, but he didn\u0027t bother buying food or cooking. Trystan learned how to use the stove before most kids could tie their shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad scoffed, \"You expect me to believe that?\" Trystan didn\u0027t bother pointing to the grocery bags. He knew it was pointless. \"I\u0027m talking to you, boy. When are you going to stop lying to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan stepped in front of his father, blocking his view of the TV. One grocery bag was clutched in each arm. \"I\u0027m not lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what the hell is this?\" his dad asked, holding up a guitar. Trystan\u0027s heart clenched. For a second all he could do was stare. He\u0027d hidden it, locked it in his room. \"Yeah, I thought so. My son\u0027s a fag, singing fairy songs around a campfire. Perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan saved his money forever to get that instrument. It was an acoustic guitar with honey wood. It came from a second-hand shop, but it still cost more than he had. He saved his money for months to get it. Since then it\u0027d been hidden in his room at the top of his closet. He\u0027d put enough stuff around it to block it from view. But that didn\u0027t matter since it was sitting on his father\u0027s lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan tried smiling. Ignoring the comments, he walked to the kitchen counter and placed the groceries down. Part of him hoped the guitar would be forgotten, but his dad kept it clutched on his lap. Trystan made dinner. It was a generic Hamburger Helper without the meat. He walked a plate of it over to his dad. Last time they\u0027d eaten it, he liked it a lot. This time was different. Trystan would never forget this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached out to hand Dad his plate, the old man swatted at it. \"I\u0027m not eating that shit. You stole it. Like you stole this!\" Dad shot out of his chair. Trystan watched the plate go flying, the noodles stuck to the wall before they slid down leaving a rust colored stain in their wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan took a deep breath, trying to brace himself. He knew it was coming. There was no reasoning with him when he was like this. It was one of the few times Trystan wished his dad was a sip away from passing out. But he wasn\u0027t and he was angry. \"I bought it, Dad. I have a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I can\u0027t provide for you? Is that it?\" He advanced on his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan stepped back. \"No, that\u0027s not it. You work hard. You shouldn\u0027t have to cook and get groceries too.\" It\u0027s not what he thought, but now wasn\u0027t the time for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right,\" his father said, taking another step forward. \"I take care of you. I give you everything I have. Everything. And you repay me like this.\" He pointed to the guitar. Shaking his head, Dad looked down at the instrument. One second he was calm, like he was going to hand it back, but Trystan saw the tell. His father\u0027s lips pressed together tightly, his biceps twitching as tension corded his muscles tighter and tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guitar swung forward and smashed against the floor. It made a cacophony of notes and cracking wood as it splintered. Wood flew through the room as the strings popped off one by one. His father held the neck of the broken instrument in his hands. A single string was still attached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan swallowed hard. Rage flowed through his body, barely in check. He wanted this to end, but there was nowhere else to go. He had to stay here until graduation. That was his way out. He\u0027d already spoken to the military recruiter. He had to keep his nose clean until then. He couldn\u0027t fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put it down,\" Trystan said, his voice deeper than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad laughed, as he stepped forward, brandishing the piece of the guitar like a weapon. \"Why don\u0027t you make me. Show me who\u0027s the man here, Trystan.\" Without warning, his Dad\u0027s arm swung. The piece of wood collided into Trystan\u0027s thigh, sending a sharp burst of pain through his hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing it was pointless to talk, he turned and bounded down the hallway to his room. He ran inside and pushed the door shut. His hand reached for the deadbolt, but grabbed only air. It was gone. \"Shit,\" Trystan said, panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then his dad tried to crash through the door. Trystan kept his body braced against it to keep him out. With each slam, Trystan flinched. Just like old times, he thought. But now I\u0027m old enough to keep you out, even without the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan knew the old man wouldn\u0027t learn. He\u0027d keep beating the door until he passed out or Trystan did from lack of sleep. Hours passed. His father screamed at him for the first few, but eventually it grew quiet. Trystan slid down the door, but kept his body pressed against it, ready to brace himself if his dad tried to force it open again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was after 1:00am the next time he heard his dad\u0027s voice, \"It was your fault, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain shot through Trystan\u0027s heart, threatening to tear him in half. He\u0027d always though it was his fault, but hearing his dad say it was unbearable. He swallowed the knot in his throat and replied, \"I never said it wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were too much for her. She said it over and over again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t remember his mother leaving. There were no pictures of her, only faded memories that he wasn\u0027t even sure were real. Trystan hung his head, lowering it to his knees. His arms were wrapped around his ankles, his back still pressed firmly to the door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collide-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-1/page-8.html","bookId":2773,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:33 PM"}
