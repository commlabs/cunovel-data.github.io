I can feel each time my dick contracts, sending a squirt of cum into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rides it out, slowly moving up and down, taking all of me as she shouts out her orgasm. Squeezing me harder and harder, she tenses up at her peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold her hips and try to breathe, letting her ride it out. After a few seconds, she falls back on top of me, a sweaty heap lying across my body. I wrap my arms around her, holding her to me, kissing her neck as we both try to catch our breath. It was intense and hot as fuck, and I don’t know how long I lie there, holding her, trying to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few moments, I kiss her shoulder and tell her it’s time. “It’s probably ready by now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m nervous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be right there with you the whole time.” I smile against her skin and squeeze her tighter, letting her know I’m never going anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes a deep breath and nods, and I get us both up off the floor. I take her by the hand and lead her to the master bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope is a few steps behind me as I pull her to the sink with me. “You realize the test said we only had to wait sixty seconds, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the cocky grin come appear on my face, and I turn to look at her. “Yes, and I told you sixty-nine sounded like a better idea, and that’s how we ended up on the floor. You didn’t put up much of a protest, if I recall.” She blushes a little, and I move in to kiss her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese past weeks have been absolute heaven. I didn’t know love like this could be real, and each day I’m happier and happier. It’s only been about six weeks total since I first laid eyes on her, but I felt then what I feel now. I feel like I’m home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we left the lawyers that day, we went straight to the estate and got her things. There was plenty of time to go through the house and figure out what she wanted to do with it, but in that moment, we both wanted one thing, and that was to have her living with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted her in our bed forever, and whatever it took to do that, that’s what we did. I asked her a couple of times what kind of wedding she wanted, and she finally decided she wanted to do something small in our home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got married in the backyard under the old oak tree. She wore her grandmother’s wedding dress, which was classic and simple. And she had her brother walk her down our makeshift aisle. Butch was my best man, and surprisingly, Penelope asked Joey to be her maid of honor. Over the past weeks, they’ve grown really close, and I think it has something to do with Joey being important to Law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of us cared about a big wedding or anything fancy. So we kept it simple. We just wanted something for us, and to make it legal. And I wanted to make sure the rings were exchanged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wears the ring her grandma gave me, and I wear a simple gold band. People tell me it’s dangerous to wear one while working on cars, but I think it’d be more dangerous not to wear one. I don’t want anyone thinking I’m not taken by the most beautiful woman in the world. I wear it with pride, and if you ask me about my wife, you better get comfortable. I’ve got a long list of what I love about her. I couldn’t be happier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in the bathroom, I break our kiss to reach over and grab the pregnancy test. I don’t look at it, just hold it out for her to take. Her nervous fingers take it from me, and she holds it, hesitating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull her naked body close to mine, wrapping her up and kissing her forehead. “Turn it over, Duchess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns over the pregnancy test, and we look down, seeing the blue plus sign. I feel my heart nearly burst with love, knowing that we made a baby together. I knew at some point it would happen, but seeing the test makes it so much more real. I feel myself smile from ear to ear, and I look down to see Penelope shed a few tears. I kiss them away, scooping her up and carrying her to our bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaying her down, I crawl in beside her, resting my hand on her belly. I feel a tear slip free from my eye, and she leans in to kiss it away, just as I did to her. I’m overflowing with happiness, and it’s coming out in the form of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for making me so happy, Penelope.” I hold her to me and think about how perfect everything is. I would fight to the death to keep this love, and I’ll never let anything come between me and my family. “I love you and our baby so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We love you, too, Paine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hand over mine, and we lie there talking about baby names and what kind of nursery we want. I don’t care what she chooses, as long as she’s happy. I’m just glad I’m the lucky son of a bitch she chose to take along for the ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePENELOPE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5 years later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You better quit that or we’re gonna be late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wouldn’t be the first time, and it won’t be the last,” Paine mumbles against my neck, sending chills down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean it. I spent three hours cooking sides for this BBQ, and if we’re late and we miss Law pulling the pork off the smoker, you’re gonna have one pissed-off pregnant lady on your hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling Paine kneel down behind me, I start to wiggle. I know what he’s up to. It’s been five years and three—almost four—kids later. I know his moves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifts up my summer dress and nibbles across my ass. I grip the counter top, some of my anger melting away. “Paine,” I warn, but he ignores me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue come out and moves from my ass cheeks to the area between my legs, and all my resistance disappears. Bending over as far as I can with an eight-month pregnant belly, I spread my legs, giving him all of me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mechanic-breeding-2/page-28.html","bookId":1799,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:44 PM"}
