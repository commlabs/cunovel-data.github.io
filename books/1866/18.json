{"id":82313,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u003cp\u003eTaryn took her aunt\u0027s advice. She would never again consider hounding Cole, like she had that day a week ago when he\u0027d informed her that her show would record six episodes rather than a full season\u0027s complement of thirteen. Now she didn\u0027t seek out his company and most certainly he didn\u0027t seek out hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the days had gone by, she\u0027d kept herself busy with one of two occupations. She was either immersed in her show\u0027s preparation - organizing crew, sponsors, studio time - or sourcing people who would love to adopt a kitten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did little socially, although when Roman had asked, she\u0027d gone to a movie. They\u0027d grabbed a bite beforehand, had enjoyed buttered popcorn throughout the show and had said goodbye in the complex\u0027s parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven he knew about the Cole situation, Taryn guessed Roman felt sorry for her. Which was thoughtful. Nice. But she was done with feeling sorry for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past couple of days, her hope to stay with Hunter Broadcasting had dimmed. She\u0027d swallowed the six-show deal. But then Cole had cut her budget in half. Had told her that he could not agree to sign the host she liked. Today he\u0027d put the nail in her coffin. His PA had passed on the news that rather than five people helping to put the show together, she\u0027d have two, one being a seventeen-year-old graduate. No experience equaled cheap labor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnically, Cole might have approved her show but, clearly, he still wanted her gone. She hoped he slept well at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier today, Taryn had learned Guthrie was in, which happened less and less. When Taryn had phoned through, his personal assistant had said he\u0027d see her straightaway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking down that long corridor, Taryn guessed she ought to feel nervous, one of the reasons being that she didn\u0027t normally do snap decisions. Usually she formulated a plan, studied all the angles then pursued her goal until said goal was attained. Whereas the action she\u0027d decided upon this morning had seemed to come to her out of the blue. Kind of the way she\u0027d handled her conflagration of an affair with Cole. Only, no matter how much this might hurt, she was certain this decision was the right one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe entered Guthrie\u0027s office. He stood by that long stretch of window, studying that panoramic view of Sydney and its harbor, his fingers loosely thatched at his back. Hearing her, he turned, smiled and asked, \"What can I do for you, Taryn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took seats and suddenly Taryn couldn\u0027t find the right words. While the son might be difficult, Guthrie had only ever been supportive. But, whether he knew it or not, Guthrie wasn\u0027t in charge here. If he were, she wouldn\u0027t need to jump through Cole\u0027s endless hoops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn looked Guthrie in the eye. \"I have to leave Hunter Broadcasting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows snapped together. \"Trouble with staff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With management.\" She swallowed. \"With Cole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuthrie studied her for a long queasy moment. Then he pushed to his feet and, with a slight limp leftover from that last assault, crossed to his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have a word with him,\" he said, stabbing a button. \"Stay put. We\u0027ll sort this out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That won\u0027t do any good.\" Having found her feet, too, she moved closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuthrie had the receiver to his ear. \"He has his own mind, but Cole listens when he knows I\u0027m serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was serious, too. \"He doesn\u0027t believe in my project. I won\u0027t put my all into doing my best when Cole is doing everything in his power to cut me off at the knees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuthrie tried again. \"My son\u0027s motives can seem harsh at times, but underneath all the woo-hah, he\u0027s only trying to take care of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you. I do. But it doesn\u0027t work in this situation.\" Doesn\u0027t work for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taryn, are you certain there\u0027s nothing more behind this? I was preoccupied that afternoon you both flew back from that survey, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever happened between the two of us doesn\u0027t change his work attitude, then or now. I\u0027m unhappy here.\" Not appreciated or respected. Cole had seduced her and, yes, she\u0027d wanted to be seduced. He liked to be in charge, but in this final stretch, she was taking the reins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish it were different,\" she said, \"but I don\u0027t ever see that changing. I\u0027ll leave Hunters today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite today\u0027s heavy rain, Taryn had ventured out to collect some cat milk for Muffin and a bunch of roses from the corner store. She was arranging the flowers in her favorite vase, thinking about dicing some vitamin-rich food for the lactating mother, when a knock sounded on the door. She glanced up. She wasn\u0027t expecting her aunt. Her friends all had jobs during the week. Perhaps it was a delivery, only she wasn\u0027t expecting an order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she passed by Muffin and her litter, who were snuggled and asleep in a large bed-box in the living room, Taryn had a flash but quickly pushed the thought aside. Guthrie had accepted her resignation and she didn\u0027t regret the move. The CEO slash Executive Producer of Hunter Broadcasting had never liked her show\u0027s premise. Had never approved of her being hired without being consulted first. No doubt, when all was said and done, Cole would be grateful to be rid of that headache. She was relieved to have gotten rid of hers. She was more calm. Her usual cool self again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Taryn fanned back the door and her heart leaped so high, she had to swallow to push the lump halfway back down. Cole stood on her porch, looking unhappy about being drenched because of the rain and, she supposed, being here. Well, he could simply turn around, jump in his sports car and go back to the office. She certainly hadn\u0027t invited him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole set his monster black umbrella down, tapping the steel spike against the timber floorboards twice - to help shake off the water or make certain she was paying attention?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this about you quitting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe feigned surprise. \"You\u0027re only finding out now? I gave Guthrie my resignation two days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you think to consult me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Consider yourself consulted.\" Her hand still on the doorknob, she stepped back. \"Hope I don\u0027t sound rude, but I was in the middle of something important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finding another job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feeding the cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face and neck hot, she moved to shut the door. One big black leather lace-up slid out, acting as a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You don\u0027t have to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a choice, Cole. I don\u0027t have to go. I want to go.\" She slanted her head. \"Why are you here? You never liked my idea. You\u0027ve done everything you could to have me land flat on my backside.\" You\u0027ve ignored me day after day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come in and we\u0027ll discuss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not letting you in.\" Not ever again. \"Give yourself until next week. You\u0027ll have forgotten all about this by then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting his umbrella up against the outside wall, he dragged a hand down his face as if this were all too hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I\u0027m sorry I had to make all those cuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine. All forgotten. Now please leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cast an exasperated look back at the rain teeming down beyond her porch and exhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t help the way things are,\" he said. \"You knew what my life was from the start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen heat from frustration and anger threatened to overtake her, she closed her eyes and shook her head. If he felt guilty about the way he\u0027d treated her, that was his bad luck. She only wanted him to vanish so she could go back to arranging flowers and forgetting that man ever existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me in. We\u0027ll talk - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he moved forward, finished with games, she moved, too. And shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cole\u0027s barrier now was a thousand times more effective than the one he\u0027d used earlier. He reached out and, without apology, hooked one arm around her waist then hauled her close until her breasts were pressed against his shirt and she felt the booming of his heartbeat too near her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth to tear him down. After what he\u0027d done, how dare he handle her this way. But in one blinding heartbeat, his mouth had taken hers. With one palm supporting the small of her back, he kissed her long and hard and shockingly deep. Flames swirled through her blood, instantly melting her bones, causing her to become a rag doll in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when his palm scooped lower and she felt him harden against her belly, her strength returned. Making fists, she pushed with both barrels against his chest. She might as well have tried to shift a mountain. He was on a mission. And, damn the man, he was winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his head angled more and the rough of his beard rubbed a path against her cheek, gradually, bit by bit, her fight drained away. He was so determined, so hot, what hope did she have? But she wasn\u0027t beaten so much as temporarily tamed. If he\u0027d only quit with the caveman act - if he\u0027d stop kissing her long enough for her to get her thoughts together - she\u0027d tell him this kind of treatment wouldn\u0027t change her mind...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time his mouth eventually left hers, the world was spinning twice as fast. Not only were her breasts aching, begging for his touch, the throbbing at the apex of her thighs told her that past indiscretions were forgiven. Forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his lidded eyes searched hers, Taryn couldn\u0027t bring herself to move away. She could only remember the heaven she\u0027d experienced on that island when he\u0027d coaxed and adored her body, teasing her nipples, stroking her curves, loving her to the point where nothing and no one else had existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, over the pounding rain, she heard another noise. His cell phone sounding. Rather than take the call, he pressed soft moist kisses at one corner of her mouth while two hot fingers rode a drugging circle low on her back. But his cell beeped again, and again. Giddy with want, she felt his hesitation and forced herself to focus. The sound of the rain drifted back in. Behind her, Muffin mewed twice. When Cole carefully released her, the firm set of his jaw said he wasn\u0027t finished sorting this out but he also needed to read that text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrawling out from the fog, Taryn remembered Aunt Vi\u0027s advice. Keep the door open because once it\u0027s shut, there\u0027s no going back. But when Cole held up one finger to ask her to hold on a minute, Taryn touched her still-burning lips and a good measure of the stardust faded and fell away. She watched him check the cell, dial into his voice mail, then press a finger to an ear, shutting out a roll of thunder while he turned his back to concentrate fully on business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn blinked and thought, but when she\u0027d made up her mind, she didn\u0027t bother to interrupt. She simply shut the door, bolted the lock and didn\u0027t open it again, no matter how hard he knocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith two chilled beers in hand, Cole sidled up to the chair next to Brandon\u0027s. Talking above the din of the local club, he handed one over and asked, \"So, anything to report?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judge and I have exhausted every lead from the guy who threw himself under that car. If he was connected to those earlier incidents and this latest one, whoever\u0027s pulling the strings has done a fine job of camouflaging their trail. I\u0027ve assigned a private detail for Guthrie\u0027s and Tate\u0027s protection. I also suggested one for your stepmother, but she declined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole nodded then downed a mouthful of beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon went on to describe in detail the areas he would sweep next: again questioning neighbors and also employees, setting up surveillance cameras that reached outside of normal parameters. Cole absorbed it all at the same time as his brain switched to a different box in his head. Lately, more and more, he found his thoughts drifting there and wanting to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought he knew himself pretty well and yet he was stumped figuring out why he\u0027d bothered showing up on Taryn\u0027s doorstep the other day. She was right. Although he\u0027d enjoyed their time together, he\u0027d never gone for her show\u0027s concept. Obligation had caused him to okay it. Duty had compelled him to sabotage it. Guilt had sent him knocking on her door to... Apologize? Make amends?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, he was a fool and he knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole blinked back. \"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t hear anything I just said, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I did. This is my father\u0027s life we\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means whatever it is eating you must be important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole swirled his bottle. No reason he couldn\u0027t share with his best friend. If anyone would understand, it was Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a woman. Taryn Quinn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon sat slowly back. \"You blew it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I let it go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe explained the story from go to woe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy crap,\" Brandon said when Cole had finished. \"No wonder she\u0027s pissed at you. You sleep with her like there\u0027s no tomorrow then barely acknowledge her because of a contract. To add insult to injury, you set her show up for a slide into the mud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole cocked an eyebrow, swallowed beer. \"That\u0027s pretty much it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might be company obsessed, but you\u0027ve never treated a woman like that before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGazing at his beer, Cole confessed, \"Taryn\u0027s special.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God help the ones who aren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have too much on my plate, too much to keep in order, to have to worry about a relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Meredith said at the reunion, you can\u0027t run forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to ease up on yourself. Quit taking all the responsibility for Hunters. That\u0027s too much for anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say that as if I have a choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s a choice, all right. Don\u0027t try to say you don\u0027t like being \u0027the man.\u0027 At school, if you didn\u0027t get \u0027school captain this\u0027 or \u0027regional champion that,\u0027 you dragged your feet for days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s healthy to be competitive. It\u0027s natural.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until it starts to screw with your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Work is my life. With all my family tangled up in it, it has to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you my take. I think this woman\u0027s in love with you. And my bet is you\u0027re in love with her, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the moment of shock had passed, Cole barked out a laugh. \"Remember who you\u0027re talking to? I\u0027ve never been in love.\" He held up a warning finger. \"Meredith McReedy doesn\u0027t count. Hell, I\u0027ve only known Taryn a few weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes it happens that way. Fast and deadly, like a snake bite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not looking to get hitched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I\u0027ve heard about this lady is how strong and beautiful and perfect she is. But you\u0027re not really seeing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole drained the rest of his beer then set the bottle down on the table hard. \"I don\u0027t see any ring on your fat finger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that\u0027s because I haven\u0027t found the right person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole\u0027s thoughts skidded to a halt as those words echoed through his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that it? Why he couldn\u0027t for the life of him shake her from his mind. And the fascination was growing worse every day. Love? It was great his mother and father had shared it. He\u0027d always thought that someday he\u0027d settle down, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestion was, if Brandon was right - if this was it and she was the one - given that she hated his guts...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did he do now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day was Saturday. At home, Cole was about to settle down with that pain-in-the-butt Liam Finlay contract yet again. He got this was an important deal with a huge amount of money hanging in the balance, but he was beginning to wonder if Finlay was playing games, stretching this out, making him suffer because of his past unsatisfactory dealings with Guthrie. Still, what could he do? Hunter Broadcasting needed this deal. Therefore Cole couldn\u0027t slack off. Or, rather, not again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis home phone extension rang. Business calls came through on his cell. Majority of his personal calls, too. Probably some poor sales sap doing another cold call. Or...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTate knew that number. He\u0027d learned it off by heart. When the phone stopped then rang again, a shiver ran through Cole\u0027s blood and he picked up. Sure enough, that familiar sweet voice filtered down the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy\u0027s not home and Mommy says I\u0027m too noisy,\" Tate said. \"She\u0027s tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where your dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the weekend and Guthrie had been spending most of his time at home lately. Where else might he be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know.\" Cole imagined Tate\u0027s little shoulders shrugging. \"Can you come and play with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole recalled that tome of a contract sitting on his home desk. There was loads of other work he could catch up on, too. But then he thought of Tate, what a bum deal he\u0027d gotten having a mother like Eloise, feeling as if he had to get around like a mouse when he was a robust five-year-old boy who should be out kicking a ball, not stuck inside playing with electronic games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole scrubbed his jaw, made his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you watching TV, kiddo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. SpongeBob\u0027s just started.\" Tate laughed. \"He\u0027s funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grab a hat. By the time your show\u0027s over, I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole arrived bang on time and let Creepy Nancy know that he was taking Tate out for the day. Eloise didn\u0027t bother to come downstairs to say have a nice time. Wearing a bright red tee, Tate sat like an angel in the passenger-side seat while they drove to a park, the one Cole and Taryn had paddled those boats in, not that he\u0027d intentionally planned his and Tate\u0027s time together today that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole parked and grabbed the football he\u0027d brought along. They filled their stomachs with hot dogs and Coke first. Watched the ducks on the lake while the food settled. When Cole couldn\u0027t control Tate\u0027s fidgets any longer, they kicked and tossed the pigskin back and forth. Cole showed his brother techniques required for a handball, a pass famous in Aussie Rules Football. Tate was doing well, stepping into the action, getting his punching fist almost right. They\u0027d been out an hour. Given Tate wasn\u0027t nearly tired yet, Cole was thinking about teaching him a torpedo punt kick when his cell phone buzzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This might be your dad,\" he called out to Tate, who was perhaps twenty yards away. But when Cole answered without checking the ID, the voice on the other end wasn\u0027t the one he\u0027d expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liam Finlay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole\u0027s every sense zoomed in to concentrate fully on this conversation. \"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lawyers are with me. There\u0027s another conflict, page 103, item 24.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole\u0027s mind flew back, trying to identify the passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam went on to inform him that now the Players Association weren\u0027t happy with their cut, given the exclusivity clause relating to live games televised. Cole replied they\u0027d been through this just last week. He\u0027d already bumped his offer up. Liam said the dotted line was still blank. Now was the time to iron these creases out. Cole said he didn\u0027t want to increase his offer. He didn\u0027t believe anyone would. Liam said that was up to him. He could give him an answer now or come to the headquarters and talk it through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red soccer ball shot up and hit Cole in the shin, on the same leg that bore that old cubby house scar. In that instant, Cole remembered his brothers, Dex, Wynn, Tate -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head snapped up. He looked left, right. Then the panic, cold and creeping, began to seep into his bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole spun a three-sixty. Looked down low. Up high. Behind benches and trees. His world shrank then funneled out fast. That tiny five-year-old was nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his stomach as it pitched and pitched again. He didn\u0027t often pray but now he looked to heaven and, as the strength seemed to drain from his body and his brain began to tingle, he vowed he would give anything - everything - if he was only overreacting and Tate would magically reappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ground, a toss away, Cole spotted his cell. His scattered thoughts pieced together. If Tate was indeed missing - and given recent history, that idea couldn\u0027t be discounted - there was a logical step he must take. Sending another swift glance around, he scooped up the phone where he\u0027d dropped it then frowned at the noise coming out. Finlay was still bleating on the other end?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole didn\u0027t think twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ended that call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he strode around, asking the ice-cream vendor then a man walking his dog if they\u0027d seen a little boy in a bright red tee, he dialed the three-digit number to connect to emergency services. As he spoke to the representative on the other end of the line, sickening panic crushed in again, but this time it was peppered with resolve. If Tate was lost, if he\u0027d been taken, he would find his brother. If he had to ask every person in this park, cut down every tree, check on each -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole\u0027s tracking gaze stopped and he froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the parking lot some fifty yards away, a big black van was reversing out. The windows tinted an impenetrable shade, Cole couldn\u0027t make out the plates but, through the windshield, he saw the shaggy-haired driver wore dark glasses that covered half his face. His father had said one of the men who\u0027d tried to abduct Tate had shaggy hair, big black glasses. Cole also knew those men had driven a black van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole belted off. He heard Tate\u0027s name called out. Twice. Three times. Limbs pumping, he realized that voice was his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed into the van before it could leave, thumped on the sliding door and didn\u0027t stop. The driver, an angry weedy man, soon appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell you doing to my vehicle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole grabbed him by the scruff of his shirt and pulled him up so he could talk to his weasel face. \"Open that door. Do it now. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was right, if Tate was in there, he\u0027d deal with weasel-man after his brother was out in the light again. But when he flung aside the door, peered inside, the space was empty other than an old washing machine dumped in one corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole stormed over, his footfalls echoing through the metal cage. He flung open the lid of the machine and then -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart dropped to the ground. He staggered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole wandered out into the sunshine feeling sucker punched. He was the son who always had things under control. He couldn\u0027t stand to have surprises sneak up and bite him in the rear. He complained about Dex, about Wynn. Huffed at memories of a grown woman like Teagan having her own life. He\u0027d thought he was so much better, responsible, worthier than any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here he\u0027d failed in the most devastating way possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow would he ever tell his father?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were milling around him. Cole knew he must look like a madman. On a different level, he understood he needed to get himself together. He couldn\u0027t help Tate if he disintegrated into a mute, dazed mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole cast another look around. Curious faces peered back. Old, young, different colors and heights and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole\u0027s head went back. He rubbed his stinging eyes and then focused hard. A little boy in a red tee was walking toward him, a football slotted under his arm, looking for all the world as if nothing had happened, nothing was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rush of adrenaline propelled him forward at the same time a cry broke from his lips. Then he was on his knees, hugging his brother so tight that, if it had been anyone else, Cole would have told them to back the hell off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cole? You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth cheeks damp, Cole forced himself to draw back. He inhaled through his nose, smelled that peanut-butter smell that was Tate and almost lost the battle not to hug him extra tight again. Was the nightmare truly over?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis throat and voice were thick as molasses. \"I lost you for a minute, kiddo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to see the paddleboats.\" Tate turned and pointed to the lake and the oblivious couples peddling around. \"Wanna try it with me? Looks really fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChest aching, Cole laughed. He thought he might never stop. \"It is fun. But give me a minute to catch my breath. I was worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coz you were alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly exhausted, Cole grinned. \"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis small smile comforting, Tate brought his big brother close again. Patting his back, he said, \"Don\u0027t worry, Cole. I\u0027ll never leave you. I love you. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. I know.\" Cole\u0027s throat closed more. \"But I\u0027m just not around enough to hear it, am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can come around more. Lots more. Daddy\u0027s not spending so much time at Hunners now. You shouldn\u0027t, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d look after me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving a big sigh, Tate held his brother\u0027s hand. \"And you can make all the noise you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when Cole\u0027s dam cracked wide-open and, in front of a crowd, on his knees in his little brother\u0027s arms, the CEO of Hunter Broadcasting surrendered and broke down. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/losing-control-the-hunter-pact-1/page-18.html","bookId":1866,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:43:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:43:30 PM"}
