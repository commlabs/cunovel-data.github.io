{"id":82631,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u003cp\u003eUsually, driving is a therapeutic experience for me. I\u0027ve never taken the Metro in Los Angeles because despite how long my daily commute is, it gives me time to gather my thoughts, flush out any anger from the day. Sometimes, it\u0027s the one chance I have where I feel like I\u0027m in complete control of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving Lucas from point A to point B, though, is almost painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop grinding your teeth, Sienna,\" he says, his voice weaving from the third row - where he insisted on riding so that he could write music in \"peace\" - up to the driver\u0027s seat to irritate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s stop and go traffic. It\u0027s nerve-wracking,\" I hiss. Then, reluctantly, I add, \"Mr. Wolfe.\" I won\u0027t mention that Kylie\u0027s notes explicitly said that a car would be sent to take him to the photo shoot this afternoon. That I heard him cancelling said vehicle this morning while I was making myself a cup of coffee. Or that the only reason I personally think he\u0027s having me escort him around is so that he can screw with my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake me fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTempt me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance into the rearview mirror. My gaze locks with frustrated hazel eyes. \"Just stop with the teeth,\" he growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore what? You discipline me? I take a breath, ready to verbalize the taunts, but then I decide better on it. Lucas is holding something important over my head. Plus, despite his promise not to touch me unless I ask, I know he doesn\u0027t have to lay a hand on my body to punish me. He\u0027s proven that to me more times than I\u0027d like to remember. Wetting my lips, I tighten my grip on the steering wheel to stop my hands from shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the rest of the ride, I slide my tongue back and forth between my teeth to keep from grinding them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reach the location for the shoot - a historic diner in the heart of downtown Nashville that\u0027s been rented out for the entire day - Lucas stops me before I open my door. \"Look, I don\u0027t . . . do very well with this kind of thing with other people around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShyness is not something I expect from Lucas, and I\u0027m taken aback. \"Meaning you want me to stay outside,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t sound so dejected. You\u0027ve got the business credit card Kylie left, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s seven more days after this. You have a tendency to dress like a first grade teacher and since you\u0027re a direct reflection of me - well, do something about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a wardrobe girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who dresses like a 23 year old teacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am 23.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re my assistant who\u0027s agreed to do as I say. Right now I\u0027m telling you to buy clothes that fit the role. Don\u0027t tell me you can\u0027t because I know you\u0027re fucking incredible at what you do,\" he says. Then, lifting his eyebrows suggestively, he leans forward and places his elbows on his knees. \"Because as it stands, the only thing I want to do when I look at you is take a ruler, bend you across a desk and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it!\" I cry out, squeezing my eyes shut to flush out the imagery that\u0027s just thrust itself into my brain. Every time I think I\u0027m making a little progress of not thinking about sex and Lucas, he stomps all over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he notices that I\u0027ve not referred to him as Mr. Wolfe or Sir once during this exchange, he doesn\u0027t say anything. He sits in the same position, staring at me expectantly until I realize at last that he\u0027s waiting for me to let him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winks at me as he steps out of the Cadillac. As he slides past me, his body brushes mine. It\u0027s just the tiniest of touches, the back of his wrist against my belly button, his shoulder skimming the top of my head so that strands of my red hair cling to his V-neck tee, but it\u0027s enough to make us both pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTentatively, I shift forward. The muscles jump under his cheeks, and he reaches up, past me, to close the car door. He keeps his eyes off of my face as he says, \"When you\u0027re shopping . . . remember you\u0027re dressing a rocker\u0027s personal assistant, remember we\u0027ve got a semi-formal birthday party to go to while in Atlanta. And if I so much as see one lame ass cardigan, I swear I\u0027ll burn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stalks past me and into the diner. Instead of following him with my gaze, I close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFantasize about what would\u0027ve happened if our lips had touched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel parts of me that I shut down two years ago wake up once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I shop at the trendy boutiques and vintage stores downtown Nashville is popular for, my mind pings back and forth between Lucas, my duty to finish up my seven days and get the house back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my life in California.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I can\u0027t resist wondering if I had given in to Lucas when we almost spent the night together, would things be different now? Would I be different? My attraction to him was immediate, one of those things that took my breath away, numbing my senses and making me ache all at once. I was drawn to his music, the way his voice had a way of tearing away my layers and digging to my very core, even when he was singing about strippers and partying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, Lucas was drawn to me because . . . I had a hard time saying \"no\" on set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept to him, and he was too infatuated to realize that until it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back of my neck tingles, and I tilt my head to each side to stretch it. I\u0027ve got to quit letting the past mess with my head. I just need to forget Lucas Wolfe and all of this and move on. I just need -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sienna?\" a female voice calls my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up from the black skinny jeans that I\u0027m clutching to face a girl with short, spiky turquoise and pink hair and snake bite piercings. I squint for a second, trying to place her. As she comes closer, her face unblurs, and I mentally take away the facial piercings and picture her with blonde Jennifer Aniston-esque layers and a pink Polo shirt. I feel my lips automatically curl into a grin. Jessica rushes forward to hug me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing back, she squeals. \"Dude, I haven\u0027t seen you in - what? - four or five years? What are you now, a teac - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wardrobe assistant for Echo Falls,\" I say before she has the chance to call me a teacher. Self-consciously, I tug at the hem of my flutter sleeve top. Guess it does its job of making me look professional. To the point that my boss wants to spank me with a ruler and an old friend assumes I spend my days drilling addition into first graders\u0027 brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit,\" she says. She drapes the armful of clothes she\u0027s carrying across a mannequin\u0027s arm, despite the nasty look the sales girl working the floor gives her. Jessica rolls her eyes. \"I fucking hate that show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" I say, and she grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long you here for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing down at a rack, I shrug. \"Just another couple weeks. I\u0027m doing a favor for a . . . um . . . friend and helping my grandma with a few things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s she doing?\" When I tell her that Gram is well, she tilts her head to the side, nodding. \"And your mama?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat familiar buzz of humiliation makes me bow my head a little, but I fight back the urge to flinch. When my mom and her husband had gone down for selling and trafficking prescription drugs, they\u0027d taken Jessica\u0027s uncle with them. Jessica never seemed too hurt about it - and she\u0027s not mentioning it right now - but I hate that she\u0027s asked about my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust me, if your mom went to prison for one of the biggest drug busts in state history and snitches on every dealer within 20 miles . . . you\u0027d be afraid and embarrassed when someone asks about her too. \"She\u0027s fine,\" I say stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica murmurs something inaudible in a sympathetic voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your parents still run that bar?\" I ask and she rolls her eyes dramatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it would be awesome getting all the free booze, but yeah. My dad\u0027s a fucking slave driver.\" As if on cue, her phone beeps and she drags it out of the pocket of her fuchsia jeans. \"And as usual, work calls. I\u0027ve gotta pay for these and run, but if you\u0027re not busy tonight . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe digs in her messenger bag and hands me a red and black flyer. It\u0027s an advertisement for a Your Toxic Sequel cover band performing at her parents\u0027 Broadway bar. I nearly choke on my own saliva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeals, clapping her tattooed hands together. \"Ahh, a YTS fan, I see? I adore them. My boyfriend\u0027s in the band and they\u0027re amazeballs - almost better than the real thing. Come out if you can. See you around,\" she says, plucking her clothes off the mannequin. \"And find me on Facebook if I don\u0027t see you tonight!\" she yells as she walks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pay for my own selections soon after. I ball the pink flyer up and throw it in the bottom of the shopping bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas has that look of worshipped star as I drive him back to the house on Green Hills, so he doesn\u0027t complain about how the ride back is twice as long, or how I nearly run into the back of a minivan that boasts about a hundred of those kid and animal pictures on the very back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d think they give blow jobs with photo shoots,\" I say under my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing at all, Mr. Wolfe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he asks to see the clothes that I\u0027ve purchased the moment we enter the house. My head hurts from the long day spent out, so I gesture toward my room, and he follows behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For someone who plays with clothes all day, you didn\u0027t buy much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face tightens. \"I don\u0027t play with clothes all day, Lucas. I . . . work with them.\" But my voice falters as if I\u0027m unsure of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raises his hands up in front of himself defensively. \"Hey, I didn\u0027t mean anything by it. I think it\u0027s\" - he pauses and bends his knees a little so his face is closer to mine - \"are you crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I huff and puff and yell and you say nothing. I make a joke about your job and you cry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, at least he acknowledges that he\u0027s a bully. Crossing my arms over my chest, I sit on the arm of the couch that\u0027s at the end of my bed. He doesn\u0027t move from his spot in front of me, tapping his foot as he waits impatiently for a reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, I begin, \"I just - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t lie to me either,\" he says in a stern voice. I glare up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom used to call it playing with clothes. Hell, she probably still calls it that, that\u0027s all.\" I say. Shrugging my shoulders, I slide the heel of my foot up and down the side of the couch. \"I\u0027ve got a few mommy issues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head to each side, he says, \"I bet.\" I furrow my eyebrows, and he adds, \"My mom\u0027s never been the biggest fan of what I do. I mean, she jokes about it at Thanksgiving and her friends think me and Kylie are demons, but she\u0027s never made me feel like what I love to do isn\u0027t important. If she did . . . well, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d want much to do with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want him to elaborate because this is one of the first times he\u0027s given me insight into his life outside of music and fame, but he nods his head down toward the bags strewn out across my temporary bed. \"Now, show me what you\u0027ve bought for yourself.\" His voice is soft now, encouraging. Just another reminder of just how puzzling Lucas is. His moods switch at the drop of the hat, and it\u0027s suicidal to be attracted to someone I can\u0027t predict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scamper over the back of the couch, landing on my knees on the bed. He hisses in a deep breath of air, and my head pops up, red hair flying everywhere. He\u0027s frozen in place, looking down at me with his face drawn and his full lips parted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do things like that, that\u0027s what,\" he growls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drag my hands through my hair, knotting it into a loose pile at the top of my head. \"You\u0027re incredibly uptight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try living with someone that\u0027s hard to resist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or someone you want to control?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow painfully aware of his every move, his every inhale and exhale, I show him the clothes. He murmurs appreciatively at the piles of rocker-friendly gear, rubbing his fingertips over edgy t-shirts and vintage lace tops and the leather jacket I\u0027d picked out. I\u0027m folding the clothes into neat piles when I hear something crinkling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up to see the red and black flyer for the Your Toxic Sequel cover band in his hand, held between his index and middle finger. When I make a move towards it, he backs up, shooing me away. I watch with my heart in my throat as he unfolds the paper. He reads it carefully, a shit-eating grin growing wider and wider as his eyes scan the page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter smoothing out the wrinkles and folding the flyer into neat creases, Lucas drops it on top the clothes I\u0027ve just folded. \"You\u0027re going to be my DD tonight, Sienna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groan and he cocks an eyebrow at me. Plastering on a smile, I grind out, \"Yes, Mr. Wolfe.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-10.html","bookId":1869,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:50 PM"}
