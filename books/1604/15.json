They need the extra hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wakes and instantly gives me a snarl, \"No. I\u0027m coming with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No you need to stay and hang with Mary. I\u0027m taking Will to the farmhouse. I\u0027ll be back in a couple days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lays back, \"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Leo, \"You coming or staying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretches out on the sleeping bags and snuggles into Meg who laughs sarcastically, \"Ha. He likes me better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes, \"Traitor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI zip the tent back up and walk back to Will, whose eyes sparkle in the morning light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, amused by me for something, \"You\u0027re funny Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003exxxx\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walk back down the mountain is less painful and considerably faster than the walk up. My feet don’t hurt and Will keeps a fast pace. Unlike Meg, he never speaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we make it back to the meeting tree, we both take a pause and listen. I lead across the open field with a sprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe make it to the edge of the field. I crouch down to look out for any signs of life in the driveway. The barn door swings open and shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re back. I know I sealed the barn door completely when I left. I can hear Will\u0027s breath on the back of my neck as I watch the house silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and whisper, \"Let me go look first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and points to the barn door. I turn and look again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost jump as I see them. It feels as though they\u0027re watching me. As the barn door swings open and shut a pair of eyes watch from inside. Stains of bloody tears streak the gaunt cheeks below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach twists and turns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI back up but Will puts his arms on me to stop me from running away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words make my skin shiver, as his hot breath lands on the back of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t move. The barn door opens and closes several more times. Then suddenly it opens and the eyes are gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at the loft window to see the thin figure pass by it. The window over looks the field perfectly. We will be seen. Suddenly I\u0027m on the ground, in the hay and wrapped up in Will\u0027s long body. He holds me close to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind plays with the hay around us, it whispers to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel his heart beating against my chest. We are face to face but my eyes dart around us. I hear footsteps. I hear something else, it’s the way an exhale sounds when your throat is a ragged mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe infected are near us. I want to pull my shirt up over my face. I want to run. I need my mask but I\u0027ve left it behind. Another rule I\u0027ve broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill strokes his thumb along the back of my neck, where his left hand lays. He\u0027s trying to calm my nerves, before I give away our location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the gusts of warm wind and the calm silence of the ragged exhales, I hear a sound I don’t expect. It\u0027s the hollering of men and the high moans of the infected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps leave the hay around us. The moaning and ragged breath becomes harder to hear, as distance is put between us and them. It\u0027s always us and them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill whispers into my forehead, \"Oh my fucking god.\" We lay in silence for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peeks his head up to look around, but I pull him back down, \"One more minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns but as I speak it the barn door closes several times hard. A raucous noise fills the air, different types of commotion begin after it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to leave now.\" I whisper into his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw nods against the top of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls back a bit and looks at me, almost through me with his intensely blue eyes. He tilts my chin with his free hand and lightly feathers his lips against mine. His kiss isn’t intense like Jake\u0027s was or soft and uncertain like Mary\u0027s. It\u0027s somewhere in the middle and filled with more of everything. He kisses beside my mouth and whispers into my cheeks, \"We\u0027re going to crawl from here and then make our way to the forest on the other side from where we came. We don’t want to lead them to the camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses once more just along side my lips and lets me out of his firm grip. He moves away from me and slithers backwards, away from the farmhouse. I follow him. The hay slices along my skin giving me small cuts. When we get to the halfway point between the forest and farmhouse, he stands and walks hunched right over. I do the same listening intently to every sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe make our way into the forest where he breaks into a run. I follow him until we reach the bigger trees. He climbs one of them quickly. I look around and start to feel uncomfortable. I don’t like being on the ground without Leo. I climb the next largest tree. I scramble up the branches until I\u0027m as high as he is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe farmhouse, my farmhouse, is nearly the entire view. I can see the field I\u0027ve crossed too many times to count. Pain creeps around inside of me as I imagine my bunker and my rations and my clean little spaces, all torn apart by the infected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Jake and Anna were here with you?\" His voice betrays his lack of hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see a small cluster of men fighting the infected like fools. They will get sick. They will become infected and maybe they will die because not everyone is able to live with running sores and bloody tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, they should have run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognize one of the men. He is the man who shouted the loudest when the man with the evil grin peed on the fire. The man named John who pulled down my pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those men held me captive. They\u0027re the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where their camp is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. I\u0027d like to avoid it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if they have Jake and Anna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain in his eyes hurts me somehow, \"I never said I was going to avoid it. I said I\u0027d like to. I\u0027m betting they have Jake and Anna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take one last look and know it will be a long time before I ever come back, if I ever do. I take my last look at the white siding and the small windmill in the front yard waves goodbye to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my feet make their way back down the tree, I see something that makes me feel the smallest amount of fear and hope simultaneously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ground is a small bandage and above it is a broken branch. I look deeper into the forest and see another broken branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They got away. They\u0027re this way.\" I point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks at the bandage and frowns, \"Emma that could belong to anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No it\u0027s not. It will smell like tea tree and the branches.\" I point to them, \"I told Jake it was how I always found my way through the woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bends his face to the ground and sniffs the air around the bandage, \"It is tea tree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to run, but he grabs my arm as he stands and pulls me into him, \"One thing first.\" He puts his hands on the small of my back and lifts me into his arms. His lips meet mine with desperation and excitement. His tongue slides into my mouth, caressing mine. He sucks my lower lip and nibbles it. His hands take up most of my back and rub and caress me. Suddenly his hands make their way lower. I don’t feel uncomfortable as he cups my butt and lifts me into him. He wraps my legs around him. I\u0027m feeling the way I used to when I read the romance novels granny had stored at the cabin. I feel a heat rising low in my belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lets me slide down his body, till my feet touch the ground again. Air rushes between us. I open my eyes, not realizing I had closed them, and look up into his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, \"I am going to have a hard time staying focused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggle like a schoolgirl, as my granny always said. It is the first time that has left my lips, a giggle that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses me softly one last time and walks away toward the broken branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never imagined they were alive. I went back to where they were when I got taken and I couldn’t find them. I knew Jake was young and not very responsible. Well neither of us were.\" He runs a hand through his dark shaggy hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anna told me you guys were pretty bad for paying attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles and I catch myself staring at his butt. It is round and firm and when he takes a step, it moves in a way I enjoy. I realize when I watch him I feel a small amount of guilt. Jake kissed me too. Jake made me smile and made me laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill makes me scared of him but safe against the world, where as Jake makes me feel the opposite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun sets as we reach the top of a hill I have never climbed. It is in the opposite mountain range from where I\u0027ve been and I am nervous of it. I don’t know what lies on the other side. My feet hurt and I\u0027m tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lays a bunch of bows on the ground and gives me a very appealing look. It makes my stomach hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to where he has chosen to sleep and smile at it. There are branches on the ground making a mat for sleeping. He has chosen a huge tree with great bows to protect us in case it rains. He is like my father, more than I expected him to be. Not that I ever expected to meet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They think you\u0027re dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts the last bow down and sits on it. He takes the jacket he has brought with him out and puts it down. He pats it for me to sit beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy steps hurt my feet now that we\u0027ve stopped walking. I drop onto the ground beside him and watch his eyes sparkle as darkness takes over the night sky. I tuck my bow and quiver next to me, always close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was taken to the work farms. We were hiding in this old house like your farmhouse there. I wasn’t smart like you though. I never even thought about bunkers or having a few different houses and traveling between them. I was an idiot. Anyway they came. I hid Anna and Jake and let them take me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face is stoic. I want him to kiss me again. I start to wonder if he\u0027s going to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get away from the farms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met some people while I was there. Doctors who were forced to work the breeder camps and other scientists. They convinced me I needed to start a revolution from the outside. I escaped with some of them.\" He shakes his head, as if his thoughts entertain him and brushes his hands through his hair again. He looks at me and smiles, \"You know of a good spot to clean up around here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Never been here before. You\u0027re starting a revolution?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-15.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
