Sara carried on something fierce while Nathan gently applied the sticky lotion to her back and shoulders. Fortunately the front of her hadn\u0027t been burned. She slept on her stomach, and when she couldn\u0027t stand the shivers she slept on Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day Nathan didn\u0027t make a single rude remark when he kissed Sara good-bye. He pretended he didn\u0027t mind looking at the mask of green paste covering her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara spent the next two days with her aunt. The Reverend Mr. Pickering came back for a second visit. He was much more civil. Sara explained the reason she\u0027d used such foul words in his presence. Pickering broke into a smile. He looked relieved by her confession, and his manner toward Aunt Nora warmed considerably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the course of their visitation the reverend mentioned that there was a ship leaving for England the following morning. Sara immediately went to her aunt\u0027s desk and penned a letter to her mother. She told all about her adventure, how happy she was, and boasted that Nathan had turned out to be a kind, considerate, loving husband. Reverend Mr. Pickering took the missive with him to give to the captain of the vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Nathan came back the following morning Sara was so happy to see him that she burst into tears. They spent a peaceful day together and fell asleep wrapped in each other\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara couldn\u0027t believe it was possible to be so happy. Being married to Nathan was like living in paradise. Nothing could ever destroy their love. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished everyone could be as happy and made that remark to Nora and Matthew late one evening. The three of them sat in wicker chairs on the verandah while they waited for Nathan to return from an errand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe Matthew and I know exactly what you\u0027re talking about,\" Nora announced. \"One doesn\u0027t have to be young to experience love, my dear. Matthew, are you ready for a brandy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll fetch it,\" Sara volunteered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll stay put,\" Nora countered. She stood up and started for the door. \"Your burn\u0027s still tender. Keep Matthew company. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the door closed behind Nora Matthew whispered, \"She\u0027s too good for me, Sara, but I\u0027m not going to let that stand in my way. As soon as I put my affairs in order I\u0027m coming back to live out my days with your aunt. How are you feeling about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara clasped her hands together. \"Oh, Matthew, I think that\u0027s wonderful news. We must have the wedding ceremony before we leave for England. I don\u0027t want to miss the celebration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew looked uncomfortable. \"Well, now, Sara, I didn\u0027t exactly mention marriage, did I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bounded out of her chair. \"You\u0027d best mention it now, Matthew, or you aren\u0027t ever coming back here. A single night of passion is one thing, sir, but a plan to live out the rest of your days in sin is quite another. Think of Nora\u0027s reputation!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am thinking about Nora\u0027s reputation,\" Matthew defended. \"She couldn\u0027t marry me. It wouldn\u0027t be right. I\u0027m not worthy enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seaman stood up and stared out toward the sea. Sara walked over and jabbed him in his stomach with her finger. \"You bloody well are worthy enough. Don\u0027t you dare insult yourself to me, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara, I\u0027ve led a… speckled life,\" Matthew stammered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m only a seaman,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara shrugged. \"Nora\u0027s first husband was a groom. He was probably just as speckled as you think you are,\" she added. \"Nora was blissfully happy with her Johnny. She must like speckled men. Nora confessed to me that you are a dear, tenderhearted man, Matthew. I know you love her. She must love you, too, if she let you into her bed. As I said to Nathan not long ago, this would solve many problems. Uncle Henry wouldn\u0027t send anyone after Nora if he knew she had someone strong to protect her. You\u0027ll look after her interests. And I would be so very proud to call you Uncle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew was humbled by her faith in him. He let out a happy sigh. \"All right,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll ask Nora. But you have to promise me you\u0027ll accept it if Nora says no. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara threw her arms around Matthew\u0027s neck and hugged him tight. \"She won\u0027t say no,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wife, what the hell are you doing? Matthew, unhand her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Sara and Matthew ignored Nathan\u0027s brisk order. Only after she\u0027d placed a chaste kiss on Matthew\u0027s cheek did she move away from him. She walked over to the top step where Nathan stood and gave him a sassy grin. \"We have to go upstairs now, husband. Matthew wants to be alone with Nora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to pull him into the house and up the stairs. He wanted her to explain why he\u0027d found her draped all over his seaman. \"I\u0027ll explain everything when we\u0027re in our bedroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed Nora on their way across the foyer. Sara bid her aunt goodnight, then went upstairs. She paced while she waited to find out if Matthew had asked his question and if Nora had given him her answer. When Nathan grew weary of watching her wear out the carpet he captured her in mid-pace, tossed her on their bed, and made wild, passionate love to her. They fell asleep wrapped in each other\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe announcement was made the following morning. Nora had agreed to become Matthew\u0027s wife. Sara guessed that much as soon as she saw her aunt\u0027s radiant smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew explained that he would have to return to England for a short while, in order to straighten out his affairs and sell his cottage. He wouldn\u0027t take Nora with him, of course, for her life would be in jeopardy if the Winchesters sniffed out her presence in England. The older seaman wanted to get married before he left, and since Nathan was determined to set sail within a week, the wedding was scheduled for the following Saturday. It was a simple ceremony. Sara wept her way through the event and Nathan spent most of his time mopping at her tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought she was the most exasperating woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan stood there watching his gentle little wife as she whispered and laughed with her aunt, and he realized then the joy she brought to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard her tell Matthew that her most fervent wish was that their marriage would be as perfect as hers was. He laughed then. Sara really was a hopeless romantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was ridiculously tenderhearted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was outrageously innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was… perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more than one serpent slithering around in Sara\u0027s paradise, just waiting for her return to England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voyage back to London was uneventful, however. Ivan took Sara under his wing and tried to teach her how to make a proper soup. The woman couldn\u0027t seem to grasp the knack of using just a pinch of seasoning, but Ivan couldn\u0027t bring himself to tell her the truth. The rest of the men wouldn\u0027t tell her either. They praised her considerably, yet the minute she turned her back on them they tossed the soup overboard. Their empty stomachs weren\u0027t nearly as important to them as Sara\u0027s feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara then wanted to try her hand at making biscuits. The ones stored in the wooden tins were filled with vile little creatures called weevils. The crew didn\u0027t mind the insects. They merely pounded the biscuits on the floor a couple of times to shake the weevils loose, then ate the biscuits whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Ivan had all the ingredients needed, he decided to let Sara make a batch. She worked all morning on the biscuits. The men pretended to be appreciative, but the things were as hard as stones, and they were afraid they\u0027d break their teeth if they tried to take a bite out of one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChester had become Sara\u0027s greatest champion. He scoffed at the other men, then soaked his biscuit overnight in a full cup of grog. Come morning, even he had to whisper defeat. The biscuit was still too hard to chew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew suggested they use the leftovers for cannonballs. Nathan laughed at that remark. Sara happened to overhear the banter and took immediate exception. She retaliated that evening by eating the most disgusting meal ever put together by man. She made certain Nathan was watching her, too. The sour cucumbers soaked in strawberry jam did the trick. Nathan barely made it to the railing before he lost his supper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara did seem to have an iron stomach and less than ordinary discrimination regarding food. Nathan watched her every move, and it wasn\u0027t long before he realized how enjoyable it was to have her around. He liked the sound of her laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they reached London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan immediately took Sara to the Emerald Shipping office. He was eager for her to meet Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was midmorning when they walked down the crowded wharf. The sun was shining bright enough to make a person squint. It was warm, too. The door to the office was propped open to let the sweet breeze inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were just a half a block away from the entrance Nathan pulled Sara aside, leaned down, and whispered, \"When you meet Colin, don\u0027t mention his limp. He\u0027s a little sensitive about his leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a limp? What happened to the poor man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A shark took a bite out of him,\" Nathan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good Lord,\" she whispered in a rush. \"He\u0027s fortunate to be alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he is,\" he agreed. \"Now promise me you won\u0027t say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you think I\u0027d mention his limp to him? What kind of woman do you think I am? Nathan, I do know what\u0027s proper and what isn\u0027t. Shame on you for thinking I\u0027d say a word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You screamed when you saw my back,\" he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have to bring that up. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, that was different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" he asked, wondering what outrageous explanation she would give him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"It was different because I love you,\" she said, blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, she was exasperating, he thought. Pleasing, too. He was becoming accustomed to hearing her tell him how much she loved him. Shaking that thought away, he continued. \"And now that you know about Colin\u0027s leg you won\u0027t be surprised, and you therefore won\u0027t say anything to embarrass him. Isn\u0027t that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she nodded agreement she tried to get in the last word. \"Lord, you\u0027re insulting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her just to gain a moment\u0027s peace, but before he could stop himself he\u0027d properly hauled her into his arms and let the kiss get completely out of hand. She opened her mouth before he would have forced her. His tongue swept inside to rub against hers. He didn\u0027t mind at all that they were standing in the center of the busy crosswalk, didn\u0027t care either that several passersby stopped to watch them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimbo and Matthew came rushing down the walk but stopped when they saw the couple. Jimbo let out a snort of disgust. \"For God\u0027s sake, boy, now isn\u0027t the time to be pawing your woman. We\u0027ve got business to see to before the day\u0027s completely gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan reluctantly pulled away from his wife. She sagged against him. He had to smile over that telling reaction. Then she noticed the group of strangers watching her. The mist of passion quickly evaporated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forget yourself,\" she whispered to Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not the only one who forgot myself,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored that truth. \"I\u0027m about to meet your business associate, and I would appreciate it if you wouldn\u0027t distract me so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her back on him before he could think of a suitable retort. While she smoothed her hair over her shoulders she smiled at Jimbo and Matthew. \"Are you coming along with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men nodded in unison. Sara took Jimbo\u0027s arm. \"You may escort me, sir, and you as well, Matthew,\" she added when he offered his arm to her. \"I\u0027m most anxious to meet Nathan\u0027s friend. He must be quite a man to put up with my husband. Shall we go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan had only enough time to get out of the trio\u0027s way as they continued down the walk. He trailed behind, frowning over the high-handed way his wife had taken charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And by the way,\" he heard Sara say, \"whatever you do, please don\u0027t mention Colin\u0027s limp to him. He\u0027s very sensitive about that topic, I can assure you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you hadn\u0027t met him yet,\" Jimbo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t,\" Sara replied. \"But Nathan has advised me. My husband is proving to be very tenderhearted when it comes to his friend\u0027s feelings. Now if I could only get him to show me like consideration, well, I assure you, I would be most grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit trying to provoke me,\" Nathan said from behind. He shoved Jimbo out of his way, grabbed hold of his wife\u0027s hand, and dragged her forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was highly insulted by that command. She wasn\u0027t the ill-natured partner in the marriage. Since she was so sweetnatured, she decided not to take issue with Nathan. She\u0027d wait until later to set him straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, she was eager to meet his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin was sitting behind his desk, sorting through a mound of papers. As soon as Sara and Nathan walked inside he stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan\u0027s friend was an extremely good-looking man, and it didn\u0027t take Sara long to realize his character was just as charming. He had a nice, genuine smile. There was a devilish sparkle in his hazel-colored eyes. He was handsome, though certainly not as handsome as Nathan. Colin didn\u0027t have the height, either, or the muscle. Sara did have to look up at him, of course, but she didn\u0027t get a crick in her neck as she always did when Nathan was standing close to her and nagging her to look him in the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe guessed it was rude of her to stare at the man and immediately made a formal curtsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At last I\u0027m allowed to meet the bride,\" Colin said. \"You\u0027re even more beautiful close up, Lady Sara, than from the distance at which I last saw you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter giving her that compliment Colin walked over to stand directly in front of her. In a gallant action he formally bowed to her, then lifted her hand and kissed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quite impressed with his manners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan wasn\u0027t. \"For God\u0027s sake, Colin, you don\u0027t have to put on a show. You won\u0027t impress her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he will,\" Sara announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s impressing me, too,\" Jimbo announced with a deep chuckle. \"I\u0027ve never seen the Dolphin act so fancy.\" He nudged Matthew in the ribs. \"Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t say that I have,\" Matthew replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin didn\u0027t let go of Sara\u0027s hand. She didn\u0027t mind. Nathan obviously did. \"Unhand her, Colin,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until you\u0027ve made a proper introduction,\" Colin announced. He winked at Sara and almost laughed when she blushed in reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only was Nathan\u0027s wife exquisitely beautiful, she was also charming, Colin thought to himself. Had Nathan realized his good fortune yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin turned to his friend to ask just that question, then decided to find out for himself. \"Well?\" he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-32.html","bookId":1790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM"}
