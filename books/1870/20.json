Turns out, no matter how hard I tried to bring him to his so-called cheating knees, he held onto his resolve and, apparently, his relationship. Lauren burst out of the closet and the rest was make-up sex history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I\u0027ll have to confess everything to Cruise since it\u0027s his friend from the gym, or things are bound to get really weird the next time Cal\u0027s around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my hair into a ponytail and head to the kitchen. There\u0027s a plate on the table loaded with eggs and bacon, two slices of my favorite kind of toast, and my heart melts. The way Cruise loves me is indescribable. It feels like heaven to be cared for like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a note set to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing for a walk, be right back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t hesitate slipping on my boots and coat before heading out the door. I need to collect my morning kiss. It\u0027s practically a necessary vitamin to kick-start the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air outside is crisp. The wind picks up and wraps itself around my bare neck like a scarf made of icicles. If it weren\u0027t for Cruise, I\u0027d literally be freezing to death and homeless. I guess I should be thankful Pennington didn\u0027t have the foresight to get me keyed in with the housing department - thankful for his beer bong emergency that cropped up at the last minute. It\u0027s so strange how it all worked out. It\u0027s as if destiny stepped in and arranged every coincidence to work in our favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf ever there were a couple that was meant to be, it\u0027s Cruise and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoices buzz through the shrubbery, and I follow the sound over to a dirt trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t love her anymore.\" Cruise\u0027s voice resonates loud and clear through the thicket, it reverberates through my skull like some horrible gong. Who doesn\u0027t he love?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean into the fat trunk of a pine - my heart already blistering from his words. Surely, they weren\u0027t meant for me. I peer over at him, seated next to his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I regret every last thing,\" he continues. \"Honestly, I don\u0027t know what I ever saw in her. I don\u0027t even think she\u0027s pretty.\" His voice escalates as if he just woke up from a long hibernation and wasn\u0027t satisfied with what he found lying in his bed. \"She\u0027s totally screwed up on the inside. I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll blame it on daddy issues, and now she\u0027s got her mother all over my back. If I regret one thing, it\u0027s ever asking her to marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart pulsates through me like a series of grenades. It thumps through my ears until the world warps to the deafening sound of a jungle drum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stagger backward and trip over a root. The ground jolts, the entire universe spins on its axis as I gather what strength I have left and head back to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears pour like rain for the first twenty minutes, as an entire cyclone of emotion rips through me. I hadn\u0027t seen the storm on the horizon. There was no time to batten down the hatches. Cruise doesn\u0027t love me anymore, and now he\u0027s sorry he ever put this ring on my finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m numb inside, a shell of who I was just an hour ago. I segue into the hiccupping, slap-cheek red phase of the ugly cry, but I need to pull it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent a text to Ally. She said I could crash with her for a while. There\u0027s no way I\u0027m staying in the bed and breakfast with his family, even if Mom, herself, has already taken up residency there. I\u0027ll fill her in on my trauma some other day. Besides, I don\u0027t think I could get the words to vomit from my throat, not with this boulder of pain Cruise lodged in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door jiggles, and everything in me freezes. I wipe down my face with my T-shirt and brace myself for what I have to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruise walks in and beams a sad smile while taking off his jacket. He looks resplendent, divine. How I ever thought someone as godlike as Cruise Elton could love me, want me, just shows how hard I\u0027ve fallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look who\u0027s up?\" If I didn\u0027t know better I\u0027d think he was hurt, but it seems like I\u0027m the only one hurting in this equation. He does a double take at my suitcase, packed and ready to roll by my side. \"What\u0027s going on?\" His features transform with genuine surprise, and I\u0027m almost sold on the fact he\u0027s aching to see me stay, but I know better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just heading to Ally\u0027s.\" I shrug, running my fingers through the back of my hair as if he didn\u0027t just cut my heart out with the knife of his tongue and unwittingly serve it to me for breakfast. \"You know, just getting out of your way. Rumor has it your ex is interested in patching things up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I hear.\" He rides his eyes up my body, slow, suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, I guess that means you\u0027re still into her.\" My heart sinks - you could tie it to my neck and throw me into the sea with the millstone it\u0027s become in such a short time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows dip as if to protest the idea. \"Are you into other guys, Kenny?\" His strangled gaze remains unmovable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a breath and hold it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s happening? This is, Cruise. A few short hours ago, I would have bet my life that we were Garrison\u0027s next power couple, and now here we are, frying each other on the skillet, searing our hatred over one another for the hell of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose hurtful words I overheard this morning waft through my mind like the stench from a rotting corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I am into other guys,\" I say it low. \"That\u0027s how this whole mess started, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest lurches as if he were going to laugh - cry, but he aborts the effort. \"I guess I trained you well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess you did.\" I glance down at his grandmother\u0027s ring still gracing my finger and gently pluck it off. He doesn\u0027t stop me or beg me not to do it with some impassioned plea, which only solidifies what I heard him say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis right here - this stabbing rejection is real. Cruise and all his love for me was just another illusion. I jumped into love believing it was a battleship that would withstand the test of time when all it turned out to be was a paper boat that dissolved to nothing beneath my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose this was just a test,\" I say, holding up the platinum band a moment before placing it on the table. \"I guess I failed because a player never commits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruise closes his eyes an inordinate amount of time and takes a breath that goes on for miles. \"Look, I get it. You\u0027re not ready. You\u0027re in college - you\u0027re young. You want to see what\u0027s out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips tremble, and for a minute I think he\u0027s going to tell me this is all some joke, that he still loves me, that I should put that ring back on right this fucking minute, but he doesn\u0027t. Cruise is somehow trying to pass all this off on me because he\u0027s too chicken shit to admit the fact he\u0027s over us - that he never thought I was pretty - that I\u0027m prone to blame everything on my screwed up fatherless childhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe in the future.\" He takes a step forward, and I retract. \"Maybe we can see where things lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart implodes. This is it. The big kiss off. Cruise Elton has the balls to look me straight in the eye and offer me \"someday\" while hacking down any fantasy I might have had about forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck off, Cruise.\" I wheel my luggage past him at breakneck speed and open the door to the icy world waiting to comfort me with its barbed wire embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears bubble to the surface, and I refuse to do him the honor by letting them fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kenny, wait,\" he pleads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet somehow find the strength to carry me over the threshold one last time. I glance back at him - his gorgeous frame stains itself like a bookmark in my mind. I never want to forget how bad falling in love can hurt - how quick the jagged granite comes up after you dive from the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Kendall,\" I stammer. \"But don\u0027t worry. You won\u0027t have to use it. I won\u0027t be hanging around too much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toss my shit in the car and speed the hell away from the Elton Bed and Breakfast where hearts are stolen and returned mutilated on a whim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive down several miles until I come upon a sign that reads, Now leavening Carrington. Please visit us again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrington was beautiful, but its lessons were harsh. It watched with eager anticipation as its prized son cut out my heart with a rusted razor for the hell of it. The world tried to warn me, but I wouldn\u0027t listen. I wanted the fairytale, the fantasy of it all. I wanted to be the princess that Cruise told me I was. I bought the lie, and my heart was thrown back in my face. I came to Carrington with a heart of glass, and Cruise crushed it under his heel. But today, as I leave Cruise and Carrington behind for good, I trade that heart of glass for a heart of stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one will ever hurt me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll make damn sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull off behind a row of Junipers and sob my eyes out for the next several hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy maxim comes back like a haunting refrain - love never works out in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate that I was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruise\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuck just happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stagger over to the door and stare at the empty space where her car sat a moment ago. A plume of dust rises over the hill from the direction she sped off in. I step back into the house, panting - my heart threatening to evict itself from my chest. I should have fought for her. I should have laid down my pride and dropped to my knees, begged her to have me - hell, pencil me in on Tuesdays if she wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was that imposter? It couldn\u0027t have been Kenny. Maybe she\u0027s got a twin, and she\u0027s punking me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I see it. Neatly laid out over the sofa is the wool coat I gave her. Her boots sit on the hearth as if she were suggesting I use them for fuel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hard roll of nausea cycles through me. How could I have let this happen? Then again, how could I not? I\u0027m Catastrophe Cruise, and fucking up relationships seems to be my specialty. Although it wasn\u0027t me who cheated with Blair, and it wasn\u0027t me who cheated with Kenny. But I would tolerate just about anything Kenny dished out just to be a part of her life. I\u0027d take the leftovers of her love on every day that ends in Y if she let me. That\u0027s how far I\u0027ve drifted from the person who built his life around ideals, when high standards and morals were the order of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baseball bat I keep in the corner catches my eye. I speed over and choke the shit out of it like my life depended on it - hell, my sanity. I blow out every fucking window in this psychotic love shack of ours - shatter them to millions of pieces just like Kenny shattered my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue to her word, Kenny doesn\u0027t show for class that week or the following week after that. She doesn\u0027t return my calls, and her mother manages to give me to the cold shoulder each time I\u0027ve bumped into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been holing up in the bowels of the bed and breakfast, going over the books, as if I weren\u0027t depressed enough already. Just as I suspected, Mom has let a few bills go unpaid, and now the creditors are breathing down our necks. I assured her I\u0027d take over. There\u0027s no point in delaying the inevitable. The only question is, how am I going to handle school and running a fulltime business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Wednesday there\u0027s a note on my desk, and for a moment my adrenaline skyrockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandatory meeting. My office 3:30. Dr. Barney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor sure not the note I was hoping for. I was looking forward to something a little more erotic in nature with a big fat heart and a giant K gracing the bottom of the page. I\u0027ve been fantasizing all week how she\u0027d sneak into my room - that this had all been some great ploy to initiate the world\u0027s greatest make-up sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 3:30 on the button, I stroll into Dr. Barney\u0027s office and try to forget about the constant ache gnawing at me ever since Kenny rolled her suitcase out of my life. I press out a manufactured smile and nod into the tired looking man who holds my fellowship in his hands. I must be early because the rest of the seats are suspiciously empty. Either that or this is a private pow-wow. He probably wants to tell me how proud he is of me, handling Bradshaw\u0027s class with one hand tied behind my scholastic back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Elton.\" Dr. Barney raises his chin and expertly peers down his nose at me. He\u0027s plumped up a bit, and his age spots have spread evenly over his face giving him a tanned complexion. \"I\u0027m most devastated by some news that\u0027s recently come to my attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\" I hiss it out low. \"Is Bradshaw all right?\" What the hell am I saying? Obviously, Bradshaw is not all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor Bradshaw is in remission.\" He pulls back his lips, and his double chin quivers with anger. \"Cruise, this news involves you, and, unfortunately, not you alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slides an enlarged photo across the table and my blood runs cold with just one look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Kenny and me that day back in my classroom. Her sweater dips past her bottom, her legs curve around my back, perfectly pale. My face is buried in her neck, and I can still feel the pleasure coursing through my veins as if I were reliving it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slides another shot my way. The tower stares back at me with its long, erect neck, the bony structure of the globe. Then a zoomed shot. You can\u0027t see Kenny, just my coat as I help her into the center of the steel-caged world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this.\" He slips me another picture of the tower, this time a close up of my face lost in ecstasy - Kenny\u0027s long mane whipping over my neck. \"Well? What do you have to say for yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare down at them - Kenny and I in these compromising positions - her beautiful hair, her feathered skin, those lips I\u0027d die to cover with mine just one last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I\u0027d really like to say is, can I have these? I\u0027d like to spread them over my bed - lay over them naked, frame them, replicate them, and wallpaper my new crappy room with a dizzying pattern of who we once were - all of our adventures surrounding me like an erotic kaleidoscope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that I\u0027ve rendered you speechless\" - he rasps his knuckles over his desk - \"I\u0027ve one other thing to show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time it\u0027s a simple sheet of paper he slides over - the revised syllabus I made just for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A young lady dropped them by, early this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenny? But how would she take the pictures? Most likely Blair and I wouldn\u0027t put it past her to riffle through Kenny\u0027s things and steal what she needed. I hold up the syllabus as exhibit A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cruise, I\u0027m sorry to have to do this, but your brief teaching career has come to a rather ignoble demise. Not only that, but I\u0027ve had to report my findings to the board. We\u0027ve unanimously agreed - your fellowship has been revoked. You\u0027ve been expelled from Garrison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words come to me in snatches. The room warps in and out, and I\u0027m ready to bang my head over the table in the most literal fucking sense because all of my bad luck has managed to come crashing around me at once. The funny thing is, none of this bullshit matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027ve disappointed you, Dr. Barney.\" I rise to my feet and take a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem too broken up about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\" I press it out in a fit of honesty. \"I lost the most important thing in my life last week - this is just a superficial wound in comparison.\" The brevity of truth gives me pause. \"I\u0027m sorry if I\u0027ve insulted you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked me to give you this.\" He hands me a small folded note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unravel it to find the words, Consider yourself played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriday afternoon, I manage to crawl out from under my mother\u0027s watchful eye and head to the gym with the intention of tormenting every muscle in my body. I let her know I\u0027m taking back the bed and breakfast. I\u0027m ratcheting up the marketing to a whole new level and even suggested she air out those rooms because she can damn well expect more than a few guests. I plan on getting the financial cogs moving again. Maybe if I had more monetary stability in my life. Maybe then...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I could I say I was over Kenny - nose to the wind, I\u0027ll catch another bus and all that good to go bullshit, but she branded herself over my heart, my mind. She haunts my dreams, my waking hours. Kenny is the ghost, the one that got away. I have a feeling I\u0027ll be wanting her, yearning for her long into my golden years until I take that eternal nap, and even then, I won\u0027t be put out of my misery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get a text from Pen as I stroll into the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s on like Donkey Kong. Alpha Sigma Phi tonight. See U there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach does a revolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlpha Sigma Phi. That\u0027s where it all started for Kenny and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal spots me as I walk into the weight room and heads over with a spring in his step. I bet he\u0027s got a blowjob story I\u0027m not going to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long time no see,\" he chirps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s on my calendar to beat the shit out of you,\" I say, taking a seat on the Frankensteined workout equipment. I\u0027m not really in the mood to confront him about what I saw that night at Delta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell for?\" He pops a foot up on the wheel and begins tying his shoe - his fucking shoe like it\u0027s no big deal. It makes me feel like shoving mine right up his ass. \"So, I got some news - Lauren says I passed the test.\" He hikes his brows like this should mean something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What test?\" I down my water bottle to keep from socking him in the nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ticks his head as though this were big news. \"The ambush hookup, the lover\u0027s limbo - how low can you go?\" He holds his hands out like he\u0027s about to fly away, and I wish he would. \"You know, relationship test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you talking about?\" Not that I care. It\u0027s not like I\u0027m passing any relationship test anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren. She sicced that hot girlfriend of yours on me, then watched me sweat it out. I turned her down flat, and Lauren jumped out of the fucking closet like a psychotic P.I. But it was cute. It means she loves me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides pinch to life.
