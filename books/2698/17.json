I\u0027ve seen-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, why do you think I can only use my blood for the transfusions?\" He released her, stepping back, and his voice turned almost cold. \"I\u0027m an anomaly, as far as I can tell. The story I got as a child was pretty confused, but my mother didn\u0027t believe my father had been dead for very long. But he came home to her-when all the evidence says he was lying dead on the plain. The way I figure it, my father was attacked and...turned, but somehow he made it back to her, and that was the night I was conceived. He loved her deeply, and-I know she loved him. The idea of finding a new husband never once occurred to her. And, like you, she never believed that a man she loved so much could be evil. But as I grew up, it became apparent that I wasn\u0027t quite your usual kid. If I was injured, I healed. I was riddled with bullets during the war, and everyone was sure I was dead. When it turned out I was alive, I was discharged and sent home to heal. Except I already was healed. That\u0027s why I went to medical school, though. I wanted to help others heal.\" He paused. \"I have some other unusual abilities, too. I can move like lightning, and if I concentrate, I can cloak myself, like a shadow. I have a superhuman strength. And my hearing and eyesight are acute. I really am-a vampire, Alex. Half vampire, anyway, which I guess is why I don\u0027t need an invitation to enter a house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis story was insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cody, I know you believe what you\u0027re saying, but it\u0027s just because you\u0027ve been doing this so long that you\u0027re...You\u0027re just strong, that\u0027s all, and you\u0027ve got...you\u0027ve got good blood,\" she said weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Alex, I am half monster,\" he said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t drink blood!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite herself, she felt her hand slip to her throat. \"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, turning away from her again and striding across the room. \"I don\u0027t take human blood, Alex. Like anyone, I get most of my nutrition from food, and I learned as a child to subsist on any kind of blood when food just wasn\u0027t enough. And to go a very long time between...drinks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what kind of blood do you...?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cow\u0027s blood, Alex. I\u0027ve been known to hang around a slaughterhouse or two,\" he said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cow\u0027s blood,\" she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wild pigs did well enough when I went to war,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex blinked. \"Wild pigs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Once, as a child, I bit the family dog. I really loved that dog, and because of me, he almost died. When he made it, I knew that I\u0027d never touch a dog, or any pet, again. Or a coyote or a wolf, for that matter. They\u0027re too much like dogs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chickens?\" she suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and met her eyes again. \"Chickens-if I have no choice. They don\u0027t provide much blood, not like a cow or a horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true. Every word I\u0027ve spoken is true. I never wanted to come to Victory. I wanted to heal the injured-boys from the North as well as the South-as they straggled back into New Orleans. I wanted to deliver babies. But I\u0027d gotten a reputation, I guess you\u0027d say, and I worked for the government on a few cases before the war. And now I\u0027m here because Brendan had heard about me, and he asked me to come out and help him with what was going on here. So you see, Alex, my father is out here somewhere, too. And I need to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Alex could do was stare at him. After a long moment he turned, went back over to her dressing table and picked up his plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take this to my room and leave you to your thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked away, closing the door behind him, and she couldn\u0027t even manage to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t-wouldn\u0027t-accept what he\u0027d said. He was crazy. He\u0027d been doing this too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat first night...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had moved like a shadow himself, slipped up behind Milo in a way that had seemed almost inhumanly effective. He knew exactly what he was doing. He...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s true. Every word I\u0027ve spoken is true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe believed it. And after what she had seen...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe believed it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sprang into action, hurrying to the door, throwing it open-and then she froze, staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d set his plate down on the dresser and was at the washstand. His shirt was gone, and he was lathering himself up almost frenziedly. He scrubbed his face and chest, then drenched himself in cold water, letting it sluice over him. His back was to her, but when he looked up, she could see his face in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he could see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he demanded. His tone was sharp, as if he was trying to create a wall between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I laid it out simply enough. My father became a vampire. Then he went back to my mother-and I was conceived. Therefore, I am half vampire. Half monster. And I\u0027ve figured out that I\u0027ll never get to go home and go back to simply being a city doctor-delivering babies and setting broken legs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around, mopping his face with a towel, frowning as he looked at her. \"So...what?\" he asked, scowling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strode into the room, facing him. Close. Almost backing him into the washstand. \"I never took you for a coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you talking about?\" His eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you have a little quirk in your pedigree,\" she said, then smiled. \"This is America. I\u0027m some kind of Northern European mix. Between them, Tess and Jewell have Chinese, African, Mexican and Indian blood. God knows what Jigs is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe allowed himself a small, grim smile. \"Nice try, Alex, but that\u0027s not quite the same as being half vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is for you, Cody. You use your birth, the abilities you inherited, for good,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her against him for a long moment, and she could smell the clean scent of soap on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if you\u0027re going to hunt vampires all your life, there\u0027s no reason not to allow yourself to care-not have a home to go back to after you go hunting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cupped her face, lifting her chin. \"You still don\u0027t believe me, do you? I\u0027m a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you still don\u0027t believe me, do you?\" she whispered. \"I don\u0027t see you as a monster. I see you as the man who saved my life. I see you as the man I want...for however much time I can have, whenever that time may be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Alex, I have no right. I never had the right....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cody, for the love of God, will you please let me have the last word, just this once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell silent, staring at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted herself on her toes, finding his lips, kissing them softly at first, then passionately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cody, I need you tonight,\" she whispered against his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped his arms around her again, his chin resting atop her head, and he said, \"I don\u0027t know what the future will bring, Alex. I honestly don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of us do,\" she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he kissed her. Maybe, in his own mind, he felt he had to prove his humanity, because he was gentle, his kiss feather light. He lifted her as if she were precious and laid her down so tenderly that she was aware only of the softness of the mattress beneath her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretched out beside her, stroking her cheek, staring into her eyes....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed softly, somehow knowing what was in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll stay here. I\u0027ll protect you. I\u0027ll be your strength against the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverwhelmed by need and desire, she suddenly took command and straddled him, working at the buttons on her tailored shirt as she leaned down over him, her hair feathering against his chest, eliciting a soft groan that only fed her own hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw the shirt aside and kissed him, her lips wild and hungry, her tongue passionate and demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose to the challenge, returning her fever with his own, cupping her head, rolling with her, seeking to free her from her remaining garments. She helped, sliding her riding breeches down over her hips before shifting her hands to the buckle of his belt, then dipping her fingers beneath his waistband. His eyes met hers, and she bit back the words she couldn\u0027t say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t care who or what you are. I don\u0027t care that we\u0027ve only known each other a few days, the strangest days of my life. I know there will never be anyone else like you. I\u0027m falling in love with you. No, I am in love with you....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. She couldn\u0027t say those words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she made love to him instead, and she gasped in sweet pleasure as he returned each brush and gesture, as they turned into a tangle of stroking, touching, kissing and teasing, awakening an ever greater arousal. Finally they rocked into climax together, the moment seizing them with a sweet violence that swept them up into the wonder of the flesh, then allowed them to drift down still filled with the wonder of what could never be truly touched, truly understood, the power of the heart and the soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward they lay together quietly for a while, just breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither of us can take the chance of being fooled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring up at the ceiling, but his arm tightened around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both want our fathers to be...good. Not monsters. Not killers. But if they should come to us, we can\u0027t allow ourselves to be fooled. We can\u0027t let hope cost us our lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" she whispered. \"I can be strong. But we\u0027ll learn the truth. We\u0027ll bring down Milo, and then we\u0027ll discover that there can be such a thing as a good vampire. That shouldn\u0027t be so hard for you to believe. You say you\u0027re a vampire, and you\u0027re good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a vampire,\" he said. \"And yes, I\u0027m good, or at least I try to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See? I told you that was the truth,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her against him. \"We\u0027ll find out soon enough, I\u0027m afraid,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow night the full moon would be here. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-of-the-wolves-vampire-hunters-1/page-17.html","bookId":2698,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM"}
