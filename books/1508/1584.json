There were a total of ten pillars, each of them looking grand. And in the center of the hall was a regal woman. She wore a golden red phoenix gown, each strand of silk spun from blue snow gold. It was resistant to water and fire, and even sabers and swords would find it difficult to slash through.

At that time, she had been the proudest daughter of heaven within the Marvel Blue Nation. Her talent was outstanding and she had a variation bloodline. Moreover, her appearance was fantastic too.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBefore that, Marvel Blue Nation had held a martial meeting involving all heroic young elites at the Divine Sea realm. In the end, Naye had been the one to emerge as champion. She had earned the attention and praise of the Marvel Blue Emperor and had entered the imperial palace afterwards. Along the way, she gained more and more favor, her rank increasing until she was finally titled as the Empress.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis grace was due to the advantages that the Marvel Blue Emperor had gained after taking Naye’s primordial yin.

The World King realm was simply far too difficult to reach.

In the past, within the Divine Realm, there were some Great World King Holy Lands like the True Martial Holy Lands who only had a single World King leading their sect. 50,000 years ago, the Verdant Feather Holy Lands had also been a Great World King Holy Land but their Holy Land only had two World Kings, one of them Tian Mingzi and the other one the old Verdant Feather World King. If they had more World Kings then the Verdant Feather Holy Lands wouldn’t have suffered such a miserable fate after Tian Mingzi’s betrayal so many years ago.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eImperial Concubine Moon was well aware of the World Kings in the Marvel Blue nation.

As for Chief Eunuch Wei, he was only loyal to the Marvel Blue Emperor and also maintained neutrality in the struggle for succession. Even though Lord Snow and Lord Shen had done everything in their power to try to win over Eunuch Wei, even delivering to him all sorts of heavenly materials, Eunuch Wei had refused all offers and had returned all gifts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eImperial Concubine Moon suspected that all of this was arranged by the old Emperor.
