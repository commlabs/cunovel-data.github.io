Just when he\u0027d begun to open up, she went ahead and spoiled it by speaking without thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch thoughtless chatter. She cringed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like Aidan,” he finished for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis comment took her aback. The look on his face was calm but not cold, and her relief was profound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aidan always hated playing the Campbell, too,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t smiling, but he was speaking, and it gave her courage to press him. “Do you ever think about him?” He was quiet. The only sound was their horses\u0027 hooves in the gravel of the drover\u0027s road. Geese called overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she listened for it, she could hear the hiss of the sea in the far distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when nerves once again began to chill her blood, he spoke. “There isn\u0027t a day goes by that I don\u0027t think about my brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” she said quietly. Such an understatement. Of course he\u0027d think of Aidan. Every day. But did he blame her for it? He\u0027d endured such pain. His whole family, such pain. She blamed herself. He must damn her as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut would he speak of it? Never. He only stared, silent accusation in his eyes. She\u0027d lived for thirteen years with the guilt, and she refused to keep it in a moment longer. It needed to erupt, here and now, to the surface. “I know it\u0027s my fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s no\u0027 your fault,” he said, his voice flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, it was my fault.” As she brought her darkest thoughts to light, she realized the words couldn\u0027t come fast enough. So much time had passed; she needed desperately to talk about it. “I dared you boys to climb the chimney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou must blame me for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ree… “ He scrubbed a hand over his face. “Ree, I can\u0027t speak of this now. If you must talk, talk to me of the Aberdeen quays. If there were any ships newly docked, we must—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I want to talk about this, Cormac.” She\u0027d rather have his shouts of anger, of hatred, anything but his dreadful silences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe halted his horse, and she fumbled to bring her mount to a stop. She turned in the saddle to find his eyes flat and steady on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I agreed to come help you,” he said. “And that is all I agreed to.” His brooding hurt her, and now it was beginning to anger her as well. She would hear him give voice to his accusations, hear his sharp words, if she had to provoke them herself. “We have to talk about this.” He merely looked at her blankly, and her fury erupted. Marjorie swung off her horse and stalked to him. She felt the words begin to boil from her and did nothing to stop them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to talk about this, but instead you just glare at me. You\u0027re like a silent, glowering man of… of stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these years!” She slapped his horse\u0027s belly just behind Cormac\u0027s calf, and the animal skittered beneath him. He swung off and stared, standing still as granite before her, silent as stone. It made her want to rave. “All these years and never a word from you. I was left to wonder, for years. I felt like some… some pathetic spy, forced to skulk in the shadows, begging word of you from your sisters, gathering news from town.” The memory of it brought her emotions to a fever pitch. But still he remained quiet, and his silence dragged words from her lips she\u0027d never dreamed she\u0027d utter. She knew she\u0027d regret airing such secret, shameful thoughts, yet she couldn\u0027t seem to stanch her outburst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped closer to Cormac, until they stood, both ramrod stiff, mere inches apart. “It\u0027s like I disappeared that day. You were my… my… “ She faltered at the sharp pain in her chest. He\u0027d been her what? Her dearest friend forever? Her treasured knight and protector? The boy she thought she\u0027d wed? Her one true love? “You were my friend…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just looked at her mutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears stung her eyes. Such pique, such humiliation, such agony clenched her chest, bringing her breath in short gasps. She cast off what last scraps of dignity she had left. She slapped her hands at his chest. “Say it! Just say it, Cormac! Say you hate me. Tell me once and for all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands gripped her shoulders, and she realized she was trembling. Slowly she dared to look up, fearing what she\u0027d see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were intense, the blue subsumed by gray, like clouds over a stormy sea. “Ree,” he rasped, and something in her slackened. “Och, Ree, it\u0027s not you I blame. Can\u0027t you see? I bear the shame of that day.” She shook her head sharply, for once speechless. It was her fault. Naughty, willful, sweet, darling Aidan kidnapped. It was unthinkable. And it had been all her fault. She trembled, shaking her head harder. Her fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hush, lass,” he whispered. He cupped a hand to her cheek, stilling her. Gently, Cormac touched his forehead to hers. “I could never hate you,” he said, his voice the barest whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt his words, his touch, relief swamped her, melting something deep inside. Marjorie wilted toward him. Her breasts brushed against his hard chest, and relief changed like quicksilver into another thing entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesire shocked through her, sharp and hot. Her knees buckled, and she grabbed Cormac\u0027s arms to steady herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feel of his hard muscles in her hands only intensified the feverish buzzing throughout her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, she\u0027d needed to purge the words that had festered for so long inside. But now she needed to release an entirely different demon, something that had haunted her for years. She wanted Cormac. She\u0027d always wanted him near, but now that she was a woman, that craving had transformed into something hotter, darker, more powerful. She wanted to give herself to him, to make her body an offering, just for him. The desire stole the air from her lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath was warm on her face, his mouth a whisper away from hers. Kiss him. She could kiss him. She slid her hands up his hard arms, stroked them up his neck. A fantasy flashed in her mind: Cormac, naked above her. What would it be like to lie beneath him? She\u0027d seen his chiseled arms; they\u0027d flex as he held himself over her. She\u0027d kiss and bite that strongly corded neck. The thought made her gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, he tried to pull away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost let him. But the residual fury and shame that had been simmering, battling deep within, caught into a rapid boil, making her feel as though her heart would roil from her chest. She grabbed his shoulders, flexing her fingers into rock of muscle and bone. “Cormac,” she said, her voice a scold, a plea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to stop breathing. He held himself stiffly before her. She\u0027d surely scandalized him, but Marjorie felt beyond fear, beyond shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cormac,” she breathed. She felt his muscles slacken beneath her fingers. “Cormac, I want you… I want you to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hush.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed the words she\u0027d been ready to say, wondering if she\u0027d later regret or be grateful for the discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ree, lass, we… “ He lowered his head, whispering into her hair. “ This… this cannot be.” This… them. He was right. There was too much between them. Too much fault, too much blame. Much too horrifying a history. Cormac might say he didn\u0027t hate her, but she couldn\u0027t believe he didn\u0027t bear some small kernel of contempt in a distant corner of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could never have him. Because, on some level, never would he fully accept her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie nodded mutely. She might never have him, but she could steal something of this moment instead. She tucked herself into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze for a moment, but then his arms folded around her as effortlessly as a puzzle piece falling into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered in a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her carefully, and she let her gaze drift to the distance. They were close to the coast, and she stared blindly at a faraway and fathomless gray sea diluting into gray skies above. She thought of Cormac\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood there for a time, in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac spoke finally, and his low voice reverberated in her chest, soothing her. “Some mornings, when I set off in my boat, I wonder what it would be to go and not turn back. Just keep going. Sailing away, with Scotland at my back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused for a time, and she remained utterly silent, wanting the moment never to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you ken,” he said finally, “that here we\u0027re closer to Scandinavia than we are to London? If you sailed straight from here, you\u0027d land in Norway. And sometimes I do set off, and for a time, I don\u0027t turn back, thinking I\u0027ll find some icy rock where I can live out the rest of my days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you always turn back,” she said, subdued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye. So far I\u0027ve always turned back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away then, and this time she let him, with more peace in her heart than she\u0027d known in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ease my mind, Cormac.” She wasn\u0027t convinced he didn\u0027t blame her. Deep in Cormac\u0027s heart, he surely held her accountable. But he at least cared enough to try to make her feel better. “You ease me, and it\u0027s always been thus.” She might not have believed his words, but she\u0027d take them. For now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey handed their tired mounts off at the Broad Street mews and headed toward her uncle\u0027s Aberdeen town house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie was stiff from the day\u0027s ride, but she saw from the corner of her eye that Cormac walked with as much fluid ease as ever. He seemed aware of everything around him, and she wondered once more what he\u0027d been like as a soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the house, and he paused on the street to stare up at it. Her uncle\u0027s home was much the same as it\u0027d been thirteen years ago: a stone facade harled white with lime, black-painted window sashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark cloud passed over Cormac\u0027s features. He\u0027d not been back to her uncle\u0027s since the day Aidan was taken. She followed his eyes up to the second-story window. Her stomach turned, remembering the last time they\u0027d stood together at that window, looking down at a cart full of sweeps below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come,” she said quietly, touching his arm. Ghosts abounded in the old house. He\u0027d best inure himself to them now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-10.html","bookId":2656,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM"}
