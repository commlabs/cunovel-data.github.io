Staking out a musician suspected of stealing a demo tape should be a piece of pan dulce. But his attention wanders just long enough for fiddle player Julie Kearnes to be gunned down before his eyes. He should just back away and let the cops investigate, but backing away has never been Tres\u0027s strong point. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe missing demo and Julie\u0027s murder are just two of the problems besetting Miranda Daniels, a pint-sized singer with Texas-sized talent. She\u0027s the prize in a tug-of-war between two music hotshots who want to manage her career. One has a habit of making bad things happen to people he doesn\u0027t like. The other has just vanished without a trace. As Tres looks into the dirty dealings surrounding Miranda, it becomes clear he\u0027s stepped into a rattlesnakes\u0027 nest of greed, double cross, and murderâ€”and he may be the next to be snakebit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM"}
