As she waited, she paced the living room. When she heard a loud knock at her front door, she rushed to answer it—and found Troy Davis standing there, looking grim and hard-faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you hurt?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded angry, as he had every right to be. What an irrational, irresponsible thing she’d done in calling him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m…shaken up,” she told him, hoping that would be enough to explain why she’d behaved so illogically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait here,” he said and left her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith lowered herself into her favorite rocker. She sat there for long moments, unmoving, not knowing what to think or why someone had targeted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was obviously the case. She’d done her best to ignore the fact, pretend this couldn’t be happening. Now, whoever this person was, he’d come back, bolder and even more aggressive. After the initial break-in, he—or she—had spray painted her garage. Now—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s clear evidence of someone outside your bedroom window,” Troy said sternly as he came through the front door. “Deputy Walker saw footprints in the snow.” His tone was almost…accusatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith looked up at him and blinked, bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy’s nod was curt and professional as he prepared to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Faith sensed his hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you lock the dead bolts before you went to bed?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe confirmed that she had. “I also purchased a pair of old work boots from Goodwill and set them on the porch. I bought the largest size I could find—fourteen. Then I added a huge dog dish and a bone, so it would look as if I have a dog.” She figured that since she was pretending she had a dog, she might as well make him big. Her son and daughter had found her antics amusing. Troy apparently didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you get a real security system?” he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat she hadn’t done. This was a rental house and she had a six-month lease. She hoped to buy a home within the next few months. It seemed a waste of time and money to invest in a security system when she didn’t intend to live here much longer. And she didn’t feel an alarm system was the landlord’s responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I recommend you do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy turned to leave again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrightened, she didn’t want to be alone, but she didn’t know how to stop him. “Why are you so angry?” she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy’s back was to her. He held himself stiff, and then she saw his shoulders deflate as he faced her. He didn’t seem to have an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was wrong of me to call you. I apologize, I really do.” She didn’t remind him that he’d been the one to make that suggestion. It had stayed there, in her mind, like a thorn caught on a piece of fabric. In her weakened state she’d done what she’d wanted to all along and now regretted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill Troy didn’t speak, didn’t move or give even a hint that he’d heard her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I realize I shouldn’t have….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe accepted her answer with a curt nod. “You’ve made it plain you don’t want me in your life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat rose in her cheeks, embarrassing her even more. “Yes, I know. I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why, when you felt you were in danger, did you reach out to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was obviously determined to make this difficult. She told him the truth, since she couldn’t come up with any other explanation. “I feel safe with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared across the room at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt awkward to be sitting while he loomed over her, even if he was on the other side of the room. Faith stood abruptly. She hated to let him see how upset she was by this latest disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need some coffee,” she said, knowing there was no point in going back to bed now. “Would you like some, Troy?” she asked, refusing to allow his anger to affect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t sound as if he meant that, so she proceeded into the kitchen, immeasurably pleased when he came, too, a few paces behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have the names of a couple of companies who install security systems,” he said. “I’ll have Megan pass them on to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith continued to prepare the coffee. “I’d appreciate that. Thank you, Troy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed on the verge of leaving again. She resisted the urge to stop him, although she didn’t want to be alone. No, it was more than that. She wanted Troy with her. She needed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw the TV report about the cave and the skeleton on that Seattle station,” she said conversationally. “I hear everyone in the area’s talking about it. I hope all this media attention hasn’t caused your office any problems.” The reporter had started all kinds of speculation, and as a result Kitsap County seemed to be alive with rumors, some of them pretty ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy didn’t answer, but he didn’t walk away, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over at him, waiting for a response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mayor Benson isn’t happy about it,” he finally said. “Neither am I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It puts a lot of pressure on you and your staff, doesn’t it?” She brought a mug to the kitchen table and set it down while the coffee filtered into the pot. “Is that the reason you’re so cranky?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain he didn’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or does it have to do with Will Jefferson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did see us, didn’t you?” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more he declined to respond, but she went on as if he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy remained stoic. “I didn’t know the two of you were seeing each other,” he said tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As it happens, we aren’t.” She went on to explain that she’d run into Will at the restaurant. If her explanation satisfied him, he didn’t say. He seemed determined to keep her out of his life. Well, that was what she’d wanted, wasn’t it? What she’d asked for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coffee gurgled behind her, and the slow dripping sound came to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s none of my business who you have dinner with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True, but I felt you should know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded as though acknowledging the information. That was encouraging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure I can’t talk you into having coffee with me? It’s almost four, and there probably isn’t enough time to go back to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hovered uncertainly in the kitchen doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is that such a difficult decision?” Faith asked, half joking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to hide her disappointment. “I understand.” Thankful for an excuse to turn away, she filled her mug and added cream. When she turned back, she discovered that Troy had taken a few steps into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Before I do, I want you to tell me again what happened tonight. Start with the fact that someone was at your bedroom window.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sipped her coffee, letting the warmth seep through her. “Yes. I heard the footsteps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You heard noise out by the garage on another occasion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, there was that spray-painting incident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has there been anything since?” he asked. “Before tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that I’m aware of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you should be aware,” he said in a brusque voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith exhaled slowly, unaccustomed to dealing with Troy when he was angry. This was a side of him she wasn’t familiar with. Troy Davis had never revealed a temper in her presence, not in the past and not recently. Until tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I probably should keep closer tabs on the garage and the house, too,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you should.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re making me feel foolish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy ignored the comment. “Have the interior security system installed, and ask Grace and Cliff to place a motion light above the garage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do that at the first opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t put it off,” Troy warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, but didn’t meet her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night, Troy,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long moment he didn’t say anything. “I appreciate knowing you’re not involved with Will Jefferson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why’s that?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy looked down at the floor. “He’s not a good match for you, Faith.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So who do you think is a good match for me?” she pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Troy Davis didn’t hesitate. His eyes met hers. “We both know the answer to that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned forward expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s me, Faith. It’s always been me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill Jefferson glanced at his watch. It was Saturday night, and he’d made reservations at D.D.’s on the Cove. The restaurant was one of the nicest in town and he intended to impress Shirley Bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d seen each other twice now. Once for coffee at Mocha Mama’s, when she’d brought her daughter. The meeting hadn’t gone badly. With Tanni there, Shirley had been relaxed and easygoing. Shaw and Tanni had bantered back and forth, and they’d all laughed. He’d enjoyed it, somewhat to his surprise, and he could tell that Shirley had, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir second date wasn’t technically a date, either. They’d met by accident late one Sunday afternoon outside the mall. Will had been at loose ends and apparently she had, too. He’d invited her to the movies. The day was dreary and cold, and it’d been an offhand suggestion. He’d been delighted—and astonished—when she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ate popcorn. She didn’t. As the credits started to roll he offered to take her to dinner. He was eager to discuss the movie, which was a complicated drama about the meaning of identity, real and fake. However, as soon as they left the theater, Shirley seemed to find it essential to get home. He let her go but spent the next few days wondering how to proceed with her. It might have worked out better if Tanni had been with her that night, too. One thing was apparent—at least to him. Shirley was frightened to death of falling in love again. Will hoped he’d be the man to allay her fears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he wanted a relationship with Shirley, he’d need to be patient, gentle, persistent. Her nervousness around him had puzzled him at first—but it meant she was aware of him. That gratified Will because he was certainly aware of her. She might be just the woman to tame his restless spirit….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter their movie date, Will had bided his time. Seven restless days later, he’d risked phoning her. He had a good excuse—another of her pieces had sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain he offered to deliver the check, and again she’d refused. But she’d come to the gallery the next day. She seemed distracted and a bit troubled, and he suggested it might help to talk about her problems. He’d felt her hesitation, but in the end she’d agreed to meet him at D.D.’s for dinner on Saturday night. Will had been walking on air ever since. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/92-pacific-boulevard-cedar-cove-9/page-17.html","bookId":1951,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM"}
