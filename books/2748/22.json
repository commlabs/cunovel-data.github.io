I should have realized as soon as we got back. I should have recognized it on the rooftop. I should have…I\u0027m an idiot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, Cam,\" Liz soothed. \"You were all…concussiony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said, even though it didn\u0027t help as much as it should have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the etching in the ancient book. Every new student in the history of our school had heard the story of Gillian Gallagher and stared at that very image, but that day I didn\u0027t look at President Lincoln or the dozens of men who stood around him. I didn\u0027t even look at the young woman with the sword, who was moving through the ballroom with more grace and strength than a hoopskirt was ever supposed to allow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I looked at the man on the floor, a pistol falling from his limp hand, the empty scabbard at his side. This time I stared at the tiny emblem I\u0027d seen a million times in the sword\u0027s hilt, barely visible next to Gilly\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" I said softly, shifting the book to better catch the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz read the caption out loud: \"Gillian Gallagher slays Joseph Cavan, founder of the Circle of Cavan. Virginia, December, 1864.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She killed him with his own sword,\" Bex said in awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I dropped a satellite photo onto the open book. \"The Circle of Cavan attempt to kidnap Macey McHenry, Massachusetts, present day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the Circle of Cavan…\" Liz started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is alive and well,\" Bex finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my roommates. \"And they want our friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew the first attempt to kill President Lincoln had really happened. I\u0027d walked by the sword and thought of Gilly a dozen times a day for years, but before that moment Gilly\u0027s story had seemed like some fabulous dream. So, standing in the library, the fire crackling beside us, I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that we\u0027d just seen a dragon in the lake, a ghost in the labs. An ancient evil was alive in the world. I knew that Gilly had won the battle in the ballroom that night, and almost immediately she\u0027d started her school, maybe because she understood the war was far from over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think they\u0027re after Macey because she\u0027s…\" Liz started. \"You know…\" She dropped her voice to a whisper. \"Gilly\u0027s descendant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the day, more than a year before, when my mother had shared that information. And when I looked at Bex, the expression on our faces said the exact same thing: Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people on the roof had reason to hate the school and reason to hate Gilly. Macey was the last true Gallagher Girl—their best chance at real revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the satellite photo again, the grainy black- and-white image that had been on my mind for weeks, and I thought about what Bex and Aunt Abby had said: The woman on the roof had been too good at her job to wear a ring that would allow her to be identified. But now I knew that\u0027s exactly why she\u0027d worn it. I thought of the look on Abby\u0027s face as I\u0027d studied that image in her room, and I realized my aunt had known that all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in a long time, a lot of things made sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that didn\u0027t mean I had to like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that point on, everything—and I do mean everything— about our school looked different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gallagher Academy history section of the library? Full of books that didn\u0027t tell the whole story. That painting of Gilly standing at a window, staring across our walls? Now I had a whole different idea of what our school\u0027s founder had feared seeing in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the week, I hadn\u0027t heard a word my teachers had said without reading between some imaginary line, biting back some question that I knew they would probably never answer: Who, exactly, were the Circle of Cavan? What did they want? Where had they been for the last hundred and fifty years? And, most important, as Liz and Bex fell into step beside me on our way to dinner that Friday night, what were we supposed to tell Macey?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause, believe it or not, \"Oh, by the way, you know the guy Gilly killed? Well, I guess he\u0027s still got friends who are really ticked off about it, and they\u0027re trying to take their revenge out on you. Oh, and did we mention that you\u0027re Gilly\u0027s great-great-granddaughter, and that\u0027s why you were admitted to the school in the first place?\" was harder to work into everyday conversation than you might think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is khabar ko kisi kitab ke andar daal dein, ya aisa kuch?\" Liz whispered as we practiced our Hindi and ate our macaroni and cheese (the gourmet kind); and yet, as much as I appreciated Liz\u0027s flash cards, I didn\u0027t think planting the news in Macey\u0027s textbook was the best way to tell her the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usse apne pari war ke panch jani dushmano ke naam puchain aur phir ek naam aur jord dein.\" Bex offered, but I shook my head because the \"Hey, Macey, just when you thought no one could hate your family more than you do\" option didn\u0027t seem like the way to go either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth of the matter is, we might know fourteen different languages, but when it comes to breaking bad news, not even a Gallagher Girl can always find the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I said slowly and in English, despite the teachers that roamed the Grand Hall making sure our Hindi had the accent we were all trying to master, \"maybe we shouldn\u0027t…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her?\" Liz asked, reading my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t like keeping secrets, which, given my chosen profession, is strange but true. But I remembered the way I had felt on my first elevator ride from Sublevel Two—that there are some secrets we keep because we can\u0027t bear to let them out, and some because it\u0027s better to keep them in. I looked at my two best friends and wondered which kind we were keeping now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d want to know,\" Bex said simply, and I nodded, not surprised, but glad to hear it all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I…\" Liz whispered and leaned closer. \"I think…\" she stammered again, and I could tell that Liz the genius knew that the more information you had—the more data points you could plot—the better your conclusions. But Liz the girl, knew that ignorance is sometimes bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said finally with a shake of her head. \"I wouldn\u0027t want to know. And besides\"—she looked at me, her blue eyes wide—\"if it were best for Macey to know, wouldn\u0027t your mom and Abby and Mr. Solomon and everybody…tell her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate it when she\u0027s right. And unfortunately, it happens a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Bex and Liz staring at me, and I knew that I was the tiebreaking vote. A girl at the senior table held a copy of a newspaper; it rustled as she turned the page. The headline, \"Tuesday\u0027s Presidential Race Too Close to Call,\" screamed louder than the voices of a hundred chattering girls as Macey walked through the doors at the back of the room with the rest of the ninth graders who had stayed late in P\u0026amp;E. She was smiling; she was laughing; the girl by the lake seemed farther away, and yet I knew that she was still inside Macey somewhere, and I really didn\u0027t want to see her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" Macey asked as she took the seat beside me. I didn\u0027t have a clue what to say or how to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, Joe Solomon was the one who answered, \"Pop quiz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, I know some of you aren\u0027t on the CoveOps track of study,\" Mr. Solomon said, glancing down the table at the entire junior class, \"but there are aspects of this life—of this world—from which you can never walk away. Ever. The fact that almost everything you say to almost everyone you love for the rest of your life will be a lie is one of them. So, if you don\u0027t mind a little extra work …\" he said, looking down at Liz, which is kind of like asking me if I didn\u0027t mind an extra dessert, \"plain clothes. Foyer. Twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later I was running down the Grand Stairs, a half step behind Bex and Liz. The adrenaline that only comes from going someplace else, doing something else, being someone else for just a little while was starting to course through me again. Macey was beside me. I didn\u0027t have a clue where we were going, but to be honest, I didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby was standing by the door, smiling a knowing, mischievous smile to everyone who passed. But as Macey and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped toward the door, my aunt\u0027s smile was totally not what we got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arm. That\u0027s what I saw first. An arm blocking the doorway, reaching for Macey\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Aunt Abby said. \"Not a secure location.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Macey a sympathetic shrug and tried to push past. But Abby didn\u0027t budge. \"Oh.\" She looked at me. \"I think you and your mother have an…arrangement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear the retreating footsteps in the blackness outside. I could feel the opportunity slipping away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But—\" I started. I didn\u0027t know if I was pleading with my aunt, or my teacher, or with Macey\u0027s Secret Service shadow, but I knew the situation called for some serious pleading with someone. \"But this is an assignment!\" I blurted. Abby just shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, girls,\" she said. \"Sure\"—she glanced at Macey— \"I\u0027ll take a bullet for you, but that doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ll incur the wrath of Rachel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex and Liz skidded to a stop outside and turned back to us, Bex\u0027s eyes asking what was taking us so long; but Aunt Abby turned away, into the darkness, without a second glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said, running to catch up with Macey. \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"I\u0027m great.\" But she didn\u0027t sound great. Not even a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me you\u0027re talking to,\" I told her. \"I can\u0027t vote, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m…\" This time she really seemed to be thinking about the answer, and I knew there was a chance I\u0027d get the truth instead of the party line. \"I\u0027m mad,\" she said finally, the words echoing down the long empty hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m sick of this.\" She held out the cast that covered her left arm. \"This stupid, dirty, itchy…reminder. But apparently I poll ten points better with it on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m so tired…\" Her voice was softer then, her fight almost gone as she sank to the stairs. \"I am so tired of being Macey McHenry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank onto the stairs beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be worse,\" I tried, hoping my smile didn\u0027t look quite as counterfeit as it felt. \"You could be left-handed,\" I said, pointing to the cast on her left arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey laughed. \"I could be stuck on a campaign bus…with my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could be your mother,\" I tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could be Preston,\" she said with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it for a second. If Macey was going crazy living in the most secure building in the country, with Aunt Abby as her security detail, then the son of a presidential candidate had to be going out of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so ready for this to be over,\" she said as if she\u0027d just admitted her deepest, darkest secret. \"I\u0027m so ready for Tuesday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the moment we\u0027d been waiting for—the opening I\u0027d needed to tell her the truth about what was happening and warn her that it wouldn\u0027t end that quickly— that she wasn\u0027t going to stop being Gilly\u0027s descendant on Wednesday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked, reading my face. I\u0027d come to that corridor to tell her the truth, to warn her, but Macey still had hope that Tuesday might mark the end, and I for one didn\u0027t want to take that away from her too soon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-22.html","bookId":2748,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM"}
