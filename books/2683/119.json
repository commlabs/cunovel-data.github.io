{"id":69306,"no":119,"title":"Page 119","content":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s windier after the explosions and extras are letting makeup assistants wipe fake blood off their faces and a helicopter flies noisily over the scene and an actor who looks like Robert Carlyle shakes the director\u0027s hand and dollies are dismantled and stuntmen congratulate one another while removing earplugs and I\u0027m following Jamie Fields to her trailer, where an assistant hands her a cell phone and Jamie sits down on the steps leading up into the trailer and lights a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy immediate impressions: paler than I remember, still dazzling cheekbones that seem even higher, eyes so blue they look like she\u0027s wearing fake contacts, hair still blond but shorter now and slicked back, body more defined, chic beige slacks stretching over legs that seem more muscular, br**sts beneath a simple velour top definitely implants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl from Makeup wipes strategically placed smudges off Jamie\u0027s face, forehead and chin with a large wet cotton ball and Jamie, trying to talk into the cell phone, waves the girl away and growls \"Later\" as if she really means it. Trying to smile, the girl slinks away, devastated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI position myself on the sidelines, leaning sexily against a trailer parked across from Jamie\u0027s so she\u0027ll have no problem immediately spotting me when she looks up: me grinning, my arms crossed, coolly disheveled in casual Prada, confident but not cocky. When Jamie actually does look up, irritably waving away another makeup girl, my presence-just feet away-doesn\u0027t register. I take off the Armani sunglasses and, simulating movement, pull out a roll of Mentos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been there, done that,\" Jamie whispers tiredly into the cell phone, and then, \"Yeah, seeing is believing,\" which is followed by \"We shouldn\u0027t be talking on a cell phone,\" and finally she mutters \"Barbados,\" and by now I\u0027m standing over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie glances up and without any warning to the person on the other end angrily snaps the cell phone shut and stands so quickly that she almost falls off the stairs leading into the compact white trailer with her name on the door, the expression on her face suggesting: Uh-oh, major freak-out approaching, duck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey baby,\" I offer gently, holding my arms out, head tilted, grinning boyishly. \"Like, what\u0027s the story?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you doing here?\" she growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, hey baby-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ-what are you doing here?\" She\u0027s glancing around, panicked. \"Is this a f**king joke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, cool it, baby,\" I\u0027m saying, moving closer, which causes her to move up the stairs backward, grabbing onto the railing in order not to trip. \"It\u0027s cool, it\u0027s cool,\" I\u0027m saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not cool,\" she snaps. \"Jesus, you\u0027ve got to get the hell out of here-now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute, baby-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re supposed to be in New York,\" she hisses, cutting me off. \"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach out to calm her down. \"Baby, listen, if you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slaps my hands away and backs up onto another stair. \"Get away from me,\" and then, \"What the hell were you doing at Annabel\u0027s last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, hey, wait-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it,\" she says, glancing fearfully behind me, causing me to turn around too, then I\u0027m looking back at her. \"I mean it-leave. I can\u0027t be seen here with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, let\u0027s discuss this in your trailer,\" I\u0027m suggesting gently. \"Let\u0027s talk in the trailer.\" Pause. \"Would you like a Mentos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncredulous, she pushes my hand away again. \"Get the f**k off this set or I\u0027ll call Bobby, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bobby?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Hey baby-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re supposed to be in f**king New York-now goddamnit get the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold my hands up to show her I\u0027m not hiding anything and back away. \"Hey, it\u0027s cool,\" I murmur, \"it\u0027s cool, I\u0027m cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie whirls around and before disappearing into the trailer turns back to shoot me an icy glare. The trailer door slams shut. Inside, someone fiddles with a lock. Then silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of burning rubber is suddenly everywhere, causing a major coughing fit that I ease out of with the help of a couple of Mentos, then I bum a Silk Cut from another cute makeup girl, who looks like Gina Gershon, and then I\u0027m lingering next to other people who might not have noticed me at first, until I move down Westbourne Grove, then down Chepstow Road, then I stop in at a really cool shop called Oguri and after that I spot Elvis Costello at the corner of Colville Road exiting a neo-Deco, turquoise-tiled public rest room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling really injured, trying to formulate a new game plan in order to halt vacuous wandering, I proceed to various newsstands in desperate need of a New York Post or a New York News to check out what course my life is taking back in Manhattan, but I can\u0027t find any foreign papers anywhere, just typical British rags with headlines blaring LIAM: MAN BEHIND THE MYTH Or A DAY IN THE LIFE OF BIJOU PHILLIPS (an article I may or may not appear in, depending on what day) or CHAMPAGNE SALES SOAR AS SWINGING LONDON LEARNS TO PARTY. I stop by a Tower Records after downing a so-so iced decaf grande latte at one of the dozens of Starbucks lining the London streets and buy tapes for my Walkman (Fiona Apple, Thomas Ribiero, Tiger, Sparklehorse, Kenickie, the sound track of Mandela) and then walk outside into the stream of Rollerbladers gliding by in search of parks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-119.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
