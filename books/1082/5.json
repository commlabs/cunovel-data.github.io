{"id":29037,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V.","content":"The fairy little bark, the Bonnibel, swept blithely out into the moonlighted waves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bonnibel tied her lace handkerchief over her head, and wrapped the shawl about her shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Somehow her heart began to grow lighter. This moonlight flitting seemed so sweet and romantic.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her dark-eyed lover sitting opposite lightly swaying the oars[Pg 17] looked handsome as a demi-god to her partial eyes. She trusted him implicitly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The king can do no wrong,\" was her motto.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You shall never regret this step, never, my darling,\" Leslie Dane kept saying to her over and over, as if to soothe his conscience, which perhaps reproached him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Bonnibel answered with a smile every time, \"I never expect to regret it, Leslie, dear.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His rapid strokes of the oar soon brought them to their destination. Brandon was a poor little fishing village consisting only of the rude huts of the fishermen, a little Methodist chapel, and a little parsonage down by the shore rather neater than the rest of the shanties.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here lived the aged minister and his kind old wife. Thither the young artist directed his steps with Bonnibel clinging to his arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fortunately they met no one on the way, and almost before they knew it they stood in the shabby \"best room,\" which served the good man for study, library and parlor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There the minister sat with his books, and the good wife with her knitting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leslie Dane drew the old man aside and they held a brief whispered colloquy. Apparently the young man made everything satisfactory, for in a minute he came back and led Bonnibel forward to breathe those solemn vows which are so quickly cemented but which death alone can sunder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bonnibel was trembling very much, though the hitherto thoughtless child did not in the least realize the magnitude of the step she was taking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She only thought to herself how sweet it would be to be bound by that sacred tie to Leslie Dane, and she quivered from head to foot with pleasure, and with a certain indefinable nervousness she did not begin to understand, while the two old people stared at her in surprise at her radiant beauty and costly dress.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The solemn words were soon spoken, Leslie making the responses firmly, and Bonnibel in a hushed little voice that was scarcely audible. The young man slipped a ring over her finger that he had always worn on his own, the minister blessed them, the good wife kissed the girl with tears in her eyes, for women always weep at a wedding. Then Leslie slipped a generous fee into the old man\u0027s hand, and led his blushing bride away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"God bless you, my darling, and may you always look back to this hour as the happiest one of your life,\" he whispered, as he put her into the little skiff and kissed her beautiful lips with an outburst of passionate tenderness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish you the same happiness, Leslie,\" whispered the happy little bride.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In a little while now we shall be parted,\" said he; \"oh, my Bonnibel, how much easier the parting will be when I know that I am leaving my wife behind me—my wife whom no one can keep from me when I come for her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was a happy thought of yours to bind me thus,\" answered the young bride, softly. \"Now that grim presentiment will[Pg 18] haunt me no more, and Uncle Francis cannot hurt me with his threats or his coldness while I have this precious secret in my heart.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bonnibel,\" he said, anxiously, \"in some moments of defiance you may feel tempted to taunt him by the betrayal of our marriage; but I implore you do not yield to the temptation. More serious consequences may follow than you dream of. Let our secret be a dead secret until I give you leave to proclaim it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will never reveal it, Leslie, I give you my solemn word of honor,\" replied Bonnibel, earnestly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thanks dearest. I only asked the promise because I knew it was for the best. Darling, I shall think of you always while I am absent, and I will write to you very often. Will you write to me sometimes, and let me know that you are well and happy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will write to you often and let you know that I am well; but I can never be happy while I am separated from you, Leslie,\" she said, sadly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bonnibel, how beautiful you look in that white dress,\" he said, changing the conversation abruptly, seeing that it pained her. \"You were the finest bride I ever saw.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is a pretty dress,\" she said, looking down at the soft mass of muslin and lace; \"but I little thought when I put it on for dinner this evening that it would be my bridal dress. I shall always love this dress, Leslie. I will keep it always in memory of to-night.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both were silent after a little while, till Leslie said, abruptly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bonnibel, I wish I knew of what you are thinking so intently.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was hardly thinking at all,\" she said, quickly. \"Some verses were running through my mind that I read this evening in Jean Ingelow\u0027s pretty poems. I hardly understood them then, but they seem to suit my feelings now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me hear them,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I cannot recall them, except the last verse. The poem was called \u0027Divided,\u0027 and the last verse, which is all that I clearly recollect, ran thus:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027And yet I know, past all doubting truly— A knowledge greater than grief can dim— I know as he loved he will love me duly, Yea, better, e\u0027en better than I love him. And as I walk by the vast, calm river, The awful river so dread to see. I say, thy breadth and thy depth forever Are bridged by his thoughts that cross to me.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Beautiful,\" said Leslie, as the full voice, tremulous with newly awakened feeling died away. \"You must always recall those lines when you think of me, my little one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The keel grated on the shore. Leslie looked at his watch in the moonlight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is later than I thought,\" he said, hurriedly, as he helped Bonnibel out upon the shore. \"I have but fifteen minutes to[Pg 19] reach the station. Darling, I must go to-night, though it nearly kills me to leave you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She turned quivering and weeping, to throw herself upon his breast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Darling, you are not afraid to go to the house alone?\" he whispered. \"My time is so short!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no,\" she said. \"But, Leslie, how can I let you go?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Tis but a little while,\" he answered, soothingly. \"Be brave, my precious darling!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He drew her to his heart with a long, despairing embrace, and kissed her passionately.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My little love, my own sweet wife, good-bye!\" he faltered, and was gone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bonnibel threw out her yearning arms as if she would draw him back, then turned and staggered homeward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will be brave,\" she murmured. \"I will try to bear it, but, oh, this pain at my heart.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She opened the gate and went softly up the walk. It was almost midnight, and she began to wonder if the doors would be locked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If they are I shall have to get in through the window,\" she said to herself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But as she stepped on the piazza she saw the front door open and her uncle sitting motionless in his easy chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Poor dear,\" she thought, with a thrill of regretful tenderness, and forgetting herself entirely. \"He has fallen asleep in his chair and they have all forgotten him. I will wake him with a kiss.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He lay with his head thrown back, apparently fast asleep. Gliding softly along, she threw her arm about his neck and, bending over, pressed her sweet lips to his brow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She started back with a shiver and looked at him. The brow she had kissed was cold as ice. Her hand fell down upon his breast and came in contact with something wet and cold. She lifted her hand and saw upon it in the moonlight a dark stain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Uncle!\" she screamed, \"oh, God, uncle, wake up!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That wild scream of agony roused the house. The servants came rushing out, but before they reached her Bonnibel had fallen fainting at her uncle\u0027s feet. The beautiful white dress she had promised to keep in memory of that night was all dabbled and stained in a pool of his life-blood that had dripped down upon the floor.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1786/51979.html","bookId":1082,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:14:43 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:14:43 AM"}
