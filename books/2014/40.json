All was still except for the scuff and tap of servants cleaning up and the groan and heavy thunk of the table being tipped back onto its feet by the combined efforts of three men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As I was telling you, Your Highness,” remarked Hugh to Sapientia in a pleasant voice that carried easily in the hush that now pervaded the hall, “when Queen Athelthyri of Alba was angry with certain of her subjects for fomenting rebellion against her, she set her dog Contumelus over them as their count. And quite a fine count he was, this dog, for it is said that besides wearing a neckband and a gold chain as a mark of his rank, he had a certain gift, that after he barked twice he could speak every third word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf the assembly tittered. Henry did not laugh, and an instant later a rash of barking came from out of doors, hounds singing a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make way!” a man shouted outside. Hanna heard horses, the buzz of voices, and caught a glimpse of movement in the twilight beyond the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Eagles came into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Liath!” Hugh stood up so quickly that his chair tipped over behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the hall, Ivar had to be restrained from bolting forward by Baldwin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanglant took a step forward and then froze. A thin flush of red stained his cheeks. Liath marked him; Hanna saw it by the way her step faltered, and she supposed everyone else saw it, too. He stared at her, his body turned as a flower turns with the sun so he could follow her with his gaze as she strode forward with Wolfhere to the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh muttered words under his breath, Hanna could not make them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two Eagles knelt before the king’s table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wolfhere,” said Henry with such dislike that the old Eagle actually winced. The king gestured. A servingman hastened around the table to give a cup of wine to Liath; she took a draught, then gave the cup to Wolfhere, who drained it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your Majesty,” he began with cup still in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king indicated that Liath should relay her messages first, but he caught her in the act of glancing over her shoulder toward Sanglant, and she stuttered out something meaningless as many among the assembly giggled, or coughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I come from Weraushausen, Your Majesty,” she said, recovering quickly. “I bring this message from Cleric Monica: She will join you with the schola. I bring also capitularies needing your seal, and a letter for Sister Rosvita from Mother Rothgard of St. Valeria Convent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I pray it brings news of Theophanu.” At last Henry deigned to look upon Wolfhere, who had waited patiently under the king’s censure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your Majesty,” Wolfhere said briskly. “I bring news from the south. Duke Conrad sends this message: That he will wait upon Your Majesty before Matthiasmass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why has it taken him so long to come before me after the insult he gave my Eagle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His wife, Lady Eadgifu, died in childbed, Your Majesty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA murmur rolled through the hall, and several women wailed out loud. The king drew the Circle at his breast. “May God have mercy upon her.” He leaned forward to rest a fist on the table. “What of the message you took to the skopos? Is it true that you believe Biscop Antonia did not die in this avalanche we have been told of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She did not die, Your Majesty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have seen her alive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not need to see her to know she still lives—although I do not know how she escaped or where she is now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see. Go on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her Holiness Clementia, skopos and Mother to us all, has passed this judgment on Antonia of Karrone, once biscop of Mainni: that she be excommunicated for indulging in the arts of the malefici. ‘Let neither woman nor man who stand within the Light of the Circle of Unity give her shelter. Let no deacon or frater take her confession or give her blessing until she bring herself before the throne of the skopos and repent of her deeds. She may no longer enter into a church and take mass. Any who consort with her or give her shelter will also be excommunicate.’ These were the words of the skopos.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A harsh judgment,” said Henry, musing, then smiled grimly. “But a just one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is not all the news I bring,” continued Wolfhere, and the king looked at him expectantly, inclined, perhaps, to look kindly on him for bringing news so favorable to Henry’s interests. He gestured for Wolfhere to go on. “Queen Gertrudis of Aosta is dead, Your Majesty, and in Ventuno King Demetrius lies on his deathbed and has received last rites.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA profound stillness, coming over the face of the king, spread quickly until the hush that pervaded the hall caused even the greyhounds to sink down and lay their heads on their paws. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-40.html","bookId":2014,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM"}
