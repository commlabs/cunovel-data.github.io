He understood very well that it would be impossible to enforce his claim without more satisfactory testimony than his father\u0027s letter. If any one had been cognizant of the transaction between Mr. Davis and his father it would have helped matters, but no one, so far as he knew, was even aware that his father had possessed so large a sum as five thousand dollars. Had Captain Rushton inclosed the receipt, that would have been sufficient, but it had probably gone to the bottom with him. But, after all, was it certain that his father was dead? It was not certain, but our hero was forced to admit that the chances of his father\u0027s being alive were extremely slender. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Finding himself utterly at a loss, he resolved to call upon his firm friend, Squire Paine, the lawyer.
