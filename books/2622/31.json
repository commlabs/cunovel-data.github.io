Around 2:30 am—late at night or early in the morning depending on your perspective. I was standing on the porch having a cigarette, since I don’t allow smoking inside the store. Too much of a fire hazard, what with all those old dry books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon was full and fat and sort of orange as it perched above the sports bar across the street, looking as if it were a basketball teetering on the rim of the hoop. I felt a powerful urge within me to jump up and slam dunk the moon right over into tomorrow, and right as I’m thinking about that metaphor a large dog climbed up the steps and walked into the store, just as casual as can be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around the street for the owner, but no one was in sight. I stubbed out my cig, and followed the dog inside. She was sitting in front of the cash register, as if waiting for me. I walked around the counter, wondering what to do. Call the cops? Or was it the fire department who handles pets, or only the ones stuck in trees and stuff?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pooch turned to face me, just siting there, waiting. She wanted something from me, I was certain, but I had no idea what. A doggie treat? She seemed to expect me to recognize her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know whose dog she was, and had never seen her around town. She wasn’t wearing a collar. But something made me trust the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come here, girl,” I said, bending down. She eagerly came towards me, and licked my face and sniffed my crotch as I ruffled the scruff of her neck and stroked her back. “Didn’t you read the sign on the door? No Dogs Allowed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t really mind. I like dogs, a lot in fact. I just don’t want them in my store. I was losing some customers by not allowing dogs—people out walking their dogs used to stop in and browse when I welcomed pets. But one night a man came in with a doberman and the damned creature lifted his leg on two shelves full of hardcovers. Couple hundred dollars worth of damage, and I didn’t even find out until after they’d left the store. Not even an apology. After that, the sign went up on the door. I figure I’m saving money in the long run, and who knows, maybe before I was losing customers who were afraid of dogs, who now felt welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe barked twice, as if to get my attention, and then began to howl. I clapped my hands over my ears and stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quiet there, you’ll wake the dead with that racket!” I stared down at the beast. “I should change the sign to read: No Dogs Aloud, but you couldn’t read it anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, as if to disagree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you could read it, then why’d you come in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe disappeared into the back of the store. Had she come here to get a book to read? I wondered if I should follow her, wondering what damage she might be doing to the stock back there, but just as I was about to set off after her she reappeared. She had a book in her jaws, which she placed at my feet. I picked it up and wiped the slobber off on my jeans. Women who run with the wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at her, and her lips pulled back, revealing her large sharp teeth. She was grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like I was in an X-Files episode or some horror movie. She’d run with the wolves, and now was one. I wondered if she were one of my customers. Instinctively I wanted to reach out and pat the top of her head, comfort her by saying “It’s all right,” but I didn’t think it was appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I put the book down on the counter and looked out the still-open door at the dark night. “Kansas,” I said, “I’ve a feeling this isn’t Toto anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf and I sat on the front steps as I smoked another cig and tried to think of what to do. Or at least, what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I kept trying to think of ways to cure her, since I’d fallen into the kinds of thinking that assumed that was why she had come to me. But as I looked at her, sitting next to me, I got to wondering more. Was there anything wrong with her being a werewolf? Maybe she’d come to me because I knew her, or because she knew I’d understand. I had no idea how it had happened, whether she’d wanted it or not. She didn’t seem in any distress or anything, so why fix something that wasn’t broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough with canines, one did have them fixed as a preventative measure . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the smoke drift upwards. There was just a tiny sliver of moon peeking over the edge of the building, like the slivers of moon on my fingernails. I looked over at Wolf. Would she turn back into a woman as soon as that sliver disappeared? But no—just because we no longer saw the moon didn’t mean it had set. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered about clothes. Would she have any when she changed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t help wondering how long it had been since I’d seen a live naked woman. Not that I don’t practice what I preach. It had just been a long time is all. I tried to remember exactly how long and gave up before I became depressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to imagine what it would be like if it was me instead of her who’d wound up as a werewolf. And as I tried to figure out how I’d feel, I realized how much I’d changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d grown older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d become such a goody two shoes. I no longer went to rallies, ACT UP meetings, no longer did any civil disobedience of any sort. I didn’t have the time, struggling to keep the bookstore open and alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d turned into a solid, conservative businesswoman—a model citizen. I was a member of the chamber of commerce. I paid my taxes like a good little girl and didn’t even complain all that much about how they were being spent. About the most radical thing I did anymore (besides run an all-night feminist bookstore) was sign petitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was disgusted with myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d betrayed all my earlier dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, I shoved my hand in her mouth. “Bite me,” I said. What was I thinking? Was I even thinking? As the words flew from my mouth I realized I should’ve had her bite me someplace else, that I’d be crippled with only one hand to use. Still, sometimes sacrifices must be made for the greater good and I didn’t pull my hand back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for me to reconsider, then bit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched, but it was only a pinch, and then a prick, like having your blood type tested at the doctor’s office, the kind of prick you had to give yourself in biology lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the world dropped away in a flash of pain as her teeth broke skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what my body did. I think I thrashed about and convulsed. But my mind was numb to anything but pain. That pain was liberating, setting me free from my body. I looked down at myself, sitting on the porch of my bookstore with a wolf biting my hand, and I thought: Well, why don’t I do something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when I snapped back into my body. She released my hand and I stared down at the neat puncture points her teeth had made. I was calm and detached about the blood that leaked from them; my mind kept repeating one phrase: Why don’t I do something? I’d been feeling this way for a while, I only now realized. Maybe this is why the werewolf was here, to wake me up from this stupor, reclaim me as a lesbian avenger. Not a loup garou but a lesbian garou. My mind began to race through imagined scenes, the power we would have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was already beginning to act like a werewolf: the bleeding was slowing as my new super-fast metabolism began to kick in. I figured I could get to liking this. I’d even get a humane fur coat out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I had still to see how painful the Change would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch the store,” I told her, then went upstairs to get gauze and neosporin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got downstairs again, the wolf was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn its place was a naked woman. “How do you feel?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked her over: mid-thirties, dark brown hair that hung to her shoulders, slightly overweight but seemingly unselfconscious about her body. Here she was, buck naked in a used bookstore, and she was able to hold a conversation. I liked that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand throbbed. It felt swollen big as my thigh. “I’ll live,” was all I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a part of my mind whispered that I would, that I would heal from any ordinary wound, heal from anything but silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and before I could help myself—I generally had more presence of mind, but perhaps I was too flustered at seeing a naked woman again, after so long, or maybe I was just rusty from lack of practice flirting—I blurted out, “Why me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the coffee table book she’d been leafing through and put it down on the counter. “It was the wolf. Instinct. My feet just knew where to take me. I guess they knew you’d be able to handle this.” She looked away from me, as if suddenly shy, and then added, “The wolf is not a solitary creature.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was she asking of me? Or had I already decided, when I’d asked her to bite me? Was I now part of her pack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked to me like I was the alpha female. So I took charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Human’s aren’t either,” I said, and reached for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t bother to open the store the next day. For one thing, it had been so long since I’d had someone in bed with me, I didn’t want to get out of it. And I’d just have to close up at sundown, anyway, which would confuse people. What if I couldn’t get rid of all my customers in time, I wondered, if I turned into a snarling bitch right in front of them. Every store needs a gimmick these days, but that just didn’t seem right for mine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-with-the-pack/page-31.html","bookId":2622,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:49 PM"}
