(1)","content":"\u003cp\u003eWhen Tang Xian realized that Zhou Weixing was actually about to marry all three of her precious darlings, she was instantly enraged.\u0026nbsp;She had caused a huge ruckus at Heavenly Jewel Island, cursing Shangguan Tianyue senseless.\u0026nbsp;This was the reason why she was standing apart from him just now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Shangguan Tianyue had an exalted status, Tang Xian was the woman he had loved the most in all his life, and he had always felt rather guilty towards her.\u0026nbsp;Thus, although Tang Xian caused a huge ruckus, there was nothing he could really do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Zhou Weiqing ascended the island, Tang Xian and Shangguan Tianyue had immediately received word and so they had both come out.\u0026nbsp;She missed her daughter, but she was also enraged by the fact that the little bastard Zhou Weiqing was going to take advantage of all three of her baby girls.\u0026nbsp;Whenever she thought of this, she was so angry she had to hit something…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, we now have before us the sight of the mother-in-law drubbing the son-in-law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was rather astonished by Tang Xian’s sudden attack, but as a clever person he immediately knew what was going on.\u0026nbsp;Shangguan Bing’er let out a startled cry, but Zhou Weiqing didn’t dodge or block.\u0026nbsp;He allowed Tang Xian to land that palm on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sickening thud sound rang out, followed by a dense blast of Fire Attribute energies exploding. That wasn’t all. Tang Xian was by nature an impulsive woman. When she saw how Zhou Weiqing neither dodged nor blocked, she instantly took it the wrong way. \u003cem\u003eIs this little brat belittling me?\u0026nbsp;I still have a nine-Jeweled cultivation base!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage filled her heart, and so her next attack showed very little mercy.\u0026nbsp;She struck out with both palms, landing a total of eighteen blows across Zhou Weiqing’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyue had just learned that Zhou Weiqing had broken through to become a Heavenly King, and so he wasn’t too worried about Tang Xian’s attacks.\u0026nbsp;For a mother-in-law to whack her son-in-law a few times wasn’t that big of a deal.\u0026nbsp;If this resulted in Tang Xian calming down, it would actually be a good thing.\u0026nbsp;And so, he didn’t intervene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once Tang Xian actually attacked, Shangguan Tianyue’s eyes bulged out.\u0026nbsp;She was holding back nothing at all!\u0026nbsp;Her two hands blazed such scorching energy that they turned a red-gold color.\u0026nbsp;This was her supreme technique, the Crimson Inferno Palm.\u0026nbsp;It was a type of a technique, but it was an internal technique which accumulated Fire Attribute energies to an extremely dense degree, allowing for an incredibly powerful attack.\u0026nbsp;Not even Shangguan Tianyue would dare to allow her to strike him with this palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xian’er, show mercy!”\u0026nbsp;By the time Shangguan Tianyue reacted and said these words, Tang Xian had already finished unleashing her eighteen palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his heart, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but think disparagingly to himself about his father-in-law. \u003cem\u003eWhat’s the point of saying it now?\u0026nbsp;She already hit me.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er flew over, hugging her mother from behind.\u0026nbsp;Just now, Tang Xian had blocked her and so she didn’t manage to see what sort of technique she used to attack Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;All she had heard was a series of muffled booming sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xian immediately felt some regret after finishing her eighteen palms.\u0026nbsp;She had heard that Zhou Weiqing had reached the nine-Jeweled level and so she didn’t worry too much about her attacks at first.\u0026nbsp;She was one of the first to know that Zhou Weiqing had six Attributes, and so she understood that his cultivation level couldn’t be weak.\u0026nbsp;But, who would’ve thought that the kid would just stand there without even blocking, allowing all eighteen palms to land?\u0026nbsp;Although she didn’t use her full power, her Crimson Inferno Palms were able to melt gold and steel alike.\u0026nbsp;It wasn’t that easy to take!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Zhou Weiqing did next stunned everyone present.\u0026nbsp;After taking all eighteen palms, he continued to smile.\u0026nbsp;Suddenly, he fell down on his knees and kowtowed three times respectfully towards Tang Xian.\u0026nbsp;“Mother-in-law, your humble son-in-law greets you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyue had wanted to go help heal Zhou Weiqing, but his uplifted hand slowly froze in midair.\u0026nbsp;Tang Xian’s eyes bulged out.\u0026nbsp;“A-aren’t you hurt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid didn’t seem to be hurt at all, no matter how she stared at him.\u0026nbsp;His breathing was even, he had a smile on his face, and most shockingly of all… her incredibly hot Crimson Inferno Palms hadn’t even managed to leave a mark on his clothes.\u0026nbsp;But she had clearly sensed her palms exploding into his body!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter finishing his kowtowing, Zhou Weiqing stood up and said honestly, “I wouldn’t dare to be hurt.\u0026nbsp;If I did, I wouldn’t be able to live up to the favor of Xue’er, Fei’er, and Bing’er.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You…” Tang Xian had just calmed down a bit, but upon hearing these words her rage built again.\u0026nbsp;If it wasn’t for Shangguan Bing’er holding her tightly from behind, she would’ve attacked again.\u0026nbsp;“You little son of a bitch!\u0026nbsp;You came here to piss me off, right?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled bitterly.\u0026nbsp;“Mom, I would never dare to piss you off!\u0026nbsp;If you are still angry at me, you can hit me a few more times.\u0026nbsp;Your humble son-in-law wouldn’t dare to dodge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyue ambled over, casting Zhou Weiqing an unhappy glance before saying to Tang Xian, “Should I do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck off already.\u0026nbsp;I’m going to teach this brat a lesson.\u0026nbsp;This is none of your business.\u0026nbsp;You aren’t any better than him.\u0026nbsp;The two of you are birds of a feather.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyue’s jaw dropped at the berating. \u003cem\u003eI was asking for that, wasn’t I?\u0026nbsp;Why the hell did I get involved in you teaching your son-in-law a lesson?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xian charged back towards Zhou Weiqing angrily.\u0026nbsp;“You little son of a bitch, the only thing you ever learned was how to be a playboy.\u0026nbsp;Was my Bing’er not good enough for you?\u0026nbsp;You ended up sleeping your way through half the world.\u0026nbsp;Did you think it was easy for me to give birth to my three daughters?\u0026nbsp;And now, you bastard, you’ve taken all three of them.\u0026nbsp;If you don’t give me a good response right now, I’ll never let you hear the end of it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s heart clenched.\u0026nbsp;He scratched his head, then knelt down once more and said sincerely, “Milady mother-in-law, please allow me to marry Xue’er, Fei’er, and Bing’er.\u0026nbsp;I’ll definitely treat them well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“THIS is your response?”\u0026nbsp;Tang Xiang nearly laughed out of rage.\u0026nbsp;As the saying goes, no one reaches out to slap a face which is smiling at you.\u0026nbsp;The brat had put on a show of being completely filial and obedient.\u0026nbsp;It was as though he was saying, ‘Come and hit me, I definitely won’t fight back or argue with you.\u0026nbsp;As long as you give me your daughters, you can do whatever you want.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s skills in shamelessness had definitely improved by leaps and bounds.\u0026nbsp;Most importantly, he was able to be shameless in such a sincere way!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing nodded sincerely.\u0026nbsp;“Mother-in-law, aside from this response, I don’t know what else I can say.\u0026nbsp;I just hope that you can marry Xue’er, Fei’er, and Bing’er to me.\u0026nbsp;I’ll agree to any request at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xian glared at Zhou Weiqing, but her anger seemed to have subsided a bit.\u0026nbsp;“Any request at all?\u0026nbsp;You said it yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing could tell that she was easing up on him.\u0026nbsp;He hurriedly nodded obediently, as though he was a little chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xian pointed a finger at the nearby Shangguan Tianyue.\u0026nbsp;“Fine.\u0026nbsp;My request is simple.\u0026nbsp;Go over there and kick his ass, and I’ll let my three daughters marry you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh!?”\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing stared stupefied at Tang Xian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTang Xian snorted coldly.\u0026nbsp;“What?\u0026nbsp;Are you afraid or are you unwilling to obey?\u0026nbsp;I’ve wanted to kick his ass for a long time now, but I can’t beat him.\u0026nbsp;If you can beat him up for me, I’ll accept this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing turned to look at Shangguan Tianyue awkwardly. \u003cem\u003eSweet father-in-law, say something!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyue said irritably, “What are you staring at?\u0026nbsp;If you have the courage to offend your superiors, step up!\u0026nbsp;I’ve been wanting to kick your ass as well.\u0026nbsp;You seduced all three of my daughters.\u0026nbsp;Did you think that didn’t piss me off?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at this moment, a stately voice boomed out.\u0026nbsp;“Enough.\u0026nbsp;Haven’t you embarrassed yourselves enough?\u0026nbsp;Come back to the palace, all of you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon hearing this voice, even the enraged Tang Xian toned herself down slightly. This was the voice of Shangguan Tianyang, and Tang Xian still felt several degrees of respect for this Palace Lord of Heaven’s Expanse Palace. She snorted, then pulled Shangguan Bing’er as she headed towards the palace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-258-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-259-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-259-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
