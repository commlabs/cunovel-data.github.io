I only know he’s following from the crunch of the gravel under his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you know you swing your ass when you walk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop, shocked that he’s just said that about my ass. And also a little turned on hearing him talk about my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurned on. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t actually know that I swing my ass when I walk, but that’s beside the point. I scowl at him over my shoulder. “And your point is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No point. Just an observation.” He holds his hands up in surrender, and his eyes crinkle from the smile on his face. “It’s kinda cute is all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cute?” I frown, ignoring the pull I feel for him in my lower half. “I’m not cute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never said you were cute. I said your ass-swinging was cute.” He gives me a wicked grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face goes beet red. Embarrassed, I start walking again, ignoring his soft laughter behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I’ve reached his car, I’m feeling out of sorts. Vulnerable, edgy…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTotally not how I expected to be feeling this morning. Jordan just seems able to throw me off kilter at any given notice. I’ve never known anyone like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd today, things between us have shifted. I’m not really sure where to, or what’s going on, but something is definitely different between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get in the car at the same time. I buckle up as Jordan turns the ignition. The engine is rumbling, ready to go, but we don’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look across at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head is tilted my way, his deep eyes staring at me, and he’s wearing an expression I can’t decipher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I ask, feeling self-conscious. I push my short strands behind my ear, feeling myself heating under his stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, blinking himself free. “Nothing. I’m just really digging this assertive side of you.” A smile. Then he looks behind him and sets the car in reverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m left reeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan digs me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe digs me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, the cold block of ice I carry around in my chest melts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan does most of the talking on the drive to Farmington. I think he’s doing it to keep my mind busy, and off what I’m going to Farmington for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was good until we got about ten minutes away from Farmington. I broke out in a cold sweat, and when we crossed the city limits a few minutes back, my heart went into overdrive. I’m pretty sure a panic attack is on the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes me a moment to realize the car has stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we here?” My eyes are wide and alert like a rabbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A block away. I thought you might want a moment to yourself before we go to her house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It might not be her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him. I know there’s an edge of desperation in my eyes and voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It might not be,” he says slowly. “But if it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, forcing a casualness I don’t feel. “Then I’ve found my mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both stare ahead, sitting in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ready?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan turns the engine on and pulls back out onto the street. A few minutes later he pulls up front a red brick house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to him. “Will you come with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles. “Already was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, I slip my sunglass on and climb out the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitate at the top of the walk. Jordan takes my hand and tugs me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the door, Jordan doesn’t let go of my hand as he leans across me and presses the bell. The scent of his aftershave momentarily soothes me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do I say?” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just ask if Anna Monroe lives here, and we’ll go from there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeeting his eyes, I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I hear footsteps in the hall. A figure approaches the door. My body freezes. Jordan gives my hand a reassuring squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re okay. I’m here,” he whispers softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens, revealing a Chinese lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNope. Not her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it strange that I feel relief at this thought?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s definitely not a trace of Chinese in my pale skin, blonde hair and blue eyes. Unless she’s not Anna Monroe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just need her to confirm this, and then I’m out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I help you?” she asks, eyes moving between Jordan and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was, um—” I clear my throat. “I, um…” Why can’t I get my voice to work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does Anna Monroe live here?” Jordan’s voice come from beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinks from me to Jordan. “Yes,” she answers slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it be possible to speak with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you are…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. My name is Jordan, and this is Mia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifts on the spot, crossing her arms over her chest. “I’m Anna Monroe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhale the breath I didn’t realize I was holding, and then I’m out of there. Turning, and pulling my hand free from Jordan’s, I run down that path away from them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it’s wrong for me to abandon Jordan, but I can’t stop my legs from moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is pounding. Blood is roaring in my ears. And all I want to do is eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd throw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really need to throw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing back into the safety of Jordan’s Mustang, I yank my sunglasses off, and sit on my hands, trying to steady my heart and calm the war raging on inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan gets in the car a few minutes later. He turns to me. “So … she’s not your mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What gave it away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m at an impasse at the moment. I either laugh or cry. I really don’t want to cry in front of Jordan, so laughter it is. It bursts out of me. I know I’m probably coming off as a little crazy, but I can’t seem to stop, or find the will to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally regain control of myself, wiping my eyes dry on my hands, I find Jordan staring at me with an expression on his face that I’ve never seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one has ever looked at me like he is looking at me right now. Like he cares. Really cares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe relaxes his gaze, a wicked grin sliding onto his lips. “You seem to be taking the disappointment well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile has me laughing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, I abandoned you back there.” I gesture, still a little breathless from my crazy laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No worries. Come on.” He starts the car. “Let’s go grab some lunch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFood. Not a good idea for me right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not hungry.” I put my seatbelt on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I am. You can watch me eat.” He flashes me those whites of his, and I’m too dazzled by him to disagree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe end up in a coffee shop that Jordan seems to know well. Apparently, this place make the best Key Lime pie in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll have to take his word on it because eating right now is not a good idea, not while I’m with Jordan. I’m afraid that if I start, I won’t be able to stop, and then I’ll end up exposing a part of myself that I never want anyone to see, especially not him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess it was a waste of time coming all the way out here.” I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Depends on how you look at it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rest my elbow on the table and prop my chin on my hand. “And how would you look at it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans back in his seat. “That it’s one less Anna Monroe on the list. Narrows the odds. Leaves us with two. So that’s a fifty/fifty chance on the next one we pick being your mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr neither are her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’m getting to eat the pie I love. I’d call it a lose/win.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you assess everything that way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darken. “Not everything.” His lips lift with a flirtatious tilt as he leans closer, over the table. He lowers his voice. “Only things that I know are a sure thing. And when I really want something … I get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGulp. Heat infuses my skin, firing off my pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress interrupts our moment, arriving with our coffee and Jordan’s pie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was absolutely, definitely flirting with me then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not complaining. It’s nice to have someone as gorgeous as Jordan flirt with me. I guess what bothers me is that I don’t know what it means for him. Or more so, what I want it to mean for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s your pie?” I ask, watching him dig into it like it’s god made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So good,” he murmurs through a mouthful. The sound is as delicious as he looks. “You wanna try?” He holds out a pie-filled fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re missing out on the best pie you’ll ever taste.” He waggles the fork in front of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, I shake my head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins and puts the fork in this mouth, letting out an over-exaggerated groan of pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a split second, I actually wish I was the fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have serious issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pour some sugar in my coffee. “Thanks for coming with me today. It really means a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re friends. Friends help each other out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re friends?” I tease, unable to help the smile that’s crept on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifts a dark brow. “Hadn’t we already established that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring the cup to my lips and blow on the hot coffee. “I don’t think it had been confirmed, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, consider it confirmed.” He digs his fork in his pie, eyes smiling. “We’re friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith benefits?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly cow, I can’t believe I just thought that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, well … Jordan Matthews. Didn’t expect to ever see you here again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my head and see a guy about Jordan’s height and build, shaved head, arms sleeved with tattoos, heading in our direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes move beyond him, and see two other guys walking behind, both tall and skinny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the corner of my eye, I can see that Jordan’s whole demeanor has changed. His body is rigid, tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air instantly prickles with discomfort, and the sound of Jordan’s fork clattering to the plate makes me jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turn the fuck around and walk away, Donnie,” Jordan hisses, the level of anger in his voice surprises me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonnie lets out a laugh. He grabs a chair from the empty table by us and sits down, his front to its back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn closer inspection, I spy a tattoo on Donnie’s neck. It says Fuck You.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s no way to greet an old friend,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan laughs a hollow sound. “That’s the last thing I’d ever refer to you as.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re breaking my heart here, Matthews.” Donnie slaps a hand over his chest before moving his gaze to me. “And who do we have here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he looks at me sets alarm bells ringing in my head. I’m familiar with the look. I’ve seen it before from Forbes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI curl my fingers together in my lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t answer that.” My eyes shoot up to Jordan’s. He stares at me for a long second, trying to convey something in his eyes that I can’t quite grasp. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trouble/page-22.html","bookId":2000,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM"}
