We’re actually dating.” I glanced toward Caroline, who was covering her mouth with both hands and watching us from worried eyes. “We have been for a couple months.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dating? Are you kidding me?” Noel turned his attention to Caroline, too. “How many dates has he taken you on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at him, obviously not understanding. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled out his hand, encouraging her to talk. “How many times has he taken you out to eat? To the movies? Dancing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not fair.” I shifted toward him, balling my hands into fists. “We couldn’t do any of that shit because of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Whatever. The truth is you’re no better than Sander Scotini.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, that fucker. He just had to go there, didn’t he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage flooded my veins. But what hurt more than hearing he thought I belonged anywhere in the same category as that worthless pussy was that I agreed with him. I hadn’t been fair to Caroline. I’d hidden our relationship in fear of the consequences, in fear of Noel finding out. I’d been just as big of a pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I pushed all my blame on Gamble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bastard,” I roared right before I charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHamilton wrapped an arm around me from behind and picked me up off my feet, while Hart, Pick and Lowe regathered their efforts to keep Gamble at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill pissed as hell, I struggled in my roommate’s impenetrable hold. “Take that back! I’m nothing like that piece of shit. I actually love her. And the only reason I didn’t tell you sooner was to protect her, because I knew you’d fucking overreact, and she’d get hurt. I mean, fuck! Just look at her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know she’d started to sob, but I could feel it in my bones. And yep, when I glanced over and pointed a finger in her direction, the tears were streaming down her face as she clutched Blondie for dear life. It tore a hole through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it,” I rasped, my voice breaking. “We’re making her cry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noel,” she sobbed. “Please.” The pain in her eyes killed me. I just wanted to strangle Gamble and make him see reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed his eyes closed as if trying to block out the effect her pleading had on him. Then he gritted his teeth and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not his fault,” she begged. “I tricked him. I snuck into his room in the dark when he was expecting someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, fuck...me.” A sickened revulsion clouded his face. “You’re Midnight Visitor.” He turned to me and pointed accusingly at his sister. “She’s Midnight Visitor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He had no idea it was me,” Caroline said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGamble snorted. “Oh, I bet he didn’t.” His gaze narrowed on me as if he knew better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t,” Caroline cried in self-righteous defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually,” I admitted with a sigh as I glanced guiltily up at the sky. “I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” She spun to me, her mouth falling open. “No, you did not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked her straight in the eye. “Yeah...I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. “No...no, you didn’t.” Except she suddenly didn’t look so sure. “But...y-you got mad at me when you finally found out. You were...pissed because I’d tricked you. I forced you to betray your best friend, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. “I still knew. I mean, you called me Oren. You forgot to disguise your voice too many times, and...fuck, you smelled like you. I knew it was you. I just...denied it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfusion seized her expression. “What do you mean you denied it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy. I told myself it wasn’t you. Knowing it was really you would’ve made it wrong, and I didn’t want it to be wrong, so...I convinced myself it wasn’t you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, unable to believe my statement. “How the hell do you do something like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know, but I can. I did a damn fine job of denying the fact I had a twin sister who died a horrible death four years ago, now didn’t I? I’m like the king of denial.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You had a twin sister?” Gamble’s jaw fell open and his eyes grew wide, but I was too busy staring at Caroline to pay him much mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave another confused shake of the head. “But...if you knew it was me, then why didn’t you stop me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed softly. “Because it was you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs her lips parted, realization lit her face,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so intent on watching her expression I didn’t realize Gamble had broken free of Lowe, Pick and Hart until he shoved me. I went sprawling across the yard until I lost my footing and landed on my ass in the grass. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-148.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
