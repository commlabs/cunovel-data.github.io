Orcs readied their bows, and Kaer\u0027lic considered a spell, but Obould moved first and fast, and with little ambiguity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold your shots!\" he bellowed, rushing and turning about so that there could be no mistaking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he turned Kaer\u0027lic\u0027s way, the drow priestess saw such fires raging in his eyes that they washed away any thoughts she entertained of ignoring his command and throwing some Lolth-granted spell at the pegasus rider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat only infuriated her more as the winged horse closed and she recognized the black-skinned rider astride the magnificent creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" she mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He dares approach?\" asked Tos\u0027un, who was standing at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pegasus banked and reared up, stopping its approach and seeming to hover in the air through a few great wing beats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obould!\" Drizzt cried, and as he had maneuvered himself upwind, his words were carried to the orcs. \"I would speak with you! Alone! We have an unfinished conversation, you and I!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has lost all sensibility,\" Kaer\u0027lic whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or is he in parlay with Obould?\" asked Tos\u0027un. \"As an emissary of Mithral Hall, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Destroy him!\" Kaer\u0027lic called to Obould. \"Send your archers and cut him down or I will do it my - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will hold your spells, or you will discuss this matter with Ad\u0027non and Donnia in short order,\" Obould replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill the ugly beast,\" Tos\u0027un whispered to her, and Kaer\u0027lic almost launched a magical assault upon the orc king - until good sense overruled her instinctive hatred. She looked from Obould over to Drizzt, who was taking the pegasus down lower onto an adjoining high point, a huge flat rock wedged against the steep hillside, its far end propped by several tall natural stone columns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaer\u0027lic did well to hide her grin as she looked back at the orc king, all adorned in his fine plate mail fastened by spider-shaped buckles. Though she hadn\u0027t planned on getting anywhere near to Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, in effect, the scene was playing out exactly as she had hoped. Better than she had hoped, she thought, since she had not expected that Drizzt Do\u0027Urden himself would prove to be the first formidable foe King Obould faced in his \"improved\" armor. If Drizzt was half as good as Kaer\u0027lic had come to believe, then Obould was in for a very bad surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You intend to speak with this infidel?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he speaks for Mithral Hall and they have anything to say that I wish to hear,\" Obould answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he has come to kill me, no doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you will walk out to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And slaughter him.\" Obould\u0027s look was one of perfect confidence. He seemed almost bored by it all, as if Drizzt was no serious issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot do this,\" Tsinka said, moving fast behind her god-figure. \"There is no reason. Let us destroy him from afar and continue on our way. Or send an emissary - send Kaer\u0027lic, who knows the way of the drow elves!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden widening of Kaer\u0027lic\u0027s red eyes betrayed her terror at that prospect, but she recovered quickly and flashed Tsinka a hateful look. When Tsinka\u0027s responding expression became concerned, even deeply wounded, Kaer\u0027lic remembered the enchantment, remembered that she was \"best friends\" with the pitiful shaman. She managed a smile at the fool orc, then lifted her index finger and waggled it back and forth, bidding Tsinka not to interfere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTsinka continued to look at her dear, dear dark elf friend curiously for a moment longer, then happily smiled to indicate that she understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one is formidable, so I have heard,\" Kaer\u0027lic said, but only because she knew she would hardly dissuade Obould from his intended course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have battled him before,\" Obould assured her with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps it is a trap,\" Tsinka said, her voice falling away to ineffectiveness as she sheepishly looked at Kaer\u0027lic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould snickered and started to walk away, but stopped and glanced back, his yellow teeth showing behind the mouth slit in his bone-white helmet. Two strides put him past Kaer\u0027lic, and he reached over and grabbed poor Fender by the scruff of his neck, and easily hoisted the dwarf under one arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never parlay without a counteroffer prepared,\" he remarked, and he stormed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt was not surprised to see Obould stalking from the far hilltop, though the sight of the dwarf prisoner did catch him off his guard. Other than that squirming prisoner, though, Obould was moving out alone. As he had shadowed Obould looking for the proper terrain, Drizzt had concocted elaborate ambushes, where he and Sunrise might swoop down from behind a shielding high bluff in a fast and deadly attack on Obould. But Drizzt had known those plans to be unnecessary. He had taken a good measure of the orc king in their fight, in more ways than physical. Obould would not run from his challenge, fairly offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what of the dwarf? Drizzt had to find a way to make sure that Obould would not kill the poor fellow. He would refuse the fight unless the orc king guaranteed the prisoner\u0027s safety, perhaps. As he watched the approach, the drow became more convinced that he would be able to do just that, that Obould would not kill the dwarf. There was something about Obould, Drizzt was just beginning to see. In a strange way, the orc reminded Drizzt of Artemis Entreri. Single-minded and overly proud, always needing to prove himself - but to whom? To himself, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt had known beyond the slightest bit of doubt that Obould would come out to meet him. He watched the orc king\u0027s long strides, noted the other orcs and a pair of drow creeping about in a widening arc behind the solitary figure of the great king. He had his left hand on Icingdeath, and he drew Khazid\u0027hea from a scabbard strapped on Sunrise\u0027s side, but put the blade low immediately so as not to offer any overt threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will cut out his heart, the sword started to promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will be silent and remain out of my thoughts, Drizzt answered telepathically. Distract me but once and I will throw you down the mountainside and rain an avalanche of snow and cold stones upon you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo forceful and dominant was the focused drow that the sentient sword went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will win, yes? With the magic you put on his armor, Obould will win, yes?\" Tsinka babbled as she moved to a closer vantage point beside the two drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaer\u0027lic ignored her for most of the way, which only made the foolish shaman more insistent and demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the drow priestess turned on her and said, \"He is Gruumsh, yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTsinka stopped short - stopped both walking and babbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drizzt is a mere drow warrior,\" said Kaer\u0027lic. \"Obould is Gruumsh. Do you fear for Gruumsh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTsinka blanked, her doubts spinning around to reflect a lack of faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So be silent and enjoy the show,\" said Kaer\u0027lic, and so overpowering was her tone, particularly given the enchantment she still maintained regarding Tsinka, that her effect over the babbling shaman proved no less than Drizzt\u0027s dominance over Khazid\u0027hea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say what you must, and be quick,\" Obould said as he mounted the high flat stone directly across from the drow. Sunrise took a few quick strides and flew off the other way, as Drizzt had instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say?\" the drow asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould dropped poor Fender down onto the stone, the dwarf grunting as he hit face first. \"You have come with parlay from Mithral Hall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have not been to Mithral Hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile widened on Obould\u0027s face, barely visible behind that awful skull-like helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe that the dwarves will parlay with you?\" Drizzt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have they a choice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will speak with their axes and their bows. They will answer with fury, and nothing more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that you have not been to Mithral Hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need I return to a place and people I know so well to anticipate the course of Clan Battlehammer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is beyond Clan Battlehammer,\" said Obould, and Drizzt could see that his smile had disappeared. With a growl, the orc king kicked the squirming Fender, sending the dwarf flying off the back side of the stone and bouncing down a short descending path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden surge of anger caught the drow off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wish for a parlay with Mithral Hall?\" Drizzt stated as much as asked, and he didn\u0027t even try to keep the surprise out of his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould stared at him hatefully through the glassy eye-plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions came at Drizzt from every corner of his mind. If Obould desired a parlay, could it be that the war was at its end? If Drizzt battled the orc king, would he be showing disloyalty to Bruenor and his people, given that he might have just witnessed a sliver of hope that the war could be ended?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will return to your mountain homes?\" Drizzt blurted, even as the question formulated in his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould scoffed at him. \"Look around you, drow,\" he said. \"This is my home now. My kingdom! When you fly on your pet, you see the greatness of Obould. You see the Kingdom of Dark Arrows. Remember that name for the last minutes of your life. You die in Dark Arrows, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, and will be eaten by birds on a mountainside in the home of King Obould.\" He ended with a snarl and lifted his greatsword up before him, beginning a determined approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is your second?\" Drizzt asked, the unexpected words halting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould. \"For when you are dead, I will need to know. Perhaps that orc will be wiser than Obould and will see that he has no place here, among the dwarves, the elves, and the humans. Or if not, I will kill him, too, and speak with his second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt saw Obould\u0027s eyes widen behind the glassy plates, and with a roar that shook the stones, Obould leaped ahead, stabbing ferociously with his powerful sword, the blade bursting into flame as he thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut snapped Icingdeath, in the blink of a drow eye, the enchanted weapon slapping across the greatsword, extinguishing the fires in an angry puff of smoke as Drizzt hopped to the side. He could have struck with Khazid\u0027hea, for Obould, in his supreme confidence, had abandoned all semblance of defense in the assault. But Drizzt held the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe greatsword came slashing across, predictably, forcing the drow into a fast retreat. Had he taken that first opening and struck with his newfound sword, Drizzt would have scored a hit, but nothing substantial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that instance, Obould would have recognized his unanticipated vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould pressed the attack wildly, slashing and stabbing, rushing ahead, and on the high ground behind and to the side of the flat stone, orcs cheered and shouted in glee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt measured every turn and retreat, letting the fury play out, using less energy than his outraged opponent. He wasn\u0027t trying to tire Obould, but rather to gain better insight into the orc\u0027s turns and movements, that he could better anticipate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe greatsword flamed to life again with one feinted stab that became a sudden reversal into a downward chop, and had Drizzt not seen a similar distraction tactic used against the elf Tarathiel, he might have found himself caught by surprise. As it was, the descending greatsword met only the slap of Icingdeath, extinguishing the larger weapon\u0027s fires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould came on suddenly and wildly, charging straight for the drow, who stepped left, then leaped back right, going into a roll as Obould started one way then threw himself back the other, slashing his sword across. That sword flamed to life again, and the rolling Drizzt felt the heat of those magical fires as the blade cut above him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt came up to his feet and spun, then back-stepped and slid off to the side once more as Obould continued to press. Around and around they went, the orcs cheering and howling with every slash of Obould\u0027s sword, though he got nowhere close to hitting the elusive drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither did he show any signs of tiring, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Obould stopped his charge and stood glaring at Drizzt from behind the flames of the upraised greatsword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to fight me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould growled. \"Run away, if that is your course. Cross blades if you are not afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You grow tired?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I grow bored!\" Obould roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt smiled and faked a sudden rush, then stopped abruptly and caught everyone by surprise when he simply tossed Icingdeath up into the air. Obould\u0027s eyes followed the ascent of the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt reached his free hand behind his back and brought out the loaded hand crossbow, and as Obould snapped his gaze back upon him - yes, he wanted the orc king to see it coming! - the drow gave a shrug and let fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dart hit Obould\u0027s helmet in the left eye then collapsed in on itself and exploded with a burst of angry flame and black smoke. Obould\u0027s head snapped back viciously, and the orc king went flying down to the stone, flat on his back, as surely as if a mountain had fallen atop him. He lay very still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasps and silence replaced the wild cheering of all those looking on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impressive,\" Tos\u0027un quietly remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, Kaer\u0027lic stood with her jaw hanging open, and beside her, Tsinka whimpered and gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched Drizzt snap the hand crossbow back behind him, then casually catch the falling scimitar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaer\u0027lic noticed the approach of the pegasus, and suddenly feared that Drizzt would escape once more - and that, she could not allow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began casting a powerful spell, aiming for the flying horse and not the too-lucky drow, when she was interrupted by Tsinka, who grabbed her arm, and screamed, \"He moves!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow priestess looked back at Obould, who rocked up onto his shoulders, arching his back and bending his legs, then snapped back the other way, leaping up to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orcs screamed in glee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt hid his surprise well when Obould was suddenly standing before him once more. He noted the tip of the dart, embedded in the glassteel plate of the helmet, and the black scorch marks showing over the rest of that plate, and partially over the other one as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t expected to kill Obould with the dart, after all, and it was a fortunate thing that the orc king\u0027s fall had caught him more by surprise than his sudden return, for Obould howled and attacked once more, slashing with abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t see! Drizzt realized as he stepped aside and Obould continued to press the attack at the empty air before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKill him now! the hungry Khazid\u0027hea implored, and the drow, in complete agreement, didn\u0027t even scold the sentient sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped in suddenly and drove Khazid\u0027hea at a seam in the orc king\u0027s fabulous armor, and the fine blade bit through and slid into Obould\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow the great orc howled and leaped, tearing the sword right from Drizzt\u0027s grasp. Obould staggered back several steps, blood leaking out beside the sticking blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treachery!\" Obould yelled, and he reached up and yanked the ruined helmet from his head, throwing it over the cliff face. \"You cannot beat me fairly, and you cannot beat me unfairly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Drizzt\u0027s amazement, he came on again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unbelievable,\" whispered Tos\u0027un.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stubborn,\" Kaer\u0027lic corrected with a snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gruumsh!\" howled the gleeful and crying Tsinka, and all the orcs cheered, for if that sword protruding from Obould\u0027s side would prove a mortal wound, it did not show at all in the great orc\u0027s pressing attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t even know when he\u0027s dead,\" Kaer\u0027lic grumbled, and she launched into a spell, then, a calling to magical items she had fastened by the grace of Lady Lolth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to end the travesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt tried to battle past his incredulity and properly respond to Obould\u0027s renewed attacks. It took him several parries and a few last-second dodges to even realize that he should draw out Twinkle to replace his lost sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what have you gained for all of your treachery, drow?\" Obould demanded, pressing forward and slashing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are without a helmet, and that is no small thing,\" Drizzt shouted back. \"The turtle has come out of its shell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only so that I can look down upon you in the last moments of your life, fool!\" Obould assured him. \"That you might see the pleasure on my face as your body grows cold!\" He ended with a devastating charge, and turned in anticipation even as Drizzt started to jump aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe move caught Drizzt off guard, for it was truly an all-or-nothing, victory-or-defeat maneuver. If Obould guessed wrong, turning opposite Drizzt\u0027s sudden dodge, then Drizzt would have little trouble in slamming one or both of his scimitars down upon the back of the orc\u0027s skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Obould guessed right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his heels, corralled and running out of retreating room, Drizzt parried desperately. So fast was Obould\u0027s sword-work that Drizzt couldn\u0027t even think of launching an effective counter. So furious was the orc king\u0027s attack that Drizzt didn\u0027t even entertain any thoughts of swinging for his exposed head. Drizzt understood the power behind Obould\u0027s swings, and he knew that he could not fend that greatsword. Not the shirt he had taken from the dead dark elf, not even the finest suit of Bruenor\u0027s best mithral stock would save him from being cloven in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery simply, Obould had guessed right in his turn and Drizzt understood that he was beaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth his blades slapped against the slashing greatsword, Icingdeath extinguishing the stubborn fires yet again. But the shock of the block sent waves of numbness up the drow\u0027s arm, and even with a two-bladed parry, he could not fully deflect the swing. He fell down - that, or he would have been cut in half - and scrambled into a forward roll, but he could not get fully past Obould without taking a hit, a kick at least. He braced himself for the blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it did not fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt came around as he got back to his feet, to see Obould squirming and jerking wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" the orc king growled, and he jolted left then right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Drizzt several seconds to sort it out, to notice that the spider clasps on Obould\u0027s armor were animating. Eight-legged creatures scrambled all over the orc, and by Obould\u0027s roars and jerking movements, it seemed as if more than a few were stopping to bite him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the orc thrashed, pieces of that fabulous armor suit went flying. One vambrace fell to the stone, and he kicked his legs to free himself of the tangle of flapping jambs. His great breastplate fell away, as well as one pauldron and the backplate. The remaining pauldron flapped outward, held in place only by the embedded sword - and how Obould howled whenever that vicious blade moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot understanding, not even caring, Drizzt leaped in for the kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd promptly leaped back out, as Obould found his focus and countered with a sudden and well-timed sword thrust. Drizzt winced as he back-stepped, blood staining his enchanted shirt on the side. He stared at his opponent through every inch of his retreat, stunned that Obould had found the clarity to so counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeparated and with a moment\u0027s respite, Obould straightened. His face twisted into a grimace and he slapped one hand across to splatter a spider that had found a soft spot in his toughened orc hide. He brought his hand across, throwing the arachnid carcass to the ground, then reached over, growled and grimacing, and pulled Khazid\u0027hea free of his side, taking the pauldron with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWield me as your own! the sword screamed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a feral and explosive roar, Obould threw the annoying sword over the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treachery again!\" he roared at Drizzt. \"You live up to the sinister reputation of your heritage, drow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was not my doing,\" Drizzt yelled back. \"Speak not to me of treachery, Obould, when you encase yourself in an armor my blades cannot penetrate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat retort seemed to quiet and calm the orc, who stood more upright and assumed a pensive posture. He even offered a nod of concession to Drizzt on that point, ending with a smile and an invitation: \"I wear none now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould held his arms out wide, and brought his greatsword flaming to life, inviting the drow to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt straightened against the sting in his side, returned the nod, and leaped ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose watching the fight, drow and orc alike, did not cheer, hoot, or groan over the next few moments. They stood, one and all, transfixed by the sudden fury of the engagement, by the hum of swords, and the dives and leaps of the principals. Blade rang against blade too many times to be heard as distinguishable sounds. Blades missed a killing mark by so narrow a margin, again and again, that the onlookers continually gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe confusion of the battle challenged Drizzt at every level. One moment, he felt as if he was fighting Artemis Entreri, so fluid, fast, and devious were Obould\u0027s movements. And the next moment, he was painfully reminded by a shocking wave of reverberating energy flowing up his arm that he might well be battling a mighty giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of all his thoughts then, and fell into the Hunter, allowing his rage to rise within him, allowing for perfect focus and fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew in an instant that the creature he faced was no less intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny traces of her charm spell was gone then, Kaer\u0027lic knew, as Tsinka Shinriil, finding herself deceived by the drow\u0027s work on Obould\u0027s armor, leaped up beside Kaer\u0027lic and began shrieking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot defeat him! Even your treachery pales against the power of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould!\" she screamed. \"You chose to betray a god, and now you will learn the folly of your ways!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruly it seemed a moment of absolute glee for the idiot Tsinka, and that, Kaer\u0027lic could not allow. The drow\u0027s hand shot up as she mouthed the last words of a spell, creating a sudden disturbance in the air, a crackling jolt of energy that sent Tsinka flying away and to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill her,\" Kaer\u0027lic instructed Tos\u0027un, who moved immediately to see to the enjoyable task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Kaer\u0027lic said. \"Let her live a bit longer. Let her witness the death of her god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should just be gone from this place,\" said Tos\u0027un, clearly intimidated by the spectacle of King Obould, who was matching the skilled drow cut for cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaer\u0027lic flashed her companion a warning look, then turned her focus back upon that high stone. Her eyes went wild and she began to chant to Lady Lolth, reaching within herself for every ounce of magical strength she could muster for her powerful spell. The very air seemed to gather about her as she moved through the incantation. Her hair bristled and waved, though there was no wind. She grasped at the air with her outstretched hand then brought it in close and reached with the other one. Then she repeated the movements again and again as if she was taking all of the energy around her and bringing it into her torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground began to tremble beneath them. Kaer\u0027lic began a low growl that increased in tempo and volume, slowly at first, but then more forcefully and quickly as the drow priestess began to reach out toward Drizzt and Obould with both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder rolled all around them. The orcs began to cower, shout, or run away. And the ground began to shake, quick and darting movements at first that grew into great rolling waves of stone. Rock split and crumbled. A crevice appeared before Kaer\u0027lic and charged out toward the unfazed combatants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the high rock split apart under the force of Kaer\u0027lic\u0027s earthquake. And stones tumbled down in an avalanche. And Obould fell away, roaring in protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Drizzt went right behind him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-31.html","bookId":2142,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:47 PM"}
