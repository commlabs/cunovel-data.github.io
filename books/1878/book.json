He blows through females quicker than his muscle car races down the \"The Strip\" in Collinsville and he wouldn’t have it any other way. Determined to avoid the devastation he has watched his father endure in the aftermath of his mother leaving, he believes there is no room in his life or his heart for a relationship lasting more than one night. He seeks happiness in things that won’t let him down...fast cars, adrenaline and one night stands. To his absolute dismay, all of that changes when he unexpectedly runs into an old friend and is introduced to Payton Archer, the first girl he ever wanted for more than one night. There’s only one catch...she is completely immune to him and his smooth talking ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shallow-going-under-2.jpg","author":"Georgia Cates","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/shallow-going-under-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:13 PM"}
