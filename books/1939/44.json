If she did go to her Harvey\u0027s suspicions proved correct. When I called her parents, I learned that Macy hadn\u0027t been in touch in several weeks. I explained who I was and said I loved Macy. Her mother had never heard of me. That was another big dent to my pride. By then, it had received so many dents I was beginning to feel like a car abandoned at the junkyard. I asked Mrs. Roth to contact me if she talked to her daughter. She didn\u0027t call and I could only assume Macy hadn\u0027t gone running to her family for solace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Sammy doing without Macy?\" I asked Harvey the second week. She\u0027d taken the three cats with her, wherever she might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He misses her as much as you and I do,\" the old man said starkly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third week, Harvey called me after ten one evening, so excited I had difficulty understanding him. \"Turn on channel thirteen,\" he finally said, enunciating slowly and clearly as if I were some backward pupil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it happened, I had my TV on and flipped to the proper channel just in time to catch the end of the grocery-store commercial that had caused Macy such trouble. Seeing her in that 1960s costume again set my heart racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see her?\" Harvey demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks good, doesn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, knowing Harvey couldn\u0027t see my response. But that was okay because he knew how I felt. I was so hungry for the sight of Macy, I would\u0027ve crawled inside the TV set if I could have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss her, don\u0027t you?\" he said with surprising gentleness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than I could ever have guessed. You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a pest.\" He sighed. \"Never thought I\u0027d say this, but it\u0027s downright lonely around this place without her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least you\u0027ve got Sammy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want him, come and get him,\" Harvey retorted. \"He\u0027s all yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was an empty promise if I\u0027d ever heard one. \"No, you keep him,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sammy\u0027s company, all right,\" Harvey said next. \"But half the time he\u0027s over at Macy\u0027s door, whining because he misses her and those darn cats. I swear I\u0027ve never seen anything like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was whining myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You coming by tomorrow?\" Harvey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squared my shoulders and my resolve. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She isn\u0027t there, is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I can\u0027t see any point in coming by.\" My friendship with Harvey was a good reason, but I preferred to keep in touch with him by phone. It was just too painful to visit her house, her neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to call when she comes back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to give that some consideration. \"No, I don\u0027t think so.\" I didn\u0027t mean to have a defeatist attitude, but I\u0027d done all I could. As far as I was concerned, it was Macy\u0027s turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\" Harvey echoed in disbelief. \"What\u0027s the matter with you, boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, I don\u0027t like being referred to as a boy, and secondly, Macy had been clear about what she wanted. And what she didn\u0027t want. The way I saw it, if she couldn\u0027t love me enough to see past our differences, a relationship between us had no potential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave it my best shot, Harvey,\" I said. \"Macy doesn\u0027t want to be part of my life, so I\u0027d better live with her decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She loves you,\" he argued. \"But she\u0027s afraid. She\u0027s never been in love like this before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have,\" I reminded him. I knew what it meant to love someone else, the way Hannah had loved me, and this wasn\u0027t it. Macy might think she was in love with me, but her actions certainly contradicted that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let the girl have a second chance,\" Harvey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at his feeble attempt to patch things up. He could argue all he wanted, but his arguments were irrelevant, since Macy was nowhere to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI insisted I was done with Macy; nevertheless, I sat up for several hours, staring at the TV, flipping channels, looking for a repeat of the Safeway commercial just to see her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, I do have my pride. To prove I was getting over her, I accepted a blind date and actually had a semienjoyable evening. The woman, Carrie, was a friend of Melanie\u0027s, Patrick\u0027s wife. Carrie was a perfectly nice person, but she wasn\u0027t Macy. She had an easy laugh but she didn\u0027t make me laugh, didn\u0027t make me think or challenge me. Nor did she try to feed me cat food or drag in a stray dog to love and protect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne date was all it took. I realized I wasn\u0027t nearly as over Macy as I\u0027d hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat particularly disturbed me was the fact that Macy had never finished the mural. It remained three-quarters completed. Every time I walked past it, I looked at that jungle scene, those parrots and that baby giraffe, and thought of Macy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly everything in her life seemed to be like this unfinished painting. She had good intentions, but one thing or another kept her from following through with what she started. Apparently, this translated into relationships, as well. I was just another unfinished project discarded along with the mural on my wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy guess was that this inability to complete anything went back to her childhood. In one of those lengthy phone conversations, during which we chatted for three or four hours, I\u0027d learned that Macy had always been considered a bit odd by her family. They had little patience with her often-roundabout approach to things and her idiosyncratic views. And they rarely showed much interest in any project she undertook. The only person who understood and appreciated her had been her grandmother. I\u0027d come to love her quirky nature, but I couldn\u0027t get past her ability to walk away from people and projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda caught me staring at the mural the first week of August. \"Do you want me to find someone to finish it?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s funny, isn\u0027t it, how she simply vanished like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny isn\u0027t the word I would\u0027ve used. \"Yeah,\" I said and headed for my next appointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before you go in there, I need to tell you this is a new patient. He\u0027s, well, a bit of an unusual case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Thanks for the warning.\" She wore a strange expression and I couldn\u0027t help wondering what was so different about this new patient. I soon found out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walked into the room, I found Harvey sitting on the exam table, his legs dangling down so far they touched the floor. \"Harvey,\" I said, unable to disguise my shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made my appointment like everyone else,\" he grumbled, crossing his arms over his chest in a defensive gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to remind you that I\u0027m a pediatrician.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027d like to remind you that I came at my appointment time. Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re going to refuse me treatment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" If Harvey was seeking medical help, I\u0027d do everything I could, and that included referring him to a specialist. If necessary, I\u0027d personally escort him to every appointment. I\u0027d come to love this old man as much as Macy did, probably more. I wouldn\u0027t turn my back on him the way she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better sit down,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That bad, huh?\" I teased. Because of the chest pains he\u0027d occasionally mentioned, I suspected the problem was with Harvey\u0027s heart, although he didn\u0027t seem any worse than the day we\u0027d met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plugged my stethoscope into my ears. \"Let\u0027s start by listening to your heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not here about my heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I said, removing the stethoscope. \"Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey took a moment to answer. He nailed me to the stool with his piercing gaze, then said, \"Macy\u0027s back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glad I was sitting down. Still, I couldn\u0027t immediately form the words to question him. \"When did that happen?\" I finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couple of days ago. She doesn\u0027t look good, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I was reluctant to show interest, but at the same time I was curious. I just didn\u0027t want Harvey to know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old guy frowned at me, but I wasn\u0027t intimidated. I\u0027d learned months ago that he was all growl and no bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s lost weight and she didn\u0027t have any to lose.\" Lips pinched, he shook his head. \"She\u0027s nothing but skin and bones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\" And I was. \"Where did she go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To a friend\u0027s place on the other side of the mountains, near Wenatchee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never mentioned a friend near Wenatchee. I wondered if this person was male or female.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told her about you hanging around the place for a month or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d rather he hadn\u0027t; nevertheless, I was curious to know her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" I asked in a bored voice. I doubt I\u0027d fooled him but my pride demanded the pretense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat figured. \"I\u0027ll bet Sammy was pleased to see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And her him. Those two were glued to each other for a whole day. I don\u0027t understand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She rescued him. Sammy owes her. What\u0027s there to understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t talking about Sammy and Macy,\" he snapped. \"I mean Sammy and those cats of hers. You\u0027d have thought they were best friends. They were all over him and Sammy just stood there, happy as a clam at high tide, letting those blasted cats weave in and around his legs. I wouldn\u0027t have believed it if I hadn\u0027t seen it with my own eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my determination not to, I smiled. Everything had felt out of kilter while Macy was away. And now she was back--but it didn\u0027t matter. It couldn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" Harvey said none too gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to see her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t the one who ran away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That didn\u0027t stop you the first week. You practically lived at my house. I can remember a couple of times I had to escort you to the door because it was past my bedtime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was before,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his eyes. \"Before what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before--\" I looked at him pointedly \"--I came to my senses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey shook his head slowly from side to side. \"It seems to me you\u0027ve lost your senses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macy has a habit of running away whenever she\u0027s confronted with anything difficult or boring or unpleasant. I\u0027m not chasing after her, Harvey. If she loves me, she\u0027ll come to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis frown darkened. \"Cut her some slack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. I gave her a month. Now it\u0027s up to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t like it, but I could see he wasn\u0027t going to argue. I guessed he\u0027d talked to Macy and learned what I already knew. Macy might be full of energy, crackling with life and unexpected ideas, but she was afraid of commitment, afraid of love. If my feelings for her weren\u0027t enough to give her the courage to face me, then nothing I said or did would make any difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The two of you are more trouble than you\u0027re worth,\" he said with a disgruntled snort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt.\" I could appreciate that it had taken a great deal for Harvey to make an appointment to see me. He knew that if he\u0027d phoned, it would\u0027ve been a short conversation. This way, he could see my reaction for himself and gauge how likely it was that his efforts would bring Macy and me back together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to examine you?\" I didn\u0027t wait for an answer. I inserted my stethoscope\u0027s earpieces again. \"Since you\u0027re paying for this appointment, you should make it worth your while.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-44.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
