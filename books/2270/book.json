In the long months since, sh\u0027s slowly come to terms not only with her loss but with her unsettling new ability to communicate with ghosts, a dubious \u0027gift\u0027 received in the wake of her own brush with death. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eNow sh\u0027s returned to lower Manhattan\u0027s historic Hastings House, site of the explosion, to conquer her fears and investigate a newly discovered burial ground. In this place restless spirits hold the secrets not only of past injustice but of a very real and very contemporary conspiracy with deadly designs on the city\u0027s women--including Leslie herself. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBy night Matt visits her in dreams, warning her and offering clues to the truth, while by day she finds herself helped by--and attracted to-- his flesh-and-blood cousin Joe. Torn by her feelings for both men, caught between the worlds of the living and the dead, Leslie struggles against the encroaching danger that threatens to overcome her. As she is drawn closer to the darkness at the heart of Hastings House, she must ultimately face the power of an evil mind, alone in a place where not even the men she loves can save her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-room-harrison-investigation-4.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-room-harrison-investigation-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:02 PM"}
