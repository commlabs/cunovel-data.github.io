I know we don’t do the whole Christmas stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if I want to get you something, though?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you can,” I say. “But just so you know, what I got you isn’t anything great.” Which is true. While we were out shopping for wedding decorations, I saw these friendship bracelets that looked exactly like the ones Micha and I had for a while before we were kids, after we made this promise to be best friends forever. Eventually they got all worn out and we threw them away or lost them, and when I told Lila this, she said I should get them and give them to Micha as a present. I’m not one for sappiness, but I still found myself buying them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m already getting you,” he says. “Which is the best present ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, but can’t help but smile. “You’re so cheesy sometimes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you secretly love it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t respond because he’s right and then he grins as he nudges my legs open with his knee, shifting his hips between them, ready to slip back inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a knock on the door interrupts us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ella,” Lila calls out from the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just ignore her,” Micha whispers, nibbling on my earlobe as he grazes his thumb across my nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groan, squeezing my legs against his hips as the tip of him presses into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ella, I know you’re in there and I need you to come out.” She pauses. “Dean and Caroline are here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI work to keep my voice level as Micha thrusts inside me. “I’ll be out in just a second.” My voice comes out breathless and Micha laughs, his mouth hovering over mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pauses, arching his brow. “A second. Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach around and pinch his ass, causing him to laugh. “You better make it a second, otherwise you’re going to get blue balls for the rest of the day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head, he smiles. “Fine, you win.” Then his slips all the way inside me and again I lose myself in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout fifteen minutes later, we’re fully dressed and we head out to the kitchen, exhausted but content. Lila’s at the kitchen table, dressed in her pajamas with little cherries on the fabric. The table and counters are still covered in ribbon and candles, along with a few boxes of cereal and dirty dishes. Ethan’s in the chair beside her, in a T-shirt and plaid pajama bottoms, eating a bowl of cereal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knowing grin rises on Lila’s face when she sees us. “Took you two long enough,” she jokes as she adds a spoonful of sugar to her coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan glances over his shoulder, his eyes bloodshot, probably because he’s hungover. He stares at my cheek, which I tried to cover up with makeup but shiners on the face are pretty much a lost cause so all I can do is wear it proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who the hell beat you up?” Ethan asks, stirring his cereal with a spoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touch the spot with my fingers as Micha releases my hand and goes over to the coffeepot beside the sink. “Mikey,” I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan lets out a gradual exhale. “Shit, was it because…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe trails off as Micha hands me a cup of coffee. “Because you two jackasses threw a shake in his car?” he says. “Yep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan frowns as he rakes his fingers through his hair, making it stick up on the top. “Hey, it wasn’t my idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it was mine,” I say to Micha, inhaling the aroma of the coffee. “Don’t give him credit for my awesomeness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m too hungover for you two to start arguing.” Micha grimaces and then stretches his arms above his head, the bottom of his shirt riding up, flaunting his muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan and I exchange a challenging look, and then Ethan gives up and returns to eating his cereal as I take a soothing gulp of my coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said Caroline and Dean were here?” I ask Lila as I sit down at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila nods as she stirs her coffee. Her hair is pulled back in a short ponytail and she doesn’t have any makeup on. “They were, but I told them you were going to be a minute so they went over to your house and I told them I’d send you over when you came out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut the window, I see there’s a large maroon SUV parked in the driveway beside my house, just behind the Firebird. “Is that their rental car?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila shakes her head. “No, they drove here because Caroline didn’t want to fly. I think it’s their car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess he got rid of the Porsche then,” I say, adding a drop of milk to my coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably because they’re about to have a baby and there’s no room for a car seat in a Porsche.” Lila smiles and then takes a gulp from her coffee mug. “Caroline’s belly is so cute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan shakes his head, his eyes wide as he fixes them on his cereal. I glance over at Micha, who’s watching me while he leans against the counter, sipping his coffee. When he pulls the mug away from his mouth, he licks his lips. I know him well enough to know that he’s attempting to read my reaction, not just about the Porsche—my mom’s old car—being sold but because Lila’s talking about babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rise to my feet and look at Micha. “Do you want to come with me and say hi or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicha nods and moves away from the counter for the back door. We grab our coats and tell Lila and Ethan we’ll be right back, and then we head over to my house. Thomas’s old truck is parked in the driveway behind Micha’s Chevelle and there are shoe prints in the snow, leading from Micha’s steps to the fence. Then they pick up on the other side of the fence, heading to the stairs of my house. I can’t help but smile because it probably means Dean and Caroline took our little path to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point down at the tracks. “Hey look, all the cool kids are doing it now,” I joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicha grabs the top of the fence and hops gracefully over it, landing in the snowbank on the other side. “I’d rather they not. I like that it’s our path and I want it to stay that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too,” I agree, sliding my fingers around the icy metal fence and hoisting myself up. Halfway over, Micha grabs onto my hips and helps me to the ground, setting me in the driveway so I don’t sink in the snowbank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tromp through the snow to the house and walk inside, the air smelling like cinnamon again and perfume, along with a hint of bacon. There are pans on the stove and there’s coffee brewing in a pot on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have prepared myself more because as soon as we enter, Caroline practically starts jumping up and down. She’s wearing a flowing purple dress and her black hair is braided. The fabric of the dress stretches over her protruding belly and even though I try not to, I can’t help but stare. Dean is sitting on the table, his feet propped up on a chair with a newspaper on his lap. He’s dressed in a collared shirt and slacks and I still can’t get used to the look. Growing up, all he would wear were old T-shirts and jeans and he even dyed his hair blue once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God, there you two are,” Caroline says excitedly, clapping her hands with enough energy to power the entire house. “Congrats, you two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.” I force myself not to get awkward and I let the nice moment be, even though deep down I feel uncomfortable with the positive attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses. “Ella, what happened to your face?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cup my swollen cheek. “I got into a small fight, but nothing major.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like old times,” Dean remarks with a shake of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I hope you’re okay,” Caroline says, examining my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine,” I assure her. “The swelling will go down in a day or two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good, then it’ll be gone for the wedding.” She leans in to hug me and I uncomfortably hug her back, feeling her belly press against mine. When she moves away, she notices me staring and places her hand across her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s going to be a girl,” she says and Dean glances up at me with a strange look on his face that I can’t decipher. I wonder if he’s freaked out, too, at the thought of children, if he’s worried he’ll end up like our father, drunk and nonexistent. I could ask him, but we’re not to that place yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulations,” I say to both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.” Dean folds up the newspaper and tosses it into the table by the cookie jar. He’s quiet for a moment and I seriously have no idea what the hell’s going to come out of his mouth. “You too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m surprised by his simple remark and I miss a beat before I respond. “Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is going to be so good,” Caroline says, whisking over to the counter to a plate of eggs and bacon. “A wedding outside at Christmas time near a lake. I can only imagine the pictures I’m going to get to take.” She starts munching on the bacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’ll be freezing though,” Dean says, stating the obvious as he hops off the table and then strides up to Caroline and circles an arm around her waist. “You sure you don’t want to have it inside? We’ll all be freezing our asses off by the end of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicha and I exchange a look and then we both shake our head. “No, cold temperature or not, I’m not having it anywhere else,” I tell Dean, and Micha squeezes my hand. “It’s important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” Dean says, confused. “I guess we’re having an outdoor wedding. But who all’s coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, Micha, Lila, Ethan,” I ramble off the list, counting down on my fingers. “Micha’s mom and boyfriend, you and Caroline obviously, and Dad… and maybe his girlfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah,” Dean says as he kisses Caroline’s shoulder. “The secretary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you knew about her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders rise and fall as he shrugs. “He mentioned it on the phone a couple of weeks ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never mentioned it to me. “Oh.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ever-after-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-4/page-27.html","bookId":1972,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:59 AM"}
