Instead, he stayed in the Outer Academy for a couple of days. During this period of time, Xiao Li’s injuries had not only recovered quickly under the numerous expensive medicinal pills of Xiao Yan, but his strength had also advanced greatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan had naturally probed Xiao Li’s current strength during the period that the latter was recuperating. He was currently at the peak of the Dou Shi class and could break through that barrier anytime, leaping to become a Da Dou Shi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan pondered a little about this before he secretly added a drop of ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ during Xiao Li’s recuperation. Borrowing this enormous energy, Xiao Li finally broke through the Dou Shi barrier as he had desired, and took the first step in advancing to a Da Dou Shi!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Xiao Li’s wounds had been completely cured and his strength had advanced greatly, his entire aura had undoubtedly become much darker and sterner than before after undergoing such a great change. He was still a little better when faced with his relatives like Xiao Yan. However, when he talked to an outsider, the thick cold glint in his eyes that was as sharp as an eagle caused other people to have the feeling of sitting on needles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan did not have any other solution with regards to this. It was impossible not to change a little after experiencing such a great disaster. The problem that he currently needed to think about was how to arrange for his second brother, Xiao Li, to stay. This Jia Nan Academy was after all a renowned academy in the continent. A person of questionable background could not continue to stay within it. If he had not borrowed the status of Hu Jia and Wu Hao during this period of time, it was likely that there would have been members of the academy’s Law Enforcement Unit coming to expel Xiao Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan had originally intended to introduce Xiao Li to the Jia Nan Academy. After all, the training talent of the latter was quite good. However, after experiencing this change, the dark and cold aura of Xiao Li was not suitable to stay for long in the academy with its calm atmosphere. Moreover, with the latter’s character, it was likely that he would not be an obedient student within the academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Xiao Yan was having a little headache, Xiao Li took the lead to look for him. The decision that Xiao Li spoke caused Xiao Yan to be stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish to go into the ‘Black-Corner Region’.” Xiao Li licked his mouth within the room as he eyed Xiao Yan’s stunned manner. A smile was revealed on his cold and stern face as he spoke, “I discovered that the atmosphere there is very suitable for me. When I was in the Jia Ma Empire in the past, there was always something restricting me regardless of what I did. On the other hand, there are no rules within that ‘Black-Corner Region’. Therefore… I can use any means, including unscrupulous ones to build some things there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although the ‘Black-Corner Region’ is a place without rules, it is also overly chaotic. A person who is weak is unlikely to have a large chance to survive for long.” Xiao Yan, who had personally experienced that chaos was naturally not too willing to allow Xiao Li to go to that kind of place. Therefore, he did his best to persuade the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax. No matter how one puts it, I am considered someone of the Da Dou Shi class now. Moreover, in that kind of place, it is not as though one must use force for everything.” Xiao Li waved his hand. Seeing that Xiao Yan was still hesitating, he could only helplessly take out two scrolls, where a silver-colored bright glow was flickering, from his chest pocket. He said, “This is a set of a lightning affinity Qi Method and a Dou Technique. Its level is sufficient to reach the Middle Xuan class. Moreover, if the two of them are used in unison, their strength would increase by multiple times. Even if one were to use a High Xuan class Qi Method and Dou Technique, the attack’s strength would have difficulty matching with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh? Where did you get this from?” Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this as he spoke in a stunned voice. A Qi Method of this class was not only that of the rare lightning affinity but was actually a set. This price was something that even an ordinary High Xuan Qi Method would have difficulty matching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hee hee, this was given by that girl Xun Er.” Xiao Li laughed, “After not having seen her for so many years, she is still completely obedient and docile toward you. You better not let her down. She may have grown up in the Xiao clan since she was young, but she is not a member of the Xiao clan. I think you should be aware of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As expected…” Xiao Yan laughed bitterly and shook his head. He just knew it. Who else other than that girl Xun Er could simply just take out such a valuable Qi Method? Xiao Yan had also automatically ignored the last few words of Xiao Li. The current him did not have the time and qualification to discuss these matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Therefore, you need not be the least bit concerned. With my lightning affinity Dou Qi and adding this Qi Method and Dou Technique, even an ordinary four or five star Da Dou Shi can do nothing to me.” Xiao Li smiled. However, his smile hid a little bloodthirst. “Moreover, the both of us are now carrying a vengeance. Therefore, I cannot just die this easily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan studied Xiao Li’s eyes. It was a long while later before he sighed softly. He understood Xiao Li very well. As long it was something that the latter had decided, it would be difficult for even nine bulls to pull him back...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan frowned as he mused for a moment. He suddenly flipped his hand and a strange dark-black scroll suddenly appeared in his hand. After rubbing it carefully, he handed it to Xiao Li and said softly, “This is a Flying Dou Technique scroll. It is named ‘Lightning Bat Sky Wings’. After you practice it, you will possess a flying ability just like a strong Dou Wang. However, it greatly exhausts your Dou Qi. Additionally… Unless it is a crucial time where you need to flee, it would be best for second brother not to easily display it. The origin of this thing is shady. If someone were to recognize it, it is likely that will bring about an unexpected calamity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ‘Lightning Bat Sky Wings ‘ was something that Xiao Yan had obtained from killing the junior sect leader of the ‘Blood Sect’ back then. It had once shown itself in the auction house and many people knew that the junior sect leader of the ‘Blood Sect’ had purchased it. Now that the person had died, it was likely that those fellows from the ‘Blood Sect’ would send someone to kill Xiao Li if this kind of dirty item was identified to be in Xiao Li’s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the sake of Xiao Li’s safety in the ‘Black-Corner Region’, Xiao Yan had also quietly told him about this secret in order for him to be cautious of the ‘Blood Sect’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hee hee, this is really a good thing.” Xiao Li’s face was filled with joy as he received the dark-black scroll. He was not the least bit courteous as he stuffed it into his breast pocket. He immediately spoke with a dark vulturous tone, “Relax, I will pay attention to that ‘Blood Sect’. I have also heard about them when I passed by the ‘Black-Corner Region’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should temporarily stay for these few days. I will refine some medicinal pills for you to protect yourself.” Xiao Yan nodded slightly before immediately hesitating a little as he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ke ke, alright.” Xiao Li also clearly understood that Xiao Yan was worried about him making a living within the ‘Black-Corner Region’. Therefore, it was likely that Xiao Yan was unwilling to let him leave. Hence, Xiao Li did not reject Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan sighed gently. He gave a bitter smile as he patted Xiao Li’s shoulders. Immediately, he turned around and walked into a quiet room to begin refining medicinal pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to give Xiao Li the best protection, Xiao Yan naturally needed to prepare the ‘Dragon Strength Pill’ that could greatly raise one’s physical strength within a short period of time. Although the medicinal ingredients needed for this ‘Dragon Strength Pill’ were complicated, Xiao Yan was coincidentally in possession of three sets of medicinal pills that Elder Liu had sent him. As Xiao Yan’s chances of success in refining a ‘Dragon Strength Pill’ were not considered very high, he invited Yao Lao to do the refinement this time around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Yao Lao, an alchemist grandmaster, helping out, Xiao Yan naturally had a bountiful gain. The three sets of medicinal ingredients had all successfully agglomerated into pill shapes and eventually turned into pills without exception under the dancing thick white flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao did not immediately stop after helping Xiao Yan refine the ‘Dragon Strength Pill’. He clearly knew how much Xiao Yan valued Xiao Li. If anything were to happen to Xiao Li in the ‘Black-Corner Region’, this fellow might become totally crazy at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence, Yao Lao did not rest as he activated his flame after putting away the ‘Dragon Strength Pill’ into a jade bottle. He spent quite a bit of time to refine a batch of varying medicinal pills belonging to quite a high tier. These medicinal pills had various unique medicinal effects. Although they were not ordinary medicinal pills, they were able to obtain an unexpected effect during certain times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s heart was also filled with gratitude toward Yao Lao who had spent great thought and effort in his refinement. He could only quietly swear in his heart that he would cobble together the ‘Heavenly Flames’ as soon as possible and help refine a body that could accommodate Teacher’s spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the second day, Xiao Yan gave all the medicinal pills that had been refined to Xiao Li with the exception of a ‘Dragon Strength Pill’ that Elder Liu needed. Moreover, he also gave Xiao Li a dark-black storage ring on top of the medicinal pills. This storage ring had a cluster of ‘Bone Chilling Flame’ that Yao Lao had wrapped with his Spiritual Strength. If one was able to unleash it at a critical juncture, it would achieve the effect of hurting the enemy. However, this kind of storage method could merely be used once. Moreover, it would cause quite a bit of damage to one’s own Spiritual Strength. Hence, this could be considered a final trump card that preserved Xiao Li’s life other than the ‘Lightning Bat Sky Wings’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Li eyed Xiao Yan’s worried expression as he received all the things from the latter. A warm feeling surfaced in his eyes, which were usually filled with a dark sternness. He patted Xiao Yan’s back heavily and smiled as he said, “Xiao-Yan-zi, you can relax, your second brother will not lose to any one of those bastards in the ‘Black-Corner Region’ when it comes to being vicious. Among us three brothers, we cannot simply just rely on you for everything right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan nodded slightly as he softly spoke, “Second brother, take care. You can just come and find me in the Jia Nan Academy if you have any problem. Additionally, if you meet the Law Enforcement Unit of the Jia Nan Academy, you can tell them Wu Hao’s name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rest assured. I will occasionally send someone to give you a letter and allow you to know my whereabouts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Li nodded his head. His body stood straight for a moment as he faced and waved at Xiao Yan as well as Xun Er, Xiao Yu, and the others behind. After which, he suddenly turned around without feeling unwilling to be apart as he strode out the gate of the academy, heading toward the distant area that was filled with chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan ge-ge, you need not be too worried. With older cousin Xiao Li’s character, he will definitely get along very well within that ‘Black-Corner Region’. By the next time you see him, the faction that he established might well have far exceeded your ‘Pan’s Gate’.” Xun Er gently spoke with a smile as she looked Xiao Yan’s eyes who was watching Xiao Li leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ke ke, Xun Er, thank you very much.” Xiao Yan stood at the entrance to the academy and eyed Xiao Li’s back that had gradually become blurred. A long time later, he let out a long breath and smiled to Xun Er. This thanks was naturally to thank her for the help that she had given Xiao Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does Xiao Yan ge-ge need to be so courteous to Xun Er? You will ultimately not accept the things that I give you. Therefore, I can only give them to older cousin Xiao Li instead.” Xun Er said with a saucy smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan smiled and nodded quietly. He turned around and walked back into the academy while speaking in a faint voice, “Let’s go. It is time for us to return. The ‘Strong Ranking’ Grand Competition is about to arrive. This time around, I must enter the top ten!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I must!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-546\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-548\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-547","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM"}
