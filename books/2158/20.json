He tapped a finger against his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sought Guild or CHOAM sanctuary at junction,\" she said. \"How fortunate our spy ship was there to scoop you up before the enemy could react.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister...\" How difficult that word! \"... if you truly are my sister in kehl, why will you not provide me with Face Dancer servants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still too many secrets between us, Scytale.

How oppressive it was in this place! \"Why is she behind me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the servant of my Sisters and she is here to observe us both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve taken some of my cells, haven\u0027t you?

We know when you lie and when you conceal. We employ senses others do not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true!

All of them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were on lashkar,\" Odrade prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLashkar! How he wished he were here on lashkar. Face Dance warriors, Domel assistants - eliminating this abominable evil! But he dared not lie. The one behind him probably was a Truthsayer. Experience in many lives told him Bene Gesserit Truthsayers were the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I commanded a force of khasadars. We sought a herd of Futars for our defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerd?

I think it likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you call them Honored Matres?\" His voice lapsed almost into a screech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because that is what they call themselves.\" Very calm now. Let him stew in his own mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is right! We were betrayed. Bitter thought. He held it close, wondering how he should reply. A small revelation? There is never a small revelation with these women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sigh shook his breast. The nullentropy capsule and its contents. His most important concern. Anything to get him access to his own axlotl tanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Descendants of people we sent into the Scattering returned with captive Futars. A mingling of human and cat, as you doubtless know. But they did not reproduce in our tanks. And before we could determine why, the ones brought to us died.\" The betrayers brought us only two!

That is what they do with small revelations!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did the Futars not hunt and kill Honored Matres on Gammu?\" It was Duncan\u0027s question and deserved an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were told no orders were given. They do not kill without orders.\" She knows this. She is testing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Face Dancers also kill on order,\" she said. \"They would even kill you if you ordered it. Not so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That order is reserved for keeping our secrets from the hands of enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you want your own Face Dancers? Do you consider us enemies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could compose a response, Bellonda\u0027s projected figure appeared above the table, lifesize and partly translucent, dancing crystals of Archives behind her. \"Urgent from Sheeana!\" Bellonda said. \"The spice blow has occurred. Sandworms!\" The figure turned and looked at Scytale, comeyes perfectly coordinating her movements. \"So you have lost a bargaining chip, Master Scytale! We have our spice at last!\" The projected figure vanished with an audible click and a faint smell of ozone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying to trick me!\" he blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the door at Odrade\u0027s left opened. Sheeana entered towing a small suspensor pod no more than two meters long. Its transparent sides repeated the glowglobes of the workroom in tiny bursts of yellow light. Something squirmed in the pod!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheeana stood aside without speaking, giving them a full view of the contents. So small! The worm was less than half the length of its container but perfect in every detail, stretched out there on a shallow bed of golden sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScytale could not contain a gasp of awe. The Prophet!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade\u0027s reaction was pragmatic. She bent close to the pod, peering into the miniature mouth. The scorching huff-huff of a great worm\u0027s internal fires reduced to this? What a tiny mimicry!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrystal teeth flashed as it lifted its front segments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worm sent its mouth questing left and right. They all saw behind the teeth the miniature fire in its alien chemistry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thousands of them,\" Sheeana said. \"They came to a spice blow as they always do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade remained silent. We have done it! But this was Sheeana\u0027s moment of triumph. Let her make the most of it. Scytale had never looked this defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheeana opened the pod and lifted the worm from it, cradling it as though it were an infant. It lay quiescent in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade took a deep, satisfied breath. She still controls them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scytale,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not take his gaze from the worm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you still serve the Prophet?\" Odrade asked. \"There he is!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not know how to respond. Truly a revenant of the Prophet? He wanted to deny his first awed response but his eyes would not permit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade spoke softly. \"While you were out on your foolish mission, your selfish mission, we were serving the Prophet! We rescued his last revenant and brought him here. Chapterhouse will become another Dune!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back and steepled her hands in front of her. Bell was watching through the comeyes, of course. A Mentat\u0027s observations would be valuable. Odrade wished Idaho were also watching. But he could look at a holo. It was clear to her that Scytale had seen the Bene Gesserit only as tools for restoration of his precious Tleilaxu civilization. Would this development force him to reveal inner secrets of his tanks? What would he offer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must have time to think.\" A tremor in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what would you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not answer but kept his attention on Sheeana, who was replacing the tiny worm in its pod. She stroked it once before sealing the lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, Scytale,\" Odrade insisted. \"How can there be anything for you to reconsider? This is our Prophet! You say you serve the Great Belief. Then serve it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see his dreams dissolving. His own Face Dancers to print memories of those they killed, copying each victim\u0027s shape and manner. He had never hoped to gull a Reverend Mother... but acolytes and simple workers of Chapterhouse... all the secrets he had hoped to acquire, gone! Lost as certainly as the charred husks of Tleilaxu planets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur Prophet, she said. He turned a stricken look toward Odrade but did not focus. What am I to do? These women no longer need me. But I need them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scytale.\" How softly she spoke. \"The Great Convention is ended. It\u0027s a new universe out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to swallow in a dry throat. The whole concept of violence had taken on a new dimension. In the Old Empire, the Convention had guaranteed retaliation against anyone who dared burn a planet by attacking from space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Escalated violence, Scytale.\" Odrade\u0027s voice was almost a whisper. \"We Scatter pods of rage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focused on her. What is she saying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hatred being stored up against Honored Matres,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are not the only one with losses, Scytale. Once, when problems arose in our civilization, the cry went out: \"Bring a Reverend Mother!\" Honored Matres prevent that. And the myths are recomposed. Golden light is cast upon our past. \"It was better in the old days when the Bene Gesserit could help us. Where do you go for reliable Truthsayers these days? Arbitration? These Honored Matres have never heard the word! They were always courteous, the Reverend Mothers. You have to say that for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Scytale did not respond, she said: \"Think of what might happen if that rage were loosed in a jihad!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he still did not speak, she said: \"You have seen it. Tleilaxu, Bene Gesserit, priests of the Divided God, and who knows how many more - all hunted like wild game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They cannot kill us all!\" An agonized cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t they? Your Scattered ones made common cause with Honored Matres. Is that a sanctuary you would seek in the Scattering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there goes another dream: Little pods of Tleilaxu, persistent as festering sores, awaiting the day of Scytale\u0027s Great Revival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People grow strong under oppression,\" he said, but there was no force in his words. \"Even the Priests of Rakis are finding holes in which to hide!\" Desperate words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who says this? Some of your returned friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis silence was all the answer she needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bene Tleilax have killed Honored Matres and they know it,\" she said, hammering at him. \"They will be satisfied only with your extermination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And yours!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are partners by necessity if not by shared belief.\" She said it in purest Islamiyat and saw hope leap into his eyes. Kehl and Shariat may yet take on their old meanings among people who compose their thoughts in the Language of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Partners?\" Faint and extremely tentative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe adopted new bluntness. \"In some ways, that\u0027s a more reliable basis for common action than any other. Each of us knows what the other wants. An intrinsic design: Screen everything through that and something reliable can occur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what is it you want from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How to make the finest tanks, yes.\" He shook his head, obviously unsure. The changes implied by her demands!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade wondered if she dared snap at him in open anger. How dense he was! But he was close to panic. Old values had changed. Honored Matres were not the only source of turmoil. Scytale did not even know the extent of changes that had infected his own Scattered Ones!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Times are changing,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChange, what a disturbing word, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must have my own Face Dancer attendants! And my own tanks?\" Almost begging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Council and I will consider it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is there to consider?\" Throwing her own words at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need only your own approval. I require approval of others.\" She gave him a grim smile. \"So you do get time to think.\" Odrade nodded to Tamalane, who summoned guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to the no-ship?\" He spoke from the doorway, such a diminutive figure amidst burly guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But tonight you ride all the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a last lingering stare at the worm as he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Scytale and guards were gone, Sheeana said: \"You were right not to press him. He was ready to panic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda entered. \"Perhaps it would be best just to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bell! Get the holo and go through our meeting again. This time as a Mentat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You take too much joy in your Sister\u0027s discomfiture, Tam,\" Sheeana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane shrugged but Odrade was delighted. No more teasing of Bell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you spoke of Chapterhouse becoming another Dune, that was when he began to panic,\" Bellonda said, her voice Mentat distant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade had seen the reaction but had not yet made the association. This was a Mentat\u0027s value: patterns and systems, building blocks. Bell sensed a pattern to Scytale\u0027s behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ask myself: Is it the thing become real once more?\" Bellonda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade saw it at once. An odd thing about lost places. As long as Dune had been a known and living planet, there existed a historical firmness about its presence in the Galactic Register. You could point to a projection and say: \"That is Dune. Once called Arrakis and, latterly, Rakis. Dune for its total desert character in Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDestroy the place, though, and a mythological patina inveighed against projected reality. In time, such places became totally mythic. Arthur and his Round Table. Camelot where it only rains at night. Pretty good Weather Control for those days!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, a new Dune had appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Myth power,\" Tamalane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhhhh, yes. Tam, close to her final departure from flesh, would be more sensitive to workings of myths. Mystery and secrecy, tools of the Missionaria, had been used also on Dune by Muad\u0027Dib and the Tyrant. The seeds were planted. Even with priests of the Divided God gone to their own perdition, myths of Dune proliferated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melange,\" Tamalane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Sisters in the workroom knew immediately what she meant. New hope could be injected into the Bene Gesserit Scattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda said: \"Why do they want us dead and not captives? That has always puzzled me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonored Matres might not want any Bene Gesserit alive... only the spice knowledge, perhaps. But they destroyed Dune. They destroyed the Tleilaxu. It was a cautioning thought to take into any confrontation with the Spider Queen - should Dortujla succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No useful hostages?\" Bellonda asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade saw the looks on the faces of her Sisters. They were following a single track as though all of them thought with one mind. Object lessons by Honored Matres, leaving few survivors, only made potential opposition more cautious. It invoked a rule of silence within which bitter memories became bitter myths. Honored Matres were like barbarians in any age: blood instead of hostages. Strike with random viciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dar\u0027s right,\" Tamalane said. \"We\u0027ve been seeking allies too close to home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Futars did not create themselves,\" Sheeana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ones who created them hope to control us,\" Bellonda said. There was the clear sound of Prime Projection in her voice. \"That\u0027s the hesitation Dortujla heard in the Handlers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was and they faced it with all of its perils. It came down to people (as it always did). People - contemporaries. You learned valuable things from people living in your own time and from knowledge they carried out of their pasts. Other Memory was not the only conveyance of history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade felt that she had come home after a long absence. There was a familiarity about the way all four of them were thinking now. It was a familiarity that transcended place. The Sisterhood itself was Home. Not where they lodged in transient housing but the association.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda voiced it for them. \"I fear we have been working at cross purposes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fear does that,\" Sheeana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade dared not smile. It could be misinterpreted and she did not want to explain. Give us Murbella as a Sister and a restored Bashar! Then we might have our fighting chance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight there with that good feeling in her, the message signal clicked. She glanced at the projection surface, a pure reflex, and recognized crisis. Such a small thing (relatively) to precipitate crisis. Clairby mortally injured in a \u0027thopter crash. Mortal unless... The unless was spelled out for her and it added up to cyborg. Her companions saw the message in reverse but you got good at reading mirrored information in here. They knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere do we draw the line?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda, with her antique spectacles when she could have had artificial eyes or any of numerous other prosthetics, voted with her body. This is what it means to be human. Try to hold on to youth and it mocks you while it sprints away. Melange is enough... and perhaps too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade recognized what her own emotions were telling her. But what of Bene Gesserit necessity? Bell could lodge her individual vote and everyone recognized it, even respected it. But Mother Superior\u0027s vote carried the Sisterhood with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst the axlotl tanks and now this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNecessity said they could not afford to lose specialists of Clairby\u0027s caliber. They had few enough as it was. \"Spread thin\" did not describe it. Gaps were appearing. Cyborg Clairby, though, and that was the opening wedge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Suks were prepared. \"A precautionary arrangement\" should it be required for someone irreplaceable. Such as Mother Superior? Odrade knew she had approved that with her usual cautious reservations. Where were those reservations now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCyborg was one of those potpourri words, too. Where did mechanical additions to human flesh become dominant? When was the Cyborg no longer human? Temptations intensified - \"Just this one little adjustment.\" And so easy to adjust until the potpourri-human became unquestioningly obedient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut... Clairby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConditions of extremis said, \"Cyborg him!\" Was the Sisterhood that desperate? She was forced to answer in the affirmative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was then - decision not entirely out of her hands, but the ready excuse at hand. Necessity dictates it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Butlerian Jihad had left its indelible mark on humans. Fought and won... for then. And here was another battle in that long-ago conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, survival of the Sisterhood was in the balance. How many technical specialists remained on Chapterhouse? She knew the answer without looking. Not enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade leaned forward and keyed for transmit. \"Cyborg him,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda grunted. Approval or disapproval? She would never say. This was Mother Superior\u0027s arena and welcome to it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho won this battle? Odrade wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk a delicate line, perpetuating Atreides (Siona) genes in our population because that hides us from prescience. We carry the Kwisatz Haderach in that bag! Willfulness created Muad\u0027Dib. Prophets make predictions come true! Will we ever again dare ignore our Tao sense and cater to a culture that hates chance and begs for prophecy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Archival Summary (adixto)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just after dawn when Odrade arrived at the no-ship but Murbella was up and working with a training mek when Mother Superior strode onto the practice floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade had walked the last klick through ring orchards around the spacefield. Night\u0027s limited clouds had thinned at the approach of dawn, then dissipated to reveal a sky thick with stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recognized a delicate weather shift to wrench another crop from this region but decreasing rainfall was barely enough to keep orchards and pastures alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she walked, Odrade was overcome by dreariness. Winter just past had been a hard-bought silence between storms. Life was holocaust. Dusting of pollen by eager insects, fruiting and seeding that followed the flower. These orchards were a secret storm whose power lay hidden in torrential flows of life. But ohhh! the destruction. New life carried change. The Changer was coming, always different. Sandworms would bring the desert purity of ancient Dune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desolation of that transforming power invaded her imagination. She could picture this landscape reduced to windswept dunes, habitat for Leto II\u0027s descendants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the arts of Chapterhouse would undergo mutation - one civilization\u0027s myths replaced by another\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aura of these thoughts went with Odrade onto the practice floor and colored her mood as she watched Murbella complete a round of flashing exertion, then step back, panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin scratch reddened the back of Murbella\u0027s left hand where she had missed a move by the big mek. The automated trainer stood there in the center of the room like a golden pillar, its weapons flicking in and out - probing mandibles of an angry insect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella wore tight green leotards and her exposed skin glistened with perspiration. Even with the prominent mounding of her pregnancy, she appeared graceful. Her skin glowed with health. It came from within, Odrade decided, partly the pregnancy but something more fundamental as well. This had impressed itself on Odrade at their first encounter, a thing Lucilla had remarked after capturing Murbella and rescuing Idaho from Gammu. Health lived below the surface in her, there like a lens to focus attention on a deep freshet of vitality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe must have her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella saw the visitor but refused to be interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet, Mother Superior. My baby is due soon but this body\u0027s needs will continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade saw then that the mek was simulating anger, a programmed response brought on by frustration of its circuitry. An extremely dangerous mode!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Mother Superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella\u0027s voice came out modulated by her exertions as she dodged and twisted with that almost blinding speed she commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mek slashed and probed for her, its sensors darting and whirring in attempts to follow her movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade sniffed. To speak at such a time amplified the peril of the mek. Risk no distractions when you played this dangerous game. Enough!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mek\u0027s controls were in a large green wall panel to the right of the doorway. Murbella\u0027s changes could be seen in the circuits dangling wires, beamfields with memory crystals dislocated. Odrade reached up and stilled the mechanism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella turned to face her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you change the circuitry?\" Odrade demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the anger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what Honored Matres do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As the twig is bent?\" Murbella massaged her wounded hand. \"But what if the twig knows how it is bent and approves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade felt sudden excitement. \"Approves? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because there\u0027s something... grand about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You follow your adrenaline high?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know it\u0027s not that!\" Murbella\u0027s breathing returned to normal. She stood glaring at Odrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s... being challenged to do more than you ever thought possible. You never suspected you could be this... this good, this expert and accomplished at anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade concealed elation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMens sana in corpore sano. We have her at last!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade said: \"But what a price you pay!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Price?\" Murbella sounded astonished. \"As long as I have the capacity, I\u0027m delighted to pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take what you want and pay for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s your Bene Gesserit magic cornucopia: As I become increasingly accomplished, my ability to pay increases.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beware, Murbella. That cornucopia, as you call it, can become Pandora\u0027s box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella knew the allusion. She stood quite still, her attention fixed on Mother Superior. \"Oh?\" The sound barely escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pandora\u0027s box releases powerful distractions that waste energies of your life. You speak glibly of being \u0027in the chute\u0027 and becoming a Reverend Mother but you still don\u0027t know what that means nor what we want from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it was never our sexual abilities you wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade moved eight paces forward, majestically deliberate. Once Murbella got on that subject there would be no stopping her short of the usual resolution - argument cut short by Mother Superior\u0027s peremptory command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheeana easily mastered your abilities,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you will use her on that child!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade heard displeasure. It was a cultural residue. When did human sexuality begin? Sheeana, waiting now in the no-ship guard chambers, had been forced to deal with it. \"I hope you recognize the source of my reluctance and why I was so secretive, Mother Superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I recognize that a Fremen society filled your mind with inhibitions before we took you in hand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had cleared the air between them. But how was this exchange with Murbella to be redirected? I must let it run while I seek a way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be repetition. Unresolved issues would emerge. The fact that almost every word Murbella uttered could be anticipated, that would be a trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you evade this tested way of dominating others now that you say you need it with Teg?\" Murbella asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slaves, is that what you want?\" Odrade countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes almost closed, Murbella considered this. Did I consider the men our slaves? Perhaps. I produced in them periods of wildly unthinking abandon, a giving up to heights of ecstasy they had never dreamed possible. I was trained to give them that and, thereby, make them subject to our control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil Duncan did the same to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade saw the hooding of Murbella\u0027s eyes and recognized there were things in this woman\u0027s psyche twisted in a way difficult to uncover. Wildness running where we have not followed. It was as though Murbella\u0027s original clarity had been stained indelibly and then that mark covered over and even this cover masked. There was a harshness in her that distorted thoughts and actions. Layer upon layer upon layer...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re afraid of what I can do,\" Murbella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s truth in what you say,\" Odrade agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonesty and candor - limited tools now to be used with care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan.\" Murbella\u0027s voice came out flat with new Bene Gesserit abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fear what you share with him. You find it odd, Mother Superior admitting fear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I know about candor and honesty!\" She made candor and honesty sound repellent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reverend Mothers are taught never to abandon self. We are trained not to encumber ourselves that way with concerns of others. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It goes deeper and has other threads. Being Bene Gesserit marks you in its own ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027re asking: Choose Duncan or the Sisterhood. I know your tricks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are things I won\u0027t do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Each of us is constrained by a past. I make my choices, do what I must because my past is different from yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll continue to train me despite what I\u0027ve just said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade heard this in the total receptivity these encounters with Murbella demanded, every sense alerted to things not spoken, messages that hovered on edges of words as though they were cilia wavering there, reaching for contact with a dangerous universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bene Gesserit must change its ways. And here is one who could guide us into change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda would be horrified at the prospect. Many Sisters would reject it. But there it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Odrade remained silent, Murbella said: \"Trained. Is that the proper word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conditioned. That\u0027s probably more familiar to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you really want is to conjoin our experiences, make me sufficiently like you that we can create trust between us. That\u0027s what all education does.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-20.html","bookId":2158,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM"}
