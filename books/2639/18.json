It stopped ten feet from the ladders, from the man hanging by his feet and his would-be rescuers. Two medics and a fireman jumped out, removed the ladders, shooed back Frohmeyer and his cohorts, then one of them drove the ambulance carefully under Mr. Krank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luther, what are you doing up there?\" Nora yelled as she rushed through the crowd\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it look like?\" he yelled back, and his head pounded harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe medics and the fireman crawled up on the hood of the ambulance, quickly lifted Luther a few inches, unraveled the cord and the rope, then eased him down. A few folks applauded, but most seemed indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe medics checked his vitals, then lowered him to the ground and carried him to the back of the ambulance, where the doors were open. Luther\u0027s feet were numb and he couldn\u0027t stand. He was shivering, so a medic draped two orange blankets over him. As he sat there in the back of the ambulance, looking toward the street, trying to ignore the gawking mob that was no doubt reveling in his humiliation, Luther could only feel relief. His headfirst slide down the roof had been brief but horrifying. He was lucky to be conscious right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet them stare. Let them gawk. He ached too much to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora was there to inspect him. She recognized the fireman Kistler and the medic Kendall as the two fine young men who\u0027d stopped by a couple of weeks ago selling fruitcakes for their holiday fund-raiser. She thanked them for rescuing her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanna go to the hospital?\" asked Kendall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a precaution,\" said Kistler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks,\" Luther said, his teeth chattering. \"Nothing\u0027s broken.\" At that moment, though, everything felt broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA police car arrived in a rush and parked in the street, of course with its lights still flashing. Treen and Salino jumped out and strutted through the crowd to observe things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrohmeyer, Becker, Kerr, Scheel, Brixley, Kropp, Galdy, Bellington-they all eased in around Luther and Nora. Spike was in the middle of them too. As Luther sat there, nursing his wounds, answering banal questions from the boys in uniform, practically all of Hemlock squeezed in for a better view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Salino got the gist of the story, he said, rather loudly, \"Frosty? I thought you guys weren\u0027t doing Christmas this year, Mr. Krank. First you borrow a tree. Now this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on, Luther?\" Frohmeyer called out. It was a public question. Its answer was for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther looked at Nora, and realized she wasn\u0027t about to say a word. The explanations belonged to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blair\u0027s coming home, for Christmas,\" he blurted, rubbing his left ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blair\u0027s coming home,\" Frohmeyer repeated loudly, and the news rippled through the crowd. Regardless of how they felt about Luther at the moment, the neighbors adored Blair. They\u0027d watched her grow up, sent her off to college, and waited for her to come back each summer. She\u0027d babysat for most of the younger kids on Hemlock. As an only child, Blair had treated the other children like family. She was everyone\u0027s big sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she\u0027s bringing her fiance,\" Luther added, and this too swept through the onlookers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Blair?\" asked Salino, as if he were a homicide detective digging for clues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s my daughter,\" Luther explained to the uninformed. \"She left about a month ago for Peru, with the Peace Corps, not going to be back for a year, or so we thought. She called around eleven today. She was in Miami, coming home to surprise us for Christmas, and she\u0027s bringing a fiance, some doctor she just met down there.\" Nora moved closer and was now holding his elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she expects to see a Christmas tree?\" Frohmeyer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a Frosty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about the annual Krank Christmas Eve party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd inched closer as Frohmeyer analyzed things. \"What time does she get here?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plane lands at six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople looked at their watches. Luther rubbed the other ankle. His feet were tingling now, a good sign. Blood was flowing down there again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic Frohmeyer took a step back and looked into the faces of his neighbors. He cleared his throat, raised his chin, and began, \"Okay, folks, here\u0027s the game plan. We\u0027re about to have a party here at the Kranks\u0027, a Christmas homecoming for Blair. Those of you who can, drop what you\u0027re doing and pitch in. Nora, do you have a turkey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said sheepishly. \"Smoked trout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smoked trout?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all I could find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral of the women whispered, \"Smoked trout?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who has a turkey?\" Frohmeyer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have two,\" said Jude Becker. \"Both in the oven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" said Frohmeyer. \"Cliff, you take a team down to Brixley\u0027s and get his Frosty. Get some lights too, we\u0027ll string \u0027em along Luther\u0027s boxwoods here. Everybody go home, change clothes, grab whatever extra food you can find, and meet back here in a half hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Saline and Treen and said, \"You guys head to the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" asked Salino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blair needs a ride home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure if we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I call the Chief?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTreen and Salino headed for their car. The neighbors began to scatter, now that they had their instructions from Frohmeyer. Luther and Nora watched them disperse up and down Hemlock, all moving quickly, all with a purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora looked at Luther with tears in her eyes, and Luther felt like crying too. His ankles were raw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrohmeyer said, \"How many guests are coming to the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" Nora said, staring at the empty street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as many as you think,\" Luther said to her. \"The Underwoods called and canceled. As did Dox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did Father Zabriskie,\" said Nora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Mitch Underwood?\" queried Frohmeyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but he\u0027s not coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a sad little party, thought Frohmeyer. \"So how many guests do you need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody\u0027s invited,\" Luther said. \"The whole street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the entire street,\" Nora added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrohmeyer looked at Kistler and asked, \"How many guys in the station tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can the firemen and medics come too?\" Vic asked Nora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they\u0027re all invited,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the police as well, added Luther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be a crowd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A crowd would be nice, wouldn\u0027t it, Luther?\" Nora said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the blankets tighter and said, \"Yes, Blair would love a crowd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about some carolers?\" Frohmeyer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be nice,\" Nora said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey helped Luther into the house, and by the time he made it to the kitchen he was walking unassisted, but with a severe limp. Kendall left him a plastic cane, one he vowed he wouldn\u0027t use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were alone in the living room, with Trogdon\u0027s tree, Luther and Nora shared a. few quiet moments by the fire. They talked about Blair. They tried in vain to analyze the prospect of a fiance then a groom, then a new son-in-law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were touched beyond words by the unity of their neighbors. The cruise was never mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora looked at her watch and said she had to get ready. \"I wish I\u0027d had a camera,\" she said, walking away. \"You up there hanging by your feet with half the city watching.\" And she laughed all the way to the bedroom. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skipping-christmas/page-18.html","bookId":2639,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM"}
