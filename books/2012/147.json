Columns of black marble, rising in a ring around the glittering mound.

Still a child, really, a sorely used one, and only a bastard would say it had all been for the good. That the finding of faith could only come from terrible suffering. That wisdom was borne on scars. Just a child, dammit, scoured clean of foul addictions, but that look remained, there in her ancient eyes. Knowledge of deadly flavours, a recognition of the self, lying trapped in chains of weakness and desire .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was the Redeemer’s High Priestess.

T’lan Imass, mostly. Bits of polished bone, shells and amber beads had a way of wandering down the sides of the barrow.

A Bridgeburner. He’d trained in military engineering, as much as any Malazan marine had. And now, three months since his return from Darujhistan (and what a mess that had been!) he’d been made a pit captain, but as in his soldiering days he wasn’t one to sit back and let everyone else do all the hard work. No, all of this felt … good. Honest .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d not had a murderous thought in weeks. Well, days then .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was bright, blistering down on the flood plain. On the west road huge wagons were wending up and down from the quarries. And as for the city to the south … he turned, squinted. Glorious light. Kurald Galain was gone.
