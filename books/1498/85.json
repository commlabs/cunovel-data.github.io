It surrounded my body, turning into a ball of golden light; I slowly floated from the ground. When I floated about five meters off the ground, the ball of light suddenly burst and released golden starlight amongst the wide expanse. The stone giants within a hundred meters were completely enveloped by the starlight. As it passed through their solid bodies, open cavities were left behind. The stone giants within 100 meters were completely annihilated. This had created a brief moment of safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I was in the air, I spat out a mouthful of blood from my excessive use of magic power and dropped down. A golden light flashed and Xiao Jin caught me on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred meters away, I saw the stone giants slowly approaching. I shouted through clenched teeth, “Xiao Jin, use the last of your power and bring everyone away, quickly!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jin let out a sound of lament, clearly unwilling to leave me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone had already come over and crowded around. Everyone was injured, we bitterly smiled at one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI urgently said, “Quickly leave! Otherwise it’ll be too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhan Hu smiled, saying, “Foolish Little Brother, do you think we still have the strength to fly out? I’m afraid your magic beast is also unable to carry anyone. Look at his wing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, Xiao Jin’s left wing had a large wound. It seems he could not fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistressed, I said, “Don’t tell me everyone wants this place to be their grave? Blame me. Blame me for having you follow me. Blame me for not listening to Grandpa Barrier’s words and having everyone be buried with me. I am unworthy of you. If I had you leave at the beginning perhaps you still would have been able to escape.” Remorseful tears flowed down my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXing Ao scolded, “Enough. Zhang Gong, we are all good brothers. Although we could live together, is dying together so bad? We’ll just organize another Brilliant Battle Squadron in the afterlife and sweep across the world of ghosts.” With this said, he tightly grasped my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiu Si said, “Xing Ao is correct. We are forever brothers. Besides, you did nothing wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jin lowered his body and licked me with his tongue. Closing his eyes, he snuggled against me. It is clear that he wanted to die together with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone joined hands together. A strong sense of companionship filled our hearts. We saw the stone giants have already reached 50 meters of us, all of them announcing the declaration of certain death. At this time, resistance was already meaningless. Nobody spoke a word more and waited together for death to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giants gradually grew closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e40 meters… 30 meters… 20 meters… 10 meters… 5 meters…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe glanced at each other, then we closed our eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a minute had passed. Baffled, I thought, ‘How am I still not dead? I am not afraid of death. The others were trembling as they waited for death.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to bear the impatience, I opened my eyes. I was stunned by the scene before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same as if we had just entered the Forest of Gods. How dense. How beautiful. The environment was filled with ancient trees that reached the sky. However, the bloodthirsty giants disappeared without a sound. If everyone no longer had the same injuries as before, perhaps I could then reason I was no longer alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, they could no longer wait and one by one everyone opened their eyes. They were all stunned by the scene before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter quite a while, we finally reacted. We simultaneously roared from the joy of escaping mortal danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loudly yelled, “We aren’t dead! We aren’t dead!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jin turned into a gold light and returned to my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is going on? How did those giants disappear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could it be their time ended?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Regardless, nobody died. It is as such.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all sat on the floor and leaned against the large trees. With my mind cleared, I said, “The most important thing right now is to immediately recover our strength.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiu Si took out the rations and water while I took out some medical supplies from my dimensional pocket. Everyone bound their wounds, ate their respective rations and dizzily lied down. We were extremely tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot knowing how long we slept, we all woke up. Everyone’s strength recovered a bit. I also felt much more comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was already late. We had finished eating our rations and sat around the open fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke the silence first, “It would be better to not advance. Let’s travel back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhan Hu said, “No way. We all traveled here with much difficulty. We absolutely cannot give up halfway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, I do not want anyone to continue accompanying me on my adventure. You should all go back. I’ll complete my mission by myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiu Si angrily said, “Zhang Gong, who do you take us for? Are we really so fearful of death? Is there anyone here who here wishes to leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXing Ao loudly said, “Xiu Si words are right. We aren’t shirking cowards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked to the left and then to the right. To my surprise, no one was willing to leave. I sighed and stood up. Then I deeply bowed towards everyone. “Thank you all. You are my greatest brothers.” Emotional tears flowed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDong Ri also stood and embraced my shoulders, “Zhang Gong, what are you doing? We are all brothers. Besides, we too want to witness the holy sword.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhan Hu broke the heavy mood and changed the subject, saying, “We should plan our next move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiu Si said, “I feel that everyone should first recover from their injuries and reach their peak condition. Then we will continue onward. This way, it will be a bit safer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “Right. I think so too. We still don’t know what other dangers lie ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhan Hu said, “I also agree. We should cut down the surrounding trees to make an encirclement. Then we’ll take turns keeping watch. Everyone else will go to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter ten days of rest and organization, everyone had finally recovered to their peak condition. After my previous exertion, Xiao Jin seems to mature a bit. He could already absorb a bit of energy from the world. With this, he can accompany me in battles for a longer period of time. The gold sphere in my body felt more stable than before. It flashed a pure gold inside my body. My magic mimicry attacks (Spells in which I directly use magic power to transform it into my intended form without incantations are called magic mimicry attacks) were much easier to use than before. It seems I have improved. Teacher Di was right, only with continuous temperament could I obtain even greater progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-3-chapter-40\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-3-chapter-42\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-3-chapter-41","bookId":1498,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:31:03 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:31:03 AM"}
