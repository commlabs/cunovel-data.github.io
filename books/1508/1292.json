The following opponents he fought were all weaker than Frost Moon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I admit defeat.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFacing Lin Ming, Blood Carnage wasn’t able to summon the least bit of courage to fight. If it was an opponent that was stronger than him, but not by too much, then Blood Carnage would still fight. Although he would be defeated, it would still be a glorious defeat that tempered himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut facing this freak like Lin Ming who was included in the Divine Seal 12 Children, Blood Carnage was well aware that he would be defeated within two attacks if he fought. In front of several hundred million people, what reason was there to bring shame and trouble upon himself? If he was going to lose like that then it would be better to preserve his own strength to deal with the following matches, because no matter how bad his results were he still needed to fight the full 18 matches. No one hoped to lose all 18 matches in a miserable manner. He would at least need to win another one or two so that it didn’t look too ugly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSoon, Lin Ming obtained a 17 win winning streak.

However, the first tier of people that formed after the first rounds in the finals would only consist of 10 people. Because of this, it wasn’t strange for some of these people to bump into each other, especially the Divine Seal 12 Children.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Lin Ming’s opponent was one of the Divine Seal 12 Children – Ram Saber.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis match would determine who would enter the final top 10.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the same time, Dragon Fang, Shiku, White King, and even Jun Bluemoon all met opponents who had won all 17 of their matches so far.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe last battle would be far more intense than the previous matches.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming hefted the Phoenix Blood Spear and stepped onto the arena stage. His opponent was a thin young man carrying a thick saber on his back. He wasn’t tall and his skin was swarthy, serving as a direct contrast to the tremendous saber he carried that was nearly as wide as his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You are Lin Ming?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe thin youth coldly looked at Lin Ming, his eyes giving off an impression as if he were a wild beast staring at its prey. His gaze held no contempt nor did it carry arrogance.

They had experienced countless battles and gone through numerous dangerous and risky situations. Their fighting intuition had been honed to a terrifying state and no matter the situation, they could remain completely calm and crazy at the same time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen someone faced this youth, it was like facing a wild desolate beast.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaturally, those that were included in the Divine Seal 12 Children weren’t common geniuses of their era.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eVast Cosmos’s voice suddenly rang out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ram Saber, the descendant of Saber Sovereign. Senior Saber Sovereign is a hidden Empyrean that has long been in seclusion. He rose to fame 50 million years ago, and his skills with a saber are fantastic and unrivalled!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eVast Cosmos did something he rarely did and introduced Ram Saber. This was mostly because besides some peak high level figures here, no one, not even ordinary World King powerhouses, knew of the Saber Sovereign. That old man’s era had been far too long ago. In the past he had been known as the number one saber artist in the world, and in these past many years he had been living in seclusion. Nowadays there were very few people who knew of him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHidden Empyreans did not create their own Heavenly Palaces and their wealth was naturally less than ordinary Empyreans’. At the same time, they wouldn’t receive too many direct disciples either. A hidden Empyrean would often receive around 20 disciples, about an average of one every few million years. These Empyreans had extremely harsh and stringent qualifications for who they accepted, so the average quality of their disciples far surpassed the Empyrean descendants of most Empyrean Heavenly Palaces!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“To be specifically introduced by Vast Cosmos, this Saber Sovereign is no laughing matter!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ram Saber is ruthless, but Lin Ming is ruthless too! With two freaks bumping into each other, I wonder just who is fiercer.” Lin Ming’s victory over Frost Moon was still fresh in everyone’s mind. No one thought that Lin Ming was weak any longer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I’ve also seen their matches. From what I can tell, Ram Saber’s style is extremely vicious and cruel, whereas Lin Ming is more versatile, skilled in Laws, speed, and strength. If Lin Ming can draw Ram Saber into an extended battle then he should be able to win with a slight superiority!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs everyone was speaking, Ram Saber suddenly extracted the saber on his back. He slowly stroked the saber edge and said, “I have always followed my master and journeyed through the world. My master has taken 22 disciples in his life so far, but now only two remain; all of the others have died adventuring. This is my first time participating in the First Martial Meeting to gain experience, and you are an extremely wonderful saber whetting stone for me.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRam Saber’s words shocked the entire audience. 22 disciples and yet 19 had died? Wasn’t that just being cruel to one’s own disciples? Those disciples that Saber Sovereign chose must have been outstanding talents of their era, and yet over 90% of them had died in their adventures! This Saber Sovereign was truly heartless.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That is simply Saber Sovereign’s character. It was rumored that when he was young, he was captured by an assassin organization and trained as the ultimate killer. He was in a troop of 10,000 assassins, and they were slowly whittled down using the most brutal methods until only he was left remaining. Without being tempered through blood and pain it is impossible to train a master. When Saber Sovereign receives a disciple, he will always give them a choice and explain to them clearly what lays in their future if they choose to follow. If they fear death they can refuse him.” In the honored guest area, an old man with some knowledge of the Saber Sovereign explained.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe audience was left dumbfounded. In all the various great influences, just who didn’t regard their top disciples as treasures that needed to be protected? When they went out on adventures, these top disciples were usually left with all sorts of contingency treasures to protect them from true death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut Saber Sovereign let them die as they did.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd for Ram Saber to live through the deaths of nearly all his fellow apprentices, his strength could be imagined!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You think I’m a saber whetting stone? I’m only afraid that your saber will wear itself down and break…” Lin Ming said. He pointed the Phoenix Blood Spear to the ground and drew a full arc.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHoh - !\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the arena stage, Ram Saber suddenly turned into a burst of wind as he rushed towards Lin Ming. The saber in his hands came slashing down. All around his body, saber energies gathered, spinning like a tornado. These saber energies fused with each other, rapidly flowing. Upon looking closer, one could see that these saber lights connected from head to toe, overlapping continuously. This was not only a sharp offensive move but it also had strong defensive characteristics.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That is Saber King Domain, one of Senior Saber Sovereign’s unique techniques!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor a peak genius like Ram Saber, having a domain skill was nothing strange at all. Once the Saber King Domain was revealed, the complete defensive and offensive system was difficult to deal with. Even if 10,000 martial artists attacked him, all of them launching a barrage of supernatural abilities, they would still find it hard to pierce through that saber light. If an enemy were to enter that domain they would instantly be torn apart by the wild saber light within.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRam Saber roared out loud and explosive popping noises came from his body. The muscles on his thin body suddenly bulged out as he soared up in height and size.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Blood Pond Hell!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRam Saber suddenly slashed down with his saber. A saber light tore out like an electric python, bringing with it waves of killing intent that were beyond horrifying. This sort of killing intent was gathered by Ram Saber through countless life or death slaughters, finally substantializing into true ghostly demons.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, behind Ram Saber, the phantom of a blood red demon king appeared. Facing this saber, many people felt as if they had fallen into an Asura hell and were sucked deep down into an infinite blood pond, living on the border of life and death as they suffered for all of eternity!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This saber attack!” Lin Ming’s pupil’s shrank. Ram Saber’s attack was not flashy or gorgeous like the techniques of other geniuses, rather, it was the meaning of absolute death and wild destruction. It was like facing an ancient desolate vicious beast; if words were to describe it then it would be called fierce to the extreme.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRam Saber’s saber potential was indomitable. During the last 17 matches, none of his opponents were able to defend against it head-on. The audience stared at Lin Ming with wide eyes, waiting to see how he dealt with this!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming took a step backwards, his knees sinking down and his spear coming down across his body.

The powerful impact forced the ground underneath Lin Ming to blow up, revealing the thundercrush steel and timeless god stone below. Only that sort of foundation was solid enough that it could withstand the tremendous force that tore through Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLike this, Lin Ming’s arms were steady above his head as he forcefully blocked Ram Saber’s strike with the Phoenix Blood Spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRam Saber’s eyes flashed with a trace of surprise. “You can actually block my saber in a frontal strike?

The entire audience also knew this to be true. Even though they were separated by a great distance, they could still feel that saber light crawl up their back, making them shiver.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The first?” Lin Ming chuckled, “I think you will soon discover that there will be a second and a third, moreover… I’m not just blocking your saber.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming summoned his strength, rising up with power flowing through his waist.
