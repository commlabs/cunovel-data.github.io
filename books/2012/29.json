The streets of Jakata suddenly narrowing before his eyes, the houses shrinking, the big men of the block dwindling to boastful midgets with puny eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a whole other world out there, somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandma, caught a glint in your eyes. You’d beaten the dust out of the gold carpet, rolled it out into my path. For these tender feet of mine. A whole other world out there. Called ‘learning’. Called ‘knowledge’. Called ‘magic ’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoots and grubs and tied-off twists of someone’s hair, small puppets and dolls with smeared faces of thread. Webs of gut, bundles of shedding, the plucked backs of crows. Etching on the clay floor, the drip drip of sweat from the brow. Mud was effort, the taste on the tongue that of grit from a licked stylus, and how the candles flickered and the shadows leapt!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrandma? Your gem of a boy tore himself apart. He had fangs in his flesh and those fangs were his own, and round and round it went. Biting, tearing, hissing in agony and fury. Plummeting from the smoke-filled sky. Lifting upward again, new wings, joints creaking, a sliding nightmare .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can’t come back from that. You can’t .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched my own dull flesh, and it was buried under bodies, all that gore draining down. I was pickled in blood. That body, I mean. What used to be mine. You don’t go back, not to that .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead limbs shifting, slack faces turning, pretending to look at me – but I wasn’t the one so rude as to drag them about. No need to accuse me with those blank eyes. Some fool’s coming down, down here, and maybe my soaked skin feels warm, but that’s all the lost heat from all these other corpses .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t come back. Not from that .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather, if you only knew the things I have seen. Mother, if only you’d opened your own heart, enough to bless that broken widow next door .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplain it to this fool, will you? It was a mound of bodies. They’d gathered us. Friend, you weren’t supposed to interfere. Maybe they ignored you, though I can’t figure why. And your touch was cold, gods it was cold!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRats, nuzzling close, they’d snatched fragments of me out of the air. In a world where everyone is a soldier, the ones underfoot don’t get noticed, but even ants fight like fiends. My rats. They worked hard, warm bodies like nests .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn’t get all of me. That wasn’t possible. Maybe you pulled me out, but I was incomplete .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr not. Grandma, someone tied strings to me. With everything coming down all around us, he’d knotted strings. To my Hood-damned rats. Oh, clever bastard, Quick. Clever, clever bastard. All there, all here, I’m all here. And then someone dug me out, carried me away. And the Short-Tails looked over every now and then, milled as if contemplating taking objection, but never did .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carried me away, melting as he went .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the butchering going on. They had a way of puttering about whistling some endless song and pausing every now and then to look distracted by a thought, if not thoroughly confused by its very existence. Like that .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he carried me away, and where was everybody?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pieces were back together, and Bottle opened his eyes. He was lying on the ground, the sun low to the horizon, dew in the yellow grasses close to his face, smelling of the night just past. Morning. He sighed, slowly sat up, his body feeling crazed with cracks. He looked across at the man crouched near a dung fire. His touch was cold. And then he melted . ‘Captain Ruthan Gudd, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man glanced over, nodded, resumed combing his beard with his fingers. ‘It’s a bird, I think.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured at the rounded lump of scorched meat skewered above the embers. ‘Just sort of fell out of the sky. Had feathers but they’ve burned off.’ He shook his head. ‘Had teeth too, however. Bird. Lizard. It’s an even handful of straws in each hand, as the Strike used to say.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re alone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For now. We’ve not been gaining on them much – you start getting heavy after a while.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir, you have been carrying me?’ Melting. Drip drip . ‘How far? How many days?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Carrying you? What am I, a Toblakai? No, there’s a travois … behind you. Dragging’s easier than carrying. Somewhat. Wish I had a dog. When I was a child … well, let’s just say that wishing I had a dog has been an unfamiliar experience. But yesterday I’d have cut a god’s throat for one single dog.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I can walk now, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But can you pull that travois?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-29.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
