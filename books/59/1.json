Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from \"the good fight,\" _For Whom the Bell Tolls_. The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. In his portrayal of Jordan\u0027s love for the beautiful Maria and his suberb account of El Sordo\u0027s last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in _The Sun Also Rises_ and _A Farewell to Arms_ to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving and wise. \"If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,\" Maxwell Perkins wrote to Hemingway after reading the manuscript, \"no one ever so completely performed it.\" Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author\u0027s previous works, it stands as one of the best war novels of all time.\u003c/p\u003e   \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/696/3803.html","bookId":59,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 3:22:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 3:22:30 AM"}
