He snatched up his axe, wrapping his hand around the handle just under the well-worn head. He prodded the hard ground with it as if it were a walking stick as he moved away from the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThibble dorf Pwent, wearing much of his lunch in his beard and on his armor, hopped up right behind, eager to be on his way, and Cordio and Torgar similarly rose to Bruenor\u0027s call, though with less enthusiasm, even with a wary glance to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis just gave a sigh and looked down at the remainder of his meal, a slab of cold beef wrapped with flattened bread, and with a bowl of thick gravy and a biscuit on the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always in a hurry,\" the halfling said to Drizzt, who helped him rewrap the remaining food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bruenor is nervous,\" said Drizzt, \"and anxious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he fears more monsters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because these tunnels are not to his expectations or to his liking,\" the drow explained, and Regis nodded at the revelation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had come into the hole expecting to find a tunnel to the dwarven city of Gauntlgrym, and at first, after their encounter with the strange beasts, things had seemed pretty much as they had anticipated, including a sloping tunnel with a worked wall. The other side seemed more natural stone and dirt, as were the ceiling and floor, but that one wall had left no doubt that it was more than a natural cave, and the craftsmanship evident in the fitted stones made Bruenor and the other dwarves believe that it was indeed the work of their ancestors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that tunnel hadn\u0027t held its promise or its course, and though they were deeper underground, and though they still found fragments of old construction, the trail seemed to be growing cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt and Regis moved quickly to close the distance to the others. With the monsters about, appearing suddenly from the shadows as if from nowhere, the group didn\u0027t dare separate. That presented a dilemma a hundred feet along, when Bruenor led them all into a small chamber they quickly recognized to be a hub, with no fewer than six tunnels branching out from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there ye be!\" Bruenor cried, hefting his axe and punching it into the air triumphantly. \"Ain\u0027t no river or burrowing beast made this plaza.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking around, it was hard for Drizzt to disagree, for other than one side, where dirt had collapsed into the place, the chamber seemed perfectly circular, and the tunnels too equidistant for it to be a random design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar fell to his knees and began digging at the hard-packed dirt, and his progress multiplied many times over when Pwent dropped down beside him and put his spiked gauntlets to work. In a few moments, the battlerager scraped stone, and as he worked his way out to the sides, it became apparent that the stone was flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A paver!\" Torgar announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gauntlgrym,\" Bruenor said to Drizzt and Regis with an exaggerated wink. \"Never doubt an old dwarf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another one!\" Pwent announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure\u0027n the whole place is full o\u0027 them,\" said Bruenor. \"It\u0027s a trading hub for caravans, or I\u0027m a bearded gnome. Yerself\u0027s knowing that,\" he said to Torgar, and the Mirabarran dwarf nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt looked past the three dwarves to the fourth, Cordio, who had moved to the wall between a pair of the tunnels and was scraping at the wall. The dwarf nodded as his knife sank in deeper along a crease in the stone behind the accumulated dirt and mud, revealing a vertical line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do ye know?\" Bruenor asked, leading Torgar and Thibbledorf over to the cleric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, as Cordio broke away a larger piece of the covering grime, it became apparent to all that the cleric had found a door. After a few moments, they managed to clear it completely, and to their delight they were able to pry it open, revealing a single-roomed structure behind it. Part of the back left corner had collapsed, taking a series of shelves down with it, but other than that, the place seemed frozen in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwarven,\" Bruenor was saying as Drizzt moved to the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf stood off to the side of the small door, examining a rack holding a few ancient metal artifacts. They were tools or weapons, obviously, and Bruenor upended one to examine its head, which could have been the remnants of a pole arm, or even a hoe, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might be dwarven,\" Torgar agreed, examining the shorter-handled item beside the one Bruenor had lifted, one showing the clear remains of a spade. \"Too old to know for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwarven,\" Bruenor insisted. He turned and let his gaze encompass the whole of the small house. \"All the place is dwarven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others nodded, more because they couldn\u0027t disprove the theory than because they had reached the same conclusions. The remnants of a table and a pair of chairs might well have been dwarf-made, and seemed about the right size for the bearded folk. Cordio moved around those items to a hearth, and as he began clearing the debris from it and scraping at the stone, that, too, seemed to bolster Bruenor\u0027s argument. For there was no mistaking the craftsmanship evident in the ancient fireplace. The bricks had been so tightly set that the passage of time had done little to diminish the integrity of the structure, and indeed it seemed as if, with a bit of cleaning, the companions could safely light a fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt, too, noted that hearth, and paid particular heed to the shallowness of the fireplace, and the funnel shape of the side walls, widening greatly into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The plaza\u0027s a forward post for the city,\" Bruenor announced as they began moving back out. \"So I\u0027m guessing that the city\u0027s opposite the tunnel we just came down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the lead!\" said Pwent, heading that way at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good guess on the door,\" Bruenor said to Cordio, and he patted the cleric on the shoulder before he and Torgar started off after the battlerager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t a guess,\" Drizzt said under his breath, so that only Regis could hear. And Cordio, for the dwarf glanced back at Drizzt - his expression seeming rather sour, Regis thought - then moved off after his king, muttering, \"Wouldn\u0027t need pavers this far down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis looked from him to Drizzt, his expression begging answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a free-standing house, and not a reinforced cave dwelling,\" Drizzt explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis glanced around. \"You think there are others, separating the exit tunnels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what does that mean? There were many free-standing houses in the bowels of Mirabar. Not so uncommon a thing in underground cities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True enough,\" Drizzt agreed. \"Menzoberranzan is comprised of many similar structures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cordio\u0027s expression spoke of some significance,\" the halfling remarked. \"If this type of structure is to be expected, then why did he wear a frown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you note the fireplace?\" Drizzt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwarven,\" Regis replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fireplace was not a cooking pit, primarily,\" Drizzt explained. \"It was designed to throw heat into the room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis shrugged, not understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are far enough underground so that the temperature hardly varies,\" Drizzt informed him, and started off after the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis paused for just a moment, and glanced back at the revealed structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we search this area more completely?\" the halfling asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow Bruenor,\" Drizzt replied. \"We will have our answers soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kept their questions unspoken as they hurried to join up with the four dwarves, which took some time, for the excited Bruenor led them down the tunnel at a hurried pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnel widened considerably soon after, breaking into what seemed to be a series of parallel tracks of varying widths continuing in the same general direction. Bruenor moved without hesitation down the centermost of them, but they found it to be a moot choice anyway, since the tunnels interconnected at many junctures. What they soon discerned was that this wasn\u0027t so much a series of tunnels as a singular pathway, broken up by pillars, columns, and other structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one such interval, they came upon a low entrance, capped diagonally by a structure that had obviously been made by skilled masons, for the bricks could still be seen, and they held fast despite the passage of centuries and the apparent collapse of the building, which had sent it crashing to the side into another wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be a shaft, pitched for a fast descent,\" Bruenor remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a building that tipped,\" Cordio argued, and Bruenor snorted and waved his hand dismissively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Torgar, who had moved closer, said, \"Aye, it is.\" He paused and looked up. \"And one that fell a long way. Or slid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how\u0027re ye knowin\u0027 that?\" Bruenor asked, and there was no mistaking the hint of defiance. He was catching on, obviously, that things weren\u0027t unfolding the way he\u0027d anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar was already motioning them over, and began pointing out the closest corner of the structure, where the edge of the bricks had been rounded, but not by tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We see this in Mirabar all the time,\" Torgar explained, running a fat thumb over the corner. \"Wind wore it round. This place was under the sky, not under the rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s wind in some tunnels,\" said Bruenor. \"Currents and such blowin\u0027 down strong from above.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar remained unconvinced. \"This building was up above,\" he said, shaking his head, \"for years and years afore it fell under.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah!\" Bruenor snorted. \"Ye\u0027re guessin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might be that Gauntlgrym had an aboveground market,\" Cordio interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt looked at Regis and rolled his eyes, and as the dwarves moved off, the halfling grabbed Drizzt by the sleeve and held him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t believe that Gauntlgrym had an aboveground market?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gauntlgrym?\" Drizzt echoed skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t believe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than the market of this place was above ground, I fear,\" said Drizzt. \"Much more. And Cordio and Torgar see it, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not Bruenor,\" said Regis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be a blow to him. One he is not ready to accept.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think this whole place was a city above ground?\" Regis stated. \"A city that sank into the tundra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us follow the dwarves. We will learn what we will learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnels continued on for a few hundred more feet, but the group came to a solid blockage, one that sealed off all of the nearby corridors. Torgar tapped on that wall repeatedly with a small hammer, listening for echoes, and after inspecting it at several points in all the tunnels, announced to the troop, \"There\u0027s a big open area behind it. I\u0027m knowin\u0027 it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forges?\" Bruenor asked hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar could only shrug. \"Only one way we\u0027re goin\u0027 to find out, me king.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they set their camp right there, down the main tunnel at the base of the wall, and while Drizzt and Regis went back up the tunnel some distance to keep watch back near the wider areas, the four dwarves devised their plans for safely excavating. Soon after they had shared their next meal, the sound of hammers rang out against the stone, none more urgent than Bruenor\u0027s own. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-orc-king-transitions-1/page-14.html","bookId":2187,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:14 PM"}
