The rush of static crept down my arms, jumping from the tips of my fingers through the wood. The click of the lock turning sounded like a nuclear bomb going off in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a moment to prepare myself for what could be waiting on the other side of the door. If someone were in there, I’d have to defend myself. The idea of hurting someone, possibly killing him or her, sickened me, but I knew whoever it was wouldn’t stop twice from locking me up in a cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelling myself I could do this, I opened the door and slowly stepped into the kitchen. A light was on above the stove, casting the room in soft light. I shut the door behind me and drew in a deep breath. This is insane. I crept forward, grateful for the thin soles on my boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimid Katy no more…I’d moved onto good old B\u0026amp;E.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalling my hands up under the sleeves of my hoodie, I moved down the hallway. The dining room was empty with the exception of a rolled-up sleeping bag on the floor. Two couches were pressed against the wall in the living room. There wasn’t a TV. It reminded me of a model home where everything was fake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gave me the creeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding a breath, I went upstairs slowly. Nothing about this house seemed real. It had no homey smells like leftover food or perfume. It smelled vacant. At the top of the stairs, there was a bathroom that had clearly been in use. There were hair products on the sink—gel and two toothbrushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach tightened as I left the bathroom. All the bedroom doors were open. Each of them just had a bed and a dresser. All were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last room at the end of the hall was an office of sorts. A large desk sat in the middle of the otherwise empty room. There was a monitor on the top, but no hard drive. Moving around the desk, I pulled out the center drawer. Nothing. I checked the side drawers, becoming frustrated when they were all empty. I yanked open the last one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jackpot,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out a file folder that was thick and heavy at the bottom. Lifting the file out carefully, I laid it on the desk and flipped it opened. There were pictures, hundreds of pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands shook as I went through them. A buzzing filled my ears as I turned over picture after picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of me walking from my car to the front of school in short sleeves. There were several from outside the Smoke Hole Diner, and I could just make out Dee and me sitting in front of the window, then one of us walking out the door, my arm in a splint and Dee laughing. Several more photos showed us together, at school, on my front porch, and in her car. There was one of us hugging in front of the FOOLAND, the first day I’d met her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there were pictures of Daemon, eyes narrowed and face drawn tight as he was snapped walking around his SUV, keys clenched in his hand. Another was him standing on his porch, shirtless and in jeans, with me on his steps, glaring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up one, holding it in the light that came through the window. I was in my red two-piece bathing suit, standing on the bank of the lake. I’d been looking off to the side, and Daemon had been watching me, smiling—really smiling—unbeknownst to me. I hadn’t known he ever smiled around me at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped the picture as if it burned my skin. And it did on a surreal level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more. Photos chronicling from the time I arrived in this place up until a few days ago. There were pictures of my mom heading to work, some with her and Will. There were no pictures of Blake and me together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the worst picture, the one that almost dropped me to my knees was one of Daemon carrying me back from the lake the night I’d been sick. The photo was dark and grainy, but I could make out the white sleep shirt, the way my arm hung limp, the look of pure concentration on Daemon’s face as he had one foot on the porch step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, could they be watching me now? I couldn’t let myself think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sense of violation sliced through skin and bone. They’d been watching us from the beginning. I wanted to take all these pictures. I wanted to burn them. Where there should’ve been fear, there was only anger. Who gave them the right to do this? With an anger so potent I could taste it, I gathered up the photos and placed them back in the file. I knew I couldn’t take them. Shoving them back into the drawer, I stood with hands trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom of the drawer poked up at the corner. Shoving the file back, I reached down and felt around until I got a grip on the edge. Peeling the contact paper back, I saw several sheets of paper. Most of them were receipts, which seemed odd to hide, considering everything. There were bank slips, too, showing money transfers. My eyes bugged at the amounts. Another slip of paper had an address with the letters DB written under it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson Black? Dee Black? Daemon Black?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoving the slip of paper into my pocket, I pressed the contact paper back down and put the file away. I closed the door, feeling numb as I started to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing in here?” a voice demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart leaped in my throat at the question. I jerked up, letting the rush of energy move along my skin, but the moment I locked eyes with the person standing in the doorway, I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoonlight coming in from the window washed over Bethany’s pale face as she stepped into the room. Jeans and a T-shirt hung off her slender body. Her dirty hair fell in clumps. “What are you doing in here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bethany?” I croaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked her head to the side. “Katy?” Her voice mimicked mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaken aback by the fact she knew my name, I stared at her. “How do you know who I am?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn eerie, faint smile tugged at her lips. “Everyone knows who you are,” she said in a singsong voice that reminded me of a child. “And so do I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. “You mean the DOD?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean whoever is watching knows. They always know. They always hope, too. Whenever we get close.” She paused, closing her eyes, sighing. “They hope we get close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, boy, this chick was cracked like Humpty Dumpty. “Beth, is the DOD keeping you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keeping me?” She giggled. “I can no longer be kept. He knows that. He keeps catching me, though. It’s almost like a game. A never-ending game where no one really wins. I come here…my family. My family is no longer here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. “You really shouldn’t be here. They will see you. They will take you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” I wiped my sweaty palms on my jeans. “Beth, we can—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t trust him,” she whispered, glancing around the room. “I did. I trusted him with my life, and look what happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who? Blake?” Not like she needed to tell me that. “Look, you can come with me. We can keep you safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened, shaking her head. “You can’t do anything for me now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we can.” I took a step forward, reaching out to her. “We can help you, protect you. We can get Dawson back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dawson?” she said, eyes going wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, hoping I’d found the key to make her listen to me. “Yes, Dawson! We know he’s alive—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany threw up her hand, and a burst of hurricane-strength winds slammed into my chest, lifting me off my feet. I hit the wall with enough force I swore I heard plaster crack. And I stayed there, pinned several feet off the ground, my hands and legs planted against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently bringing up Dawson’s name was not the right thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved so fast I didn’t see her until she was standing below me. Long, stringy strands of hair lifted off her shoulders, spreading out around her like a modern-day Medusa. Her feet came off the ground as the outline of her body blurred, swathed in a bluish light. Within seconds, she was eye level with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly crap…I’d never seen Blake do anything like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no hope for me,” she said, dropping the kid voice. “I’m not even sure there is any hope for you. So you should leave here, take your chances with the Arum, or you’ll end up like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcy fear trickled down my spine. “Bethany…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to me and listen closely.” She was now above me, looking down as her head nearly touched the vaulted ceilings. “Everyone is a liar. The DOD?” She laughed, a high-pitched giggle. “They don’t even know what they plan. They are coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?” I tried to peel my head off the wall, but she wouldn’t let me budge. “Beth, who is coming!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue light enveloped her completely. “You need to go NOW!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly dropped from the wall, hitting the floor in front of the door with a loud grunt. Scrambling to my feet, I whipped around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethany looked just like a Luxen, except her light was blue and less intense. She floated over the ceiling, her voice picking up in my head. Go. Go before it’s too late. GO!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pulse of energy nudged me out the door and down the hall. She wasn’t giving me much of a choice. At the top of the stairs, I spun around and tried one more time. “Bethany, we can—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid down the wall and lifted both hands. Before I could scream, I tipped over the top step and fell backward down the steep stairs. I stopped a foot above the landing, bouncing in air as if I were hooked to a bungee cord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet swung down onto the landing, and I was suddenly standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo, her voice urged. Get far away from here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands were cold and shaking by the time I turned the ignition in my sedan. Snow was falling steadily, coating the streets. I needed to get home before I got stuck. I had bad tires, no match for more than an inch of snow. And I really didn’t want to break down out here. These were the things I was busy thinking about. I had to keep everything else at bay until I could get home and successfully freak out. Now I just needed to get there without running off the road and smacking into a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway to my house, two approaching headlights sped up in the other lane, going in the direction I’d just come from. As the car neared me, the back of my neck tingled. The SUV’s tires squealed as it spun around, rushing up behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit,” I whispered, glancing at the dashboard. It was close to midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon tailed me the whole way home, repeatedly calling me. I ignored the calls, focusing on the ever-increasing lack of visibility due to the snow. The moment I parked in my driveway, he was at the side of my car, throwing open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where in the hell were you coming back from?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed out of the car. “Where were you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared down at me. “I have a feeling it was the same place you were coming back from, but I’m telling myself that you can’t be that stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy look matched his as I stomped up my steps. “Well, since that’s where you were going, I guess that means you’re stupid, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seriously went there, didn’t you?” He sounded incredulous as he followed me inside. “Please tell me that’s not where you were. That you were just out for a midnight drive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a bland look over my shoulder. “I went to Vaughn’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral moments went by as he stared at me. Flakes of snow melted, dampening the locks of hair clinging to his cheeks. “You’re insane.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-46.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
