If we were in a novel, that would be the denouement,\n\u003cbr\u003e wouldn\u0027t it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s really awfully queer not to know what one is--sort of\n\u003cbr\u003e exciting and romantic. There are such a lot of possibilities. \n\u003cbr\u003e Maybe I\u0027m not American; lots of people aren\u0027t. I may be straight\n\u003cbr\u003e descended from the ancient Romans, or I may be a Viking\u0027s daughter,\n\u003cbr\u003e or I may be the child of a Russian exile and belong by rights\n\u003cbr\u003e in a Siberian prison, or maybe I\u0027m a Gipsy--I think perhaps I am. \n\u003cbr\u003e I have a very WANDERING spirit, though I haven\u0027t as yet had much\n\u003cbr\u003e chance to develop it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you know about that one scandalous blot in my career the time I ran\n\u003cbr\u003e away from the asylum because they punished me for stealing cookies? \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s down in the books free for any Trustee to read. But really,\n\u003cbr\u003e Daddy, what could you expect? When you put a hungry little nine-year\n\u003cbr\u003e girl in the pantry scouring knives, with the cookie jar at her elbow,\n\u003cbr\u003e and go off and leave her alone; and then suddenly pop in again,\n\u003cbr\u003e wouldn\u0027t you expect to find her a bit crumby? And then when you\n\u003cbr\u003e jerk her by the elbow and box her ears, and make her leave the table\n\u003cbr\u003e when the pudding comes, and tell all the other children that it\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e because she\u0027s a thief, wouldn\u0027t you expect her to run away?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I only ran four miles. They caught me and brought me back;\n\u003cbr\u003e and every day for a week I was tied, like a naughty puppy, to a stake\n\u003cbr\u003e in the back yard while the other children were out at recess.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, dear! There\u0027s the chapel bell, and after\n\u003cbr\u003e chapel I have a committee meeting. I\u0027m\n\u003cbr\u003e sorry because I meant to write you a very entertaining letter this time.\n\u003cbr\u003e Auf wiedersehen\n\u003cbr\u003e Cher Daddy,\n\u003cbr\u003e Pax tibi!\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. There\u0027s one thing I\u0027m perfectly sure of I\u0027m not a Chinaman.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59753.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
