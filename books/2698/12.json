Brendan urged his own horse to hurry and followed. As they approached, several of the people who had been tending the fire greeted them, but Cody only waved distractedly as he leaped off his horse, threw the reins over the fence and strode quickly toward the tense scene on the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter with you, Cole?\" Alex was saying as Cody approached. \"How dare you dig up my father? You had no right to disturb his grave-any of these graves. Why did you do it, Cole? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody knew the minute she saw him coming, because she stiffened, her eyes narrowing in fury. His stomach took a dive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex,\" he said sharply. \"Don\u0027t lash into Cole-none of this is his fault or even his doing. If you need to blame someone, blame me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cody, it\u0027s all right, I can take care of myself,\" Cole said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Cody could speak again, Alex walked over to him with long, hard strides and shoved him hard. \"What the hell are you doing? Everyone has been so grateful for your knowledge and help, everyone has done everything you\u0027ve ordered. But now you\u0027re taking advantage of this community. What? Did you draw straws, trying to decide who you should disinter and chop to pieces? What kind of a ghoul are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slammed his chest hard again to emphasize her anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her wrists. \"Alex, listen. We didn\u0027t choose anything. We only did what we had to do. I\u0027m sure Cole would have explained-if you\u0027d given him a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you dig up these people? Why did you dig up my father?\" she demanded furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, we didn\u0027t choose to dig them up. They\u0027d already dug themselves out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Her eyes widened in shocked realization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what vampires are-you\u0027ve seen them. When a person is bled to death by a vampire, they come back. How the hell did you think it happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"But...they were in their graves! Cole said you had to decapitate them, like the man who died in the street, like the vampires we killed last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Cody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared from him to Cole. \"So you found them in their graves? But...why weren\u0027t they with Milo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milo doesn\u0027t want everyone he infects. He leaves them to stumble around like newborns, starving, desperate, deadly newborns. Alex, we let them rest in peace. We keep them from killing, don\u0027t you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my father? You did that to my father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody was silent for a split second too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Cole told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he wasn\u0027t in his grave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him for a long moment, saying nothing. Then she turned and raced down the hill to where her mare was tethered. She mounted in one smooth motion, and then, kicking up dust, horse and rider went racing off toward town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where in hell is she going?\" Dave demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody didn\u0027t answer him. He was already halfway down the hill, intent on following Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA LEX COULD HAVE HEADED straight to the lodging house. Beulah always kept alcohol on hand-for medicinal purposes, the cook said-and she could have chosen from brandy, sherry and perhaps some wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t want to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reined in at the saloon, sliding from Cheyenne\u0027s back and leaving the mare loosely tied at the hitching post in front. Then she strode through the swinging doors and walked straight to the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoscoe looked at her, hesitant. As if he was afraid of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like a whiskey, Roscoe,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...pardon?\" he said, blinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like a whiskey,\" she repeated more slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Alex...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A whiskey, Roscoe,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, turned and poured her a drink. Alex took a long swallow, and a shudder racked her body. She grimaced. God, the stuff tasted awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as it burned its way down her throat and into her stomach, she found that, oddly enough, it did give her strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all crazy, she thought. Her father was not a vampire. He was nothing like Milo Roundtree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun around. Jigs was sitting on the piano bench, his back toward the keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Jigs,\" she said glumly, then looked at him more closely. She frowned. He looked tired, ashen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I reckon I\u0027m tired, and I know I\u0027m worried. Dave Hinton right kindly been sleeping here the last couple of nights. He keeps vigil from midnight to 4:00 a.m., then I take over for a few hours, and then Roscoe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard footsteps and looked up. Linda was coming down the stairs. Alex tried to watch her objectively. It was just so difficult, seeing Linda-Linda Gordon, that was her name now-so blithe and overt about her promiscuous sexuality when Eugene Gordon had done her the honor of making her his wife. When Alex had left after their conversation the other day, she had found herself actually liking the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, on top of what she\u0027d just learned about her father, Linda, in all her skimpy finery, was the last person Alex wanted to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, sweetie?\" Linda asked casually on her way to the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You watched them bury my father, right? I mean, you weren\u0027t out of town, seeking the future, before he was buried, were you?\" Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda started, then smiled slowly. \"Ooh. Sweet little Alex has claws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just answer me. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amusement on the other woman\u0027s features faded. \"Of course I was at his funeral. Which you didn\u0027t attend, I might add.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t even know he was dead. You know damned well he was buried long before the letters ever reached me,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda still seemed wary after Alex\u0027s initial attack. \"I saw him buried, yes. Jim Green took care of him, and the pastor came over from Brigsby to make sure he was buried with a full Christian ceremony,\" Linda said. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex didn\u0027t get a chance to answer. Cody, who was suddenly standing just inside the swinging doors, spoke for her. \"Because he\u0027s not in his grave. That\u0027s why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda looked from Cody to Alex. \"Of course he\u0027s in his grave,\" she said, as if they\u0027d both lost their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s not,\" Cody said. \"We dug up his grave the other day. The earth was already disturbed, and his coffin wasn\u0027t sealed. And he wasn\u0027t in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda shook her head, wrinkling her nose prettily. \"I don\u0027t understand. Are you accusing me of stealing Eugene\u0027s body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not accusing anyone of anything,\" Cody said, walking over to join them. \"I\u0027m just stating a fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, you are,\" Alex said, rounding on him. \"You\u0027re accusing my father of being a vampire. Like Milo Roundtree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never said he was like Milo Roundtree,\" Cody argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God in heaven,\" Roscoe breathed, pouring a whiskey into the shot glass and downing it in one swift movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they all have to be destroyed. They\u0027re all monsters, right?\" Alex demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody was stubbornly silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex looked at Linda again. \"Tell me, have you seen my father? Has he been hanging around outside your balcony, calling to you-quoting from Cyrano, maybe. Or maybe Shakespeare. He always loved Shakespeare. Maybe he\u0027s playing Romeo, trying to entice his Juliet to come out and have her neck bitten and her blood sucked dry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex,\" Linda murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex was in a state verging on hysterics, and she knew it. She should have gone home. She would go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and headed toward the door, pushing past Cody to make her escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole and Dave were just tethering their horses and stepping up onto the wooden sidewalk. \"Alex,\" Cole said sympathetically. \"One of us should have-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now, Cole,\" she said. Without another word, she collected Cheyenne\u0027s reins and led her horse home, walking her around the side of the house to the stable. Levy must have heard her coming; he was waiting at the barn door to take the horse from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Alex? You all right?\" he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell does \u0027all right\u0027 even mean around here anymore?\" she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Levy\u0027s look of sympathy that pierced through the miasma of fear and dread that had gripped her and touched something in her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced a smile. \"I\u0027m fine, Levy. How are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, Miss Alex. I feel good, and angry-and strong,\" he assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Levy.\" She turned and started toward the back door of the boardinghouse, then stopped and looked back at him. \"Levy, do you ever have dreams? Nightmares?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"No, not really. Well, not that I remember, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever dreamed about my father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Miss Alex.\" He frowned, clearly confused by the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, hesitating, as she felt tears welling in her eyes. She blinked them back. \"If you ever should dream about him-if you think he may be calling to you, asking for help, or just looking for you-don\u0027t go to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon, miss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go to him. Promise me you won\u0027t go to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I promise, Miss Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring at her, but not in a way that suggested she was crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it was a look of helplessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled sadly, shook her head and went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe passed through the kitchen, where Beulah was preparing dinner, stirring something in a pot that bubbled over the fire. Tess was sitting at the table, peeling potatoes, and Jewell was next to her, snapping peas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are, Alex. I was about to get worried. I wonder if them fellows will be back for dinner tonight. Well, you go ahead and wash up. Won\u0027t be long now till the food is ready,\" Beulah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m going straight to bed tonight, Beulah. Feels like I just ate lunch,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You\u0027ve got to eat,\" Beulah insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex ignored her and headed upstairs, well aware that Cody and Brendan would be coming back soon, and not in the mood for conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe headed straight to her room. There was clean water in the ewer, and she poured some into the washbowl, then doused her face. She prayed it would somehow make her feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was done, she pulled off her boots and hose, and lay on her bed, staring up at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one knew how her father had died. They had simply found his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been torn to shreds, just lying there...dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead as if someone had sucked all the blood from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been prepared for burial and interred in the ground. Six feet under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he was no longer in his grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t feel angry anymore. She felt numb. She told herself that her father could never be a monster, and she thought about her dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been about to hurt her. He had been trying to save her from Milo Roundtree. He had been warning her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winced, remembering how Cody had warned people that they mustn\u0027t be fooled by the cries of their loved ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father was different. Had to be different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose and went over to her dressing table, where she sat thoughtfully brushing her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head as if she could clear the awful implications of what might have happened to her father from her mind. Once the concept of vampires would have struck her as ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had seen them, had seen them swooping down, black shadow-bats with death in their eyes, and she had seen what had happened when they were killed. She had seen April Snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay down again. If she could sleep, it might be possible to dream, and...maybe in a dream she could reach out and find her father. If her previous dream had truly been a vision, he wasn\u0027t with Milo Roundtree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t become a vicious killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe what? He was living alone, hiding out somewhere, fighting the blood thirst, that, according to Cody, had to be ravaging him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was true, maybe...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes, willing her breathing to come slow and easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC ODY ENTERED THE HOUSE through the front and went from room to room, looking for Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to the entry, he found Beulah and demanded, \"She\u0027s here, isn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeulah nodded. \"What\u0027s going on, Mr. Fox? Why is she so upset?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no reason to honey-coat his words with Beulah, who always got straight to the point herself. \"Her father\u0027s grave is empty. We discovered it the other day, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But no one wanted to tell Alex, and you were sure you had the situation under control,\" Beulah said tartly. Cody stared at her, and she went on. \"Well, you know what, Mr. Fox? I believe if anyone can control what\u0027s happening around here, it\u0027s you. But that don\u0027t mean you can manage Miss Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up in her room, and you leave her alone right now, Mr. Fox. You can talk to Alex when she\u0027s had a chance to calm down a bit and think things out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody frowned suddenly. \"Beulah, you haven\u0027t had the sense that Eugene\u0027s been around here, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, no!\" Beulah protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beulah? This place is decorated with crosses and garlic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her chin and answered him with great dignity. \"My grandmother was a wise woman, Mr. Fox. She was a slave in Haiti, but she came to the United States during the Haitian Revolution. She taught us things she\u0027d learned back in Africa and things she\u0027d learned from her French master. She knew all about the walking dead. Once Mr. Eugene was gone, I decided we needed to do everything we could to keep this place safe, what with the things going on in Brigsby and Hollow Tree.\" She sniffed. \"Didn\u0027t help much the night those filthy scallywags came in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a boardinghouse, a public place,\" Cody said. \"But Brendan and I are here now, and we\u0027re prepared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prepared?\" Beulah said. \"Maybe here, but the people of Victory are spread out all over the countryside. All the ranches, all the farms. And there\u0027s John Snow\u0027s place, and the Apache camp, and...Oh, Lord, Mr. Fox, what would happen if they got into the Apache camp, if they...made those warriors into monsters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody groaned; she was echoing his own thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t wait for that to happen. We intend to find Milo and his gang, and exterminate them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeulah nodded. \"I\u0027m glad to hear that,\" she said. \"For now, you come and sit down and have a nice dinner. You and Mr. Vincent, you\u0027re going to be needing your strength. Then you can go and talk to Miss Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCOLE AND DAVE PLAYED poker at the saloon, whiling away the time until sunset. The minute the sky began to don its nightly cloak of crimson, Cole grew wary and alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were armed, just as he\u0027d told the entire town to be. Eight bows, eight quivers of arrows and a stack of sharp stakes were at the ready, and garlic and crosses guarded all the doors and windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls, now that the men of the town were battening down their homes each night, had gotten bored with card games and gossip sessions, and gone upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoscoe was sleeping behind the bar until an attack came or it was his turn to stand watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJigs was up and alert, staring at the new saloon doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new doors had just gone up an hour ago; the swinging doors with their implicit welcome had seemed not only inappropriate but an invitation to danger. The wooden doors that had taken their place were rough, not sanded or painted, but they had a bolt that kept them closed. Cole wasn\u0027t sure just how much good the new doors would do, given that the saloon was still technically open to the public, but he would take what he could get, and they were as ready as they would ever be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was restless, and he tossed his cards down on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danged if you didn\u0027t beat me again, Cole,\" Dave said with disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinning a hand of cards had been the last thing on Cole\u0027s mind. He rose and walked over to Jigs. \"Jigs, Dave and I are here. You look like you\u0027ve been rode hard and put away wet, so go to bed and try to get some sleep now in case we need you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJigs looked up at him. \"Ain\u0027t right, Sheriff. Ought to be me, watching over the place. Me and Roscoe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole set a hand on his shoulder. \"Go to bed, Jigs. We\u0027ll wake you later, so we can catch some sleep. Now, get to bed or you\u0027ll be so tired, you won\u0027t be any good to anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJigs stood and arched his back, stretching. \"I guess you\u0027re right, Sheriff.\" He shook his head. \"Don\u0027t see how this can come to no good end. This town can\u0027t make it, everybody hiding all the time. This saloon, those girls...well, we can\u0027t survive without customers, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can hold out, Jigs. We got help when those other towns didn\u0027t. We\u0027ll win. You wait and see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJigs might not have believed him, but he was too tired to argue. With a wave of his hand and a muffled \"Thank you, Sheriff,\" he shuffled on up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so tired, Jigs thought. Dead tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced at his own choice of words and looked around as if afraid someone might have overheard his thoughts. \"Dead\" just wasn\u0027t a word to be using loosely these days, even in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked his window, which was securely locked, and rearranged the crosses and garlic around it. If anything happened downstairs, the noise would wake him, he knew, so he crashed down on his bed still dressed, boots and all. In two seconds, he was drifting off to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJigs liked sleeping lately, thanks to the erotic dreams he\u0027d been having. He didn\u0027t have any trouble finding women in Victory because of his mixed ancestry. Hell, not in a whorehouse. But finding love, that was something else again. Truth was, he was ugly, and women didn\u0027t cotton to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in his dreams...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dreams, she would sneak right into his room, then kind of slink up to the side of his bed. He would open his eyes, and she\u0027d be standing there, smiling. She would put a finger to her lips to warn him to keep quiet, and then she would grin mischievously and start to do things to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot...everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut enough. Enough to have him panting like a schoolboy as she cuddled up beside him, all lean and sleek, and whispered in his ear. She liked to tease, to nip at his earlobes and caress his neck. He\u0027d feel a pinch now and then, but then she\u0027d start licking him, soothing his flesh, and he would be just about flying out of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s our little secret, Jigs,\" she would whisper as she left. \"I wouldn\u0027t want the other girls knowing what a treasure you are. And I sure don\u0027t want anyone knowing that I come to you...on the house!\" That always made her giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she would be gone, leaving him alone in bed to relish the lingering arousal of that dream. He was always so tired afterward, but tired in a way that made him smile. What a fine way for a man to get so exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew they were just dreams...but every man deserved his dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA LEX TRIED TO PICTURE her father. He was a good-looking man, and not so old, only forty-five. His hair was graying, but that only enhanced the character evident in his face. He was straight-backed, broad-shouldered and fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pictured him out on the plain on the last day of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to feel the breeze, the touch of the sun, the glow of the sunset. She imagined the tumbleweeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow me...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a thought. It was a prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no matter how hard she tried to conjure the image of her father, the picture kept slipping away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t fair. He had already come to her once in a vision. Why couldn\u0027t she recapture that vision now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even as she tried, it was as if dark clouds came roiling through her mind, blocking both the plain and the image of her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe darkness was thick, with a life of its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it began to clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw a house. A pretty ranch house, and around it there were fields, some of them fenced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was familiar, and she was sure it had been there a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a horse whinny, then another, and knew that there were stables just beyond the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd inside...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside there was usually the smell of fresh-baked goods and the laughter of children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved inside in her dream, her vision, and realized that tonight, while it was still early, the children and their mother had gone to bed, while her husband doused the lights. She knew them, she realized. Bill and Dolores Simpson. Poor couple, still mourning their beloved Amy, who\u0027d been like sunshine in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she watched, Bill finally got into bed, and the house fell silent. Alex could almost feel the depth of their grief, something she knew far too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she sensed movement in the darkness, and in a moment she saw Dolores rise and get out of bed. She didn\u0027t bother with a robe, or even with slippers, just headed for the bedroom door, where she paused briefly and looked back. Bill hadn\u0027t moved and appeared to be asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDolores slipped out of the room, closing the door carefully behind herself, and walked down the hall. She almost seemed to...flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached the boys\u0027 room and stepped inside to assure herself that they were safe. After a moment she walked to the bed where the younger boy, Jared, was asleep and sat at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA creeping feeling of unease swept over Alex, and she fought the dream, but it was no good. She had no choice but to watch as Dolores leaned over her son and clamped a rough hand over his mouth, then drew back her lips, baring her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, her fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw her head back with an animallike groan of pure pleasure. Then she ducked forward and sank her fangs into the soft flesh of her little boy\u0027s neck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-of-the-wolves-vampire-hunters-1/page-12.html","bookId":2698,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:37 AM"}
