Although he had joined the preliminaries, he didn’t reveal his true abilities and he rarely came out to the contestant area, so many people didn’t know about him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithout any problem, White King easily defeated the blood hands and stepped onto the city gates.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter White King, Xiao Moxian also flew up. She even engaged the blood hands in a little tussle before scattering them. The other martial artists were afraid of the blood hands and vigorously tried to avoid their attacks, but this was actually amusing to Xiao Moxian.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThen, it was time for Fairy Frost Dream.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrost Dream gently lifted her hand, covering her entire body with a shroud of scattered light. This dream-like scattered light slowly revolved around Frost Dream, seeming like countless gorgeous flower petals that fell around her. Then, she simply vanished.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the next moment she appeared above the city gates. A hazy halo of light appeared, shining with dazzling colors like spring cherry blossoms. Frost Dream appeared within these flower petals, proud and tall, like a goddess fallen down from the highest heavens. Her entire body exuded a holy and sanctified aura. Even though she had entered Slaughter City, she wasn’t stained with even the tiniest scent of blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLike this, Frost Dream had inexplicably appeared within Slaughter City, as if those flower petals had led her there. From start to finish, no one had been able see how she moved or what Laws she utilized.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is that teleportation?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Impossible! The power of space around Slaughter City is extremely solid and there is also that resentful energy that is hindering us all. It’s already difficult for us to fly, so how could she possibly teleport?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Too horrifying.

Xiao Moxian was a heaven-gifted eternally rare genius, but she was still only 26 years old. Being so young, her strength would naturally lag behind her senior.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMoreover, after understanding Xiao Moxian’s information, although one still couldn’t hold a candle to her, at least one could clearly see her strength. She wasn’t like Fairy Frost Dream, who had always been a mystery. Even now, no one had the faintest clue about her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“These aren’t the Space Laws. This Frost Dream is too terrifying…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDragon Fang thought to himself. As someone with an extreme understanding of the Space Laws and who also touched upon the sixth level Concept, he could easily distinguish whether or not Fairy Frost Dream had used the Space Laws just now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere was no limit in this universe. There was always a higher mountain and a stronger person!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany martial artists sighed with emotion. Frost Dream was already so horrifying and yet no one knew where the limits of her strength lay.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Frost Dream, the other remaining participants were all overshadowed. Even if they could defeat the blood hands, that wasn’t anything special at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSoon, all 10,000 people had tried to enter Slaughter City, with only 890 succeeding!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“10,000 people and now 90% were suddenly eliminated!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is just too abnormal. I thought that after entering the finals I would be able to earn a ranking, but I never imagined there would be so many people that wouldn’t even have the chance to enter the arena!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There are too many geniuses. This competition is the definition of brutal!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven those that successfully entered Slaughter City thought this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for those martial artists that were overly confident in themselves, they also restrained the contempt and envy in their hearts. The difference was laid out in front of them. Many of them had managed to barely bypass those hands to enter Slaughter City, whilst some easily defeated the blood hands to enter. There was even someone like Fairy Frost Dream who had entered using some inconceivable means.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let the battle begin!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOne of the World Kings managing the tournament suddenly announced.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the 10 great divisions, those that were eliminated were in the second group. Everyone in the first group would be considered has having passed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was in the third division. In his division, there were 62 individuals remaining in the second group. They had to challenge those 30 martial artists in the first group.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Dragon Fang?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was surprised. He hadn’t noticed before, but he and Dragon Fang were placed in the same division. In addition, Purple Blade was also here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Choose your opponent. Each of you has three chances.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe one managing this division was a thin old man. He wore blue clothes and had an extraordinary and ethereal-like temperament to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe 62 individuals chose their opponents. Neither Lin Ming nor Dragon Fang was selected.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was also a reasonable matter. As one of the few people in their division capable of defeating those blood hands, wasn’t challenging someone as strong as they were just asking to die?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBeside Lin Ming, several other people weren’t chosen either. These were Empyrean descendants, Heavenly Palace core disciples, or the original first ranked martial artists of their contest areas.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone else had three or four opponents. There were even some with poor performances as they entered Slaughter City, like Purple Blade, who were simultaneously chosen by seven or eight people.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“So that’s how it is. The elimination round in entering Slaughter City helps to reduce the number of participants but it is also to help those in the second group have an approximate understanding of the strength of the others. They can learn who is weak and who is strong so they don’t randomly waste their time.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was thinking, he suddenly felt someone’s eyes fall onto his body. He saw a white-clothed youth looking at him. This youth was shaved bald with a nine ringed scar on his head. He wore straw sandals and a loose robe, the very image of a solemn monk.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Monk…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s eyebrows arched up.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Benefactor Lin, I’m blessed to meet you. I am a disciple of Mount Potala, Hang Chi.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mount Potala…” Lin Ming was startled. He had never heard the name of Mount Potala before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was trying to recall anything about Mount Potala, Purple Blade’s true essence sound transmission suddenly rang in his hears.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Brother Lin, Mount Potala is an Empyrean Heavenly Palace level influence. They have an incomparably low profile most of the time, but they are one of the longest-lived sects with the most glorious history, and it is even rumored that they have two Empyreans in their sect!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Two Empyreans?” Lin Ming asked, startled. A sect with two Empyreans!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There are extremely few double Empyrean influences. In the future, Divine Dream Heavenly Palace and Demondawn Heavenly Palace will be the same. Fairy Frost Dream and Xiao Moxian could be called young Empyreans. But, whether it is Divine Dream Heavenly Palace or Demondawn Heavenly Palace, they cannot compare with Mount Potala. This is the difference in background. I heard that Mount Potala has already existed for 3.6 billion years…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“3.6 billion years!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming sucked in a breath of cold air. For an influence to survive for 3.6 billion years, that was a truly terrifying number!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“In these 3.6 billion years of history, would there always be an Empyrean standing guard within their ranks? Wouldn’t that mean they had several dozen Empyreans born from their sect?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I am not too clear about that. Mount Potala is extremely mysterious. The only reason I understand a little about them is because I was investigating information about everyone who is participating in the First Martial Meeting finals.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming deeply looked at Hang Chi. This monk exuded an aura as deep as the sea. He was clearly an extreme master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There are really too many masters here. This is a den of crouching tigers and hidden dragons!” Lin Ming thought to himself again. He cupped his hands and greeted Hang Chi in return.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s fortunate to meet you too.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSince this fellow was polite, Lin Ming naturally had to return the politeness.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd at this time, the fierce battling of the elimination series began. Every large division had several battles continuing on at the same time. In nearly all of them, the participants from the second group were defeated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter battles and more battles, there would be someone eliminated every now and then. But this intense combat had no influence on Lin Ming at all. When the sun set and the elimination round was over, out of the 10,000 people at the start, only 300 people were remaining, with each division having 30 people.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePurple Blade was unlucky; he had been eliminated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere wasn’t much he could do about this. He was someone who just barely managed to enter into the first group. On Gravemoon Star’s side, there was only Lin Ming, Dragon Fang, Nether Limitless, and Bloodless Sword left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo a martial artist, there was no difference whether they fought in the morning or night. After several hours of rest, the group matches would begin.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd at this time, it was still around midnight.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Things are happening so fast!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming thought to himself.

In each group of 30 people, every person only needed to fight 15 times. Lin Ming’s matches were mostly against Heavenly Palace core disciples or top three ranked participants from their contest areas. He wouldn’t be running into true Empyrean descendants or Dragon Fang yet. It seemed that everyone who was considered an extreme master was seeded into different groups to stagger them apart from each other.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“First martial field!

This was also reasonable. Lin Ming hadn’t even fought in the elimination series so he naturally had to fight first.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis opponent, Cang Liang, was a Heavenly Palace core disciple, and he stayed at Palace 90.
