It‘s locked.‖ When he opened his mouth again, I said, ―Yes, the librarian doesn‘t come in for another hour, I know. Do you have the key?‖ He nodded. ―Can you unlock the door?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. ―The librarian has to be there.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Well, can I go to my locker, please? Maybe by the time I put my stuff away, the librarian will be in.‖ I could tell he didn‘t like the idea, but I was already moving away, heading for the stairs, not waiting for permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let me get maybe ten feet then called, ―Hey!‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what? I looked back. ―Yes?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up that damn coffee, the one I‘d set down when I tried the library doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―This yours?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I made it to the second floor, my stomach was churning. Great. I couldn‘t even handle a perv janitor. No way I was going back downstairs, not while that guy was around. Maybe hide in the bathroom? Bathrooms were safe, even in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially in the dark. Lock myself in a stall, plug into my iPod, tune out, and let the blackness fold around like a blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe upstairs hall was quiet. Lockers lined white cinder-block walls, which were broken at intervals by closed classroom doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll except one, on the right. A spray of fluorescent light splashed onto the floor, and there was music, something lush and bittersweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, okay, so a teacher was getting a jump on the first day of classes, so what? I was going to my locker, no big deal. I‘d just slide by, pray my locker door didn‘t make a racket, then dump my stuff and duck into the bathroom at the other end of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved fast, on the balls of my feet, quiet as a mouse. The music was everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt billowed. Walking into the swell of violins was like passing into a fine mist, and I couldn‘t help it. I slowed, just a little, tossing a quick glance to the right—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd stopped dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Oh. My. God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3: a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was your standard chemistry classroom: desks and chairs in the center ringed by lab benches and high stools, with a demonstration bench up front. Chrome spigots, sinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing, that is, but him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis back was to me. He stood at the far side of a lab table, staring out a bank of windows overlooking the woods to the northeast. The sky was a clear, crisp cerulean blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rays of the rising sun bathed his shoulders and back, which were flawless and very muscular, a rich, warm gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he was naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had turned to stone. I just . . . Bob, I just couldn‘t move. You have no idea, or maybe you do. Like when you first saw the girl who would be your wife. . . . Maybe it wasn‘t a thunderbolt moment for you, but even my parents, as messed up as they are, remember the instant they first laid eyes on each other. So I remember every second of that first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was beautiful, like something out of a dream. When he shrugged into a pale blue button-down, sunlight rippled over valleys made of muscle and that smooth, smooth skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hair, dark and curly, fired with red and blond highlights. His movements were fluid and graceful and utterly unselfconscious because he thought he was alone. He was a demigod, and I was, welll. . . awed. Like someone this perfect just couldn‘t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that sounds hokey to you, Bob. But that‘s how I felt. That‘s the truth and that very first moment of sun and light and beauty is one I will never, ever forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ec\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I made a sound. Or he knew he was being watched. Either way, he sensed something because he began to turn and move away from the windows. That‘s when I saw he wasn‘t naked but wearing khaki slacks cinched around a trim waist. His mouth unhinged in surprise. ―Wha—?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Sorry!‖ And then I was bolting, a freaked-out little bunny scuttling down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBathroom, bathroom, where was the bathroom . . . there! I darted for the door at a dead run, thinking: If I can just get away. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it was locked. I hit pretty hard, too. The impact balled in my shoulder then shivered down my right arm. I staggered back and then the lid of that stupid coffee cup popped like a cork from a bottle of Champagne. A gush of tepid cappuccino sheeted over the door and sloshed over my skirt and bare legs. Sticky liquid crawled down my calves and leaked into my shoes. Oh no no no . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Whoa, whoa, hey.‖ He was in the hall now. ―It‘s okay, it‘s okay; relax, I‘m not going to hurt you; it‘s okay.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4: a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name was Mr. Anderson, and he taught chemistry, which I had eighth period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in his classroom, he handed over a wad of paper towels and pointed me to a back room: ―There‘s a sink. Plenty of soap. Take your time.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back room was a kind of office with a couple computers, a coffeepot, a fume hood, and a short hall leading to more doors and a storage room lined with shelves of chemicals. Music swelled from a Bose stereo squatting on a windowsill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe putty-colored stain on the khaki skirt I‘d laid out so carefully the night before was dark and precisely centered over my crotch. A fist-sized splash of coffee splotched my shirt. Even after everything dried, I would look—and smell—as if I‘d taken a bath in a coffeepot. Great. At least my canvas slides were dark blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a cake of Dove at the sink. I washed off my arms and splashed water on my face then inspected myself in a small mirror hanging on the wall. My eyes were raw and red as if someone had thrown a fistful of sand, but otherwise I didn‘t look too bad. Only now what? God, I was so embarrassed. Maybe I could just hide out here until the bell rang and—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―You okay back there?‖ Mr. Anderson called from the classroom. ―Need anything else?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about a new life? ―No. I mean, I‘m fine, thanks. Be right out.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on. Forking a handful of hair from my forehead, I hefted my backpack onto a shoulder and blew out, the way I used to right before a big race. He’s only a teacher; he’s not going to bite. Just apologize and go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Anderson was back at his windows, in a wedge of bright sun, sipping coffee from a black X-Files mug. When he heard me, he looked over and smiled. ―Better?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, tongue-tied, all the words I‘d thought about saying jamming up behind my teeth. Mr. Anderson‘s face was lean but square with high cheekbones, just the suggestion of a cleft in his chin and a broad forehead framed by thick, dark curls. His eyes were a startling, bright, silver-blue, like ancient ice, and his skin was bronzed from time in the sun. ―Th-thanks,‖ I finally managed. ―I‘m . . . I‘m sorry I made such a mess.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Don‘t worry about it. You were just lucky that coffee wasn‘t hot. While you were cleaning up, I did the hall. One less thing for Harley to complain about.‖ He raised his mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Need a cup?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―No,‖ and then thought that sounded rude, so I added: ―I don‘t really like coffee. It was my mother‘s idea.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Smart woman. Coffee is the elixir of life.‖ He hesitated. ―Look, uh, about earlier . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. what I was doing . . .‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―It‘s okay,‖ I said, quickly. ―Honest.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a hand up. ―Let me apologize, okay? All I wanted to say was I‘m sorry I scared you. You kind of caught me out. I wasn‘t expecting anyone around this early, obviously.‖ The way he rolled his eyes made me giggle and he grinned. His teeth were square and very white. He had a nice smile. ―That‘s better. I‘m training for an Iron Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer‘s no problem but once school starts up, I have to squeeze in time when I can. You a runner?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―I used to run cross-country,‖ I said and then wondered why I was telling him anything. Well, he had been nice. He could‘ve kicked me right back downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―For real? What‘s your time for a 5K?‖ I told him, and he made impressed sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Not bad. You done any middle distance? Eight or fifteen hundred?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―No. I haven‘t run in a while, actually. I mean, I haven‘t been training. Anyway, I just liked to run. I like . . . speed.‖ That wasn‘t quite what I meant to say, but to fly sounded, well, weird and I was supposed to be acting normally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―I like the power,‖ he said. ―You know, when everything‘s working the way it should and nothing hurts? You slip into that zone where you‘re skimming the ground, almost like you‘re running alongside the earth instead of on it.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Slipstream,‖ I said. It just came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, his eyes serious. He wouldn‘t be the kind to laugh even if he thought I was an idiot, I knew that. ―That‘s right. Only real runners get that.‖ He paused. ―So . . . you interested in training again? I‘m the track and cross-country coach and, well, I could always use another pair of legs, especially varsity girls.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he ran a hand through his hair and let out a little laugh. ―Sorry. School hasn‘t even started and you‘re new and already I‘m trying to sell you on a sport. You‘d probably like to settle in before getting yourself weighed down with a million obligations. Come on, I‘ll walk you downstairs to the library just in case Harley‘s still lurking.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited as I checked my left palm where I‘d penned my locker combination that morning. Unfortunately, between the coffee and washing up, the writing was faded and blurred, and I messed up the combination twice. Mr. Anderson waited a beat then said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―You have to twirl it twice clockwise to reset the mechanism and . . . Here, let me.‖ He reached past. ―What‘s the combination?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him. This close, he smelled of sunlight, pine needles, and Dove soap. He spun the knob right, then left, then once around clockwise, and then stopped on the last number before giving the handle a yank. The locker clanked open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Thanks.‖ After I‘d stowed my stuff, we walked back down the hall, past his classroom. That lush music was still playing, and I said, ―That‘s really nice. I‘ve heard it before—in a movie.‖ I thought a second. ― Blume in Love, that last scene where they‘re in St. Mark‘s square.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Yeah?‖ Cocking his head, he closed his eyes, listened a moment, said, ―You know, now that you mention it . . . that‘s right. But George Segal?‖ He gave me a curious look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―He‘s not even my generation. How do you know the movie?‖ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/drowning-instinct/page-3.html","bookId":2756,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:34 PM"}
