Texas pride aside, there are a few things you might want to keep in mind, such as the fact that federal services have jurisdiction everywhere. In our case, of course, we work where we’re invited in, except when we’re talking about criminals and situations that cross state lines. That’s always our jurisdiction. Crossing state lines is something killers do often enough. It’s as if they know they can throw law enforcement into confusion and break chains of evidence when they do, and that’s one reason the FBI is so important. Of course, your superiors know about this offer, and although they’d be sorry to lose you, they understand the unique possibilities of the position I’m offering you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan shook his head. “Thank you. No. You’ve got a serial killer on your hands. Or—since one way or another, I’ll get involved—we’ve got a serial killer on our hands. We’ll dig in, too, work with the FBI. But I think I’ll stay right where I am. I don’t see any reason to change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow nodded. “As I’ve been saying, it is your choice. But there’s something different about this case that does require an extra ability to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beneath the obvious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chelsea Martin called a friend just before she disappeared,” Jackson Crow said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From the Alamo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She said she saw a ghost. She thought it had to be the ghost of a Texas hero. He was trying to urge her to get away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve lost me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She phoned Nancy McCall, a friend in New York, when she reached the Alamo. At first, according to Nancy, she was laughing, telling her that a reenactor was playing a game with her. Then she was concerned, saying that the ‘performer’ was getting very dramatic, insisting she leave the Alamo, go and hide somewhere. At the end of the conversation, Chelsea seemed to believe she’d seen a ghost. She sounded frightened, and said this ghost or whatever he was had just disappeared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing. The line went dead. Her phone was never used again, and it was never found—and I’ve shown you what was left of Chelsea Martin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Longhorn had been built at a time when men were men and…men were men. The saloon had a long curving bar, a piano and a large space for gaming tables. Near the front entry, which came complete with swinging doors, a staircase led to the balcony above and to the rooms on the second floor. When Kelsey sped into the main saloon area from the kitchen, she was stunned to see a man running down the stairs as if he were being chased by every demon in hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA big, tough-looking man. Leanly muscled, he stood a good six foot two—and he was wearing an expression of sheer horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to be the “big ol’ rodeo cowboy” Sandy had told her about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Kelsey ran to the foot of the stairs to discover the cause of his terror, he nearly knocked her over in his haste to reach the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir! What is it? What’s happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, it seemed that the few other guests currently checked in to the Longhorn were already out or still asleep, and that the staff was either busy or not at work yet. No one else had appeared at the sound of the screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me out of here! Let me out of here now!” he yelled. He seemed like a decent man. Even in his near hysteria, he wasn’t going to mow her down or pick her up bodily to toss her out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t realized that Sandy had come behind her until she heard her speak. “Mr. Simmons, what’s wrong?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimmons was perhaps thirty; he had the ruggedly handsome look of a modern-day cowboy, and Kelsey assumed he was in town for the upcoming rodeo trials. The man might have been ready to brave the meanest bronco, but he pointed up the stairs with a trembling hand. “Blood…blood…blood. Oh, God, blood everywhere, all over the room!” he said. “Let me out. For the love of God, let me out of here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey arched a brow at Sandy and placed a hand on Simmons’s shoulder. “Sir, it’s all right. Sandy will help you,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy looked back at Kelsey, her eyes filled with a silent plea. See? I’ve been trying to tell you. It’s happening again, and it’s getting worse and worse. Do something!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey stepped past Mr. Simmons and hurried up the stairs to the gallery. She paused, gazing down over the rail of the landing. Sandy held her guest by the arm and was urging him to calm down. But Simmons seemed adamant about leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’ll just show us, Mr. Simmons,” Sandy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What, are you insane?” he shouted. He stared up at Kelsey. “Don’t…oh, God, don’t go in there! Get the police!” he cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Simmons,” Kelsey called down. “I am a law enforcement agent. I’m a United States Marshal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Room 207,” Sandy said gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey nodded, turned and hurried down the hallway. It was a straightforward numbering system; the second floor had ten rooms, 201 through 210. Room 207 was to her left along the gallery. Her own room was 201, but she didn’t really have to check at the numbers; the door to 207 was wide open, just as Simmons had left it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped inside and paused, biting her lip. There was nothing there. Certainly no blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was handsomely appointed. In fact, Sandy had done a beautiful job restoring the whole place. She’d renovated it with authenticity, studying historic documents and outfitting it with period pieces. Kelsey knew something about all of this, because Sandy had been in love with the inn—longing to buy it—for years. The Longhorn was one of the oldest original wooden structures of a bygone era. It had opened in 1833 as the Longhorn Saloon and Gentleman’s Palace, and through its history, it had been the place where travelers to San Antonio, especially “gentlemen,” had come to enjoy the liquor, poker, ambiance and female entertainment provided here. Every now and then, Sandy arranged a night with old-time entertainment; it was no longer a house of prostitution, of course, but she held poker games for charity, and hired period singers, actors and dancers to evoke the feel of the old west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeedless to say, any building as old as this one held its share of ghost stories. Room 207 had come with the Rose Langley legend, and much more recently, Sierra Monte had disappeared from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey considered what Sandy had told her about the Sierra Monte case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood spray and spatter had covered the room. There had never been any sign of her body, and there had never been an arrest. DNA testing proved that the blood was hers, and the medical examiner had claimed it was highly unlikely that anyone could have lost that much blood and survived. How her remains had been removed from the room was a mystery, just like the identity of her killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a horrible story. But in law enforcement, officers and agents heard a lot of horrible stories. And if every hotel in the world closed when something bad happened, they’d be tearing down buildings right and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, Sandy had hired special crews to come in and clean up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t a drop of blood to be seen anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey walked into the bathroom, once a dressing room for the “girls” who had entertained at the Longhorn. She hadn’t been in on the investigation, although she’d researched it, primarily because of her friendship with Sandy. She knew that blood had been found in the bathroom, as well, a great deal of it. Detectives and forensic crews had determined that Sierra was most likely killed in the bedroom and possibly dismembered in the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the police had finished and Sandy had taken over the place, she’d had the bathroom in 207 completely remodeled. The old tub was still taking up a lot of space in the evidence room at the police station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom looked completely ordinary. Shaving equipment and toiletries were on the counter by the sink, and the old claw-foot tub Sandy had bought to replace the original one was damp. Sandy’s guest had obviously had a bath or a shower before finding himself mesmerized by the blood his imagination had conjured up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kelsey left the room and walked down the stairs, she saw that neither Sandy nor Mr. Simmons was in the main saloon area. She wasn’t sure if they’d run outside—or if Sandy had managed to calm him down. She pushed open the swinging doors and looked out at the street. No one there. Kelsey quickly returned to the kitchen and the table where she’d been about to drink her now-cold coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimmons and Sandy were sitting there, but Simmons wasn’t drinking coffee. A shot glass and a bottle of whiskey stood in front of him. He’d apparently downed several shots already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy and Simmons both turned to Kelsey. She shook her head. “There’s nothing there, Mr. Simmons. Nothing at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gaped at her, disbelief in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I swear to you,” she added quietly, “there’s nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned, lowering his head, pressing his temples between his palms. “Well, that’s just great. I’m going crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey drew up a chair next to him, setting a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “Mr. Simmons—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Corey. Call me Corey, please,” he interrupted gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Corey,” she said. “You’re not going crazy. You’re merely human, which makes you susceptible to the history of places like this. Everyone knows the stories about the Longhorn. You know the room was covered in blood at one time, and not that long ago, either. So, in your mind, you saw it covered in blood. You’re not crazy. What happened wasn’t a fun ghost story. It was reality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should just not rent out that room,” Sandy murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorey waved a hand in the air. “Not your fault,” he said. He gave them both a rueful grimace. “I asked for that room. I told the boys going to the rodeo that I’d be sleeping with the ghosts. I was a real hotshot. I didn’t know I had a crazy susceptible mind. At least…that’s what I’m going to believe, Miss…?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unseen-krewe-of-hunters-5/page-5.html","bookId":2279,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:41 PM"}
