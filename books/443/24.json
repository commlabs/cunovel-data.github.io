{"id":12419,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"The most indomitable spirits have their dark hours, and this was Jack\u0027s. He returned to the Madagascar feeling that he had come to the end of his resources. It was hard to bear with the commiseration of the hotel detective and clerk on his failure; and he was in no mood to put up with Bobo\u0027s selfish complaints.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo\u0027s reasoning powers, as has been seen, were of a primitive simplicity. Like a child or a savage he was always under the complete sway of the feeling of the moment. Just now he was, or thought he was, broken-hearted over the loss of Miriam. Forgetting that he had given her up of his own free will, and for good cause, he blamed Jack for all his present misery.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you get him?\" he asked when Jack came in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To say that Bobo was pleased at the escape of \"Mr. B.\" would be putting it too strongly, but he was certainly not sorry to see Jack\u0027s discomfiture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Huh! You\u0027re too sure of yourself!\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack flashed an angry look at him, but said nothing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You always think you know more than anybody else!\" Bobo unwisely went on. \"You\u0027re always making up your mind what people are, and telling them what, to do, and all. You want to regulate the universe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Still thinking about that girl!\" said Jack. \"Will you please tell me what Mr. B.\u0027s giving me the slip has got to do with her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m just telling you you don\u0027t know everything,\" said Bobo with a superior air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was too much. Jack\u0027s patience snapped suddenly. \"You fool! Your talk has as much sense as barnyard cackle! Is it my fault that you lost your head over an adventuress? This is the thanks I get for trying to save you! For Heaven\u0027s sake, go and marry her and be damned to you! But stop grousing about it to me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He went out slamming the door, and leaving a much-scared Bobo behind him. Passing through the suite, he crossed to Gyde\u0027s old rooms, and let himself through the vault into his room in Kate\u0027s house. There was a great change in this room. Under the present régime it was a model of neatness and comfort.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here Jack lit his pipe and flung himself down, and a measure of peace returned to him. There was comfort in the silence, and in the thought of the locks that secured him from the chatter of fools.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The old boy wasn\u0027t so far wrong when he built himself a refuge like this,\" he thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But by and by when the fragrant smoke had steadied his nerves, he began to tire of solitude. To particularize, he desired the society of a certain person, to wit: the mistress of the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In order to see her it was necessary for him to assume the Pitman make-up. Much against his will—he was thinking of putting Mr. Pitman out of the way now, he arrayed himself in that character, and sallied forth in search of Kate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He found her in her own sunny sitting-room on the floor above. The old-fashioned mother was there too. Mrs. Storer was not in the secret of Jack\u0027s disguise. She considered Mr. Pitman rather a common fellow, but was always polite. Now after a few minutes\u0027 small conversation, she recollected an errand in her well-trained way, and left the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kate was sewing. The needle became her better than the typewriter. As mistress of a house she seemed to have discovered her true vocation. It may be mentioned in passing that this establishment was a success, and was already paying its way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We don\u0027t see much of you now,\" said Kate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s not from not wanting to on my part,\" he said, watching her dreamily. \"But a twenty-four hour day scarcely gives you time enough to play one part, let alone two or three.\" The sunlight behind her was making a little halo in the edges of her dark hair, and he scarcely knew what his tongue was saying.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How are things going?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The consciousness of defeat still rankled in Jack\u0027s breast; he felt a very natural desire to shine in somebody\u0027s eyes, so he said carelessly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My net is closing around the old man. He can\u0027t escape me now. I\u0027ll gather him in, when my case is complete.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fine!\" said Kate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Jack could not be sure there was not a faint ring of irony in her voice. He never could be sure of Kate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All my lines are working well,\" he went on. \"I had a glimpse of the old man to-day, but I thought it was better to let him go for awhile. I\u0027m not sure of being able to convict him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This morning when you left this house I believe you were followed,\" said Kate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack was not going to admit just then that there was anything he had overlooked. \"Oh, I think not.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I noticed a man standing at the corner looking at this house. His hat was pulled down over his eyes. As soon as you went out he disappeared.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I take precautions against being trailed,\" said Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I believe somebody has been tampering with the servants,\" Kate went on. \"Yesterday I found Bessie, the upstairs girl, exhibiting entirely too much curiosity as to the arrangements of your room. I shall let her go at the end of the week.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It isn\u0027t possible they could have discovered the secret of this house,\" said Jack. Something told him he was talking fatuously, but a little devil of perversity held sway over him for the time being.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know best of course,\" said Kate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This time he was almost sure he heard the ironical note, and he glanced at her uneasily. But the dark head was bent too low over her work for him to read her face. He felt a mighty desire to humble this cool and scornful maid, and changed his tack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re looking very charming to-day.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He got up, and sat as close to her as he could pull a chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go back where you were,\" she said calmly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I won\u0027t!\" he said masterfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I will.\" And she changed to the chair he had left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack glowered at her. \"One would think I spread a contagion.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, you know I don\u0027t care particularly for Mr. Pitman.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s only an excuse. It\u0027s me you don\u0027t care for.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She laughed tantalizingly. Jack saw now that he had started wrong but didn\u0027t quite see how to repair the original mistake. He got up to go. He knew that if he lost his temper, he would be completely at her mercy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027d better go if we\u0027re only going to quarrel,\" he muttered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who\u0027s quarreling? Can\u0027t you take a joke?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s like a flick of the whip on the raw.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had sounded the right note at last. She heard the real pain in his voice, and jumped up, careless of where the sewing went.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jack, wait a minute! What\u0027s the matter?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He paused with his hand on the door-knob. \"Nothing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the matter?\" she repeated. \"I insist on knowing!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well, things have gone a bit wrong. What do you care?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She actually stamped her foot. \"How dare you speak to me that way! You came in here like the Lord Hereditary Marshal of England. How was I to know?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I didn\u0027t want to let on that I had balled things up,\" he said sheepishly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You idiot! Will you ever learn the first rudiments of sense? Sit down here!\" She pulled him down beside her Pitman make-up and all. \"Now tell me all about it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack looked at her a little dazed by this sudden change of front. \"Why—I thought you were just having a little fun with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly I was. You asked for it. Whenever you take that \u0027my poor little woman\u0027 tone with me, you simply give me a pain. But if you are really up against it—Ah!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her voice caught on a deep low note of tenderness. Jack gave up all thoughts of mastery; he would have been quite content to kiss her hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I am up against it,\" he said quite humbly and naturally—and told her all about it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She said nothing until he was through; then: \"There\u0027s no occasion to be cast down that I can see. You and the old man are playing a close game, and he\u0027s turned a trick on you. But the game\u0027s not over yet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s so darn sure of himself!\" grumbled Jack. \"He knows what I have on him, but he goes around quite openly in his old black hearse! Shows himself everywhere. Goes on making his blackguardly collections right under my nose. He seems to enjoy playing with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s a kind of vanity,\" said Kate. \"I have read that criminals often display it. It is that very thing that will surely deliver him into your hands in the end if you bide your time. Some day he is bound to take a chance too many.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack began to feel comforted. \"I believe I could have him arrested to-morrow if I gave his description to the police,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then why don\u0027t you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He shook his head obstinately. \"I\u0027ve got to do this myself. I\u0027ve sworn it.—But how does he know I\u0027m not going to turn over my case to the police? He seems to be able to read my mind!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, there\u0027s no magic in that. He watches you of course, and anybody who knew anything about you must know that you would feel that way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was subtle flattery in this, and Jack began to feel warm about the heart once more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, he hasn\u0027t put me out of the game yet, though on this deal he has certainly called all my tricks. The minute I tried to use Mrs. Cleaver he trumped her. He has called the Pitman disguise, and he must know about my connection with Anderson. If he has spotted me coming out of this house, he must have guessed that there is a way through from the hotel. I\u0027ll have to think up an entirely new combination.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How does the situation stand with the anarchists?\" asked Kate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing new down there since I told you. I am now a full member of the circle that Emil Jansen belonged to, but so far I have not succeeded in establishing \u0027Mr. B\u0027s\u0027 connection with it. I know there is a connection, because the murderers of both Ames Benton and Silas Gyde graduated from that circle. I have to move slowly there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then there is the girl Miriam,\" suggested Kate. \"I believe you could do something with her. Do you know where she is now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bobo told me she was at the Hotel Bienvenu. But she hates me like poison.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kate smiled a little. \"From what you\u0027ve told me about her I gathered that she had a weakness of vanity, too. She was piqued because you resisted her charms. Why don\u0027t you look her up and well—not resist them quite so hard?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Kate!\" he said scandalized.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What?\" she said with an innocent air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You recommend me to do that!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why not? We don\u0027t owe her any consideration, I suppose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, it\u0027s not that. But if you cared about me the least little bit, you wouldn\u0027t be handing me over to another woman.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s up to you. I couldn\u0027t be jealous of one like Miriam. If you are in any danger from that source, Mercy! I don\u0027t want you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In other words you know you\u0027ve got me thrown and hog-tied!\" he said scowling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t be vulgar. This is simply business. You really have a chance of getting somewhere through her. The old man will be sending her remittances now. If you could trace one of those back to its source——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good! That\u0027s an idea! I think I see my way, too.\" His lassitude was gone. A fresh determination filled him. \"Kate, you are my good fairy!\" he cried. \"You have put new life into me! I am going to start to work again this very minute!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She said nothing, but her eyes were bright.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the door of the room he paused, holding her hand. \"You might let me kiss you before I go,\" he said diffidently. \"Just as a kind of encouragement to go in and win.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kate smiled. \"That\u0027s the first time you ever asked me with becoming modesty.—Once. Right here.\" She put her finger on the dimple in her right cheek.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61359.html","bookId":443,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:41:22 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:41:22 AM"}
