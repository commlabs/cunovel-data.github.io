{"id":46531,"no":1214,"title":"Chapter 1212: A Bug","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Saint-Emperor hesitated, and the Vile-Emperor sucked in a breath, eyes flickering with cold light as he waved his hand to summon his damaged red sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also stretched his left hand out in the direction of Vile-Emperor City, which caused the huge trident that the city was built on to begin to tremble, as though it might fly out of the ground at any moment!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the trident began to pulse with a murderous aura so powerful that it was even detectable this far away on the Eternal Sea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saint-Emperor. Bai Xiaochun. There’s no way the two of you can team up to kill me, not unless one of you is willing to die in the process!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Without that mindset, then maybe you’ll beat me, and maybe even take the Vile-Emperor Dynasty away from me. However, without a dynasty to worry about, I would be even more terrifying than before!” His voice was so cold that it caused the air to freeze, and ice to spread out over the surface of the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun couldn’t help but marvel at how impressive the Vile-Emperor sounded. However, all he did was frown thoughtfully, and then look over at the Saint-Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Saint-Emperor sighed, aware that this was not a fight he could win. First of all, he didn’t believe at all that Bai Xiaochun had a hundred shots of Archaean Luminescence at his disposal. Secondly, he didn’t want to have a complete falling out with the Vile-Emperor right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of the balance of power, the Saint-Emperor Dynasty now had the most territory, and after all the years that had passed, was no longer the weakest party. The Saint-Emperor now benefited from more Willpower, and the Vile-Emperor had suffered a significant loss of territory, and thus, overall power. But because there were now three power structures, such changes didn’t justify making any drastic decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, at the moment, maintaining the status quo would be the most beneficial thing to the Saint-Emperor. Chuckling, he said, “Second Bro, you’ve just established your own dynasty. Now isn’t the time for war. The Heavenspan Realm cultivators in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty have been waiting for a moment like this for a long time! I know what you’re thinking, so how could I allow you to undergo any hardship? Fine, fine. Listen, why don’t the three of us reach an agreement right here and now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the next thousand years, we’ll all agree to refrain from going to war!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think, Vile-Emperor?” With that, the Saint-Emperor looked over at the Vile-Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vile-Emperor snorted in his heart, well aware that the Saint-Emperor was just doing what he could to maintain the current political situation for as long as possible. Although the Vile-Emperor wasn\u0027t inclined to agree, after a moment of thought, his eyes glittered, and he nodded. Then he looked back at Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s eyes were narrowed, but inwardly, he was breathing a sigh of relief. He had also hoped to keep the status quo. Besides, he was out of Archaean Luminescence, and wouldn’t get it back until the following year. If fighting broke out now, that point would become obvious….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this point, both the Saint-Emperor and the Vile-Emperor were looking at him. Letting out a dramatic snort, he agreed to the proposal. With that, the three parties turned to leave; later on, they would have their subordinates take care of all the details of the truce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the other two emperors left, Bai Xiaochun breathed a long sigh of relief, and resolved to avoid dangerous situations like this in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too dangerous. But also so exciting….” On the one hand, he was questioning what he had done. But on the other hand, he knew that without the threat he had made with his three shots of Archaean Luminescence, the Vile-Emperor would definitely have made another opportunity to test him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if the Vile-Emperor hadn’t done it, then the Saint-Emperor would have. By taking the initiative, he had made his act more convincing, and the threat weightier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten more months…. During that time, I can’t cause any problems.” With that, he headed back toward his immortal domain, holding Gongsun Wan’er in one arm as he flew along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a certain point, he couldn’t help but look down at her. She was so bewitchingly enchanting, especially the delectable curves which existed below her waist. The sight instantly caused him to think back to what it had felt like to spank her….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really feel like spanking her again….” he thought, blinking a few times. “Hold on. No. I have the same standing as the Vile-Emperor and the Saint-Emperor now! If I did something like that in a situation like this, it would be too embarrassing if people found out!” He shook his head vehemently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But if I don’t spank her now, then when I get back to my immortal domain, Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo will be there… and I’ll have lost my chance…. One quick spank shouldn’t matter….” After some more thought, he decided to throw caution to the wind. After all, considering the relationship between him and Gongsun Wan’er, a quick spank wouldn’t hurt anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving reached the conclusion that this was definitely the best idea, he lifted his left hand and quickly spanked her, causing a melodious smacking sound to echo out. It definitely felt just as wonderful as last time…. However, at some unexpected point, Gongsun Wan’er opened her eyes and looked up at him icily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was completely taken aback, and also feeling a bit guilty, but reacted smoothly. “Uh… you had a bug on you….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why haven’t you taken your hand off me yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point, Bai Xiaochun realized that his hand was still resting on her rear end. Clearing his throat, he pulled it back and shook it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a really big bug, and very lucky to have gotten away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretending not to have heard that last part, Gongsun Wan’er separated from him and began to fly along on her own. She also patted her bag of holding, causing Hou Xiaomei to fly out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongsun Wan’er had been taking care of Hou Xiaomei for years now. Back when she had first begun her life as a fugitive, she had put Hou Xiaomei into her bag of holding. Now that things were safe again, the first thing she did was bring her back out into the open. From that, it was possible to see how much she cared for her apprentice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big Bro Xiaochun!” Hou Xiaomei said, visibly excited. Eyes sparkling with tears of joy, she leaped forward and embraced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was delighted, and immediately wrapped his hands around her supple waist. And then, they slowly began to move down…. At that point, Gongsun Wan’er snorted coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See another bug?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s hand froze in place. As for Hou Xiaomei, a quizzical expression appeared on her face, and she looked over her shoulder and down her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A bug?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearing his throat, Bai Xiaochun quickly changed the subject, and explained to Hou Xiaomei and Gongsun Wan’er what had gone on after his return. As for Gongsun Wan’er, she did nothing to cover up what she was thinking. From the way her eyes glittered when she looked at Bai Xiaochun, it was possible to see that she felt quite differently about him now than she had before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thus, the three drew closer and closer to the immortal domain that was now home. As Hou Xiaomei chatted and laughed, Bai Xiaochun gradually began to calm down from the tense moment earlier, and soon a smile covered his face. It almost felt like he was back in the Heavenspan Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the wonderful scene soon came to an end…. After reaching the immortal domain, Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo were both there waiting for him, their eyes flickering with cold light. Bai Xiaochun’s heart immediately began to race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, if it isn’t Xiaomei,” Song Junwan said, smiling. Next to her, Zhou Zimo said nothing. She simply frowned and rubbed her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them had been quite anxious when Bai Xiaochun had suddenly rushed off. Now, he returned with two women, one of them a childhood friend, and the other dark and mysterious. It was also obvious that they were a Master and apprentice, leading Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo to dislike them even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHou Xiaomei was visibly taken aback. She looked at the swollen bellies of Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, and then at Bai Xiaochun standing there awkwardly. At that point, she started to get angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Bai Xiaochun\u0027s hair was starting to stand on end from the looks he was getting from the three women, the Grand Heavenmaster, who was also present, cleared his throat and stepped forward. Clasping hands, he bowed to Gongsun Wan’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Celestial!” he said. “It is a great honor to have you as part of our nation. Henceforth, no one will ever dare to say that the Heavenspan Realm doesn’t have a second celestial!” The Grand Heavenmaster’s words were very well spoken, and Bai Xiaochun was very grateful. Since the topic of the conversation had been changed, he took advantage of the moment to introduce Gongsun Wan’er to everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he came up with an excuse to excuse himself, his spine still tingling from the glares he had been subject to moments ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavens! I can’t believe they were looking at me with killing intent…. What am I supposed to do now…?” After returning to his private chamber, he sat down cross-legged and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all my fault. Ai. Oh, God, please tell me… why did you make me so outstanding?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know how annoying it is to have been made so incredible by you?” Looking very downtrodden, he patted his bag of holding to produce his precious collection of love letters….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m like a prisoner nowadays.” Although he sighed, he couldn’t cover up the proud look that gleamed in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1211\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1213\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1212","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
