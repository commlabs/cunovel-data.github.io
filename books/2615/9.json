So you do.” Looking toward the castle, he tilted his head slightly. “Shall we go visit your husband?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Before I could rein in my emotions, I cast a look of utter horror toward Adem. “No. I mean...I would rather not.” I floundered in my panicked state, averting my face quickly, my heart thudding hard within my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see,” he said, and I feared he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fussed with my skirt and struggled to find words to speak that would diffuse the tension that had risen between us. None seemed sufficient to divert suspicion and I remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, let us return to the hotel. I have a surprise for you there,” Adem said after several long, painfully silent moments in which he had sat beside me in quiet contemplation. He now seemed to have dismissed my outburst altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly?” My interest was piqued and my nervousness lessened. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it be a surprise if I were to divulge that information?” Adem laughed and climbed to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would be surprised in this moment,” I assured him. “Therefore it would not be ruined by telling me what it is because you would reap the reward of seeing my reaction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning down, he took hold of my hands and drew me to my feet. “Yes, perhaps. But I would much rather leave you in suspense until you lay your beautiful blue eyes upon my gift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stomped my foot at him. “I want to know now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling, Adem strode to the horses, summoning them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really, Adem. You are truly being most cruel.” I rushed after him, holding my skirts up as I lamented the condition of my torn petticoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will lift your spirits, I can assure you,” Adem replied, helping me up onto my horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My spirits are fine,” I said quickly. “Truly. I have recovered from my maudlin repose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head, Adem’s dark curls bounced under his turban. “Ah, my Countess, I may not have known you very long, but I can see that you are lonely. Otherwise, you would not be so willing to befriend your guard and make slips with your pretty pink tongue that you can ill afford to make in our world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clutched my reins tightly in my gloved hands and swallowed my gasp. Adem’s dark gaze met my own and the solemn set to his lips chilled me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, Adem climbed onto his horse and we were off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the horses\u0027 hooves thundered toward Bistriţa far faster than any natural creature could, I considered turning my horse about and fleeing into the forest. I knew not where I could hide during the day and quashed the impulsive idea. Despite my fear, I did believe I could trust Adem. From our previous conversations it was clear that Adem was in no way an admirer of Vlad Dracula, but I feared that he would not be able to protect me if what I had done was revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the hotel, I once more considered fleeing into the waning night, but knew that I dare not. I dismounted and strode to the hotel, Adem falling into step behind me. His hand gently touched my waist and I glanced up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning toward me, he whispered, “Do not fear me. I only wish to protect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt tears spring to my eyes and was about to answer when I heard a beloved voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mistress!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy loyal maidservant rushed toward me, her smile full of joy. To my shock and embarrassment, she fell to her knees before me, gripped my hands and kissed them. I swiftly pulled her to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Magda! It is so good to see you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my dear Countess, I am so happy to be with you once more. I have truly missed you. The Haven is lovely, but I worried so for you.” Magda’s dark eyes glimmered with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought it best you have proper help to attend to your needs,” Adem said, a satisfied grin on his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot thank you enough!” My maidservant had been a true ally when I had been in Buda with Vlad. She had helped keep my affair with Ignatius a secret and her loyalty was unwavering. When I had finally realized the depth of her devotion, I had been truly touched. I cared for her as I never had any other servant in my former household.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your hem!” Magda exclaimed as she noticed the torn fabric trailing along the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tore it when learning to fight,” I explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With a dagger!” I boasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my!” She looked horrified, yet impressed. Though her appearance was that of a woman not much older than I, Vlad’s blood had kept her young and strong for more years than I could probably imagine. Though human, she sipped his blood in a ritual that bound her to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vlad never taught me to defend myself, but Adem is now teaching me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is actually quite good when she pays attention to my instructions,” Adem confided to Magda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I pay attention to your every word!” I declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When it suits you,” Adem countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well...” I pursed my lips, then lifted my shoulders. “Yes, yes...when it suits me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem chuckled as I smiled coyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dark eyes scanning my clothing, Magda regarded their condition with scorn. “I must tend to your skirt immediately. It isn’t proper for you to be seen like this. You are a countess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling content to have Magda at my side, I pulled off my gloves and hat. “I quite agree. I am rather bedraggled after our adventure tonight. A bath would also be lovely. Let us retire to my room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shall escort you there.” Adem offered his arm politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my hand on his forearm and squeezed it lightly. “Your surprise is fabulous. I am grateful.” I gathered up my petticoats with my other hand and we ascended the stairs together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay 26, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Golden Krone Hotel, Bistriţa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda’s arrival has created a semblance of normalcy in my nightly routine that I embrace with gratitude. Frustrated with the condition of my shabby room, she admonished the proprietor and set things in the proper order. She purchased a new bathing tub and washing basin, disgusted with the chipped and stained versions with which I had made do since my arrival. The new curtains and bedclothes in my favorite color of blue are reminiscent of my old room in Buda. My wardrobe is immaculate, having been properly mended and pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatya has been sulking about since Magda will no longer allow her to tidy up my room, therefore limiting her interaction with me. Magda handpicked another hotel maid to take up Katya’s former duties. It has been a relief not to endure the girl’s constant attempts to seduce me into feeding from her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem seems amused by Magda’s determination to ensure I am as comfortable as possible. Frankly, I find it endearing. She is my ever faithful companion and sleeps on a small bed in the corner of my room. When the terrors of my dreams befall my slumber, she comforts me. I could weep with thankfulness when I awaken to find her at my side with her soothing hand stroking my hair until I am calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I have not found Erzsébet, Ignatius’s whereabouts continue to be a mystery, and I fear Vlad entering my dreams, I have found some measure of solace now that Magda is at my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I rose to sit at my dressing table to compose myself after feeding, Magda escorted the guard who had served as my meal to the door. I glanced toward the departing guard while I wrapped my robe about me and watched as Magda whispered a few words of thanks to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door opened, I glimpsed Katya lingering in the hallway, her golden hair a halo in the candlelight and her eyes glittering with yearning as she regarded me with despair. The guard bowed, departed, and cast a wondering look upon the girl as he passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda regarded Katya for a long moment, her shoulders set with determination. Katya buckled beneath her scorching glower and hurried past the room with a sad little cry. Satisfied, Magda shut the door and locked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is trouble,” Magda declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps we should do something to contain her obsession with you,” Magda suggested as she drew near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vlad has made that extremely difficult. He has tampered with her mind and I cannot influence her. I attempted to do so and failed.” It had been quite frustrating to try to bend Katya’s mind to my will only to find that I could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda exhaled with frustration. “Nothing is ever as simple as it should be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to untwist the ends of the strips of paper entwined in my hair to create proper curls. Before her arrival I had been fashioning my hair with a comb, using the natural curl of my hair to form the ringlets around my face. Magda quickly dismissed this as unsatisfactory. My long red hair was now braided and rolled into a fine ornate fashion on the back of my head and the curls fashioned with the strips of paper would be much tighter and fashionable than my natural ones. I only wished Ignatius could see me appearing elegant once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fussed with the colorful bottles of fragrance on my table. Though he had never presented them as gifts and merely set them on my dressing table for me to discover, Vlad had purchased the perfumes. One in particular stood out among the ornate bottles as I rearranged them on the silver tray. It was the only perfume he had placed in my hands. The aquamarine glass of the bottle perfectly matched my eyes. It was his sole reason for purchasing it. Now holding it in my hand, I was tempted to crush it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-9.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
