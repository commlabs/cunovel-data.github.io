He was asked to leave after Mark, one of my other housemates, caught him with my laptop. God knows what he was doing with it. They couldn\u0027t tell if he was trying to steal it or just trying to open it. I used it when I was helping him with some of his classes, and I don\u0027t know how much he saw. I have some very important work on it, so I\u0027m trying to be very careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecalling a conversation they\u0027d had at the restaurant, he asked, \"Did you get your paper finished?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remembered I had a paper to write for my class?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did finish it despite my lack of sleep. I called Charlotte and she kept me up most of the night. When I told her about my argument with our aunt and uncle, she was upset.\" Upset didn\u0027t quite cover her sister\u0027s reaction. Irate was a much better description. Once Allison revealed what was in the envelope Will had handed her, her sister went into a rage. \"She wants to confront them,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over at her. \"What would that accomplish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"It won\u0027t change anything. I tried to talk her out of it, and she promised to think about it. She\u0027s not a violent person, but I worry she\u0027ll punch one of them if she ever sees them again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, he said, \"I like your sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Because she wants to punch Aunt Jane and Uncle Russell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, because she protected you when you were young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was such a sweet thing to say about Charlotte. Allison felt as though she had just been given a compliment, which didn\u0027t make any sense. Charlotte was the hero, not her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This new FBI building-,\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s also the new satellite of the CSA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Phillips is in charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison tried not to stare at Liam, but it was nearly impossible. He had such a handsome profile, and every time she looked at him, she thought about his lips on hers. She knew she was being foolish, and she wished she could be more sophisticated about it all. It being sex, she admitted. She was such a klutz when it came to physical relationships. Maybe she should have read a couple of books on the subject instead of writing code night and day. Why couldn\u0027t she stop thinking about it? Had he thought about the kiss? Probably not, she decided. Men didn\u0027t ponder such things, did they? She would ask Dan. He\u0027d be honest with her.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePull it together, she told herself. Now isn\u0027t the time to fantasize about what it would be like to be with Liam. Why think about what would never happen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phillips wants to know if I can break into the government system, right?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s okay with me searching for the leak?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a feeling he wants me to fail so he can say, \u0026amp;lsquo;I told you so.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you might be right,\" he said with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in for a disappointment,\" she said. \"I am going to get in, and if the leak is coming from inside, I will find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your confidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she replied. \"Phillips is so sure he\u0027s hack-proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re sure you won\u0027t be detected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Otherwise, what\u0027s the point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the gate, which opened for them without any notification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve been waiting for you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands were gripped tightly in her lap, and Liam could see how nervous she was. \"They\u0027re waiting for you, too,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to drop me off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again the parking lot was deserted. Liam parked close to the door where the guard waited for them. \"No, Allison. I\u0027m not leaving you. I\u0027ll make sure you get settled in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you thought more about Will?\" she asked as they made their way to the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve talked to a couple of people,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Phillips? You\u0027ll have to talk to him, too, won\u0027t you? I wish you didn\u0027t have to,\" she admitted. \"The man already thinks he has the upper hand, and doing me a favor will put me at his mercy.\" Six months, she thought. She could put up with him for six months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already discussed it with him,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have a chance to ask another question. The guard had opened the door and was waiting for them to enter. Allison went to the sign-in counter and handed her laptop and her purse to the other guard on duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was genuine when he greeted her. \"It\u0027s nice to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t wearing his identification, but she remembered his name. \"How are you, Tom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe beamed. \"You remembered me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing fine today,\" he stammered. \"How are you doing?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-43.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
