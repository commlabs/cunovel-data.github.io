Konnor looked down at it and put his hand on it, stroking up and down slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry. I thought…I remembered what you said that first day in the arena. You told me I had to go for an auction with the council,and I’d be sold to the highest bidder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was before you became my mate, baby. They didn’t like it much when they found out, but Lucas paid them well, and they’ll get over it . Don’t you know how much I love you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You love me?” Ethan asked, shocked to hear the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I do, though I can’t imagine why. Oh, you’re beautiful and sweet, but you want to give yourself to my family, have me treat you like a slave, and you said you not only didn’t want to be my mate, but you didn’t love me, never would and would be unhappy as my mate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I really say all that?” Ethan shook his head and felt a blush start up his neck. “I didn’t mean it. Not any of it. I love you so much! I’m so sorry I keep disappointing you,” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who said you did?” Konnor replied, nibbling on his ear. “You’re everything I ever wanted in a mate. I think I mentioned beautiful, and sexy, and even a natural submissive. It’s still a struggle for you, that’s all. It’s my job to help you with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you don’t think I’m a terrible submissive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, let’s just say you still have a way to go, but you’re finding out some things about what you like, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am? Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonnor chuckled. “Like you don’t mind giving your submission to me, but you really don’t want to give it to anyone else, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Ethan said firmly. “Even though your brother and your cousins are handsome, they’re not you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s good, because you belong to only me. Let ’em find their own blonds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan sighed in contentment and snuggled closer in Konnor’s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonnor kissed his temple. “And you like being tied up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan felt a blush from his toes to his cheeks. “I-I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And spanked…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan hid his face against Konnor’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No you don’t. Look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan raised his gaze, his cheeks burning so hot he thought he must have a fever. “Yes, I like it. All of it. MostlyI liked knowing you were in control of me…but I knew I could trust you to take care of me if I got in trouble or if anything went really wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. So you like submitting to me, and you trust me…yet you still don’t want to be my mate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I am your mate, aren’t I?” Ethan asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you are. And you have the mating bite to prove it. But you said there was too much drama in being a mate to an alpha. Too scary and stressful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I-I did? I guess I said a lot of stupid things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you did. Do you…still feel the same way?” Konnor’s body had gone very still and Ethan could feel his muscles tense beneath him. He gazed up at Konnor and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I love you so much it hurts, and it doesn’t scare me anymore. I can’t stand to be away from you or to have you mad at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And no more running away? When you get upset, you’ll come to me for help, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir,” he said, nodding solemnly. “I’m sorry for all the things I said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonnor bent down and took his lips possessively. He kissed him for a long time, and then raised his head to look down at him. “I think we both said a lot of stupid things when I found you again. I was angry and hurt because you ran from me, and furious at the idea that Katya hurt you and I couldn’t prevent it. I’m sorry if what I said hurt you. I never want to hurt you again, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan turned in his arms and put a hand to his cheek. “I just don’t want to be something you have to take on…out of pity or a sense of responsibility.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonnor shook him. “Listen to me. This is not pity I feel for you. You’re omega. So what? It will only help you with your submission, and the only one you’ll ever be submitting to from now on is me. You’re not the only submissive mate of the Balenescus, you know. Both my cousins, Blayde and Nikolai, have submissive mates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They do? I know you told me Jagger is, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, believe it—he is. He might give Nikolai hell from time to time, but in the bedroom, he’d get his bottom spanked for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan smiled happily. “Like you were about to do for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly. But I won’t spank you now, because I know what you heard was my fault. I should have put an end to this slave nonsense a long time ago and made sure you knew how much I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan bent his head and bit Konnor’s lower lip. Konnor put a hand to his mouth in surprise. “Ow! What the hell was that for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a reminder that I have been pretty bad…maybe I need that spanking after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonnor got a gleam in his eye. “I think that can be arranged. Lie down across my knees and get comfortable, Blondie. This may take a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe End \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/konnor-and-his-omega-mate-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-3/page-21.html","bookId":1593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:53 PM"}
