And they swim so fast! And look, they\u0027re eating right out of your manfully royal hand! And they don\u0027t smell like fishy shit or anything. \" She fluttered her eyelashes at him, then had to stop when it made her dizzy. \"Seriously, Dave. That whole, \u0027Hi, I\u0027m going to be the king of Alaska someday. . . how you doin\u0027?\u0027 thing works pretty well for you, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is wrong with a hobby?\" he demanded, wiping his hands on a nearby towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hobby! There\u0027s gotta be a hundred of the little buggers in here. So you, like, kidnapped them from Canada or wherever—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antarctica,\" he said sourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—then shut them up in your little palace of horrors—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not!\" He angrily shook his head. \"By that I mean, they have plenty of room, they\u0027re happy, and they\u0027re in no danger of being devoured by a killer whale or a walrus in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they\u0027re just in danger of making guests pass out from the stink. But I guess that\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m not getting rid of them,\" he shouted, \"no matter how many freckles you have!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m not eating in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You certainly are, Christina!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s supposed to be a royal order or something? Fact check, Prince Penguin, I\u0027m an American citizen. You can\u0027t make me do shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go away,\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a New York minute, pal! If I see one more bird shit on those rocks, I\u0027m going to yark. Not that you\u0027d notice the smell. And what\u0027s P, P, for P?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He was very red, but took a deep breath and seemed to recover enough temper to answer the question. \"It\u0027s Privacy, Please, for the Penguins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him for a moment. \"Oh, I\u0027m gonna puke right now,\" she finally decided, and let herself out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment she left, David hurled the contents of the last bucket into the water, and watched moodily while the cleverest, most charming creatures on the planet devoured the last of the fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Edmund coughed, emerging from one of the storage areas, a hose coiled over his shoulder, \"that went well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid nearly fell into the penguin pond. It was absolutely uncanny the way Edmund popped up and disappeared, never being heard or seen unless he chose to. \"What are you doing here? If the rocks need to be washed off, I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was merely anticipating your needs, sir, as any good assistant—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eavesdropper!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—would do. It\u0027s just as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the last thing in the world you need is a wife and partner who will tell you the truth, no matter how unpleasant. You need a flatterer, a panderer, a—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—woman like my mother, no thanks.\" He stared gloomily into the water for a long moment. \"Well, I\u0027m not getting rid of them, and that\u0027s that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As crown prince, you don\u0027t have to do much you don\u0027t wish to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The biggest lie of all,\" he sighed. \"But I suppose you\u0027re right. She\u0027s—well, refreshing, at the least.\" He thumped his chest with a closed fist. \"And she got me right here—I have had other girls up here, and they\u0027ve seemed to go into raptures about birds that eat fish but can\u0027t fly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fascinating creatures,\" Edmund conceded, \"but not that fascinating. Ah, supper for two,\" he added as a footman rapped on the door and wheeled in a prodigious amount of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it to the gallery,\" David grumbled. \"I\u0027ll be there directly. As soon as I\u0027m sure I can talk to her without strangling her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gallery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where she probably is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmund cocked an eyebrow at him. \"And how does His Highness know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, she loves it in there. I think she likes looking at all the relatives. Because she doesn\u0027t have any, you know.\" He hurried to the sink in the far corner and washed his hands. \"This is assuming she hasn\u0027t left the palace in disgust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, if only.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dry air.\" Edmund coughed, and coiled the hose neatly on a rock, and followed the prince out the door. \"I\u0027ve still got to look into that, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is wrong with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" Princess Alexandria replied truthfully. She was seated at the far end of the galley, an easel in front of her, her denim workshirt and cargo pants spattered with primary colors. She was shoeless, and her toes were small and pretty, and French manicured. She appeared to be painting the scene outside the window, which was interesting, because the curtains were drawn. \"Frankly, we\u0027ve all been wondering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Har, har. I mean, your brother, a perfectly nice guy—if a little obsessed with flightless waterfowl— asks me not once, but twice to marry him, and I blow him off like I can do better. I mean, what the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you can,\" the princess suggested, shoving her brush into Caribbean Blue and smooshing it around. The brush spread into a fan shape and the blob of color on her palette doubled in size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do better, I mean. I love my brother, and he\u0027s quite cute, but there\u0027s plenty of other fish in the sea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at the rate he\u0027s feeding those penguins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex snickered, but didn\u0027t comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you doing that devil\u0027s advocate thing?\" Christina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m doing the polite conversation thing. Frankly, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re waiting for. He\u0027s nice, he\u0027s cute, he\u0027s rich, and you\u0027re the first female he\u0027s shown any interest in forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, ramp up the pressure, see if I care.\" Christina flung herself into the chair nearest the princess. \"How about you? Any marital prospects?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plenty,\" she replied, drawing a bold blue stripe across the easel, \"but they\u0027re all fortune hunters. And boy, did they come flying out of the woodwork when I turned eighteen. It\u0027s enough to make a girl renounce the marriage market. At least Kathryn\u0027s spared that for a couple more years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t I read something about you and Prince William .. . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I wish. He\u0027s perfect for me—good house, good manners, good bloodline, great body. And we\u0027re exactly the same age. But it was tabloid fantasy, unfortunately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s tough. And never knowing if they like you or your title—that can\u0027t be much fun, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mm-hmm.\" The princess looked at Christina sideways and cocked a dark eyebrow. She, like her older brother, shared the king\u0027s coloring. Even casually dressed, the princess was breathtaking, with blue-black hair, dark blue eyes, and a porcelain complexion. Sitting next to her, Christina felt like the village frump. Which she probably was ... if the royal family was any example, Alaska\u0027s general populace was ridiculously good-looking. \"I suspect that\u0027s why my brother is anxious to reel you in, so to speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough with the fishing metaphors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, I\u0027ll put it this way. Your indifferent, uncaring attitude is a breath of fresh air.\" The princess managed to say this without the tiniest bit of irony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, not giving a shit is a big selling point, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandria snickered. \"I\u0027m afraid so.\" She shoved a hank of dark hair off her forehead and sobered. \"Let me level with you, Christina, woman-to-woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or princess-to-commoner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother hasn\u0027t cared about much of anything since my mother died in that stupid, senseless accident. He was focused on school, and duty, and occasionally penguins. Now all of a sudden he\u0027s chasing you all over the palace. My father\u0027s all for the match. And you, pardon my bluntness, have nowhere to go. So what, exactly, is the problem? There are about a zillion worse things than eventually being the queen of Alaska.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmm. A zillion, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So marry him, or don\u0027t. But in my so-humble opinion,\" she added, \"it\u0027s rude to enjoy my father\u0027s hospitality when you have no intention of giving anything back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew there was a catch,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A rather large one,\" the princess agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accept an invitation to lunch and now I\u0027ve gotta be a princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not so bad. All right, that was a lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina laughed unwillingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it would help you to consider what your parents might have wanted for you.\" A yellow stripe joined the blue one, followed by a shaky red one. The painting looked like a fucked-up rainbow. \"If they were still around, what would they say about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" Christina leaned back and stared at the ceiling. Which, in addition to cherubs, gods, and goddesses, had a large rainbow on it... so that\u0027s what she was painting. \"I never knew my dad. And my mom worked pretty hard most of her life ... she usually had at least two jobs. We had to move around a lot... I never really got to make any friends. It was just the two of us. And then—and then it was just me. So, there\u0027s really no contest She would have told me to go for the brass ring, and kick the crud out of anybody who got in my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandria pursed her (perfect, pink) lips and nodded. \"Well, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except.. . what makes me different from the rest of the throng, if I take your brother for the dough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The very fact that you\u0027re asking that question makes you different. Also, we all enjoy it enormously when you yell at the king, so you simply must linger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I, the court jester?\" she grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But you might be a princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill. Alexandria was certainly giving her a lot to think about. She was beautiful, and sly... asking the what would your mama say? question clinched it. Her mom would have been overjoyed, thrilled, ecstatic. It would have been worth putting up with the pomp of a royal wedding just to see her mom\u0027s face light up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-treatment-alaskan-royal-family-1/page-6.html","bookId":2789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:34:58 PM"}
