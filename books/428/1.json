ADIN DUNHAM SURPRISES HIS WIFE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;\"I\u0027ve been looking forward to this day for weeks, Sarah,\" said Adin Dunham, as he rose from the breakfast-table on a certain Wednesday morning in the early part of June. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, father, what do you mean?\" asked Mrs. Dunham curiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because to-day I am to receive a thousand dollars—a thousand dollars in hard cash,\" answered her husband in a tone of exultation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I declare!\" ejaculated his wife in amazement. \"Who on earth is going to give you a thousand dollars?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No one is going to give it to me; it\u0027s my own.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How strangely you do talk, Adin Dunham! You ain\u0027t out of your mind, be you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 6\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not as I know of,\" answered her husband with an amused smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is it really true that somebody is going to pay you a thousand dollars?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, it is.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And you say it is your own?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t understand it,\" said Mrs. Dunham, with the air of one to whom a puzzle is propounded and who gives it up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I\u0027ll explain. You know when Uncle Dan died he left me a piece of stony pasture land in Rockmount?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I know. You never could sell it, I\u0027ve heard you say ag\u0027in and ag\u0027in.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I\u0027ve sold it at last. There\u0027s a company goin\u0027 to put up a big hotel just on that spot, and they\u0027ve offered me a thousand dollars for the land.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Couldn\u0027t they find a better buildin\u0027 lot than that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, you see it\u0027s located near the lake, and though it\u0027s barren enough it\u0027s well situated, and there\u0027s five acres of it, plenty of room for all the buildin\u0027s required. They offered me first seven hundred, then eight hundred, and finally when they got up to a thousand I caved in——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You what?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I agreed to let \u0027em have it. I\u0027m going over to-day to get the money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, it\u0027ll make us rich, Adin. I never expected you\u0027d be wuth a thousand dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wonder what Uncle Dan would have said if he\u0027d7 thought I would have got so much for the land. He never cared much for me, and he only left me that because he thought it wasn\u0027t wuth anything. He did better by me than he expected.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What are you going to do with the money, Adin?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know yet. I\u0027ll keep it by me till I\u0027ve decided. Perhaps I\u0027ll invest in gov\u0027ment bonds. I guess they\u0027re about as safe as anything.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So I\u0027ve heard, Adin. I suppose the gov\u0027ment ain\u0027t likely to fail.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If it is, I guess all the banks will fail too.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How are you goin\u0027 over to Rockmount?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll borrow neighbor Gould\u0027s horse and buggy. That horse is pretty strong, and he won\u0027t mind the twenty miles—ten there and ten back.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t like to have you travelin\u0027 so far with all that money. S\u0027pose you should meet with robbers.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There ain\u0027t any robbers round here, Sarah. This is a respectable community.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You might meet a tramp.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, the chances are that he\u0027d be more afraid of me than I would be of him. I ain\u0027t a child, Sarah. I can lift a barrel of potatoes and put it in a wagon as easy as most men.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Adin, you know best. Hadn\u0027t you better take Dean with you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why should I take Dean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It would be safer for two than for one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t mean to say that I need a boy of sixteen to protect me? If I thought I did, I\u0027d stay at home and send Dean by himself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 8\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Adin, I don\u0027t want to interfere. It wouldn\u0027t be much use, either, for you generally have your own way. Have you told any of the neighbors that you are goin\u0027 for some money?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No except Lawyer Bates.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What made you tell him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I was in his office the other evenin\u0027, and somehow I was led into tellin\u0027 it. I gave a sort of hint, and the lawyer he drew it out of me. Them lawyers are great on cross-examinin\u0027, you know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did Squire Bates say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He told me I\u0027d better not tell anybody else. He talked for all the world just like you did, Sarah. You haven\u0027t been chatterin\u0027 with the squire, have you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, Adin, I don\u0027t like him well enough for that. I never fancied the squire. He\u0027s always showin\u0027 those long front teeth of his, like a wild beast.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They ain\u0027t very handsome teeth, I\u0027m bound to admit, Sarah, but the poor man can\u0027t help himself. He\u0027s as God made him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He gave you good advice at any rate, Adin. There\u0027s so many dishonest people in the world that it\u0027s best to be careful. Did you tell him when you were goin\u0027 for the money?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t exactly remember. I guess I did.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you think Squire Bates is a rich man, Adin?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know. He\u0027s a lawyer, and keeps his affairs mighty close.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That boy of his—Brandon—is his very image, even to the teeth.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, he does favor his father considerable.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 9\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean doesn\u0027t like him. He\u0027s a very big feeling boy. He looks down on Dean because he is the nephew of a poor man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"O, he\u0027ll get wiser in time. We mustn\u0027t mind them young folks so much. Boys will be boys.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So they will, but there\u0027s different kinds of boys.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I guess there\u0027s room enough in the world for both of them. If they don\u0027t like each other they can keep apart.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean is an excellent boy. I don\u0027t know how we should get along without him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I indorse all that, wife,\" said Adin Dunham heartily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027s always cheerful and willin\u0027—always ready to do chores and give up his own pleasure. I remember last winter he\u0027d set his heart on going with a skatin\u0027 party, but when I was taken sick, he stayed at home and tended me, without a word of complaint. He couldn\u0027t have done no more if he\u0027d been a son instead of a nephew.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just so, wife! Just so! He\u0027s a likely boy, and if he keeps on as he\u0027s begun he\u0027s sure to do well.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He deserves to prosper, and I hope he will. I wish we could do more for him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So do I, but a carpenter that gets work only about half the time can\u0027t do what he\u0027d like to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then Dean came into the house—a broad-shouldered, strongly built boy, with a frank, open countenance and red cheeks.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean,\" said his uncle, \"won\u0027t you go over to neighbor Gould, and ask if he will lend his horse and10 buggy for the day? I\u0027m goin\u0027 over to Rockmount.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Going to Rockmount?\" repeated Dean eagerly. \"Will you take me, uncle?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not to-day, Dean. It\u0027s a long ride, and it\u0027ll be easier on the horse to carry one than two.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean looked disappointed. A ride to Rockmount, which was a considerably larger place than Waterford, would have been to him a very agreeable recreation, but he was not a boy to complain or tease when a favor had been refused. So he indulged in no remonstrance, but went over to Mr. Gould\u0027s dwelling, only twenty rods away, and preferred the request.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly,\" said Mr. Gould pleasantly. \"So your uncle has business in Rockmount, has he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes sir, I suppose so, but he didn\u0027t tell me what it is.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, tell him not to over drive the Captain.\" (This was the rather peculiar name of Mr. Gould\u0027s horse.)\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any danger,\" said Dean smiling, for he knew that Adin Dunham was one of the most deliberate of men, and permitted a horse to select his own pace.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81467.html","bookId":428,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:27:18 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:27:18 AM"}
