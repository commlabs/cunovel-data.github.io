You also promised to further explain—in some detail—the human experience of sex.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, I promised all those things.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBook 1 had to do with more personal inquiries; with one’s life as an individual. Book 2 deals with your collective life on the planet. Book 3 concludes the Trilogy with the largest truths: the cosmology, the whole picture, the journey of the soul. Taken together, My best current advice and information on everything from tying your shoe to understanding your universe.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHave You said all You’re going to say about time?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI’ve said all you need to know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is no time. All things exist simultaneously. All events occur at once.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis Book is being written, and as it’s being written it’s already written; it already exists. In fact, that’s where you’re getting all this information—from the book that already exists. You’re merely bringing it into form.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is what is meant by: “Even before you ask, I will have answered.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis information about Time all seems. . . well, interesting, but rather esoteric. Does it have any application to real life?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA true understanding of time allows you to live much more peacefully within your reality of relativity, where time is experienced as a movement, a flow, rather than a constant.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is you who are moving, not time. Time has no movement. There is only One Moment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt some level you deeply understand this. That is why, when something really magnificent or significant occurs in your life, you often say it is as if “time stands still.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt does. And when you do also, you often experience one of those life-defining moments.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI find this hard to believe. How can this be possible?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour science has already proven this mathemati-cally. Formulas have been written showing that if you get into a spaceship and fly far enough fast enough, you could swing back around toward the Earth and watch yourself taking off.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis demonstrates that Time is not a movement but a field through which you move—in this case on Space-ship Earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou say it takes 365 “days” to make a year. Yet what is a “day”? You’ve decided—quite arbitrarily, I might add—that a “day” is the “time” it takes your Spaceship to make one complete revolution on its axis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow do you know it’s made such a spin? (You can’t feel it moving!) You’ve chosen a reference point in the heavens—the Sun. You say it takes a full “day” for the portion of the Spaceship you are on to face the Sun, turn away from the Sun, then face the Sun again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve divided this “day” into 24 “hours”—again quite arbitrarily. You could just as easily have said “10” or “73”!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen you divided each “hour” into “minutes.” You said each hourly unit contained 60 smaller units, called “minutes”—and that each of those contained 60 tiny units, called “seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne day you noticed that the Earth was not only spinning, it was also flying! You saw that it was moving through space around the sun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou carefully calculated that it took 365 revolutions of the Earth for the Earth itself to revolve around the sun. This number of Earth spins you called a “year.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThings got kind of messy when you decided that you wanted to divide up a “year” into units smaller than a “year” but larger than a “day.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou created the “week” and the “month,” and you managed to get the same number of months in every year, but not the same number of days in every month.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou couldn’t find a way to divide an odd number of days (365) by an even number of months (12), so you just decided that some months contained more days than others!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou felt you had to stay with twelve as the yearly sub-divider because that was the number of Lunar Cycles you observed your moon moving through during a “year.” In order to reconcile these three spatial events—revolutions around the sun, spins of the Earth on its axis, and moon cycles—you simply adjusted the number of “days” in each “month.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven this device didn’t solve all the problems be-cause your earlier inventions kept creating a “build up” of “time” which you didn’t know what to do with. So you also decided that every so often one year would have to have a whole day more! You called this Leap Year, and joked about it, but you actually live by such a construction—and then you call My explanation of time “unbelievable”!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve just as arbitrarily created “decades” and “centuries” (based, interestingly, on 10’s, not 12’s) to further measure the passage of “time”—but all along what you’ve really been doing is merely devising a way to measure movements through space.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus we see that it is not time which “passes,” but objects which pass through, and move around in, a static field which you call space. “Time” is simply your way of counting movements!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eScientists deeply understand this connection and therefore speak in terms of the “Space-Time Continuum.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour Dr. Einstein and others realized that time was a mental construction, a relational concept. “Time” was what it was relative to the space that existed between objects! (If the universe is expanding—which it is—then it takes “longer” for the Earth to revolve around the sun today than it did a billion years ago. There’s more “space” to cover.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus, it took more minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, and centuries for all these cyclical events to occur recently than it did in 1492! (When is a “day” not a day? When is a year not a year?)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour new, highly sophisticated timing instruments now record this “time” discrepancy, and every year clocks around the world are adjusted to accommodate a universe that won’t sit still! This is called Greenwich Mean Time... and it is “mean” because it makes a liar out of the universe!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEinstein theorized that if it wasn’t “time” which was moving, but he who was moving through space at a given rate, all he had to do was change the amount of space between objects—or change the rate of speed with which he moved through space from one object to another—to “alter” time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was his General Theory of Relativity which ex-panded your modern day understanding of the co-re-lation between time and space.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou now may begin to understand why, if you make a long journey through space and return, you may have aged only ten years—while your friends on Earth will have aged thirty! The farther you go, the more you will warp the Space-Time Continuum, and the less your chances when you land of finding alive on the Earth anyone who was there when you left!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if scientists on Earth in some “future” time developed a way to propel themselves faster, they could “cheat” the universe and stay in sync with “real time” on Earth, returning to find that the same time had passed on Earth as had passed on the Spaceship.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eObviously, if even more propulsion were available, one could return to the Earth before one took off! That is to say, time on Earth would pass more slowly than time on the spaceship. You could come back in ten of your “years” and the Earth would have “aged” only four! Increase the speed, and ten years in space might mean ten minutes on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, come across a “fold” in the fabric of space (Einstein and others believed such “folds” exist—and they were correct!) and you are suddenly propelled across “space” in one infinitesimal “moment.” Could such a time-space phenomenon literally “fling” you back into “time”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt should not be quite as difficult to now see that “time” does not exist except as a construction of your mentality. Everything that’s ever happened—and is ever going to happen—is happening now. The ability to observe it merely depends on your point of view—your “place in space.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you were in My place, you could see it All—right now!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eComprehend?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWow! I’m beginning to—on a theoretical level—yes!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGood. I’ve explained it to you here very simply, so that a child could understand it. It may not make good science, but it produces good comprehension.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRight now physical objects are limited in terms of their speed—but nonphysical objects—my thoughts... my soul... could theoretically move through the ether at incredible speeds.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExactly! Precisely! And that is what happens often in dreams and other out-of-body and psychic experi-ences.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou now understand Déj? vu.

In fact, this “set up” should serve you, not disserve you!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are always at a place of free will and total choice. Being able to see into the “future” (or get others to do it for you) should enhance your ability to live the life you want, not limit it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow?

Select another!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eChange or alter your behavior so as to avoid the undesired outcome.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut how can I avoid that which has already happened?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt has not happened to you—yet! You are at a place in the Space-Time Continuum where you are not con-sciously aware of the occurrence.

It is what makes it possible for you to “play” the great game of life! I’ll explain later!)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat you do not “know” is not “so.” Since ~ do not “remember” your future, it has not “happened” to “you” yet! A thing “happens” only when it is “expe-rienced.” A thing is “experienced” only when it is “known.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow let’s say you’ve been blessed with a brief glimpse, a split-second “knowing,” of your “future.” What’s happened is that your Spirit—the nonphysicai part of you—has simply sped to another place on the Space-Time Continuum and brought back some resid-ual energy—some images or impressions—of that mo-ment or event.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese you can “feel”—or sometimes another who has developed a metaphysical gift can “feel” or ~ these images and energies that are swirling about you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t like what you “sense” about your “fu-ture,” step away from that! just step away from it!

The whole mosaic changes. But he never loses the experience he’s given himself. He’s just relieved and happy that “you” don’t have to go through that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut the “me” in the “past” has yet to “experience” this, so he walks right into it?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn a sense, yes.

First, by changing what the “you” in front of you experienced, the “you” behind you may never have to experience it! It is by this device that your soul evolves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the same way, the future you got help from his own future self, thus helping you avoid what he did not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDid you follow that?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. And it’s intriguing. But now I have another question. What about past lives? If I have always been “me” —in the “past” and in the “future”—how could I have been someone else, another person, in a past life?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are a Divine Being, capable of more than one experience at the same “time”—and able to divide your Self into as many different “selves” as you choose.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou can live the “same life” over and over again, in different ways—as I’ve just explained. And you can also live different lives at different “times” on the Continuum.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus, all the while you’re being you, here, now—you can also be, and have been-other “selves” in other “times” and “places.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGood grief—this gets “complicateder” and “complicat-eder”!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes—and we’ve really only just scratched the sur-face here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ejust know this: You are a being of Divine Proportion, knowing no limitation.

From My viewpoint it is simply an awareness you suddenly have of something you’ve just experienced in your “future.”\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eYou are also living other lives—what you call “past lives”—right now as well—although you experience them as having been in your “past” (if you experience them at all), and that is just as well. It would be very difficult for you to play this wonderful game of life if you had full awareness of what is going on. Even this de-scription offered here cannot give you that. If it did, the “game” would be over! The Process depends on the Process being complete, as it is—including your lack of total awareness at this stage.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo bless the Process, and accept it as the greatest gift of the Kindest Creator.
