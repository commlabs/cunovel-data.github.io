The smoke was getting thicker, filling the room with dancing chimeras that kept vanishing. The fire leaped down at Alec, fondling his hair, and the crackle of the flames became Vivian\u0027s voice calling to him in an irresistible siren song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a sudden flare of brightness, he saw her.
