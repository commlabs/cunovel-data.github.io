After Gesler and his Fifth had been pushed away, there had been sounds of fighting somewhere in that direction. And Fiddler had faced the hard choice between leading his handful of soldiers into a flanking charge to break through and relieve the poor bastards, or staying quiet and hurrying on, east on a southerly tack, right into that waiting maw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe splitting cracks of sharpers had decided him-suicide running into that, since those sharpers tended to fly every which way, and they meant that Gesler and his squad were running, carving a path through the enemy, and Fiddler and his squad might simply end up stumbling into their wake, in the sudden midst of scores of enraged Edur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I left ‘em to it. And the detonations died away, but the screams continued, Hood take me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSprawled in the high grasses at the edge of the treeline, his squad. They stank. The glory of the Bonehunters, this taking to the grisliest meaning of that name. Koryk’s curse, aye. Who else? Severed fingers, ears, pierced through and dangling from belts, harness clasps, rawhide ties. His soldiers: one and all degraded into some ghastly blood-licking barely human savages. No real surprise there. It was one thing to go covert-as marines this was, after all, precisely what they had been trained to do. But it had gone on too long, without relief, with the only end in sight nothing other than Hood’s own gate. Fingers and ears, except for Smiles, who’d added to the mix with that which only males could provide. ‘M31 blecker worms,’ she’d said, referring to some offshore mud-dwelling worm native to the Kanese coast. ‘And just like the worms, they start out purple and blue and then after a day or two in the sun they turn grey. Bleckers, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn’t need to lose the path to lose theif minds, that much was obvious. Gods below, look at these fools-how in Hood’s name have we lasted this long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d not seen the captain and her runt of a mage in some time, which didn’t bode well. Still, threads of brown telltale smoke drifting around here and there in the mornings, and the faint sounds of munitions at night. So, at least some of them were still alive. But even those signs were growing scarce, when they should have been, if anything, increasing as things got nastier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve run out. We’re used up. Bah, listen to me! Starting to sound like Cuttle there. ‘I’m ready to die now, Fid. Happy to, aye. Now that I seen-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Enough of that,’ he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sergeant?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stop asking me anything, Bottle. And stop looking at me like I’ve gone mad or something.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’d better not, Sergeant. Go mad, that is. You’re the only sane one left.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Does that assessment include you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle grimaced, then spat out another wad of the grass he’d taken to chewing. Reached for a fresh handful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAye, answer enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Almost dark,’ Fiddler said, eyeing once more the quaint village ahead. Crossroads, tavern and stable, a smithy down the main street, in front of a huge pile of tailings, and what seemed too many residences, rows of narrow-laned mews, each abode looking barely enough for a small family. Could be there was some other industry, a quarry or potter’s manufactory, somewhere on the other side of the village-he thought he could see a gravel road wending up a hill past the eastern edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely quiet for dusk. Workers still chained to their workbenches? Maybe. But still, not even a damned dog in that street. ‘I don’t like the looks of this,’ he said. ‘You sure you smell nothing awry, Bottle?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nothing magical. Doesn’t mean there isn’t a hundred Edur crouched inside those houses, just waiting for us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So send in a squirrel or something, damn you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m looking, Sergeant, but if you keep interrupting me…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lord Hood, please sew up the mouths of mages, I implore you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sergeant, I’m begging you. We’ve got six squads of Edur less than a league behind us, and I’m damned tired of dodging javelins. Let me concentrate.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAye, concentrate on this fist down your throat, y’damned rat’kisser. Oh, I’m way too tired, way too old. Maybe, if we get through this-hah!-I’ll just creep away, vanish into the streets of this Letheras. Retire. Take up fishing. Or maybe knitting. Funeral shawls. Bound to be a thriving enterprise for a while, I’d wager. Once the Adjunct arrives with the rest of us snarly losers and exacts a pleasant revenge for all us dead marines. No, stop thinking that way. We’re still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Found a cat, Sergeant. Sleeping in the kitchen of that tavern. It’s having bad dreams.’\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-356.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
