Talk to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabs her car keys, swings her purse over her shoulder, and without a word she pushes past me and walks quickly down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m at her heel, following, trying to talk to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please don’t go … just wait … I know how hard this must be for you … how much you’re hurting right now … but if you’ll just let me explain…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops outside on the porch—the porch where I made love to her only a few hours ago, when I lied to her again—and slowly turns around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold in her eyes, and the dead look on her face, tell me what I already fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve lost her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no getting past this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lied to her. I let her down. Men have been letting Mia down her whole life, and now I’ve just added my name to that list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Explain? You want to explain now? You’ve had DAYS TO EXPLAIN!” she yells. “DAYS TO TELL ME THE TRUTH, BUT YOU LIED … you lied.” Her voice drops to a whisper. “She loved you … not me – you. She left me with him. God, she must have hated me…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Mia. No. You need to hear everything, you need to let me explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I DON’T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING MORE!” she screams. Tears are streaming down her face, and her hand is clutching her stomach again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes are stinging from her pain. I rub them roughly with my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go,” she says in an eerily small voice, her eyes sweeping to her car. “I have to get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fist of absolute agony twists in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe runs for her car, unlocking it on her approach. I scramble after her, grabbing her arm, trying to keep her with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t go,” I plead. “Not like this. Please, Mia. Just stay, talk to me. I can fix this. I will fix this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer empty eyes lift to mine. “This isn’t fixable … I’m not fixable. I was broken a long time ago beyond repair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe yanks her arm from my hand, climbs in her car, and drives away, leaving me in a cloud of dust and agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t realize I’m sitting on the gravel until I feel Dad’s hand on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so sorry, Jordan. I’m sorry that you’re paying for the mistakes Belle made a long time ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrub my face with my hands, then get to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No … I just … I can’t lose her. I have to make this right. I’m gonna go after her—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” He places a firm hand on my shoulder, holding me in place. “That’s not a good idea. If you go after her now, it could only make things worse. Give her time to cool down, process her hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what if she doesn’t come back?” The pain in my chest twists to pure fucking agony. I rub at the ache, feeling breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her things are here, Jordan. She has to come back for them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I shake my head, knowing how she left everything she owned behind in Boston when she ran. “Material things don’t matter to her. She left everything behind in Boston, so a few clothes left behind won’t make her come back here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of concern twists his expression for a moment. Then he pats my shoulder. “She cares about you, a lot. She’ll come back. If she doesn’t, then we’ll find her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his arm around my shoulders, and starts to steer me back inside. “Have you forgotten that your old man used to be a cop? Finding people is what I’m good at.” He smiles, trying to be helpful, positive, encouraging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, not really feeling it because my fear isn’t not finding her. I’ll track the earth until the day I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, my fear is what will be waiting for me when I do see her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo thoughts in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo pain in my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo ache in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust one focus. One aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slam on the brakes in the grocery store parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding my sunglasses on, I grab my purse and head inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get a cart. Then I hit the aisles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no conscious thought. Just need. Only need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cart is filling quickly. I’m eating already. A bag of chips already torn open and gone. A pack of candy half-eaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf people are staring, I don’t care to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cashier attempts small talk. I don’t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bag my food, pay and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I drive my car to the motel at the edge of town, the one I came to the other day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people come to motels during the day to have affairs. I come to eat. To hide my shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, in this moment it doesn’t feel so shameful anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA means to an end … an end I can’t currently see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check in at the desk. One night. I don’t need any more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just need to get this out of my system. Then I’m leaving town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I have the key to my room, I go back to my car and get my bags of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let myself in the room and dump the bags on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not the room I was in the other day, but it looks exactly the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same cheap, dirty, stale overused room. It feels right to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what I am. Cheap, stale and overused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI foolishly let myself think otherwise. Let myself think I was worth something … that I meant something to someone … him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurts to think his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bang my hands against my forehead, forcing him out, but he won’t go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I go over to the age old television and turn it on. I want to drown out the pain in my head with meaningless, but the knowledge still creeps in and cripples me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic from the television flows into the room, filling every empty corner with Rihanna’s “Diamonds”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain lances through me. I catch a sob with a fist to my mouth as I sink to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he…? How could she…?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop, Mia. Stop now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know how to take the pain away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawl over to the bed and rip open the first thing I lay my hand on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoving it in my mouth, I chew quickly, swallowing. There’s no taste. Just relief. The relief that always comes with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drag a bag down from the bed, emptying its contents to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tear open another packet – cookies. I shove them in my mouth, chewing, trying to eat as many as I can as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the food is sticking, like my body is ready to reject already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard, forcing it down, and grab the bottle of soda I bought, downing some, lubricating my dry throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I start in, eating harder than I ever have before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m laying on the dirty floor of the room, staring up at the cracked ceiling. Nearly all the food is gone, my body is drenched in sweat, and my stomach hurts like I’ve never known before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve eaten more than I ever have before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the feeling is soothing because it’s better to feel the painful ache of the food in my stomach, than to feel the crippling agony threatening to shred my heart to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother abandoned me to raise him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man I’m in love with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m truly that worthless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggle to my feet. I’m going to be sick. But I hold it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need the relief of doing this to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStruggling my way to the bathroom, I kneel at the toilet. Fingers pressed together, I push back in my throat, and rid myself of the pain trying to consume me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s still here. It didn’t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’ve taken this from me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ability to stop feeling. To stop the pain from taking me over. And now it’s here, and my ribs feel as if they’re going to crack from the absolute agony that’s tearing through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No. No. No!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m glad she’s dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrawling out of the bathroom, I struggle to my feet. My legs feel numb, my head woozy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stagger over to the bed. Scouring through the mess of empty bags and wrappers and containers that litter the bed and floor, I find some food. A bag of popcorn and some peanut butter cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! I need more than this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check the bed for more food, but nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRipping open the popcorn, I shove it into my mouth, handfuls at a time, retching as I swallow, but I don’t care, I push through. Then I switch to the peanut butter cups. When they’re gone, I get down on my hands and knees, rummaging through the trash on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find a jar of chocolate spread which had rolled under the bed. I crack it open and start scooping it out with my hand, shoveling it in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the food’s gone, and I’m nowhere near full, but it’ll have to do. I stumble back to the bathroom, stand over the sink, and force the food back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning the water, I try to wash the sick away, but the plug is blocked. There’s chocolate all over my hands and arms. Vomit in the sink. I lift my head and see myself in the mirror above it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgusting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFood is smeared across my mouth, my face … in my hair. There’s vomit on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m disgusting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t hate them – Jordan. Anna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger that I’ve never allowed myself to feel tears through me. I slam my fist into the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt shatters, small shards falling into the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood drips down from my hand landing on the white tiles beneath my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don’t feel the pain in my hand, only the pain in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes on the flood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe self-hate. The disgust. The loss. The helplessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gates open up, and it all comes washing in – fierce, like the force of a tsunami.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip the sink, opening my eyes, but I can’t see for the hot, burning tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to get out of here. I need more … something, anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving too quickly, shadows dance before my eyes, blinding me, taunting me. I stumble around the bathroom, searching for the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve overdone it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to black-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach my hand out for support, finding none, and it’s too late, I’m going down … hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t take this any longer,” I say, grabbing my car keys off the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve waited all day, but there’s been no sign of Mia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now it’s getting late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m beyond fucking worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried calling her cell a few hours ago. I got her number from the booking in sheet. How bad is that – I didn’t even know her cell number. But then I’ve never needed to call her, and I’ve not once seen her with a cell in all the time I’ve been with her. Still, I had to give it a try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a dead end. It was switched off, and I couldn’t even leave a damn voicemail because her mailbox was full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m frustrated, and I feel fucking helpless, so now I’m doing the only thing I can.
