When he gave it back to her, it was full of teeth marks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Allison held the pencil by its point. \"Yuck!\" she said. \"You chewed on it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason felt awful. It is very embarrassing to borrow somebody\u0027s pencil and then chew on it. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t do it on purpose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can keep it,\" said Allison. She dropped the pencil on Jason\u0027s desk, then raised her hand. \"Mrs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 66\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jewls, can I go to the bathroom? I have to wash my hands. Jason slobbered all over my pencil.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everybody laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason turned red. \"I\u0027m sorry, Allison,\" he said. \"I know it\u0027s a disgusting habit. I just can\u0027t help it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t let Jason touch any of my books,\" said Allison as she headed out of the room. \"He might eat them!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everybody laughed again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here, you can eat my book, Jason,\" said Todd. \"I don\u0027t like it anyway.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls made Todd write his name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason was so mad at himself, he broke the chewed-up pencil to bits.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That wasn\u0027t a smart thing to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Everybody take out a pencil and a piece of paper,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"It\u0027s time for our spelling test.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason slapped himself on the forehead. I\u0027m so stupid! he thought. \"Rondi, may I borrow a pencil, please?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rondi made a face. \"All my pencils are new,\" she said. \"How do I know you won\u0027t eat it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I won\u0027t,\" said Jason. \"I promise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You better not,\" said Rondi. She gave him one of her pencils.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was new and freshly sharpened. Jason liked the way it smelled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 67\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The first word is \u0027orchestra,\u0027 \" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason tried to remember how to spell orchestra. He stuck the back of the pencil in his mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Second word, \u0027garbanzo.\u0027 \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason chewed on the eraser.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the spelling test was over, Rondi\u0027s pencil was worse than Allison\u0027s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason looked at it in horror. He didn\u0027t even remember chewing it. Oh, no! he thought. What am I going to do? He stuck it inside his desk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jason, may I have my pencil back, please?\" asked Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What pencil?\" asked Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The one I lent you,\" said Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason opened his desk and pretended to look for it. \"I don\u0027t know where it is,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Jewls, Jason stole my pencil!\" called Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jason, give Rondi back her pencil,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He gave it to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You chewed on it!\" exclaimed Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No I didn\u0027t,\" said Jason, \"Those are your teeth marks.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How can they be my teeth marks?\" asked Rondi. She smiled. She was missing her two front teeth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So?\" said Jason. \"You don\u0027t chew pencils with your front teeth. You chew them with your back teeth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do you know?\" asked Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Um, um, uh,\" said Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls made Jason write his name on the board under the word DISCIPLINE because he chewed Rondi\u0027s pencil, then lied about it. \"And try not to eat the chalk,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rondi threw the chewed-up pencil out the window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It hit Louis on the head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls gave Dameon a stack of work sheets and asked him to pass them out. They contained arithmetic problems.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason had to borrow another pencil.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Allison, may I borrow another pencil, please?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Eat my socks,\" said Allison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That wasn\u0027t such a bad idea, Jason realized. If he stuffed a sock in his mouth, he wouldn\u0027t be able to chew a pencil.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Myron looked at his work sheet. \"I don\u0027t feel like doing this stuff,\" he said. \"Here, Jason, you can have my pencil.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thanks, Myron,\" said Jason. \"I promise not to chew it.\" He hoped he\u0027d be able to keep his promise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He thought about asking Mrs. Jewls for a Tootsie Roll Pop. If I\u0027m sucking on that, I won\u0027t chew Myron\u0027s pencil. And a Tootsie Roll Pop would probably taste better than Allison\u0027s socks. He didn\u0027t know for sure because he had never tasted Allison\u0027s socks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 69\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But before he could ask Mrs. Jewls, Mrs. Jewls called him. \"Jason, will you come here for a moment,\" she said. \"I think I know how to keep you from chewing pencils.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason smiled as he walked to her desk. \"I like the purple ones,\" he told her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027t give him a Tootsie Roll Pop. Instead, she taped his mouth shut with heavy-duty masking tape. She had to use a lot of tape, because Jason had the second biggest mouth in the class. \"There,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason started back to his seat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aren\u0027t you even going to say thank you?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mhhmm hhm,\" said Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re welcome,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, Jason,\" teased Allison. \"You look like a mummy!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t sneeze,\" said Rondi. \"You\u0027ll blow your head off!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They both laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mh mhhh mhrhhmmm!\" Jason said back to them. It was a very bad thing to say. He wasn\u0027t supposed to use words like that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You better not pull the tape off,\" said Rondi. \"You might rip off your lips!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They both laughed again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason had never been more embarrassed in his\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 70\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e whole life. His ears burned as he set to work on the arithmetic problems.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were tough problems. Several times the pencil crashed against the tape, but the tape held firm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls was very proud of herself. Not only did the tape protect Myron\u0027s pencil, but Mrs. Jewls also noticed that Jason was quieter than he\u0027d ever been. I should tape all their mouths shut, she thought. Then they\u0027d all be so nice and quiet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was such a good idea, she wondered why no other teacher had ever thought of it.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56869.html","bookId":626,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:26 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:26 AM"}
