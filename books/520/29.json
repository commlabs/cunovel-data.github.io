{"id":44695,"no":29,"title":"31st December","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I meant to write to you before and thank you for your Christmas cheque,\n\u003cbr\u003e but life in the McBride household is very absorbing, and I don\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e seem able to find two consecutive minutes to spend at a desk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I bought a new gown--one that I didn\u0027t need, but just wanted. \n\u003cbr\u003e My Christmas present this year is from Daddy-Long-Legs; my family\n\u003cbr\u003e just sent love.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve been having the most beautiful vacation visiting Sallie. \n\u003cbr\u003e She lives in a big old-fashioned brick house with white trimmings set\n\u003cbr\u003e back from the street--exactly the kind of house that I used to look\n\u003cbr\u003e at so curiously when I was in the John Grier Home, and wonder what it\n\u003cbr\u003e could be like inside. I never expected to see with my own eyes--\n\u003cbr\u003e but here I am! Everything is so comfortable and restful and homelike;\n\u003cbr\u003e I walk from room to room and drink in the furnishings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is the most perfect house for children to be brought up in;\n\u003cbr\u003e with shadowy nooks for hide and seek, and open fire places for pop-corn,\n\u003cbr\u003e and an attic to romp in on rainy days and slippery banisters with a\n\u003cbr\u003e comfortable flat knob at the bottom, and a great big sunny kitchen,\n\u003cbr\u003e and a nice, fat, sunny cook who has lived in the family thirteen years\n\u003cbr\u003e and always saves out a piece of dough for the children to bake. \n\u003cbr\u003e Just the sight of such a house makes you want to be a child all\n\u003cbr\u003e over again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And as for families! I never dreamed they could be so nice. \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie has a father and mother and grandmother, and the sweetest\n\u003cbr\u003e three-year-old baby sister all over curls, and a medium-sized brother\n\u003cbr\u003e who always forgets to wipe his feet, and a big, good-looking brother\n\u003cbr\u003e named Jimmie, who is a junior at Princeton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We have the jolliest times at the table--everybody laughs and jokes\n\u003cbr\u003e and talks at once, and we don\u0027t have to say grace beforehand. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s a relief not having to thank Somebody for every mouthful you eat. \n\u003cbr\u003e (I dare say I\u0027m blasphemous; but you\u0027d be, too, if you\u0027d offered as\n\u003cbr\u003e much obligatory thanks as I have.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Such a lot of things we\u0027ve done--I can\u0027t begin to tell you about them. \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. McBride owns a factory and Christmas eve he had a tree for\n\u003cbr\u003e the employees\u0027 children. It was in the long packing-room which was\n\u003cbr\u003e decorated with evergreens and holly. Jimmie McBride was dressed\n\u003cbr\u003e as Santa Claus and Sallie and I helped him distribute the presents.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dear me, Daddy, but it was a funny sensation! I felt as benevolent\n\u003cbr\u003e as a Trustee of the John Grier home. I kissed one sweet,\n\u003cbr\u003e sticky little boy--but I don\u0027t think I patted any of them on the head!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And two days after Christmas, they gave a dance at their own house\n\u003cbr\u003e for ME.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was the first really true ball I ever attended--college doesn\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e count where we dance with girls. I had a new white evening gown\n\u003cbr\u003e (your Christmas present--many thanks) and long white gloves\n\u003cbr\u003e and white satin slippers. The only drawback to my perfect,\n\u003cbr\u003e utter, absolute happiness was the fact that Mrs. Lippett\n\u003cbr\u003e couldn\u0027t see me leading the cotillion with Jimmie McBride. \n\u003cbr\u003e Tell her about it, please, the next time you visit the J. G. H.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours ever,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy Abbott\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. Would you be terribly displeased, Daddy, if I didn\u0027t turn\n\u003cbr\u003e out to be a Great Author after all, but just a Plain Girl?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59751.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
