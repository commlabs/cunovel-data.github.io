And shesaid that nobody else could take the spell off.\"When he still looked doubtful, although a bit more grim, Maggie added, \"Why don\u0027t youtry it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached down with long, strong fingers to pullat the fastenings of his brace. It came off easily,and Maggie\u0027s eyebrows went up. She blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe extended his arm, pointing it at the wall, anddrew a dagger from his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie had forgotten about the blood part. Shebit the inside of her cheek and didn\u0027t say anythingashe opened a small cut on his wrist. Blood welled up red, then flowed in a trickle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little blast,\" Delos said, and looked calmlyat the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned, his golden eyes flaring dangerously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie could see the concentration in his face. Hespread his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie let out her breath. I guess spells are invisible, she thought. The brace was just for show.Delos was looking at his armasif it didn\u0027t belong to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in trouble,\" Maggie said, trying not tomake it sound like I told you so. \"While they thought they were alone in here, they were talkingabout all kinds of things. All Hunter cares about is getting you to help him destroy the humans. Butthere\u0027s been some big split in the Night World, and the witches have seceded from it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelos went very still, and his eyes were distant.\"That means war. Open war between witches and vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" Maggie said, waving a hand vaguely.\"But, listen, Delos, the witches sent somebody here,an ambassador, to talk to you. To try to get you on their side. Hunter said they\u0027ve got one of the Wild Powers on their side already-the witches, I mean.Are you getting this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Delos said. But now his voice wasoddly distant, too. He was looking at something Maggie couldn\u0027t see. \"But one out of four doesn\u0027tmatter. Two out of four, three out of four-it\u0027s notgood enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talkingabout?\" Maggie didn\u0027t waitfor him to answer. \"But, look. I know the girl whocame to talk to you. It\u0027s the girl I was with on therocks, the other one you saved from Bern. She\u0027sAradia, and she\u0027s Maiden of all the witches. And,Delos, they\u0027re looking for her right now. They wantto kill her to stop her from getting to you. And she\u0027s my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s too bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to stopthem,\" Maggie said, exasperated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wecan\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought Maggie up short. She stared at him.\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying we can\u0027t stop them. They\u0027re toostrong. Maggie, listen to me,\" he said calmly and clearly, when she began an incoherent protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the first time he\u0027s said my name out loud, she thought dizzily, and then she focused on hiswords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not just the spell they\u0027ve put on me. And it\u0027snot just that they control the castle. Oh, yes, theydo,\" he said with a bitter laugh, cutting her off again. \"You haven\u0027t been here very long; you don\u0027tunderstand. The nobles here are centuries old,most of them. They don\u0027t like being ruled by a precocious child with uncanny powers. As soon asHunter showed up, they transferred their loyalty to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027BUt-\"\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s everything they admire. The perfect vampire, the ultimate predator. He\u0027s ruthless andbloodthirsty and he wants to give them the wholeworldas their hunting grounds. Do you really thinkany of them can resist that?

Do you think any of them won\u0027t follow him willingly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie was silent. There was nothing she couldsay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, and it was scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that isn\u0027t all,\" he continued remorselessly.\"Do you want to hear a prophecy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" Maggie said. She\u0027d heard more thanenough of those for one lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored her. \"My old teacher used to tell methis,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Four to stand between the light and theshadow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour of blue fire, power in their blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorn in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision;Four less one and darkness triumphs.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh,\" Maggie said. To her it sounded likejust more of the same thing. The only interestingthing about it was that it mentioned the blindMaiden. That had to be Aradia, didn\u0027t it? She wasone famous witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s `born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027svision?\"\u0027 she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means all the Wild Powers are the same age,born seventeen years ago,\" Delos said impatiently. `But that\u0027s not the point. The point is the last line,`Four less one and darkness triumphs.\u0027 That meansthat the darkness is going to win, Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s inevitable. There\u0027s no way that the humansand the witches can get all four Wild Powers ontheir side. And if there\u0027s even one less than four,the darkness is going to win. All the vampires need to do is kill one of the Wild Powers, and it\u0027s allover. Don\u0027t you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stared at him. She did see what he wassaying, and it was even scarier than what he\u0027d saidbefore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that doesn\u0027t mean we can just give up,\"she said, trying to puzzle out his expression. \"If we do that, it will be all over. We can\u0027t just surrender and letthem win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" he said harshly. \"We have tojoin them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. Maggie realized that her mouth had fallen open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to be on the winning side, and that\u0027sthe vampire side.\" He looked at her with yelloweyes that seemed as remote and deathly calm as apanther\u0027s. \"I\u0027m sorry about your friends, but there\u0027s no chance for them. And the only chance for youis to become a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u0027s brain suddenly surged into overdrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, she saw exactly what he was saying.And furygave her energy. He was lightning-fast, but she jumped up and out of the way before he could close his hands on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you out of your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to killme?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to save your life, the only way I can.\"He stood up, following her with that same eerie calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe this. I ...really ...can\u0027t ... believe this, Maggie thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe circled around the bed, then stopped. It was pointless; he was going to get her eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked into his face one more time, and saw that he was completely serious. She dropped herarms and relaxed her shoulders, trying to slow herbreathing, meeting his eyes directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delos, this isn\u0027t just about me, and it\u0027s not justabout my friends. It\u0027s about all the slaves here, andall the humans on the Outside. Turning me into a vampire isn\u0027t going to help them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said again. \"But you\u0027re all that really matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not,\"Maggie said, and this time the hottears didn\u0027t stop at her eyes, but overflowed and rolled down her cheeks. She shook them off angrily, and took one last deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t let you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t stop me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can fight. I can make you kill me before youturn me into a vampire. If you want to try it thatway, come and take your best shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelos\u0027s yellow eyes bored into hers-and thensuddenly shifted and dropped. He stepped back, hisface cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" he said. \"If you won\u0027t cooperate, I\u0027ll putyou in the dungeon until you see what\u0027s best foryou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie felt her mouth drop open again.\"You wouldn\u0027t,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dungeon, like everything else in the castle,was heart-stoppingly authentic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had something that Maggie had read about in books but hadn\u0027t seen in the rooms above: rushesand straw on the floor. It also had a stone benchcarved directly into the stone wall and a narrow,barred window-slit about fifteen feet above Mag gie\u0027s head. And that was all it had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Maggie had poked into the straw enoughto discover that she didn\u0027t really wantto know whatwas down there and shaken the iron bars that made up the door and examined the stone slabs in the wall and stood on the bench to try to climb to the window, therewas nothing else to do. She sat on the bench and felt the true enormity of the situation trickle in on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was really stuck here. Delos was really serious. And the world, the actual, real world out there, could be affected as a consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t that she didn\u0027t understand his motivation. She had been in his mind; she\u0027d felt thestrength of his protectiveness for her. And she wanted to protect him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t possible to forget about everyoneelse. Her parents, her friends, her teachers, thepaper girl. If she let Delos give up, what happenedto them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the people in the Dark Kingdom. Laundressand Old Mender and Soaker and Chamber-pot Emptier and all the other slaves. She caredabout them. She admired their gritty determination to goon living, whatever the circumstances-and theircourage in risking their lives to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what Delosdoesn\u0027t understand, shethought. He doesn\u0027t see them as people, so he can\u0027tcare about them. All his life he\u0027s only cared abouthimself, and now about me. He can\u0027t look beyondthat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only she could think of a way to makehimsee-but she couldn\u0027t. As the hours passed and thesilence began to wear on her, she kept trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo inspiration came. And finally the light outsideher cell began to fade and the cold started to settle in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was half asleep, huddled on her chilly bench,when she heard the rattle of a key in a door. She jumped up and went to peer through the bars, hoping to see Delos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door at the end of the narrow stone corridoropened and someone came in with a flare. But itwasn\u0027t Delos. It was a guard, and behind him wasanother guard, and this one had a prisoner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeanne!\" Maggie said in dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then her heart plummeted further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA third guard was half marching, half supporting Aradia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie looked at them wordlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t like Jeanne not to fight, she thought, asthe guards opened the cell door and shoved theother girls in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door clanged shut again, and the guardsmarched back out without speaking. Almost as an afterthought, one of them stuck a flare in an ironring to give the prisoners some light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeanne picked herself up off the floor, and thenhelped Aradia get up. \"They\u0027ve got P.J. upstairs,\"she said to Maggie, who was still staring. \"Theysaid they wouldn\u0027t hurt her if we went quietly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie opened her mouth, shut it again, andtried to swallow her heart, which was in her throat.At last she managed to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delos said that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delos and Hunter Redfern and that witch.They\u0027re all very chummy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie sat down on the cold bench.\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Because you\u0027re too stupidly trusting?\"Jeanne said. \"You\u0027re not responsible for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she means because she\u0027s his soulmate,\"Aradia said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeanne stared at her as if she\u0027d started speaking a foreign language. Maggie stared, too, feeling hereyes getting wider, trying to study the beautiful features in the semidarkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt oddly shy of this girl whom she\u0027d calledCady and who had turned out to be something shecould never have imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know that?\" she asked, trying notto sound tongue-tied. \"Can you justtell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsmile curved the perfect lips in the shadows.\"I could tell before,\" Aradia said gently, backing upquite accurately to sit on the bench. \"When youcame back from seeing him the first time, but Iwas too foggy to really focus on anything then. I\u0027veseen a lot of it in the last few years, though. Peoplefinding their soulmates, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re better, aren\u0027t you?\" Maggie said. \"Yousound lots moreawake.\" It wasn\u0027t just that. Aradia had always had a quiet dignity, but now therewas an authority and confidence about her thatwas new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The healing women helped me. I\u0027m still weak,though,\" Aradia said softly, looking around the cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t use any of my powers-not that breakingthrough walls is among them, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie let her breath out. \"Oh, well. I\u0027m gladyou\u0027re awake, anyway.\" She added, feeling shy again,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, I know your real name, now. Sorry about the misunderstanding before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAradia put a hand-again perfectly accuratelyon Maggie\u0027s. \"Listen, my dear friend,\" she said,startling Maggie with both the word and the intensity of her voice, \"nobody has ever helped me more than you did, or with less reason. If you\u0027d been oneof my people, and you\u0027d known who I was, it wouldhave been amazing enough. But from a human, who didn\u0027t know anything about me ...\"Shestopped and shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know if we\u0027ll even live through tonight,\" she said. `But if we do,and if there\u0027s ever anything the witches can do foryou, all you have to do is ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie blinked hard. \"Thanks,\" she whispered. \"I meanyou know. I couldn\u0027t just leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do know,\" Aradia said. \"And that\u0027s the amazingthing.\" She squeezed Maggie\u0027s hand. \"Whatever happens, I\u0027ll never forget you. And neither will theother witches, if I have anything to say about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie gulped. She didn\u0027t want to get startedcrying. She was afraid she wouldn\u0027t be able to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately Jeanne was looking back and forthbetween them like someone at a tennis match.\"What\u0027s all this sappy stuff?\" she demanded. \"Whatare you guys talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie told her. Not just about Aradia being Maiden of the witches, but about everything she\u0027dlearned from listening to Hunter Redfern andSylvia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the witches have left the Night World,\" Aradia said quietly, when she was finished. \"They wereabout ready to when I left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were coming here to talk to Delos,\" Maggie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAradia nodded. \"We heard that Hunter had gotten some lead about the next Wild Power. And weknew he wasn\u0027t goingto take any chances on letting Circle Daybreak get hold of this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeanne was rubbing her forehead. \"What\u0027s Circle Daybreak?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s the last circle of witches-but it isn\u0027t justwitches. It\u0027s for humans, too, and for shapeshiftersand vampires who want to live in peace with humans. And now it\u0027s for everybody who opposes the darkness.\" She thought a moment and added, \"I used to belong to Circle Twilight, the ...not-so wicked witches.\" She smiled, then it faded. \"Butnow there are really only two sides to choose from.It\u0027s the Daylightorthe Darkness, and that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delos really isn\u0027t on the side of the Darkness,\"Maggie said, feeling the ache in her chest tighten.\"He\u0027s just-confused.

If I live long enough, I\u0027ll be their Mother one day, and then their Crone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What fun. But with all that, you still can\u0027t thinkof any way to get us out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAradia sobered. \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027m sorry.
