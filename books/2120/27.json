She was sitting up in bed, her fine blond hair cascading over her shoulders and hospital gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer green eyes open, wide and bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a low, haunted voice she spoke. \"Beware, Schuyler. Beware.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler woke with a start. She found herself in her mother\u0027s hospital room at Columbia Presbyterian, but she had no recollection of how she had gotten there. It was past midnight, and the last thing she remembered was falling asleep while reading a book. She had no memory of leaving her bedroom, taking the bus up to 168th Street, and arriving at the hospital. She must have been sleepwalking, or had blacked out just as Bliss had described.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at her mother. Allegra was sleeping underneath the covers, silent and peaceful as ever. Was it just a dream? But it seemed so real. Her mother was awake, was speaking to her. She had told her to beware. Beware of what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother,\" Schuyler said, stroking Allegra\u0027s cold cheek. The pain of missing her never quite went away. Schuyler kissed her mother\u0027s forehead and left the room, turning out the lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt dinner the next evening, Lawrence invited Schuyler to dine with him at his old club. The Adventurers Club was an elite organization founded by the Blue Bloods in the early part of the eighteenth century as a meeting place of like-minded globe-trotters who were eager to document and share their research and theories on natural and geographic phenomenon. It was located in a well-appointed town house on Fifth Avenue, across from the Knickerbocker Club and minutes from the Metropolitan Museum--two Blue Blood associations that had to effect a more inclusive policy in recent years and accommodate Red Bloods into their ranks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Adventurers Club was still a vampire stronghold, if only because humans didn\u0027t seem to be as interested in environmental issues as social ones, and there was no cachet to be had by joining the stodgy old Adventurers circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dining room was filled with members of the old families: the Carondolets were there, as well as the Lorillards and the Seligmans, whom, like the Van Alens, had more illustrious histories rather than present-day fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence was welcomed by the maitre d\u0027 and walked around the room, shaking hands and chatting before he and Schuyler were finally able to sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe menu at the Adventurers hadn\u0027t changed since the nineteenth century. Sole meuni?re. Steak Diane. Roasted rabbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler ordered the sole, Lawrence opted for the steak. Their food arrived underneath silver covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voil?,\" the waiter said, uncovering both at the same time. \"Bon app?tit. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she cut into her fish, Schuyler told Lawrence what had happened the night before. \"I had a blackout...I woke up and I was at the hospital, in Mom\u0027s room,\" she confessed. \"Blackouts? How do you mean?\" Lawrence asked, chewing on his steak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, when you slip out of time and then you wake up and you don\u0027t know how you got there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence put down his fork. \"I know memory flash- backs. But vampires are always in control when they relive their memories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Schuyler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence nodded. \"What you\u0027re describing is highly unusual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unusual?\" Schuyler paused. But it happened to Bliss all the time, so it couldn\u0027t be that uncommon. She relayed to her grandfather what Bliss had told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence digested the information. \"Perhaps this crop of vampires has something new in their genetic makeup that causes it. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anything to worry about, but let me know if it ever happens again.\" Then he sighed and put down his fork. \"Now, I must tell you something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler steeled herself for the news she had been dreading since the day her grandfather had returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The judge has agreed to hear Charles\u0027s petition to adopt you. The hearing is in a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePATIENT RECORD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSt. Dymphna Home for the Insane\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eName: Margaret Stanford\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAge: 16 Admitted: April 5, 1869\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCAUSES:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShowing the probable causes of insanity in the patient admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMORAL:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReligious excitement Love affairs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePHYSICAL:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelf-abuse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccident or injury\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilepsy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuicidal.
