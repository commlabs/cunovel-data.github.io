{"id":83036,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eCole downshifts the car and accelerates hard as we enter highway traffic. Narrow headlights shoot beams into the darkness as we navigate the back roads. The drive to civilization makes me uneasy. There is nothing around for miles. It looks like an alien abduction road. Cole\u0027s gaze keeps shifting to me, and makes me extra nervous. I can\u0027t tell what he is thinking. The sick part of my mind wonders if he is taking me into the strawberry fields to kill me. My pinky lifts for the door handle as we slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head, he grins, \"Dear God. Miss Lamore, just jump. If you really think I\u0027m going to kill you, please jump now before I really do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl, \"I\u0027m not - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so. Your entire body is wound so tight that I could... well, never mind what I could do. I can tell you don\u0027t trust me.\" His voice is cold like I\u0027ve offended him. After a moment he asks, \"Do you care to tell me why? What have I done to warrant this reaction from you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting my bottom lip, I\u0027m not sure if I want to answer. I\u0027m still upset with him, but I find myself saying, \"I don\u0027t really know you and I don\u0027t know where I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances at me out of the corner of his eye. His grip tightens on the steering wheel of his Porsche. \"You\u0027re north of the studio, nearing the highway, with a man who values his reputation and wouldn\u0027t waste it on dumping your body in a farmer\u0027s field, no matter how much you irritate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I irritate you?\" I laugh. I fold my arms over my chest to make sure I don\u0027t flinch and reach for the door again. I mutter something about farmers and pitchforks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, glancing at me out of the corner of his eye. After a moment he says, \"So, Miss Vanilla,\" my stomach drops when he calls me that. It brings back the dream and every sensation that lit my body on fire, begging for his touch. I stiffen. Cole glances at me and continues, \"tell me why you so abhorrently object to fine art nudes. I find that ironic, being that you claim to be an artist and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s baiting me. I know it, but I answer anyway, \"I\u0027m not Miss Vanilla, smart ass, so stop calling me that.\" I\u0027m quiet for a moment, trying to put it into words. \"As for the nudes, I think they belong in paintings, not photography. Nudes in photography usually equal pornography.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, a deep belly laugh in one short burst, \"You actually believe that?\" I nod with a serious expression on my face. \"Then you\u0027re a hypocrite, Lamore. You can\u0027t be an artist and only value one medium and disregard the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not,\" I say calmly. I\u0027m holding my hands in my lap, watching the world zoom by. Cole\u0027s foot is heavy when he\u0027s irritated. I appear to have easy access to his crazy buttons and seem to be punching them like a typewriter tonight. \"It\u0027s not the medium. It\u0027s the content.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the same content is okay in a painting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Yes. Botticelli was an artist. Heffner is a pornographer. No one jerks off looking at Venus on a half shell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice is charged with emotion, \"Guys jerk off to all sorts of things, so that shouldn\u0027t be your criteria for anything. As for your identifying factors of what\u0027s art and what isn\u0027t, tell me - what makes something art? Can you define that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about it for a moment. In my gut I know. I know it when I see it. My lips part and I\u0027m telling him, \"It\u0027s art when it\u0027s evocative, when it can convey emotions and feelings to the viewer. An idea - or ideal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And sensuality doesn\u0027t count?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Well,\" I think about it. Sensuality isn\u0027t my issue. I\u0027m not sure what is. I shake my head, not looking at him I say, \"Yes, it counts.\" Cole is silent with a surprised expression on his face. I stare out the window as lights blaze by in the darkness. We\u0027re on the highway now, zooming closer and closer to his apartment. I\u0027m nervous. Nervous of what I\u0027ll say. What I\u0027ll do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice is soft, \"Why? Why does it count?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s no longer challenging me, but sounds like he genuinely wants to know what I think. This entire conversation is way outside of my comfort zone, but I don\u0027t back down. I want him to see that I\u0027m right and not just some crazy prude. Leaning my head back in the seat, I think. \"Because it\u0027s an emotion. Sensuality isn\u0027t what I object to... it\u0027s more the fact that nude photos are degrading to women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole laughs, \"Oh my god! How many crazy women are living inside your brain? How do you manage with all of them in there telling you what to say? Does one tie the others up and randomly take over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re such an ass,\" I sigh, shaking my head at him. \"You asked my opinion. Don\u0027t ask if you don\u0027t want to hear...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that was not your opinion. It was what you\u0027ve heard, what you\u0027ve learned. It isn\u0027t what you think. Last week I saw it on your face during those shoots. This kind of photography - this kind of work - isn\u0027t what you thought it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No it isn\u0027t. None of this is what I thought it would be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That makes two of us.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-7.html","bookId":1876,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM"}
