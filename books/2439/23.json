Evra was the first to break it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" he screamed. \"Don\u0027t do it! You can\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Debbie for Evra,\" I said, ignoring Evra\u0027s pleas. \"How about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Debbie?\" Murlough scratched his cheeks slowly. It took him a few seconds to figure out who I was referring to. Then he remembered and smiled. \"Ah! Debbie! Darren Shan\u0027s tasty girlfriend.\" His eyes twinkled as he thought about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d be more use to you than Evra,\" I said. \"You could drink from her. You said you\u0027d like to. You said she\u0027d have nice blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Murlough agreed. \"Salty. Juicy.\" He took a step back from Evra. \"But why choose?\" he mused aloud. \"Why not have both? Kill the snake-boy now, drink from Debbie later. She won\u0027t be hard to find. I can watch the square tomorrow, find out where she lives, and as soon as night comes...\" He grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have time,\" I said. \"You have to leave the city tonight. You can\u0027t wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still yapping about leaving?\" Murlough snorted. \"If I let you go - as you\u0027ve convinced me I should - I won\u0027t have to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes you will,\" I contradicted him. \"It\u0027ll take a while for the vampires to discover I\u0027m alive. The Generals will come straight down these tunnels when they arrive. They\u0027ll find out about me eventually, but if they kill you beforehand...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wouldn\u0027t dare!\" Murlough shrieked. \"It would mean war!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they wouldn\u0027t know that. They\u0027d think they were in the right. They\u0027d pay dearly for their mistake, but that would be no consolation as far as you\u0027re concerned. You have to leave, as soon as possible. You can return in a couple of weeks, but if you stick around now, it\u0027ll be a recipe for disaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young Murlough doesn\u0027t want to leave.\" The vampaneze pouted. \"I like it here. I don\u0027t want to go. But you\u0027re right.\" He sighed. \"For a few nights at least, I must get out. Find a dark, abandoned cellar. Hole up. Lay low.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why Debbie would be better than Evra,\" I pressed on. \"You must be hungry. You\u0027ll want to feed before leaving, yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" Murlough agreed, rubbing his bloated stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But feeding without planning is dangerous. Vampires are used to it, but vampaneze aren\u0027t, are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Murlough said. \"We\u0027re smarter than vampires. We think ahead. Plan it out. Mark our meals in advance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can\u0027t do that now,\" I reminded him. \"You need a quick snack to keep you going while you\u0027re away. I can provide that. Agree to my terms and I\u0027ll take you to Debbie. I can get you in and out without anybody knowing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren! Stop!\" Evra roared. \"I don\u0027t want this! You can\u0027t -?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurlough punched Evra hard in the stomach, shutting him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I trust you?\" the vampaneze hissed. \"How do I know you won\u0027t trick me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could I?\" I retorted. \"Keep my hands bound behind my back. Keep a knife close to my throat. Leave Evra where he is - I\u0027ll come back for him later, once you\u0027ve fed and left. If I try anything, I\u0027ll be dooming us both. I\u0027m not stupid. I know what\u0027s at stake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurlough hummed tunelessly as he thought it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t do this.\" Evra moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way,\" I said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to trade Debbie\u0027s life for mine,\" he said. \"I\u0027d rather die myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See if you think that way tomorrow.\" I grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you do it?\" he asked. \"How can you give her up as if she was just a... a...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A human\" I said shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to say animal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled thinly. \"To a vampire it\u0027s the same thing. You\u0027re my best friend, Evra. Debbie\u0027s just a human I had a crush on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra shook his head. \"I don\u0027t recognize you anymore,\" he said sadly, and turned away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Murlough reached a decision. He drew back his knives, then thrust them forward. I winced, but he only cut the rope around my ankles. I fell heavily to the floor. \"We\u0027ll do it your way,\" the vampaneze declared. \"But if you put one foot out of line...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" I said, getting up. \"Now - how about your word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t given it to me yet. I\u0027m not leaving without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampaneze grinned. \"Clever boy,\" he gurgled. \"All right. I give you my word - the girl for Snakey. Debbie for Evra. Is that good enough for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Say you\u0027ll let me go when you\u0027re finished with Debbie. Say you won\u0027t stop me coming back to free Evra. Say you\u0027ll do nothing to hurt either of us afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurlough laughed. \"Oh, you\u0027re clever all right. Almost as clever as young Murlough. Very well. I\u0027ll let you go. I\u0027ll do nothing to stop you coming back, or hurt you once you\u0027re free.\" He raised a finger. \"But if you ever return to this city, or if our paths cross in the future, it\u0027ll be death. This is a temporary deal, not a long-term guarantee. Agreed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well. Should we start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to undo a few of these ropes?\" I asked. \"I can barely walk like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Barelyis good enough.\" Murlough laughed. \"I\u0027m not going to take any chances with you. I\u0027ve got a feeling you wouldn\u0027t miss a trick.\" He shoved me hard in the back. I stumbled, then found my feet and began to walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over my shoulder at Evra. \"I won\u0027t be long,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll be back before dawn, and we\u0027ll both go home to the Cirque Du Freak, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer. He refused to even look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, I turned around and started out of the lair, Murlough guiding me through the tunnels, singing gruesome little songs as he skipped along after me, telling me what he was going to do once he got his foul hands on Debbie. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-23.html","bookId":2439,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:06 PM"}
