With his Protomagnetic Wings and the strength of his Heavenly Demon Body, he was capable of incredible speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, he moved so quickly that he turned into a blur, a beam of light that was almost instantly far off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s really not me....” he howled. Unfortunately, the golden crocodile was just as fast. In the blink of an eye, it was right on top of Bai Xiaochun, filling the entire area with golden light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun felt like his scalp was about to explode, and he was trembling in fear. “Senior Goldcroc, listen to me, sir! I also hate that little turtle, alright!? You and me, we’re not enemies! Our... our enemy is that damned turtle!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point, the golden crocodile let out a powerful roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded like thunder from the heavens, causing everything to shake violently. Bai Xiaochun’s eardrums were on the verge of popping, and with a miserable shriek, he shot onward with increased speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before he could get very far, the enraged crocodile’s eyes flashed with cold light, and its mouth snapped open. That mouth seemed to become heaven and earth as it loomed over Bai Xiaochun, casting everything below into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA powerful, fishy aroma blasted over Bai Xiaochun, and his eyes went wide as he slowly looked up. Then he screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, it was possible to see the enormous, 30,000-meter-long golden crocodile with its mouth open, and Bai Xiaochun right in the middle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to the gargantuan crocodile, Bai Xiaochun was like a tiny bug....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, the golden crocodile’s mouth began to close as it prepared to consume Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun was screaming, his eyes completely bloodshot. In this moment of critical danger, he resorted to his Mountain Shaking Bash to break free, risking everything to try to get out of the crocodile’s closing mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun felt like his heart was about to explode, and he really was about to start crying. A massive crashing sound echoed out behind him as the crocodile’s jaws slammed shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep in his bones, he hated the little turtle for setting him up and getting this crocodile to come after him. Were it not for the fact that the turtle was nowhere to be found in his bag of holding, he would definitely have pulled it out and tossed it into the crocodile’s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We really aren’t enemies! I... I... oh right, I\u0027ve absorbed water from the Heavenspan River! Look! I have the aura of the Heavenspan River on me!” Trembling, Bai Xiaochun unleashed the aura of the Violet Qi Heavenspan Incantation, hoping to convince the crocodile that they were on the same team....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to say for sure, but it seemed that the aura of the Heavenspan River worked. In almost the same moment that he unleashed it, the golden crocodile’s eyes flickered with a strange light, and it stopped in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun took advantage of that brief pause to blast forward, putting a bit of distance between himself and the golden crocodile. By this point, he was panting for breath, but before he could do anything else, a cold light flashed in the crocodile’s eyes, and it lunged forward again with gaping maw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fishy aroma washed over Bai Xiaochun once more. Screaming, he decided to throw caution to the wind, and opened his third eye. With the power of the Heavenspan Dharma Eye in full force, he looked back at the golden crocodile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, his jaw dropped. Shockingly, the crocodile was actually not a crocodile! It had been formed from water from the Heavenspan River, and emanated the same fluctuations as the river!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, though, the images in front of him changed again, and it transformed back into the golden crocodile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was little time for thought. He unleashed the control power of the Heavenspan Dharma Eye against the crocodile. It was in that moment that the crocodile’s mouth snapped shut a second time, barely missing Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the resulting blast of air sent Bai Xiaochun tumbling head over heels, face pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed. Two hours later, the golden crocodile was still chasing Bai Xiaochun. It was hard to determine what exactly it was thinking. Despite how it was pursuing Bai Xiaochun, it didn\u0027t seem to actually want to kill him. However, every time it opened its huge mouth, cold sweat broke out on Bai Xiaochun’s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, Bai Xiaochun realized that the crocodile didn’t seem to be trying to kill him, more just mess with him. Every time it closed its mouth, the blast of air would send him spinning off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, despite the fact that it wasn’t trying to kill him, Bai Xiaochun could also tell that if he didn’t evade quickly enough, he really would be swallowed up.... He felt very wronged. Compared to this gigantic crocodile, he was like a baby. If the giant thing wasn’t careful, it could definitely end his poor little life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop messing around....” he howled. He really was afraid that the crocodile’s messing around would end up killing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was scowling on the verge of tears as the golden crocodile once again opened its mouth. Bai Xiaochun was virtually scared witless, and was just about to flee when something new happened. A long water dragon burst out from inside the crocodile’s throat, charging toward Bai Xiaochun and then crashing into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn’t ordinary water, it was Heavenspan River water. Any other person would have been killed in body and soul. But because Bai Xiaochun cultivated the Violet Qi Heavenspan Incantation, he was much more used to Heavenspan River water. In the blink of an eye, most of his clothing was dissolved. Thankfully, his bag of holding was made from high-quality materials, so it ended up only being damaged a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still painful though. Screaming, he fled from the crocodile’s mouth again, heart filled with grief and indignation. He quickly put on a new set of clothing, and yet, even as he did, another water dragon burst forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the intense pressure he was under, he was able to draw upon levels of power that had previously been hidden. That was especially true when it came to his Violet Qi Heavenspan Incantation, which was constantly absorbing the Heavenspan River water as it splashed into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso because of the pressure, his seventh spiritual sea was beginning to crystallize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chase didn’t last for very long, only about a day or so. Because of the incredible speed involved, Bai Xiaochun was getting very close to the location where the three sects were preparing for the final battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning at dawn, he actually caught sight of the enormous Profound Stream Sect city in the middle of the vast mountain range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the army of the Spirit and Blood Stream Sects, which was currently leveling attacks that shook heaven and earth. The fluctuations of magical techniques caused dazzling, multicolored light to shine out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden crocodile finally stopped chasing him. However, cries of astonishment could be heard as people on the battlefield caught sight of it. The patriarchs were fighting up in the sky, but even they were completely shocked by the sight of the crocodile, and then Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden crocodile hovered in midair, looking around coldly. Apparently, it didn’t find anything in the area worth looking at. Casting a meaningful glance at Bai Xiaochun, it turned and vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was so excited to see the crocodile leaving that tears were streaming down his face. The past day had been an incredible torment. The way the crocodile had messed with him left him feeling almost violated....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hatred toward both the little turtle and the crocodile had sunk deep into the depths of his heart. However, it was in that moment that his eyes flickered with surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eee?” Looking down at himself, he was suddenly overjoyed. His Undying Live Forever Technique had made significant progress, and his Violet Qi Heavenspan Incantation was becoming more refined. As for his seventh spiritual sea, it was more than half crystallized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he felt a bit better, the price he had paid for these benefits was something he would never want to pay again. Sighing, he looked over at the huge city and the battle playing out around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Profound Stream Sect was fighting back against the invaders with complete madness. They had enormous puppets fighting on their side that looked like mechanical marionettes clad in green armor. Each one required multiple Profound Stream Sect disciples to operate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spirit Stream Sect’s spell formation giants roared as they advanced across the battlefield. Small and large, they unleashed powerful attacks that caused the earth to quake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the Blood Stream Sect, they used their locust-like spell formations to send huge sphere-like groups of cultivators bashing into the Profound Stream Sect’s green-armored puppets. They were like blood-colored mountains that erupted with blood qi and auras of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp above in the air were legacy echelon cultivators from both sides of the conflict, as well as prime elders. Even higher were the patriarchs, whose attacks caused the sky to shake and the world to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Profound Stream Sect had a huge spell formation protecting it, as well as countless smaller spell formations to provide auxiliary support. In addition to that, there were countless flickering greatswords floating in the air around the city, arranged into a large sword formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtop each sword sat disciples of their sect. Even two such swords together in formation would be incredibly destructive, but there were far more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen of them would be even more awe-inspiring, and when it came to a formation with hundreds, it could cut down Foundation Establishment cultivators and even cause prime elders to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-297\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-299\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-298","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
