He looked so sad, I wanted to chase after the retreating police car, crying and screaming over the injustice of it. But I stood rigid, shaking on the inside and wishing I didn’t have to hide how much I loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was maudlin for the rest of the night. I woodenly followed orders, walking where I was supposed to walk and standing where I was supposed to stand, but not even my mother’s threats could get me to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the long, dreadful night was finally over, I slumped into my room and immediately slipped off the heels, which were killing me. The urge to pick them up and throw them as hard as I could against the wall rose, but I swallowed it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt so awful for what had happened to Knox, and even worse that I hadn’t reacted at all when he’d been treated that way. Shame filled me. I should’ve stepped in and defended him, or...something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlumping onto my bed, I stared down at my hands in my lap, wishing I could see him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a sharp, small object snapped against my window, I yelped and jumped up from the bed, gaping at the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pebble pelted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching my breath, I raced forward, knowing it was him. But I couldn’t see him through the dark until I opened the window all the way, stuck my head out, and he waved to me. Elation roared through me, quickly chased by fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you crazy?” I hissed, glancing briefly behind me to make sure my bedroom door was still closed. “What’re you doing here? If anyone saw you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis white teeth gleamed through the dark as he merely grinned at me. “Meet me in the gazebo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Knox.” I shook my head, still unable to believe he was here. “Don’t be insane. We’ll get caught.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And wear that dress.” Then he was gone, streaking across the yard in the direction of the gazebo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned out a breath, knowing it’d be safer for him if I stayed away. But the temptation got to me, and a full five seconds later, I was slapping the window closed and scurrying barefoot from my room. I tiptoed to the stairs and crept down. I could hear voices in the front parlor, so I held my breath as I snuck to the back hall and slipped out the kitchen exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I was free in the warm evening air, I exhaled and then grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnox was close, and I was going to get to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grass was damp against the soles of my feet, and it felt good. I almost laughed aloud, I was so happy. But that would’ve been bad, so I kept quiet until I reached the gazebo steps. Then I yelped out a scream as someone grasped my arms from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure one of my brothers or father had followed me, I tensed, trying to think up a reason I had come out here. Maybe I’d left a hair barrette from earlier when we were taking pictures. Yeah. That sounded good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then the voice of my captor murmured, “Shh. It’s just me,” as he tugged me back against a familiar chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved, I whirled around and hugged him tight. His mouth captured mine with a kiss that stole my breath and reignited the tingling between my legs that I’d felt earlier in the day, except it was sharper and more intense this time around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why aren’t you at work?” I demanded when we broke apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We ran out of bags; they let me off early.” He picked me up and carried me up, out of the moonlight and into the shadows of the gazebo. “Crazy girl,” he murmured into my ear before he kissed my pulse directly under it. “You’re not wearing any shoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could I think of shoes,” I answered breathlessly, “when I knew you were so close?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned and kissed me again, hard and desperate. “God, I missed you today. It felt all kinds of wrong not being able to look at you when you were right fucking there across this very yard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his fingers immediately went to the spaghetti straps of my dress, my breathing picked up. I ran my hands through his hair, scraping my nails over his scalp. “I can’t believe you came to watch me get my pictures taken. That was too risky, Knox. You were caught. You almost went to jail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe only grinned. “But I didn’t. And I had to see you in your fancy cotillion outfit.” Then he slowly lowered the front of my dress, baring my breasts to him. “Jesus.” he sucked in a breath. “I knew you weren’t wearing a bra, but this is... You’re lovely. You’re so lovely, City. Fully clothed or with your top down like this, you’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. Did any of your idiot family tell you how nice you looked today?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-88.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
