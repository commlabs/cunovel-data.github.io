{"id":16218,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Which treats of Education in general, and George of Blanche \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;lande’s in particular\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So George grew up in the Castle side by side with Honey-Bee, whom he affectionately called his sister though he knew she was not.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had masters in fencing, riding, swimming, gymnastics, dancing, hunting, falconry, tennis, and, indeed, in all the arts. He even had a writing-master. This was an old cleric, humble of manner but very proud within, who taught him all manner of penmanship, and the more beautiful this was the less decipherable it became. Very little pleasure or profit did George get out of the old cleric’s lessons, as little as out of those of an old monk who taught him grammar in barbarous terms. George could not understand the sense of learning a language which one knows as a matter of course and which is called one’s mother tongue.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He only enjoyed himself with Francoeur the squire, who, having knocked about the world, understood the ways of men and beasts, could describe all sorts of countries and compose songs which he could not write. Francoeur was the only one of his masters who taught George anything, for he was the only one who really loved him, and the only good lessons are those which are given with love. The two old goggle-eyes, the writing-master and the grammar-master, who hated each other with all their hearts, were, however, united in a common hatred of the old squire, whom they accused of being a drunkard.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is true that Francoeur frequented the tavern “The Pewter Pot” somewhat too zealously. It was here that he forgot his sorrows and composed his songs. But of course it was very wrong of him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Homer made better verses than Francoeur, and Homer only drank the water of the springs. As for sorrows the whole world has sorrows, and the thing to make one forget them is not the wine one drinks, but the good one does. But Francoeur was an old man grown grey in harness, faithful and trustworthy, and the two masters of writing and grammar should have hidden his failings from the duchess instead of giving her an exaggerated account of them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Francoeur is a drunkard,” said the writing-master, “and when he comes back from ‘The Pewter Pot’ he makes a letter S as he walks. Moreover, it is the only letter he has ever made; because if it please your Grace, this drunkard is an ass.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The grammar-master added, “And the songs Francoeur sings as he staggers about err against all rules and are constructed on no model at all. He ignores all the rules of rhetoric, please your Grace.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Duchess had a natural distaste for pedants and tale-bearers. She did what we all would have done in her place; at first she did not listen to them but as they again began to repeat their tittle-tattle, she ended by believing them and decided to send Francoeur away. However, to give him an honourable exile, she sent him to Rome to obtain the blessing of the Pope. This journey was all the longer for Francoeur the squire because a great many taverns much frequented by musicians separated the duchy of Clarides from the holy apostolic seat. In the course of this story we shall see how soon the Duchess regretted having deprived the two children of their most faithful guardian.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3033/83845.html","bookId":1061,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:34:55 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:34:55 AM"}
