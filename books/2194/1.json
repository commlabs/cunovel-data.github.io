God bless you all, and thanks from one of the moms who crowds the stands through rain, cold, heat, and mosquitoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this mom always wonders who else might be watching the night games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thanks to Wiccans who answered my call for knowledge with more information than I could use - Maria Lima, Sandilee Lloyd, Holly Nelson, Jean Hontz, and M. R. \"Murv\" Sellars. I owe further thanks to other experts in different fields: Kevin Ryer, who knows more about feral hogs than most people do about their own pets; Dr. D. P. Lyle, who is so gracious about answering medical questions; and, of course, Doris Ann Norris, reference librarian to the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I have made mistakes in the use of the knowledge these kind people imparted, I\u0027ll do my best to somehow blame it on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found the note taped to my door when I got home from work. I\u0027d had the lunch-to-early-evening shift at Merlotte\u0027s, but since we were at the tail end of December, the day darkened early. So Bill, my former boyfriend - that\u0027s Bill Compton, or Vampire Bill, as most of the regulars at Merlotte\u0027s call him - must have left his message within the previous hour. He can\u0027t get up until dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t seen Bill in over a week, and our parting hadn\u0027t been a happy one. But touching the envelope with my name written on it made me feel miserable. You\u0027d think - though I\u0027m twenty-six - I\u0027d never had, and lost, a boyfriend before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d be right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormal guys don\u0027t want to date someone as strange as I am. People have been saying I\u0027m messed up in the head since I started school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s not to say I don\u0027t get groped at the bar occasionally. Guys get drunk. I look good. They forget their misgivings about my reputation for strangeness and my ever-present smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut only Bill has ever gotten close to me in an intimate way. Parting from him had hurt me bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited to open the envelope until I was sitting at the old, scarred kitchen table. I still had my coat on, though I\u0027d shucked my gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDearest Sookie - I wanted to come over to talk to you when you had somewhat recovered from the unfortunate events of earlier this month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunate events,\" my round rear end. The bruises had finally faded, but I had a knee that still ached in the cold, and I suspected that it always would. Every injury I had incurred had been in the course of rescuing my cheating boyfriend from his imprisonment by a group of vampires that included his former flame, Lorena. I had yet to figure out why Bill had been so infatuated with Lorena that he\u0027d answered her summons to Mississippi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably, you have a lot of questions about what happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027ll talk to me face-to-face, come to the front door and let me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYikes. I hadn\u0027t seen that one coming. I pondered for a minute. Deciding that while I didn\u0027t trust Bill anymore, I didn\u0027t believe that he would physically harm me, I went back through the house to the front door. I opened it and called, \"Okay, come on in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emerged from the woods surrounding the clearing in which my old house stood. I ached at the sight of him. Bill was broad-shouldered and lean from his life of farming the land next to mine. He was hard and tough from his years as a Confederate soldier, before his death in 1867. Bill\u0027s nose was straight off a Greek vase. His hair was dark brown and clipped close to his head, and his eyes were just as dark. He looked exactly the same as he had while we were dating, and he always would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated before he crossed the threshold, but I\u0027d given him permission, and I moved aside so he could step past me into the living room filled with old, comfortable furniture and neat as a pin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" he said in his cold, smooth voice, a voice that still gave me a twinge of sheer lust. Many things had gone wrong between us, but they hadn\u0027t started in bed. \"I wanted to talk to you before I left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" I tried to sound as calm as he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Peru. The queen\u0027s orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still working on your, ah, database?\" I knew almost nothing about computers, but Bill had studied hard to make himself computer literate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027ve got a little more research to do. A very old vampire in Lima has a great fund of knowledge about those of our race on his continent, and I have an appointment to confer with him. I\u0027ll do some sight-seeing while I\u0027m down there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought the urge to offer Bill a bottle of synthetic blood, which would have been the hospitable thing to do. \"Have a seat,\" I said curtly, and nodded at the sofa. I sat on the edge of the old recliner catty-cornered to it. Then a silence fell, a silence that made me even more conscious of how unhappy I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Bubba?\" I asked finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in New Orleans right now,\" Bill said. \"The queen likes to keep him around from time to time, and he was so visible here over the last month that it seemed like a good idea to take him elsewhere. He\u0027ll be back soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d recognize Bubba if you saw him; everyone knows his face. But he hadn\u0027t been \"brought over\" too successfully. Probably the morgue attendant, who happened to be a vampire, should have ignored the tiny spark of life. But since he was a great fan, he hadn\u0027t been able to resist the attempt, and now the entire southern vampire community shuffled Bubba around and tried to keep him from public view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother silence fell. I\u0027d planned on taking off my shoes and uniform, putting on a cuddly robe, and watching television with a Freschetta pizza by my side. It was a humble plan, but it was my own. Instead, here I was, suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you have something to say, you better go on and say it,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, almost to himself. \"I have to explain,\" he said. His white hands arranged themselves in his lap. \"Lorena and I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched involuntarily. I never wanted to hear that name again. He\u0027d dumped me for Lorena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to tell you,\" he said, almost angrily. He\u0027d seen me twitch. \"Give me this chance.\" After a second, I waved a hand to tell him to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reason I went to Jackson when she called me is that I couldn\u0027t help myself,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyebrows flew up. I\u0027d heard that before. It means, \"I have no self-control,\" or, \"It seemed worth it at the time, and I wasn\u0027t thinking north of my belt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were lovers long ago. As Eric says he told you, vampire liaisons don\u0027t tend to last long, though they\u0027re very intense while they are ongoing. However, what Eric did not tell you was that Lorena was the vampire who brought me over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the Dark Side?\" I asked, and then I bit my lip. This was no subject for levity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Bill agreed seriously. \"And we were together after that, as lovers, which is not always the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you had broken up...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, about eighty years ago, we came to the point where we couldn\u0027t tolerate each other any longer. I hadn\u0027t seen Lorena since, though I\u0027d heard of her doings, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure,\" I said expressionlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I had to obey her summons. This is absolutely imperative. When your maker calls, you must respond.\" His voice was urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, trying to look understanding. I guess I didn\u0027t do too good a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She ordered me to leave you,\" he said. His dark eyes were peering into mine. \"She said she would kill you if I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was losing my temper. I bit the inside of my cheek, real hard, to make myself focus. \"So, without explanation or discussion with me, you decided what was best for me and for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to,\" he said. \"I had to do her bidding. And I knew she was capable of harming you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you got that right.\" In fact, Lorena had done her dead level best to harm me right into the grave. But I\u0027d gotten her first - okay, by a fluke, but it had worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now you no longer love me,\" Bill said, with the slightest of questions in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have any clear answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I wouldn\u0027t think you\u0027d want to come back to me. After all, I killed your mom.\" And there was the slightest of questions in my voice, too, but mostly I was bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we need more time apart. When I return, if you consent, we\u0027ll talk again. A kiss good-bye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my shame, I would love to kiss Bill again. But it was such a bad idea, even wanting it seemed wrong. We stood, and I gave him a quick brush of lips to the cheek. His white skin shone with a little glow that distinguished vampires from humans. It had surprised me to learn that not everyone saw them like I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you seeing the Were?\" he asked, when he was nearly out the door. He sounded as though the words had been pulled out of him by their roots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one?\" I asked, resisting the temptation to bat my eyelashes. He deserved no answer, and he knew it. \"How long will you be gone?\" I asked more briskly, and he looked at me with some speculation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a sure thing. Maybe two weeks,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We might talk then,\" I said, turning my face away. \"Let me return your key.\" I fished my keys out of my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, please, keep it on your key ring,\" he said. \"You might need it while I am gone. Go in the house as you will. My mail\u0027s getting held at the post office until I give them notice, and I think all my other loose ends are taken care of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I was his last loose end. I damned up the trickle of anger that was all too ready to bubble out these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you have a safe trip,\" I said coldly, and shut the door behind him. I headed back to my bedroom. I had a robe to put on and some television to watch. By golly, I was sticking to my plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while I was putting my pizza in the oven, I had to blot my cheeks a few times. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4/page-1.html","bookId":2194,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:56:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:56:17 PM"}
