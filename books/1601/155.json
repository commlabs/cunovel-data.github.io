The two forces became entangled as they both rushed to close the gap at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning began to strike down from the sky, raining on the Dreadlords’ platform. Good. Narishma and Merise had been told to watch for the Dreadlords and try to kill them. Perhaps it would distract the enemy. Lan focused on something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had two groups of reserves been sent to plug that same hole? Either unit would have been large enough for the job; with so many, they had interfered with one another. A mistake?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed into Mandarb\u0027s saddle, reluctant to make the horse work again so soon. He would check on this error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the wolf dream, Perrin and Gaul stopped on a ridge overlooking a valley with a mountain at the end of it. Above the mountain, the black clouds spun in a terrible vortex that didn’t quite touch the mountains tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe winds ravaged the valley, and Perrin was forced to create a pocket of stillness around himself and Gaul, deflecting debris. Down below, they caught quick fragments of an enormous battle. Aiel, Trollocs and men in armor appeared in the wolf dream for moments as if out of twisting smoke and dust, swung weapons, disintegrated in midblow. Thousands of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany wolves were here in the dream, all around. They waited for . . . for something. Something they could not explain to Perrin. They had a name for Rand, Shadowkiller. Perhaps they were here to witness what he would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perrin?\" Gaul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He’s here, finally\", Perrin said softly. \"He has entered the Pit of Doom\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand was going to need Perrin at some point during this fight. Unfortunately, Perrin couldn’t just stand here; there was work to be done. Gaul and he had, with help from the wolves, found Graendal near Cairhien. She had spoken to some people in their dreams. Darkfriends among the armies, perhaps?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was peeking at Bashere’s dreams before that, Perrin thought. Or so Lanfear claimed. He didn’t trust her for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, he’d found Graendal earlier today, and had been planning to strike, when suddenly she had vanished. He knew how to track someone in the wolf dream when they shifted, and he had followed her here, to Thakan’dar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer scent vanished sharply in the middle of the valley below. She’d Traveled back into the real world. Perrin wasn’t certain how much time had passed in the wolf dream; he and Gaul still had food, but it felt as if it had been days and days. Lanfear said that the closer Perrin came to Rand, the more time would distort. He could probably test that statement, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is here, Young Bull! The sending came, sudden and urgent, from a wolf named Sunrise, here in the valley. Slayer comes among us! Hurry!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin growled, grabbed Gaul by the shoulder without a word and shifted them. They appeared on the rocky path leading to a gaping hole in the rock above, the passage down to the Pit of Doom itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wolf lay nearby, arrow in its side, smelling of death. Others howled in the near distance. The horrible wind whipped at him; Perrin lowered his head and charged into it, Gaul at his side. Inside, Young Bull, a wolf sent. Inside the mouth of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot daring to think about what he was doing, Perrin burst into a long, narrow chamber filled with jagged rocks projecting from the floor and ceiling. Ahead, something bright sent pulsing waves through the space. Perrin raised a hand against the light, vaguely catching sight of shapes at the end of the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men, locked in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo women, as if frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just a few feet from Perrin, Slayer, drawing his bow to his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin roared, hammer in his hand, and shifted himself between Slayer and Rand. He slapped the arrow from the air with his hammer a split second after it was loosed. Slayer’s eyes widened, and he vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin shifted to Gaul, grabbing the man by the arm, then shifted back to where Slayer had been and caught the scent of his location. \"Be wary\", Perrin said, then shifted them after the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dropped into the middle of a group of people. They were Aiel, but instead of wearing normal shoufa, they had strange red veils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shift hadn’t taken Perrin and Gaul far; this was a village of some sort, close enough for the peak of Shayol Ghul to be visible in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-veils attacked. Perrin wasn’t particularly surprised to find Aiel on the side of the Shadow. There were Darkfriends among all peoples. But why identify themselves with the color of their veils?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin swung his hammer in a wide circle, keeping a group of them at bay, then shifted behind them, crushing the head of one from behind. Gaul became a blur of spears and brown clothing, dodging around red-veils, stabbing, then vanishing—and then appearing and stabbing again. Yes, he’d learned quickly, more quickly than these red-veils apparently had, for they failed to keep up with him. Perrin smashed another one in the kneecap, then searched for Slayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. He stood on a hillock above, watching. Perrin glanced at Gaul, who, between jumps, gave him a quick nod. There were eight red-veils left, but—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earth underneath Gaul’s feet began to heave, exploding upward as Gaul jumped. Perrin managed to protect his friend, creating a steel plate beneath him to deflect the blast, but it was a close thing. Gaul landed shakily, and Perrin was forced to shift to him and attack the red-veil coming at him from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake care, Perrin yelled at Gaul. \"At least one of these fellows can channel!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight. As if Aiel fighting for the Shadow weren’t enough. Channeling Aiel. Channeling Aiel men. Light!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Perrin swung at another, Slayer arrived, a sword in one hand and a long hunting knife in the other—the type a man would use to skin his prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowling, Perrin threw himself into the fight, and the two began a strange dance. One attacking the other, who vanished to appear nearby before attacking also. They spun about like that, one shifting,, then the other, each trying for an edge. Perrin just missed crushing Slayer with a blow, then nearly caught steel in his gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaul was proving very useful—Perrin would have had a horrible time trying to stand alone against both Slayer and the red-veils. Unfortunately, Gaul could do little but distract his foes, and was having a very difficult time managing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a column of fire from one of the red-veils nearly took him, Perrin made his decision. He shifted over to Gaul—and almost took a spear through the shoulder. Perrin turned the spear to cloth, and it bent on his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaul started, seeing Perrin, then opened his mouth. Perrin didn’t give him a chance to speak. He grabbed his friend by the arm, then shifted them away. They vanished just as flam \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-155.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
