Since she could hear Carly\u0027s voice, a kind of quick piping, she marveled a bit. That wasn\u0027t the usual Monday morning routine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid liked school, she really did, but she rarely liked it on Monday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she stepped into the fashion show, Phoebe understood why her little girl was in the happiest of moods. Nothing like a new sweater-or a new article of any kind of clothing-to put a smile on Carly\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one she was currently modeling like a finalist on Project Runway was a pale, almost fragile blue. It looked like it was made from clouds, Phoebe thought, the way it simply wisped over shoulders and arms, swirled at the waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoing a practiced pivot, Carly spotted her mother. \"Look, Mama! Look what Gran made me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gorgeous.\" Phoebe trailed a fingertip down one sleeve. Itfelt like a cloud. \"You spoil her, Mama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My job to. But it\u0027s a sample. It\u0027s what I call market advertising. I\u0027m going to do a few in adult sizes, but thought I\u0027d start out small.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gran said she could make me a purse to match.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might as well surrender,\" Ava said under her breath as she handed Phoebe coffee. \"You can\u0027t beat the two of them. How about a hot breakfast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. I\u0027ll just grab some toast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about one of these instead?\" Ava held out a basket filled with muffins. \"I just made them this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe took one, bit in. \"And I talk about Carly getting spoiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarly, let\u0027s get some breakfast into you now. I\u0027ll drop you off at school on my way to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re supposed to drive Poppy and Sherrilynn today, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. I knew that.\" Somewhere, in the back of her mind. \"I can haul them if it\u0027d be easier for you,\" Ava offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s fine. Ah, listen, I was thinking about going out to dinner with Duncan tomorrow night, if that\u0027s not a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe watched Ava and Essie exchange smug looks behind Carly\u0027s back as the girl dumped Frosted Flakes into a bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\" Essie offered the most innocent of smiles. \"Of course it\u0027s not a problem. Not at all. Ava, I believe you owe me five dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet on...\" Phoebe made herself zip it up because Carly\u0027s eyes were on her, and full of speculation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he your boyfriend now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too old for boyfriends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My third best friend Celene\u0027s mother has two boyfriends. Celene heard her say how she juggles them so the left hand isn\u0027t sure what the right hand\u0027s doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sooner or later your two hands get together and you end up with bruised knuckles. And that is not to be repeated,\" Phoebe added. \"I\u0027m just going out to dinner with a friend.\" And having sex, she thought. Probably a lot of really great sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould she buy condoms? Surely he\u0027d have condoms. God, something else to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss going out to dinner,\" Ava commented. \"Just someone to sit across from for a couple hours, making conversation. You going fancy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, no.\" Should she buy new underwear? \"Just pizza or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nice. It\u0027s friendly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like pizza.\" Carly piped up, with a look of anticipation. Guilt, guilt, guilt. Great. Just let me get this horniness out of my system first and I\u0027ll make it up to you, baby. \"Well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have our regularly scheduled pizza night,\" Essie reminded her. That smug smile stayed in place as Essie picked up the pitcher ofjuice, poured a little more into Carly\u0027s glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just when Phoebe was thinking, Nice save, Mama, Essie threw a curve ball. \"You ought to ask Duncan over to dinner one night soon, Phoebe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nice family dinner. From what you said when you got home last night, he took you to his family. Now, you should reciprocate. Why don\u0027t you ask him what night\u0027s good for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I could.\" Complicated, complicated. Why did it have to be complicated? Couldn\u0027t a grown woman just have a simple affair? The answer, of course, was no. Not with a daughter, a mother and an honorary older sister living in the same house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finish that up now, Carly, we don\u0027t want to be late. Oh, I meant to ask. Does anyone know if someone news moved into the neighborhood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lissette and Morgan Frye\u0027s daughter Mirri\u0027s come for a visit which rumor has is a euphemism for leaving her no-good husband after she found out he was learning more from his mixed doubles partner at the club than a strong backhand.\" Ava topped off Phoebe\u0027s coffee. \"Oh, and Delly Porter\u0027s hired herself a French au pair to run herd on those twins of hers. God help the mademoiselle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s Delly going to do?\" Essie wondered. \"Is she going back to work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She says having the au pair will give her children a cultural influ ence, and give her more time for her volunteer work. What she volunteers for, as everyone knows, is shopping five days out of six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I meant a man. Is there a new man in the neighborhood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking to juggle after all?\" Ava said with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not.\" Amused, Phoebe shook her head. \"I thought I saw a new face around, that\u0027s all.\" But she hadn\u0027t really seen his face, Phoebe thought now. \"A whistler-not wolf whistler, tune whistler. What is that tune? It keeps sticking in my head but I can\u0027t quite place it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she started to hum, Essie broke in. \". You know how I love my old movies. That\u0027s the theme from with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. God, what a beauty she was. And him-now that was some handsome man. \u0027Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin\u0027,\u0027\" she sang in her light, pretty voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, right. That\u0027s the one. Funny sort of song to whistle. Well.\" With at least that mystery solved, she shelved the rest. \"Carly, get a move on now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute they were in the car, Phoebe turned to Carly. \"Does it bother you that I\u0027m going out with Duncan? With anyone, really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But if you\u0027re too old for boyfriends, why are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat one bit you on the ass, didn\u0027t it? \"I just mean boyfriend\u0027s kind of a silly term for a grown woman.\" A divorced woman with a child, Phoebe thought. \"Just friend\u0027s more sensible, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celene\u0027s mother sort of brags about her boyfriends. She used to have three, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not Celene\u0027s mother. And I don\u0027t know as I approve of her talking about her boyfriends so much around you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She mostly talks about them to her girlfriends, and Celene hears her. Then we talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Phoebe blew out a breath as she began to drive. \"Does it upset Celene that her mother goes out like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She likes the babysitter. Terri\u0027s fifteen and they do makeovers and watch TV. And the boyfriends sometimes bring Celene presents, and sometimes they take her places. Like one took her to Six Flags.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can hear your thinking,\" Phoebe said with a laugh. \"You\u0027re such a little mercenary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the first time Carly had heard the word, so she grinned, too. \"But if you don\u0027t ask for a present, and don\u0027t say would you please, please, take me to Six Flags, it\u0027s not mercenary. Is it? I mean, Gran always says when somebody gives you something, you should thank them and make them pleased they gave it. Even if you don\u0027t like it. That\u0027s manners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a tricky one, Carly Anne. Slippery as an eel. You make me proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe returned from a suicide threat that had amounted to a sad and pathetic bid for attention to find Sykes waving her away from the squad room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a heads-up, LT. You got the rat squad in your office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"IAB\u0027s in my office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of them. Got here about five minutes ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" She should have known it was coming. Had known, she corrected. But it didn\u0027t make it any less distasteful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Blackman from IAB was a salt-and-pepper-headed fifty. He had a sloping belly, a ruddy complexion and thin, dry hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Lieutenant, to keep you waiting. Did we have an appointment for this afternoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t keep me waiting. I thought we could have a conversation here rather than a formal interview, at this point. If you\u0027d rather the latter, we can arrange that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a fashionable suit, the Southern-woman polite slipped onto Phoebe. It generally served her well. \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d rather the latter until I have a better idea what conversation you\u0027d like to have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Regarding statements and accusations made against you by Officer Arnold Meeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arnold Meeks is no longer a police officer, as you well know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was when he made the statements and accusations, as you well know. I hope you\u0027re recovering from your injuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, thank you. Lieutenant Blackman, if we\u0027re going to be having this informal conversation, would you like some coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. I\u0027m fine. Prior to the attack on your person, you suspended Officer Arnold Meeks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your reasons for taking this step?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are outlined, perfectly clearly, in the file.\" She plastered a cooperative smile on her face. \"Do you need a copy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard-ass, Phoebe thought, but kept the smile as she tipped her head. \"Well then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Officer Meeks disputed your reasons for his suspension.\" Phoebe leaned back, dropped the smile, sharpened her tone. \"We both know he attacked me, that he lay in wait and assaulted me. We both know a deal was cut. And I suspect we both know Arnold Meeks has some significant problems with authority-particularly when it\u0027s female authority-anger management and control. Why are you pushing this?\" Blackman\u0027s dark eyes stayed pinned on hers. \"He made serious accusations against you and the captain of this division.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer temper wanted to leap and bite. And that, Phoebe knew, would only add fuel to a fire that needed to be stamped out quickly. \"Yes, he did. He made some of them right here in this office, to my face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a personal relationship with Captain David McVee, do you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly do. I have a personal and platonic relationship with the captain, whom I\u0027ve known and respected for more than twenty years. If you\u0027ve looked into this matter, into me, then you know the circumstances of how I came to know Captain McVee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You left the FBI to work in his division.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, for a variety of reasons. None of which are unseemly or against departmental regulations. I\u0027ve worked in this division for nearly seven years, without a single mark on my record. I believe my reputation and certainly the captain\u0027s are above reproach. Certainly from accusations made by a disgraced police officer whose answer to being disciplined was to beat the hell out of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackman puffed out his cheeks, the first sign Phoebe had seen that he felt anything at all. \"I understand you\u0027d find this conversation, the need for it, distasteful, Lieutenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Distasteful? Lieutenant Blackman, as a police officer and as a woman, I find the need for this conversation deplorable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So noted. The officer in question also contends that you made inappropriate sexual advances to him, and used your authority over him to intimidate in a sexual context.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve heard.\" And enough, Phoebe thought, was damn well enough. \"I never made sexual advances of any kind toward Arnold Meeks. You can take his word or you can take mine. I wonder how much pressure the \u0027officer in question\u0027s\u0027 father and/or grandfather might be putting on IAB to pursue this matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Complaints were filed against you, and Captain McVee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ought to consider the source of those complaints. You ought to consider the fact that Captain McVee has served this department and this city for more than twenty-five years, and doesn\u0027t deserve even the hint of a smear on his record by the pointing linger of a son of a bitch like Arnold Meeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not finished. I want you to put that in your report of this conversation. I want you to put in your report that in my professional and personal opinion, Arnold Meeks is a lying son of a bitch who\u0027s trying to cover his disgraceful and criminal behavior by damaging the reputation of a good man, and a good cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved to her feet. \"Now I want you out of my office. I have work to do. If you want another conversation with me, it will be a formal one, and my delegate will be present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it certainly is. Good afternoon, Lieutenant Blackman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Phoebe only about forty-five seconds to admit she was just too pissed, too insulted to sit there doing paperwork. Even the pretense of doing paperwork wasn\u0027t possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed her purse, strode out of the office, through the speculative, and sympathetic, glances of the squad. \"Lost time,\" she said to the new PAA. \"I\u0027ll be an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to walk. She knew herself and understood air and exercise were two vital components to cooling herself off. She walked fast, before she said or did anything she\u0027d regret later, straight out of the building. Out of the cop, she thought to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could have chosen an easier career. Psychology, psychiatry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn\u0027t she considered both? But no, through all the years, all the schooling, all the choices, she\u0027d kept circling back to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew it had given her mother more than anyone\u0027s share of sleepless nights. God knew it wasn\u0027t the best choice for a single mother with a child who needed her. It hadn\u0027t been the smart choice, really. She had a family to support, and could have done so with more style charging for fifty-minute hours instead of putting in countless nights on the job. And for what? For what? To be accused by a man who brutalized her? To be questioned by her own over those accusations before the last bruises had completely faded?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d swallowed what in her heart was no more than a slap on the wrist of the man who\u0027d used his fists on her. She\u0027d accepted the politics of it, the face-saving, and to be honest had some small seed of relief inside her that she wouldn\u0027t be called on to sit in court and replay what he had done to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this? She didn\u0027t know if she could swallow this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where were her choices now? Phoebe asked herself as she turned into the relative cool of Chippewa Square. She could give the department the finger, walk away. And toss away a dozen years of training and work-good work, she reminded herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could demand a full and formal investigation, and blast the ugliness into the air for those who enjoyed such things to snatch at like ribbons on balloons. Or she could remember that sometimes pride was less important than doing what had to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped down on a bench-the one Forrest Gump had sat on, waiting for a bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Box of chocolates, my ass,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was calmer. It was good, she decided, that she\u0027d said what she wanted to say to that rat-bastard Blackman when she hadn\u0027t been calm. Good that she\u0027d stood up, showed him she wouldn\u0027t let herself be walked over by IAB, by politics, by any old-boy network or variation thereof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him poke and prod around. She had nothing to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d go back to work, because that\u0027s what she did. And really, it wasn\u0027t just the only choice she had. It was what she wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the next five minutes, she was going to sit here-just like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForrest-and watch the world go by. As screwed up as it was, it was still her world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe glanced over as a woman sat on the bench beside her, then did a quick double take. A sassy white sun hat shaded the gorgeous curling auburn hair. Delicate, just ripened peach tinted the wide, expressive mouth. The long legs were set off in a filmy white sundress and given some jazz with the strappy high-heeled sandals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHollywood often came to Savannah, and still it wasn\u0027t a usual thing to have Julia Roberts cozy up on a park bench alongside you. Especially when Julia had a prominent Adam\u0027s apple and really big hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you don\u0027t mind me joining you.\" The voice was lazy, liquid Savannah, and on the contralto end of the scale. \"These shoes are just killing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. Fabulous shoes, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, thank you so much!\" The four-inch heels lifted, turned side to side, and showed off peach-tipped toes. \"Saw them at Jezebel\u0027s, and I couldn\u0027t resist them. I know better than to go in that place, as I have such a weakness. But there they were, right in the window, and I couldn\u0027t live without them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe had to smile, and think of Carly. Her daughter would understand the sentiment perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they are not made for walking more than five steps. I\u0027m not her.\" Phoebe\u0027s companion tipped down fashionable sunglasses. \"Lots of people mistake us, as Julia and I share certain qualities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You certainly do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she is a married lady with those adorable children. While I am still on the market.\" With a wink, the woman extended her hand. \"Marvella Starr.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phoebe MacNamara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do believe I\u0027ve seen you around here, Phoebe-that gorgeous hair of yours. I take a turn around the park most every day. It\u0027s near the police station, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do love a man in uniform. And the mounted unit, they patrol the park. A man in uniform on a horse.\" On a lusty sigh, Marvella leaned back, waved a hand over her heart. \"I am helpless. I work at Chez Vous. You ever been to Chez Vous, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you should come on by some night, catch the show. Being in the theater, I do tend to sleep in most days, but I like to stroll on through the park in the afternoon, get my policeman fix.\" She dug into her peach-toned hobo bag, took out a lemon drop. \"Candy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanionably, they sucked on lemon drops, and Phoebe felt better than she had all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You live around here, too?\" Marvella asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, actually, I work around here. At the police station. I\u0027m a cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you shut up!\" Marvella poked her in the arm. \"Is that the truth? I want to see your gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmused, Phoebe folded back her jacket to expose the weapon and badge on her hip. And had Marvella whistling in delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty thing like you, I\u0027d never have guessed it. But I guess we both know how appearances are deceiving-and it\u0027s what\u0027s inside the cover that counts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we both know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know any men in uniform who might be interested in a date with a woman of my particular style?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they aren\u0027t it\u0027s their loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you the sweet one!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I come across any, I\u0027ll send them over to Chez Vous. I bet you can take it from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s a solid truth, Phoebe. That\u0027s a solid truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she sat, he took pictures. It was such a bonus! He\u0027d never expected to see her walking along, into the square, out again. But here she was, eyes shaded by sunglasses. He wished he could see them. But it was still a bonus. He\u0027d only been scouting around, and lo and behold, here came Phoebe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking fast-fast as a Yankee-legs striding, hips swinging. Hot under the collar, he was sure of it. And the idea of her anger, her upset, gave him a nice little thrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if she\u0027d liked the little present he\u0027d left for her. It was too bad, really too bad, he hadn\u0027t been able to stick around, to wait, to position himself to see how she reacted when she found the dead rat. Still, they were going to have time, plenty of time to get to know each other again. To see each other. Eye to eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know what the hell she and the queer were blabbing on about, but the interlude gave him time for more pictures. And with her running her mouth, she wasn\u0027t going to make him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she rose, walked away, he blew a kiss at her back. \"See you soon, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave waited until it was nearly the end of shift to summon her. He was on the phone when she stepped into his office, and he held up a finger. \"That was my take, yes. I appreciate it. I\u0027ll get back to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up, swiveled a little right, a little left as he studied Phoebe\u0027s face. \"This\u0027ll only take a minute. You probably want to get home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monday night\u0027s homework session is often a study of temper and despair. By Friday, we have the hang of it again, only to fall victim to the tradition of two days of vacation. Is there a problem, Captain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know IAB\u0027s spoken with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I know you\u0027re pissed off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not going to go anywhere, Phoebe. It\u0027s got nowhere to go. But the Meekses have friends in the department, and at City Hall. It\u0027s important to them to save face to some extent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While your face and mine take the punch,\" she tossed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry that insult\u0027s been added to injury. I expect you\u0027ll handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I considered flipping them the bird and going into business as a therapist. Maybe marriage counseling.\" She watched his lips quirk. \"But considering my own track record in that area, I rejected it and mused on the more entertaining notion of going to a voodoo practitioner and buying a curse. I\u0027m still weighing the pros and cons of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me know which way you decide. It\u0027s smoke, Phoebe. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smoke can leave stains and smears. And it kills. Haven\u0027t you been paying attention to the surgeon general?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sergeant Meeks pulled some strings. He\u0027s got his son a job as a security guard. That\u0027s a hard comedown for a man like Arnie. It\u0027s a hard comedown for his father to see what I have no doubt he considered his legacy broken into very ugly bits. He\u0027s getting some of his own back.\" He swiveled again when she said nothing. \"As long as you hold your line, he won\u0027t even get that. Go on home, put this away. It\u0027s bad enough you\u0027re about to face the multiplication tables or the hell of long division.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo point in argument or debate, she thought, especially since he was right. All she had to do was hold the line. \"Monday is, invariably, vocabulary. Carly has such a damn good one it annoys her to be told what words to learn. What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to finish up here, go home and have a beer with my Hungry-Man dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on to dinner. You-\" She stopped, felt both temper and grief rise up when she saw the expression on his face. \"Is that how it has to be? Because of this insulting stupidity? We can\u0027t be friends now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course we\u0027re friends. Nothing changes that, and nothing ever could. But it\u0027s best, for the moment, that I stick with my Hungry-Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet the smoke clear, Phoebe. When it does, I promise you it\u0027s not going to leave a stain on either of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking more seriously about finding that voodoo queen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her, in that calm, patient way she loved, she depended on. \"We do good work here. We\u0027re going to keep right on doing it. And speaking of that, you did good work at the college today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was bogus. Report was the coed had barricaded herself in the dorm with a knife, a rifle and a bottle of pills. When I talked her out, what she had was manicure scissors, an unloaded twenty-two and a bottle of goddamn Turns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could have been a loaded gun, a bowie knife and a bottle of barbs. You know that. You talked her out, that\u0027s what counts. Go on home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome days, she thought as she walked out to her car, it felt like it counted more than others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was odd, wasn\u0027t it, Ava decided, for the man her friend was seeingwas in fact having dinner with that very night-to ask to see her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t sure why she\u0027d agreed to meet him. Maybe it was curiosity, or manners, or that easy charm of his. Likely all of that, she admitted as she walked to Whitaker Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d decided not to drive. Parking could be such a nightmare, and besides, you couldn\u0027t window-shop in a car, could you? Or not safely in any case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she did love to window-shop. Between her and Essie, she supposed they\u0027d completely corrupted Carly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, it wasn\u0027t all that far. And Savannah was just gorgeous in April.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loved Savannah. She loved MacNamara House-and deep in the core, it had been home more than anywhere else. Of course, she\u0027d loved her pretty little house in West Chatham. Picture-perfect life, or so she\u0027d thought. With a successful husband, a delightful little boy. Even the requisite golden retriever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0027d been nothing perfect about it, and what a hard blow that had been. Serial adultery wasn\u0027t pretty-especially for the blind wife who\u0027d missed all the signals, all the signs until they slapped hard into her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it had been back to MacNamara House. Minus the husband and the dog. She did miss the dog, she thought with some amusement. And she was grateful she\u0027d had a place to go, a place where her son could thrive, where she could be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if she still wished, occasionally, that the cheating bastard would die in some fiery car wreck, she\u0027d mellowed considerably from the days she\u0027d actively prayed for him to be decapitated by a runaway train. That was progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was lost in her own thoughts and nearly walked right by the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Ava!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, glanced over, and there was Duncan coming down the steps of some poor old house left to ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk about window-shopping, she thought with pure female appreciation. It was hardly a wonder Phoebe was taking a lot of looks at this particular piece of merchandise. Rangy build, tousled hair, killer smile. Though she hadn\u0027t proven herself the best judge of men, she was betting this one lived up to his packaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. I was daydreaming. Oh my. Is this the place you bought? The place you told Essie about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He looked back at it as a man might a beloved old aunt. \"She needs some help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she certainly does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoards blinded half the windows while the front veranda sagged like an old pair ofjowls. The paint-what was left of it-curled off the wood in a sickly yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have your work cut out for you,\" she commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s half the fun. And I kind of wanted to talk to you about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on up a little. The steps are fine.\" He took her hand, drew her up. \"Structurally it\u0027s in pretty good shape. Some this, some that. But mostly it\u0027s cosmetic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to take a lot of Max Factor, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Max... right, right. Got it. Yeah, it needs a lot of makeup, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got ideas about that. One of them\u0027s about curb appeal, you could say. Your place-MacNamara House?-it\u0027s got excellent curb appeal. I hear you do all the gardening around there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of it.\" She pulled a bottle of water out of her purse, offered it. \"You carry water in your purse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could open a small sundry shop with what I carry in my purse. I have no idea how you men get along with just pockets. Would you like it? I have two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Thanks. I\u0027m good. Ah... gardening. Your gardening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm.\" Taking a sip of water, Ava noted the tangled mess of the front lawn, and the viciously healthy bindweed that dominated. \"Essie putters a little. Phoebe barely has time to do more than yank a few weeds now and then. I enjoy it most, so I do the most.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to garden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" Now she looked at him with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Found it out when I started fooling around with the house I-the house I live in. I\u0027m not too bad. You\u0027re a whole lot better. So I thought maybe you might be able to help me out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking we\u0027ll have to start pretty much from scratch. Mostly what\u0027s here has gone woody, or it\u0027s dead, except for the weeds, of course. They need a good killing. We\u0027d want some new foundation plants for sure and something splashy. Maybe a dwarf blooming somethinglittle weeper maybe-on the side there. A trailing vine up the trellis.\" Baffled, Ava studied the sorrowful house. \"What trellis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one I think we should put up. Or an arbor. I got a fondness for arbors.\" Imagining, he jiggled the change in his pockets. \"Then there\u0027s pots and window boxes. A lot of big-and let\u0027s go splashy again-pots and window boxes. And there\u0027s a space around the back? It\u0027s small, and I\u0027m thinking a little patio with a pretty little table and chairs, that kind of thing. Needs a couple of beds to frame it in. Potted trees, so on so on. So, think you can help me out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m confused. You want me to help you landscape this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking to hire you to landscape this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the breath stuck in her throat, Ava took a long drink to clear it. \"Duncan... Why would you think I could take on a project like this? I\u0027m not a landscaper. I just do some gardening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did a little gardening, Duncan thought. What Ava did was what Essie did with hook and yarn. She created art. \"I don\u0027t want a landscaper here, exactly. Nothing against them, not a thing. I want something homey, but a little dramatic. Individual. I like what you\u0027ve done to the Jones Street place. That\u0027s what I\u0027m looking for here. I\u0027ve got pictures.\" He pulled a folder from a briefcase on the steps, pushed them at her. \"Of the house, the grounds-such as they are, the verandas, so on. And I worked up some of the basic ideas I have in mind. Not set in stone, but ideas. And the budget I was thinking of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity got the best of her, so she opened the folder, paged through until she got to the budget. \"I\u0027m going to sit down here on these steps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He sat down with her. He did love sitting on a step or a stoop in the city and just watching life go by. So he was content enough to do just that as she was silent for several moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan, I think you must be an awfully sweet man, but you may have a mental problem.\" When he laughed, she shook her head. \"You don\u0027t offer a major project like this to someone who isn\u0027t proven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, major\u0027s relative. I have a major project elsewhere, which maybe we\u0027ll talk about some other time. I want this to look like a home.\" He wanted the life that went by to see it as one. \"That\u0027s how I see what you\u0027ve done. I know something about gardening, and-\" She snorted, jabbed a finger. \"Tell me half a dozen of the plants you\u0027ve seen at MacNamara house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027ve got that one urn thing on the veranda with heliotrope and that dark red phlox, with the lobelia and the sweet alyssum.\" He moved on to another pot, on to the shrubs and beds in the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied him now, her eyes narrowed behind shaded lenses. \"Did you write all that down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I notice things, especially if they interest me. You could think about it. I\u0027ve got a couple weeks before I have to lock this in. Maybe you\u0027ll come up with some ideas, and we can kick them around. I could...\" He glanced at his watch, winced. \"But I\u0027ve gotta get on. Phoebe\u0027s coming for dinner in a couple hours so I\u0027ve got to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get on,\" Ava murmured. \"I think I\u0027ll just sit here a bit longer, if that\u0027s all right with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, poke around.\" He rose, turned and studied the house again. \"I\u0027d really like to bring her back. Just give it some thought, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give it some thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat, after he\u0027d gotten into his car and pulled away. She sat, thinking he must be a crazy man. Then she stood, studied the house, walked carefully around the sagging veranda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of the yard she\u0027d had in that tidy subdivision in West Chatham. How she\u0027d loved turning it into a showpiece. How she\u0027d hauled soil, fertilizer, peat moss. How she\u0027d dug, and planted, and sweated and weeded. Making her home, she remembered. Making it picture perfect, without a clue that there was a snake in her garden. Not a clue that she\u0027d have to walk away from the dreamscape she\u0027d imagined and worked so hard to create.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWouldn\u0027t it be something if she could do this? If she could scrape away all the dead, all the ugly, and make something beautiful here? For no reason other than the beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she decided. It was something to think about. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-14.html","bookId":2412,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM"}
