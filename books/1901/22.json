{"id":86325,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got some formidable shields, and I\u0027m not going to apologize for using the resources I have to get past them. Because you know as well as I do that what\u0027s upset you has nothing to do with me getting up your skirt. If that was the case, you never would have stopped me a month ago. It would have been a fun fuck, and two adults would have gone their separate ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I got in. In just those few minutes. So you\u0027re scared shitless about what I\u0027m going to find now that I\u0027m there. Which means it matters to you.\" A grim smile touched his mouth, though his eyes remained hard. \"Which also gives me hope that this is more to you than just getting into my pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fixed her attention stonily on his chest. \"I had it all planned out. I was going to use you and cast you aside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like yesterday\u0027s Wall Street Journal\" Lucas sighed, gathered her in, letting his chin rest on top of her head. \"You know, some of those articles are good reference material.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she let out a muffled snort, Lucas rubbed his hands up and down her back. \"God, I want to get you out of this damn thing, feel your skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t agree more, but she drew back. \"Lucas, let me put on my shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re right. You\u0027ll break your neck in these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not walking into the K\u0026amp;A lobby with the CFO in nothing but bare feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Letting her go, he pulled off one loafer and then the other as she watched, nonplussed. He considered his black dress socks. \"We had a sliding contest down here, late one night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sliding. You run fast and then slide in your socks across a slick floor? We had a bet on who could slide the farthest from a certain point. Kind of like shuffleboard, with people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we did all sorts of crazy acrobatics. We had an audience of homeless people standing outside the window, staring at us before it was all over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who won?\" Cass asked, for lack of anything else to say, her mind torn between the intensity of their exchange only a breath ago, and the whimsy of seeing the K\u0026amp;A team play like boys in their own lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter. Damn mutant cyborg. He can run the fastest. I guess that\u0027s a good thing, since when people are trying to blow you up or put bullets in your ass, being fast is important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"You\u0027re insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re human, Cass. That\u0027s all. We\u0027re all kids playing grown-up. We do the best we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking her hand and holding his shoes, he walked into the lobby. She thought about digging in, but the floor was slick enough he\u0027d probably haul her forward like a sled dog, so she went along with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraffic flow was always steady through the K\u0026amp;A lobby, and today was no exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the faces were known to her, but somehow with Lucas holding her hand and moving along as if it was the most normal thing in the world to be padding across the floor in his socks, her in stocking feet, she was able to assume an almost nonchalant air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the receptionist gave them an amused glance, they won a snort from the security guard, who obviously knew Lucas. Then they were past, heading for the revolving door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re shorter this way,\" he commented. \"Petite, like a doll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say Barbie, I\u0027ll sweep your legs and crack your skull on your pretty shiny floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch. Kung fu Barbie.\" Laughing, he dodged her shove, came back, and claimed her hand. \"There\u0027s the biker chick who stole my heart.\" Guiding her into the revolving door, he took the same section, crowding her until they emerged into the crisp fall air that nevertheless was full of sunshine. When she started to put on her shoes, he shook his head, pulled her out of the flow of foot traffic. \"Feel the warmth through the concrete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My stockings will tear. And the rest of me is a little cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear, you\u0027re as bad as working with metal. A man has to fire you up to get you to bend.\" Gathering her against him, he wrapped her up in the open panels of his suit coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, feel the heat through your soles. Doesn\u0027t that feel good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCass resisted the urge to bury her face into his shirt, rub her cheek against his chest beneath the stretched cotton. Instead, she tipped her head back to look at his eyes, narrowed against the glare, the sun forming a halo limning his golden hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, right. Definitely a trick of the light, that. \"Yes,\" she admitted, glad he didn\u0027t know what felt so good to her. The strength of his arms, his body pressed close. The coat around her, the way she\u0027d imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here comes our limo, to take us to lunch.\" At her arch glance, he shrugged. \"What\u0027s the benefit of being a big shot at K\u0026amp;A if you can\u0027t use the limo pool for lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have a car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"You saw it in my office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ride your bike to work? Where do you live? Are you insane?\" She looked at the busy downtown traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was about ten miles in New Orleans. Here it\u0027s about fifteen. It\u0027s a good way to start the day. I do have a car,\" he added. \"I only use it when I have to. Green footprint, and all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to hear it. Because I\u0027m not going on a date on handlebars or pedal pegs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Progress.\" He smiled, holding her closer, his hands low on her hips. \"You\u0027re calling it a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra didn\u0027t want to be so comfortable in his company. She needed to be out of sorts with him, convince herself she felt used, exposed, forced to an unwelcome vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she wasn\u0027t in the habit of lying to herself. She could avoid what she didn\u0027t want to think about, though. So for the time being she decided not to dwell on the fact he\u0027d made her do the unthinkable. As well as left her with a frightening need for more of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the limo, he slid an arm along the back of the seat, giving her a loose sense of being encircled, particularly when he toyed with her hair, coaxed her with amusing guile into leaning across him as he pointed out a landmark of interest. When she leaned back, she found his arm settled on her shoulder, holding her closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said lunch,\" she said. \"Then you said I could walk away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you want to do?\" he asked. \"Walk away? Why won\u0027t you give this a shot, Cass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t really have a choice, Lucas. My life has no room for something like this. Much as I might want it.\" She needed to give him that, but she almost regretted it because the softening of his expression made her wish fiercely she had more to give him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are always choices. Let\u0027s at least talk about what the obstacles might be. Let me get to know you,\" he insisted. \"I want to know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027tâ€”\" Thank God, her cell rang, but then she saw the caller ID. No, not right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe timing couldn\u0027t be worse, or more ironic. She told herself to ignore it, even as she knew she couldn\u0027t. Any more than she could cover the questions it would raise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppressing a desire to scream, she opened the cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, George. How long ago? You should have called me.\" She bit her lip. \"Yes, I know you\u0027re busy. No, I\u0027ll come get him. Yes, I will. Damn it, George, we\u0027ve been through this. I can\u0027t.\" She shook herself. \"I\u0027ll just be there in a minute, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got off, Lucas\u0027s eyes were on her face. Miserably, she averted her own, looked out the window at a world where the sun had dimmed, and everything she\u0027d just done and enjoyed was laced with bitterness. \"I\u0027m going to have to skip lunch. If you\u0027ll stop, I\u0027ll get a taxi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cass. Tell me what\u0027s going on.\" Tiredness had taken over her features the moment she looked at her caller ID, and there was a pain in her eyes Lucas wanted to erase. He touched her hand, but she drew away, shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother has some problems. He got picked up. Again. I need to go get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is one of the reasons you think I shouldn\u0027t get involved with you.\" When she pressed her lips together, he sat back, suppressing his own frustration. \"Max, take us to the District One police station, will you? I assume that\u0027s where he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Her gaze snapped to him. \"I don\u0027t want you involved in this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tough. Now tell me what we\u0027re dealing with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not dealing with anything,\" she said sharply. \"I\u0027m just going to get him. This is my business, Lucas. There\u0027s no need to involve yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need at all, if my interest was only in your beautiful body and eager pussy.\" He\u0027d pitched his voice low, but it still made her attention jerk toward the driver then back to him, her face burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" she hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it was. You like men, Cass, but you view them like pets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can only count on them for certain things, and you\u0027re wholly responsible for taking care of them. Which, for what a dog or cat provides us, is a wonderful symbiotic relationship. When you apply that to a human, it\u0027s way too much work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you analyze me,\" she warned. \"We\u0027re not in a board room now. I can make Max stop this limo, tell you to kiss my ass and go on my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re almost there.\" Lucas studied her. \"I\u0027m not trying to threaten you, Cass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are,\" Cass retorted. She tossed circumspection out, since he already had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, we can do sex. Hell, I\u0027d be happy to fuck our mutual brains out. You\u0027re the first man I\u0027ve met in a while that might actually do the trick without taking too much time out of my day and still be satisfying. But my cunt is not the gateway into my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limo veered, a quick brake. Lucas sent a grimly amused glance toward the front. \"All right up there, Max?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cleared throat and the driver, a man who looked to Cass like he also served as a bouncer, spoke. \"Er, yes, Mr. Adler. I\u0027ll just, uh, raise the glass. I\u0027d like to listen to some music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can stop right here, Max, and let me out,\" she ordered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/controlled-response-knights-of-the-board-room-2/page-22.html","bookId":1901,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:28 PM"}
