{"id":110816,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were a dream,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all remained standing, the dhampirs fanning out around the Moroi in a sort of protective formation. Abe\u0027s was the strange face I\u0027d seen while I\u0027d been going in and out of consciousness after the fight by the barn. He was older than me, close to Olena\u0027s age. He had black hair and a goatee, and about as tan a complexion as Moroi ever had. If you\u0027ve ever seen tan or dark-skinned people who are sick and grow pale, it\u0027s a lot like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was some pigment in his skin, but it was underscored by an intense pallor. Most astonishing of all was his clothing. He wore a long dark coat that screamed money, paired with a cashmere crimson scarf. Below it, I could see a bit of gold, a chain to match the gold hoop earring he wore in one of his ears. My initial impression of that flamboyance would have been pirate or pimp. A moment later, I changed my mind. Something about him said he was the kind of guy who broke kneecaps to get his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dream, eh? That,\" the Moroi said, with the very slightest hint of a smile, \"is not something I hear very often. Well, no.\" He reconsidered. \"I do occasionally show up in people\u0027s nightmares.\" He was neither American nor Russian; I couldn\u0027t identify the accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he trying to impress me or intimidate me with his big, bad reputation? Sydney hadn\u0027t been afraid of him, exactly, but she\u0027d certainly possessed a healthy amount of wariness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I assume you already know who I am,\" I said. \"So, the question now is, what are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said, the smile turning harder. \"The question is, what are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gestured back to the house, trying to play it cool. \"I\u0027m going to a funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not why you came to Russia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to Russia to tell the Belikovs that Dimitri was dead, seeing as no one else bothered to.\" That was turning into a handy explanation for me being here, but as Abe studied me, a chill ran down my spine, kind of like when Yeva looked at me. Like that crazy old woman, he didn\u0027t believe me, and again I felt the dangerous edge to his otherwise jovial personality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbe shook his head, and now the smile was gone altogether. \"That\u0027s not the reason either. Don\u0027t lie to me, little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my hackles going up. \"And don\u0027t interrogate me, old man. Not unless you\u0027re ready to tell me why you and your sidekicks risked driving that road to pick up Sydney and me.\" Abe\u0027s dhampirs stiffened at the words old man, but to my surprise, he actually smiled again-though the smile didn\u0027t reach his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I was just helping out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not from what I hear. You\u0027re the one who had the Alchemists send Sydney with me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" He arched an eyebrow. \"Did she tell you that? Mmm... that was bad behavior on her part. Her superiors aren\u0027t going to like that. Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, damn. I\u0027d spoken without thinking. I didn\u0027t want Sydney to get in trouble. If Abe really was some kind of Moroi Godfather type-what had she called him? Zmey? The snake?-I didn\u0027t doubt he could talk to other Alchemists to make her life even more miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forced it out of her,\" I lied. \"I... I threatened her on the train. It wasn\u0027t hard. She\u0027s already scared to death of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t doubt she is. They\u0027re all scared of us, bound by centuries of tradition and hiding behind their crosses to protect them-despite the gifts they get from their tattoos. In a lot of ways, they get the same traits as you dhampirs-just no reproductive issues.\" He gazed up at the stars as he spoke, like some sort of philosopher musing on the mysteries of the universe. Somehow, that made me angrier. He was treating this like a joke, when clearly he had some agenda regarding me. I didn\u0027t like being part of anyone\u0027s plans-particularly when I didn\u0027t know what those plans were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, I\u0027m sure we could talk about the Alchemists and how you control them all night,\" I snapped. \"But I still want to know what you want with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing? You\u0027ve gone to a lot of trouble to set me up with Sydney and follow me here for nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back down from the sky, and there was a dangerous glint in his eyes. \"You\u0027re of no interest to me. I have my own business to run. I come on behalf of others who are interested in you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened, and at last, true fear ran through me. Shit. There was a manhunt out for me. But who? Lissa? Adrian? Tatiana? Again, that last one made me nervous. The others would seek me out because they cared. But Tatiana... Tatiana feared I\u0027d run off with Adrian. Once more I thought that if she wanted me found, it might be because she wanted to ensure I didn\u0027t come back. Abe struck me as the kind of person who could make people disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do the others want? Do they want me home?\" I asked, trying to appear unafraid. \"Did you think you could just come here and drag me back to the U.S.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat secretive smile of Abe\u0027s returned. \"Do you think I could just drag you back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I scoffed, again without thinking, \"you couldn\u0027t. Your guys here could. Well, maybe. I might be able to take them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbe laughed out loud for the first time, a rich, deep sound filled with sincere amusement. \"You live up to your brash reputation. Delightful.\" Great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbe probably had a whole file on me somewhere. He probably knew what I liked for breakfast. \"I\u0027ll make a trade with you. Tell me why you\u0027re here, and I\u0027ll tell you why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash, the laughter was gone. He took a step closer to where I sat, and I saw his guardians tense. \"And I told you not to lie to me. You\u0027ve got a reason for being here. I need to know what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose? Can you come in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack toward the Belikov house, Viktoria\u0027s clear voice rang out in the night. Glancing behind me, I saw her standing in the doorway. Suddenly, I wanted to get away from Abe. There was something lethal underneath that gaudy, jovial facade, and I didn\u0027t want to spend another minute with him. Leaping up, I began backing toward the house, half-expecting his guardians to come kidnap me, despite his words. The two guys stayed where they were, but their eyes watched me carefully. Abe\u0027s quirky smile returned to his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry I can\u0027t stay and chat,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right,\" he said grandly. \"We\u0027ll find time later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not likely,\" I said. He laughed, and I hastily followed Viktoria into the house, not feeling safe until I shut the door. \"I do not like that guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abe?\" she asked. \"I thought he was your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly. He\u0027s some kind of mobster, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose,\" she said, like it was no big deal. \"But he\u0027s the reason you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know about him coming to get us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktoria shook her head. \"No, I mean here. I guess while you were in the car, you kept saying, ¡®Belikov, Belikov.\u0027 Abe figured you knew us. That\u0027s why he took you to our house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was startling. I\u0027d been dreaming of Dimitri, so of course I would have said his last name. But I\u0027d had no idea that was how I\u0027d ended up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d figured it was because Olena had medical training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Viktoria added the most astonishing thing of all. \"When he realized we didn\u0027t know you, he was going to take you somewhere else-but grandmother said we had to keep you. I guess she\u0027d had some dream that you\u0027d come to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Crazy, creepy Yeva who hated me? \"Yeva dreamed about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktoria nodded. \"It\u0027s this gift she has. Are you sure you don\u0027t know Abe? He\u0027s too big-time to be here without a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlena hurried over to us before I could respond. She caught hold of my arm. \"We\u0027ve been looking for you. What took so long?\" This question was directed to Viktoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abe was-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlena shook her head. \"Never mind. Come on. Everyone\u0027s waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" I asked, letting her drag me through the house to the backyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was supposed to tell you,\" explained Viktoria, scurrying along. \"This is the part where everyone sits and remembers Dimitri by telling stories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s seen him in so long; we don\u0027t know what\u0027s happened to him recently,\" said Olena. \"We need you to tell us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched. Me? I balked at that, particularly when we emerged outside and I saw all those faces around the campfire. I didn\u0027t know any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I talk about Dimitri? How could I reveal what was closest to my heart? Everyone seemed to blur together, and I thought I might faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the moment, none of them noticed me. Karolina was speaking, her baby in her arms. Every so often she\u0027d pause, and the others would laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktoria sat down on a blanket-covered spot on the ground and pulled me down beside her. Sydney joined us a little while later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s she saying?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktoria listened to her sister for a few moments and then leaned closer to me. \"She\u0027s talking about when Dimitri was very young, how he used to always beg her and her friends to let him play with them. He was about six and they were eight and didn\u0027t want him around.\" Viktoria paused again to take in the next part of the story. \"Finally, Karolina told him he could if he agreed to be married off to their dolls. So Karolina and her friends dressed him and the dolls up over and over and kept having weddings. Dimitri was married at least ten times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help but laugh as I tried to picture tough, sexy Dimitri letting his big sister dress him up. He probably would have treated his wedding ceremony with a doll as seriously and stoically as he did his guardian duties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther people spoke, and I tried to keep up with the translations. All the stories were about Dimitri\u0027s kindness and strength of character. Even when not out battling the undead, Dimitri had always been there to help those who needed it. Almost everyone could recall sometime that Dimitri had stepped up to help others, going out of his way to do what was right, even in situations that could put him at risk. That was no surprise to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri always did the right thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was that attitude that had made me love him so much. I had a similar nature. I too rushed in when others needed me, sometimes when I shouldn\u0027t have. Others called me crazy for it, but Dimitri had understood. He\u0027d always understood me, and part of what we\u0027d worked on was how to temper that impulsive need to run into danger with reason and calculation. I had a feeling no one else in this world would ever understand me like he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t notice how strongly the tears were running down my cheeks until I saw everyone looking at me. At first, I thought they considered me crazy for crying, but then I realized someone had asked me a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want you to talk about Dimitri\u0027s last days,\" Viktoria said. \"Tell us something. What he did. What he was like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used my sleeve to clean my face and looked away, focusing on the bonfire. I\u0027d spoken in front of others before without hesitation, but this was different. \"I... I can\u0027t,\" I told Viktoria, my voice strained and soft. \"I can\u0027t talk about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed my hand. \"Please. They need to hear about him. They need to know. Just tell us anything. What was he like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He... he was your brother. You know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said gently. \"But we want to know what you think he was like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes were still on the fire, watching the way the flames danced and shifted from orange to blue. \"He... he was the best man I\u0027ve ever met.\" I stopped to gather myself, and Viktoria used the opportunity to translate my words into Russian. \"And he was one of the best guardians. I mean, he was young compared to a lot of them, but everyone knew who he was. They all knew his reputation, and lots of people relied on him for advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey called him a god. And whenever there was a fight... or danger... he was always the first one to put himself out there. He never flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a couple months ago, when our school was attacked...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked up here a bit. The Belikovs had said they knew of the attack-that everyone knew about it-and from the faces here, it was true. I didn\u0027t need to elaborate on that night, on the horrors I\u0027d seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That night,\" I continued, \"Dimitri rushed out to face the Strigoi. He and I were together when we realized they were attacking. I wanted to stay and help him, but he wouldn\u0027t let me. He just told me to go, to run off and alert others. And he stayed behind-not knowing how many Strigoi he\u0027d have to take on while I went for help. I still don\u0027t know how many he fought-but there were a bunch. And he took them all down alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dared to look up at the faces around me. Everyone was so quiet and still that I wondered if they were breathing. \"It was so hard,\" I told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout realizing it, my voice had dropped to a whisper. I had to repeat myself more loudly. \"It was so hard. I didn\u0027t want to leave him, but I knew I had to. He taught me so much, but one of the biggest things was that we have to protect others. It was my duty to warn everyone else, even though I just wanted to stay with him. The whole time, my heart kept saying, ¡®Turn around, turn around. Go to him!\u0027 But I knew what I had to do and I also knew part of him was trying to keep me safe. And if the roles had been reversed... well, I would have made him run too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, surprised I\u0027d revealed so much of my heart. I switched back to business. \"Even when the other guardians joined him, Dimitri never backed down. He took down more Strigoi than almost anyone.\" Christian and I had actually killed the most. \"He... he was amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told them the rest of the story that I\u0027d told the Belikovs. Only I actually forced a little detail this time, telling them vividly just how brave and fierce he had been. The words hurt me as I spoke, and yet... it was almost a relief to get them out. I\u0027d kept the memories of that night too close to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut eventually, I had to tell them about the cave. And that... that was the worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d trapped the escaping Strigoi in a cave. It had two entrances, and we came at them from both sides. Some of our people got trapped, though, and there were more Strigoi than we\u0027d expected. We lost people... but we would have lost a lot more if Dimitri hadn\u0027t been there. He wouldn\u0027t leave until everyone was out. He didn\u0027t care about the risk to himself. He only knew he had to save others...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d seen it in his eyes, that determination. Our plan had finally been to retreat as soon as we were all out, but I\u0027d had the feeling he would have stayed and killed every Strigoi he could find. But he\u0027d followed orders too, finally beginning his retreat when the others were safe. And in those last moments, just before the Strigoi had bitten him, Dimitri had met my eyes with a look so full of love that it was like that whole cave filled with light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression had said what we\u0027d talked about earlier: We can be together, Rose. Soon. We\u0027re almost there. And nothing will ever keep us apart again...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t mention that part, though. When I finished the rest of the tale, the faces of those gathered were grim but filled with awe and respect. Near the back of the crowd, I noticed Abe and his guardians listening as well. His expression was unreadable. Hard, but not angry or scary. Small cups began circulating through the group, and someone handed me one. A dhampir I didn\u0027t know, one of the few men present, stood up and raised his cup in the air. He spoke loudly and reverently, and I heard Dimitri\u0027s name mentioned several times. When he finished, he drank from the cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else did too, so I followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd nearly choked to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like fire in liquid form. It took every ounce of strength I had to swallow it and not spray it on those around me. \"Wh... what is this?\" I asked, coughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktoria grinned. \"Vodka.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered at the glass. \"No, it isn\u0027t. I\u0027ve had vodka before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Russian vodka.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently not. I forced the rest of the cup down out of respect to Dimitri, even though I had a feeling that if he were here, he\u0027d be shaking his head at me. I thought I was done being in the spotlight after my story, but apparently not. Everyone kept asking me questions. They wanted to know more about Dimitri, more about what his life had been like recently. They also wanted to know about me and Dimitri as a couple. They all seemed to have figured out that Dimitri and I had been in love-and they were okay with it. I was asked about how we\u0027d met, how long we\u0027d been together...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the whole time, people kept refilling my cup. Determined not to look like an idiot again, I kept drinking until I could finally take the vodka down without coughing or spitting. The more I drank, the louder and more animated my stories became. My limbs started to tingle, and part of me knew this was all probably a bad idea. Okay, all of me knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, people began to clear out. I had no idea what time it was, but I think it was the middle of the night. Maybe later. I stood as well, finding it much harder to do than I\u0027d expected. The world wobbled, and my stomach wasn\u0027t very happy with me. Someone caught a hold of my arm and steadied me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy,\" said Sydney. \"Don\u0027t push it.\" Slowly, carefully, she led me toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God,\" I moaned. \"Do they use that stuff as rocket fuel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one made you keep drinking it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, don\u0027t get preachy. Besides, I had to be polite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made it inside and then had the impossible task of getting up the stairs to the room Olena had given me. Each step was agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all knew about me and Dimitri,\" I said, wondering if I\u0027d be saying any of this sober. \"But I never told them we were together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t have to. It\u0027s written all over your face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They acted like I was his widow or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might as well be.\" We reached my room, and she helped me sit down on the bed. \"Not a lot of people get married around here. If you\u0027re with someone long enough, they figure it\u0027s almost the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and stared off without any particular focus. \"I miss him so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will it ever get better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question seemed to catch her by surprise. \"I... I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever been in love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure if that made her lucky or not. I wasn\u0027t sure if all the bright days I\u0027d had with Dimitri were worth the hurt I felt now. A moment later, I knew the truth. \"Of course they were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" asked Sydney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized I\u0027d spoken my thoughts out loud. \"Nothing. Just talking to myself. I should get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need anything else? Are you going to be sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assessed my queasy stomach. \"No, but thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" And in her typically brusque way, she left, turning off the lights and shutting the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have thought I\u0027d pass out right away. Honestly, I wanted to. My heart had been opened up to too much of Dimitri tonight, and I wanted that pain to go away. I wanted blackness and oblivion. Instead, maybe because I was a glutton for punishment, my heart decided to finish the job and rip itself completely open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to visit Lissa. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4/page-10.html","bookId":2063,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:08:04 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:08:04 AM"}
