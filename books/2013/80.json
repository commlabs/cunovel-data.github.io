A few more ill-chosen words and Clip’s head would roll from his shoulders. ‘Is it your mission,’ she asked the Tiste Andii, ‘to guide-us to our destination?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother smile, another snap of the chain. ‘It is. You will be, uh, welcomed as guests of the Andara. Although the presence of both Letherii and Tiste Edur in your party is somewhat problematic. The Onyx Order has been outlawed, as you know, subject to vicious repression. The Andara represents the last secret refuge of our people. Its location must not be compromised.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you suggest?’ Seren asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The remainder of this journey,’ Clip replied, ‘will be through warren. Through Kurald Galain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin cocked his head at that, then grunted, ‘I am beginning to understand. Tell me, Clip, how many wizards of the Order dwell in the Andara?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are five, and they are the last.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And can they agree on anything?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course not. I am here by the command of Ordant Brid, Reve Master of the Rock. My departure from the Andara was uneventful, else it is likely I would not be here-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Should another of the Order have intercepted you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nod. ‘Can you wait for the maelstrom your arrival will bring, Silchas Ruin? I can’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thus, your greeting earlier should have been qualified. The Order does not welcome us. Rather, this Ordant Brid does.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They all choose to speak for the Order,’ Clip said, his eyes glittering, ‘when it will most confound the others. Now, I can see how eager you all are.’ From his right hand the chain whipped out, the silver ring round his index finger, and at the snap of the chain’s full length, a gate into Darkness appeared to the warrior’s right. ‘Call the others here,’ Clip said, ‘at haste. Even now, bound wraiths serving the Tiste Edur are converging. Of course, they all dream of escape-alas, that we cannot give them. But their Edur masters watch through their eyes, and that won’t do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac turned about and summoned the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip stepped to one side and bowed low. ‘Silchas Ruin, I invite you to walk through first, and know once more the welcome embrace of true Darkness. Besides,’ he added, straightening as Ruin strode towards the gate, ‘you will make for us a bright beacon-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Silchas Ruin’s swords hissed out, a gleaming blur, the edge slashing across the space where Clip’s neck had been, but the young warrior had leaned back… just enough, and the weapon sang through air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft laugh from the youth, appallingly relaxed. ‘He said you’d be angry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin stared across at Clip for a long moment, then he turned and walked through the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing a deep.breath to slow her heart, Seren Pedac glared at Clip. ‘You have no idea-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t I?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others appeared, leading their horses. Udinaas, with Kettle tucked into one arm, barely glanced over at Clip before he tugged his horse into the rent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You wish to cross swords with a god, Clip?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He gave himself away-oh, he’s fast all right, and with two weapons he’d be hard to handle, I’ll grant you-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And will the Reve Master who sent you be pleased with your immature behaviour?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip laughed. ‘Ordant could have selected any of a hundred warriors at hand for this mission, Letherii.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yet he chose you, meaning he is either profoundly stupid or he anticipated your irreverence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou waste your time, Acquitor,’ Fear Sengar said, coming up alongside her and eyeing Clip. ‘He is Tiste Andii. His mind is naught but darkness, in which ignorance and foolishness thrive.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Fear the young warrior bowed again. ‘Edur, please, proceed. Darkness awaits you.’ And he waved at the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Fear Sengar led his horse into the gate, the chain on Clip’s right index finger spun out once more, ending with a clash of rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why do you do that?’ Seren demanded, irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrows lifted. ‘Do what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwearing under her breath, the Acquitor walked through the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBook Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLayers Of The Dead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho now strides on my trail\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edevouring the distance between\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eno matter how I flee, the wasted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreath of my haste cast into the wind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand these dogs will prevail\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edragging me down with howling glee\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor the beasts were born fated,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrained in bold vengeance \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-80.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
