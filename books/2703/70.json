It’d also be a first for me. It’d be the first time I’d step inside a bar. We were supposed to go to her place this afternoon after classes and get ready together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Quinn?” I asked, thinking Cora could ride to class with him since he’d stayed the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that question made her eyes narrow. “He had to leave early for his morning weight training session.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced. He’d gotten off work at two thirty last night, and then stayed up later to help me. And then he had to go in early for weight lifting? I suddenly had no reason whatsoever to complain about being tired. Poor guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping between me and the door, Cora crossed her arms over her chest. “Well, I was going to have this discussion in the car, but since you obviously already have plans...” She sneered the word as if she couldn’t believe I’d make my own plans. It made me feel guilty because I was here in this town for her, to make sure she stayed healthy. What was I doing, going out with Caroline to football games and concerts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” I asked, immediately concerned. “Did one of your tests—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine.” She rolled her eyes and sighed. “This is about Quinn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, totally confused. “Quinn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes! Your crush on my boyfriend is getting a little ridiculous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot at all expecting her to say that, I stumbled back a step and pressed my hand to my heart. “Wha—no... Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t even believe...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I was too flabbergasted to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean, it was cute at first,” Cora went on in the most conversational tone as my jaw dropped farther and farther. “This is probably the first time you’ve actually liked someone from the opposite gender. Right? I mean, for a while there, in high school, I thought you were a lesbian and into me, but...no...from the way you watch my boyfriend, like all the time, it’s obvious you’re definitely into guys. I just hope you know you could never have him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I...I...” Heat infused my face...and my chest...and my stomach. I didn’t even know what to say to that. So I fumbled out a few more unintelligible words before sputtering, “Oh my God, Cora. I have never...not even once thought your boyfriend would—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” Cora said perkily, clasping her hands together. “Because even if you tried, he’d never go for someone like you. He’s into much more knowledgeable, sophisticated women. Naive, gullible little innocents just aren’t to his taste.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart flopped heavily into my stomach, not only because it hurt to hear how I could never get a guy like Quinn because I was too...me, but just knowing she felt the need to warn me away from him, as if she thought I’d even try to steal him from her, was just...yeah. Insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why you even feel the need to say this to me.” I shook my head. “You know me! I’d never...ever...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right.” Cora smiled as if pleased. She patted my arm and stepped aside to let me go. “I do know better. I guess I was just getting a little possessive of the man I love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing her say the L-word rattled me more than I cared to admit, and I had to look at anything but her while I nodded, agreeing with her assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank goodness that’s all settled then. Have fun at school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, feeling more unsettled than ever before. I stared at her a moment, then I had to say, “I think you should tell him, though. He deserves to know. Quinn is a really good—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora lifted her fingers to stop me mid-word. Then she narrowed her gaze. “Yes, he is a really good guy. But he’s my guy. Not yours. It’s completely my decision what I do with him and what I tell him.” She stepped threateningly closer. “And if you ever even think about interfering with that, or telling him what I don’t wish for him to know, you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. Understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t even respond to that. I simply brushed past her and hurried from the apartment. But I felt cold, deep inside, all the way to school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was worse, Quinn was already in art class, sitting in the chair next to mine when I arrived. And then he had to go and smile at me as if he were happy to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, did you get the super called this morning?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-70.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
