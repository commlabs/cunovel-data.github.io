Eons ago, in the saurian age, as men have called it, great lizards died in this strange part of the world by the thousands. No one knows why they came here; why they perished. Was it a realm of tropical trees and steaming swamps We don\u0027t know. All we have now in this spot is the desert and millions upon millions of fossils, telling a fragmentary tale of giant reptiles who surely made the earth tremble with each step they took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gobi Desert is therefore an immense graveyard and a fitting place for me to look the sun in the face. I lay a long time in the sand before the sunrise, collecting my last thoughts,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trick was to rise to the very limit of the atmosphere, into the sunrise, so to speak. Then when I lost consciousness I would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etumble down in the terrible heat, and my body would be shattered by this great fall upon the desert floor. How could it then dig in beneath the surface, as it might have done, by its own evil volition, were I whole and in a land of soft soil\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, if the blast of light was sufficiently strong to burn me up, naked and so high above the earth, perhaps I would be dead and gone before my remains ever struck the hard bed of sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the old expression goes, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Nothing much could have deterred me. Yet I did wonder if the other immortals knew what I meant to do and whether or not they were in the least concerned. I certainly sent them no farewell messages; I threw out no random images of what I meant to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last the great warmth of dawn crept across the desert. I rose to my knees, stripped off my clothing, and began the ascent, my eyes already burning from the faintest bit of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigher and higher I went, propelling myself well beyond the place where my body tended to stop and begin to float of its own accord. Finally I could not breathe, as the air was very thin, and it took a great effort to support myself at this height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the light came. So immense, so hot, so blinding that it seemed a great roaring noise as much as a vision filling my sight. I saw yellow and orange fire covering everything. I stared right into it, though it felt like scalding water poured into my eyes. I think I opened my mouth as if to swallow it, this divine fire! The sun was mine suddenly. I was seeing it; I was reaching for it. And then the light was covering me like molten lead, paralyzing me and torturing me beyond endurance, and my own cries filled my ears. Still I would not look away, still I would not fall!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus I defy you, heaven! And there were no words suddenly and no thoughts. I was twisting, swimming in it. And as the darkness and the coldness rose up to envelop me-it was nothing but the loss of consciousness-I realized that I had begun to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound was the sound of the air rushing past me, and it seemed that the voices of others were calling to me, and through the horrid mingled roar, I heard distinctly the voice of a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen nothing . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I dreaming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were in a small close place, a hospital smelling of sickness and death, and I was pointing to the bed, and the child who lay on the pillow, white and small and half dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sharp riff of laughter. I smelled an oil lamp- that moment when the wick has blown out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat, she said. How beautiful her little voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to explain about my father\u0027s castle, about the snow falling, and my dogs waiting there. That\u0027s where I had wanted to go. I could hear them suddenly, that deep baying bark of the mastiffs, echoing up the snow-covered slopes, and I could almost see the towers of the castle itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then she said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was night again when I awoke. I was lying on the desert floor. The dunes bestirred by the wind had spread a fine mist of sand over all my limbs. I felt pain all over. Pain even in the roots of my hair. I felt such pain I couldn\u0027t will myself to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor hours I lay there. Now and then I gave a soft moan. It made no difference in the pain I felt. When I moved my limbs even a little, the sand was like tiny particles of sharp glass against my back and my calves and the heels of my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of all those to whom I might have called for help. I did not call. Only gradually did I realize that if I remained here, the sun would come again, naturally enough, and I would be caught once more and burned once more. Yet still I might not die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to remain, didn\u0027t I What sort of coward would seek shelter now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all I had to do was look at my hands in the light of the stars to see that I was not going to die. I was burnt, yes, my skin was brown and wrinkled and roaring with pain. But I was nowhere near death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last I rolled over and tried to rest my face against the sand, but this was no more comforting than staring up into the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I felt the sun coming. I was weeping as the great orange light spilled over all the world. The pain caught my back first and then I thought my head was burning, that it would explode, and that the fire was eating my eyes. I was mad when the darkness of oblivion came, absolutely mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I awoke the following evening, I felt sand in my mouth, sand covering me in my agony. In that madness, I\u0027d apparently buried myself alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor hours I remained so, thinking only that this pain was more than any creature could endure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I struggled to the surface, whimpering like an animal, and I climbed to my feet, each gesture pulling at the pain and intensifying it, and then I willed myself into the air and I started the slow journey west and into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo diminishing of my powers. Ah, only the surface of my body had been deeply harmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind was infinitely softer than the sand. Nevertheless it brought its own torment, like fingers stroking my burnt skin all over and tugging at the burnt roots of my hair. It stung my burnt eyelids; and scraped at my burnt knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI traveled gently for hours, willing myself to David\u0027s house once more and feeling the most glorious relief for a few moments as I descended through the cold wet snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just before morning in England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI entered by the rear door again, each step an excruciating ordeal. Almost blindly, I found the library and I went down on my knees, ignoring the pain, and collapsed upon the tigerskin rug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laid my head beside the tiger\u0027s head, and my cheek against its open jaws. Such fine, close fur! I stretched out my arms on its legs and felt its smooth, hard claws under my wrists. The pain shot through me in waves. The fur felt almost silky and the room was cool in its darkness. And in faint shimmers of silent visions, I saw the mangrove forests of India,! saw dark faces, and heard distant voices. And once very clearly for a full instant I saw David as a young man, as I\u0027d seen him in my dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed such a miracle, this living young man, full of blood and tissue and such miraculous achievements as eyes and a beating heart and five fingers to each long slender hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw myself walking in Paris in the old days when I was alive. I was wearing the red velvet cloak, lined with the fur of the wolves I\u0027d killed back in my native Auvergne, never dreaming that things lurked in the shadows, things that could see you and fall in love with you, just because you were young, things that could take your life, just because they loved you and you\u0027d slain a whole pack of wolves . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid, the hunter! In belted khaki, with that magnificent gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, I became aware that the pain was already lessened. Good old Lestat, the god, healing with preternatural speed. The pain was like a deep glow settling over my body. I imagined myself giving a warm light to the entire room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the scent of mortals. A servant had come into the room and quickly gone out. Poor old guy. It made me laugh to myself in my half sleep, to think what he had seen-a dark-skinned naked man, with a mop of unkempt blond hair, lying atop David\u0027s tiger in the darkened room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, I caught David\u0027s scent, and I heard again the low familiar thunder of blood in mortal veins. Blood. I was so thirsty for blood. My burnt skin cried for it, and my burning eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft flannel blanket was laid over me, very light and cool-feeling to me. There followed a series of little sounds. David was pulling the heavy velvet draperies closed over the windows, which he had not bothered to do all winter. He was fussing with the cloth so that there would be no seams of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat, he whispered. Let me take you down into the cellar, where you\u0027ll surely be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoesn\u0027t matter, David. May I stay here in this room?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, of course, you may stay. Such solicitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you, David. I started to sleep again, and snow was blowing through the window of my room in the castle, but then it was wholly different. I saw the little hospital bed once more, and the child was in it, and thank God that nurse wasn\u0027t there but had gone to stop the one who was crying. Oh, such a terrible, terrible sound. I hated it. I wanted to be ... where Home in the deep French winter, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the oil lamp was being lighted, instead of going out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told you it wasn\u0027t time. Her dress was so perfectly white, and look, how very tiny her pearl buttons! And what a fine band of pretty roses around her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did you say? David asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalking to Claudia, I explained. She was sitting in the petit-point armchair with her legs straight out before her, toes together and pointed at the ceiling. Were those satin slippers I grabbed her ankle and kissed it, and when I looked up I saw her chin and her eyelashes as she threw back her head and laughed. Such an exquisite full-throated laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are others out there, David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes, though it hurt to do it, hurt to see the dim shapes of the room. Sun almost coining. I felt the claws of the tiger under my fingers. Ah, precious beast. David stood at the window. He was peering through a tiny seam between the two panels of drapery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut there, he went on. They\u0027ve come to see that you\u0027re all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine that. Who are they? I couldn\u0027t hear them, didn\u0027t want to hear them. Was it Marius Surely not the very ancient ones. Why would they care about such a thing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know, he said. But they are there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know the old story, I whispered. Ignore them and they\u0027ll go away. Almost sunrise anyway. They have to go. And they certainly won\u0027t hurt you, David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t read my mind if you won\u0027t let me read yours, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t be cross. No one will come into this room or disturb you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I can be a danger even in repose ... I wanted to say more, to warn him further, but then I realized he was the one mortal who did not require such a warning. Talamasca. Scholars of the paranormal. He knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleep now, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to laugh at that. What else can I do when the sun rises Even if it shines full upon my face. But he sounded so firm and reassuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo think, in the olden times, I always had the coffin, and sometimes I would polish it slowly until the wood had a great luster to it, and then I\u0027d shine the tiny crucifix on top of it, smiling at myself, at the care with which I buffed the little twisted body of the massacred Christ, the Son of God. I\u0027d loved the satin lining of the box. I\u0027d loved the shape, and the twilight act of rising from the dead. But no more . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was truly coming, the cold winter sun of England. I could feel it for certain, and suddenly I was afraid. I could feel the light stealing over the ground outside and striking the windows. But the darkness held on this side of the velvet curtains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the little flame in the oil lamp rise. It scared me, just because I was in such pain and it was a flame. Her small rounded fingers on the golden key, and that ring, that ring I gave her with the tiny diamond set in pearls. What about the locket Should I ask her about the locket Claudia, was there ever a gold locket. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning the flame higher and higher. That smell again. Her dimpled hand. All through the long flat in the Rue Royale, one could catch the scent of the oil. Ah, that old wallpaper, and the pretty handmade furniture, and Louis writing at his desk, sharp smell of the black ink, dull scratch of the quill pen . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer little hand was touching my cheek, so deliciously cold, and that vague thrill that passes through me when one of the others touches me, our skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would anyone want me to live? I asked. At least that was what I started to ask ... and then I was simply gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-body-thief-the-vampire-chronicles-4/page-4.html","bookId":2212,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:22 PM"}
