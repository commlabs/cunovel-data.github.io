A group of riders exited that camp, moving swiftly to the south, and without the banner of Many-Arrows flying from their midst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"War pigs, and armored,\" the shaman Ung-thol remarked. \"Elite warriors. Obould\u0027s own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDnark pointed to a rider in the middle of the pack, and though they were far away and moving farther, his headdress could still be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The priest, Nukkels,\" Ung-thol said with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does this mean?\" Oktule asked, his tone concurring with his body posture to relate his discomfort. Young Oktule had been chosen as a courier from the east because of his speed and stamina, but he had not the experience or the wisdom to fathom all that was going on around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chieftain and his shaman turned as one to regard the orc. \"It means that you should tell Grguch to proceed with all caution,\" Dnark said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"King Obould might not welcome him with the warmth promised in the invitation,\" Dnark explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or might greet him with more warmth than promised,\" Ungthol quipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOktule stared at them, his jaw hanging open. \"King Obould is angry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought a laugh from the two older and more worldly orcs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know Toogwik Tuk?\" Ung-thol asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOktule nodded. \"The preacher orc.

He proclaimed the power of Chieftain Grguch and the call of Gruumsh to bring war to the dwarves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDnark chuckled and patted the air with his hand, trying to calm the fool. \"Deliver your words to Chieftain Grguch as your king demanded,\" he said. \"But seek out Toogwik Tuk first and inform him that a second courier went out from Obould\u0027s\" - then he quickly corrected himself - \"King Obould\u0027s camp, this one riding to the south.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it mean?\" Oktule asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means that King Obould expects trouble,\" Ung-thol interrupted, stopping Dnark before he could respond. \"Toogwik Tuk will know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble?\" asked Oktule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dwarves will likely counterattack, and more furious will they become when they learn that both King Obould and Chieftain Grguch are in the same place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOktule began to nod stupidly, catching on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be off at once,\" Dnark told him, and the young orc spun on his heel and rushed away. A signal from Dnark sent a couple of guards off with him, to escort him on his important journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they were gone, the chieftain and the shaman turned back to the distant riders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really believe that Obould would send an emissary to the Battlehammer dwarves?\" Ung-thol asked. \"Has he become so cowardly as that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDnark nodded through every word, and when Ung-thol glanced over at him, he replied, \"We should find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye tell Emerus that we\u0027ll be lookin\u0027 for all he\u0027s to bring,\" Bruenor said to Jackonray Broadbelt and Nikwillig, the emissaries from Citadel Felbarr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bridge\u0027ll be ready soon, I\u0027m told,\" Jackonray replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget the durned bridge!\" Bruenor snapped, startling everyone in the room with his unexpected outburst. \"Alustriel\u0027s wizards\u0027ll be working more on the wall for the next days. I\u0027m wanting an army here afore the work\u0027s even begun on the bridge again. I\u0027m wanting Alustriel to see Felbarr side-by-side with Mithral Hall, that when we\u0027re walking out that gate, she\u0027ll know the time for talkin\u0027s over and the time for fightin\u0027s come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" Jackonray replied, nodding, a smile spreading on his hairy and toothy face. \"So I\u0027m seeing why Bruenor\u0027s the king. Ye\u0027ve got me respect, good King Bruenor, and ye\u0027ve got me word that I\u0027ll shove King Emerus out the durned tunnel door meself if it\u0027s needin\u0027 to be!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re a good dwarf.

All around Bruenor, dwarves began to chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never let it be said that a Battlehammer don\u0027t know a good joke when he\u0027s seein\u0027 one,\" Bruenor remarked, and the chuckles turned to laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackonray and Nikwillig left in a rush, giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let Alustriel play a part in her own trap,\" Bruenor said to Cordio, Thibble dorf, and Banak Brawnanvil, who had a specially designed throne right beside Bruenor\u0027s own, a place of honor for the heroic leader who had been crippled in the orc assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suren she\u0027s to be scrunching up her pretty face,\" Banak said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Mithral Hall and Citadel Adbar march right past her working wizards, to be sure,\" Bruenor agreed. \"But she\u0027ll be seeing, too, that the time\u0027s past hiding from Obould\u0027s dogs. He\u0027s wantin\u0027 a fight and we\u0027re for givin\u0027 him one - one that\u0027ll take him all the way back where he came from, and beyond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room erupted in cheering, and Banak reached out to grab Bruenor\u0027s offered hand, clasping tight in a shake of mutual respect and determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye stay here and take the rest o\u0027 the audiences,\" Bruenor instructed Banak. \"I\u0027m for seeing Rumblebelly and the littler one. There\u0027s clues in them scrolls we brought back, or I\u0027m a bearded gnome, and I\u0027m wantin\u0027 all the tricks and truths we can muster afore we strike out against Obould.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hopped down from his throne and from the dais, motioning for Cordio to follow and for Thibble dorf to stand as Banak\u0027s second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nanfoodle telled me that the runes on them scrolls weren\u0027t nothing he\u0027d e\u0027er seen,\" Cordio said to Bruenor as they started out of the audience chamber. \"Squiggles in places squiggles shouldn\u0027t be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The littler one\u0027ll straighten \u0027em out, don\u0027t ye doubt. As clever as any I\u0027ve ever seen, and a good friend o\u0027 the clan. Mirabar\u0027s lost a lot when Torgar and his boys come our way, and they lost a lot when Nanfoodle and Shoudra come looking for Torgar and his boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordio nodded his agreement and left it at that, following Bruenor down the corridors and stairwells to a small cluster of secluded rooms where Nanfoodle had set up his alchemy lab and library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one in the tribe knew if it had gotten its name through its traditional battle tactics, or if the succession of chieftains had fashioned the tactics to fit the name. Whatever the cause-effect, their peculiar battle posture had been perfected through generations. Indeed, the leaders of Wolf Jaw selected orcs at a young age based on size and speed to find the appropriate place in the formation each might best fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoosing the enemy and the battleground was more important even than that, if the dangerous maneuver was to work. And no orc in the tribe\u0027s history had been better at such tasks than the present chieftain, Dnark of the Fang. He was descended from a long line of point warriors, the tip of the fangs of the wolf jaw that snapped over its enemies. For years, young Dnark had spearheaded the top line of the V formation, sliding out along the left flank of an intended target, while another orc, often a cousin of Dnark\u0027s, led the right, or bottom, jaw. When the lines stretched to their limit, Dnark would swing his assault group to a sharp right, forming a fang, and he and his counterpart would join forces, sealing the escape route at the rear of the enemy formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs chieftain, though, Dnark anchored the apex. His jaws of warriors went out north and south of the small encampment, and when the signals came back to the chieftain, he led the initial assault, moving forward with his main battle group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did not charge, and did not holler and hoot. Instead, they approached calmly, as if nothing was amiss - and indeed, why would King Obould\u0027s shaman advisor suspect anything different?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camp did stir at the approach of so large a contingent, with calls for Nukkels to come forth from his tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUng-thol put his hand on Dnark\u0027s arm, urging restraint. \"We do not know his purpose,\" the shaman reminded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNukkels appeared a few moments later, moving to the eastern end of the small plateau he and his warriors had used for their pause. Beside him, Obould\u0027s powerful guards lifted heavy spears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow Dnark wanted to call for the charge! How he wanted to lead the way up the rocky incline to smash through those fools!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Ung-thol was there, reminding him, coaxing him to patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Praise to King Obould!\" Dnark called out, and he took his tribe\u0027s banner from an orc to the side and waved it around. \"We have word from Chieftain Grguch,\" he lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNukkels held up his hand, palm out at Dnark, warning him to hold back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no business with you,\" he called down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"King Obould does not share that belief,\" Dnark replied, and he began his march again, slowly. \"He has sent us to accompany you, as more assurance that Clan Karuck will not interfere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interfere with what?\" Nukkels shouted back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDnark glanced at Ung-thol, then back up the rise. \"We know where you are going,\" he bluffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Nukkels\u0027s turn to look around at his entourage. \"Come in alone, Chieftain Dnark,\" he called. \"That we might plot our next move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDnark kept moving up the slope, calm and unthreatening, and he did not bid his force to lag behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone!\" Nukkels called more urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDnark smiled, but otherwise changed not a thing. The orcs beside Nukkels lifted their spears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter. The bluff had played its part, allowing Dnark\u0027s core force to close nearly half the incline to Nukkels. Dnark held up his hands to Nukkels and the guards then turned to address his group - ostensibly to instruct them to wait there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill them all - except for Nukkels and the closest guards,\" he instructed instead, and when he turned back, he had his sword in hand, and he raised it high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warriors of Clan Wolf Jaw swept past him on either side, those nearest swerving to obstruct their enemies\u0027 view of their beloved chieftain. More than one of those shield orcs died in the next moments, as spears flew down upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the jaws of the wolf closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Dnark got up to the plateau, the fighting was heavy all around him and Nukkels was nowhere to be found. Angered by that, Dnark threw himself into the nearest battle, where a pair of his orcs attacked a single guard, wildly and ineffectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObould had chosen his inner circle of warriors well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the Wolf Jaw orcs stabbed in awkwardly with his spear, but the guard\u0027s sword swept across and shattered the hilt, launching it out to confuse the attacker\u0027s companion. With the opening clear, the guard retracted and stepped forward for the easy kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that Dnark came in fast from the side and hacked the fool\u0027s sword arm off at the elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard howled and half-turned, falling to its knees and clutching its stump. Dnark stepped in and grabbed it by the hair, tugging its head back, opening its neck for a killing strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd always before, the chieftain of Clan Wolf Jaw would have taken that strike, would have claimed that kill. But he held back his sword and kicked the guard in the throat instead, and as it fell away, he instructed his two warriors to make sure that the fallen enemy didn\u0027t die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he went on to the next fight in a long line of battles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the skirmish on the plateau ended, though, Shaman Nukkels was not to be found, either among the seven prisoners or the score of dead. He had gone off the back end at the first sign of trouble, so said witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Dnark could begin to curse that news, however, he found that his selections for the fangs of the formation had done his own legacy proud, for in they marched, Nukkels and a battered guard prodded before them with spears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obould will kill you for this,\" Nukkels said when presented before Dnark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDnark\u0027s left hook left the shaman squirming on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The symbol is correct,\" Nanfoodle proudly announced. \"The pattern is unmistakable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis stared at the large copy of the parchment, its runes separated and magnified. On Nanfoodle\u0027s instruction, the halfling had spent the better part of a day transcribing each mark to that larger version then the pair had spent several days cutting out wooden stencils for each - even for those that seemed to hold an obvious correlation to the current Dwarvish writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMistaking that tempting lure, accepting the obvious runes for what they supposed them to be, Dethek runes of an archaic orc tongue called Hulgorkyn, had been their downfall through all of their early translation attempts, and it wasn\u0027t until Nanfoodle had insisted that they treat the writing from the lost city as something wholly unrecognizable that the pair had begun to make any progress at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that was indeed what they were making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany other stencils had been crafted, multiple representations of every Dwarvish symbol. Then had come the trial and error - and error, and error, and error - for more than a day of painstaking rearranging and reevaluation. Nanfoodle, no minor illusionist, had cast many spells, and priests had been brought in to offer various auguries and inspired insights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-two separate symbols appeared on the parchment, and while a thorough statistical analysis had offered hints of potential correlations to the traditional twenty-six runes of Dethek, the fact that none of those promising hints added up to anything substantial made much of that analysis no more than guesswork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, though, patterns had taken shape, and spells seemed to confirm the best guesses time and time again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than a tenday into the work, an insight from Nanfoodle - after hearing all of Regis\u0027s stories of the strange city - proved to be the tipping point. Instead of using Dwarvish as his basis for the analysis, he decided upon a double-basis and began incorporating the Orcish tongue - in which, of course, he was fluent. More stencils were cut, more combinations explored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly one morning, Nanfoodle presented Regis with his completed conclusion for translation, a correlative identifying every symbol on the parchment, some that mirrored current Dwarvish or Orcish lettering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe halfling went to work over the transcribed, larger-lettered parchment, diligently placing above each symbol the stencil Nanfoodle believed correlative. Regis didn\u0027t pause at all to consider familiar patterns, but simply placed them all as fast as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he stepped back and stood up on the high bench Nanfoodle had placed beside the work table. The gnome was already there, staring back incredulously, his mouth hanging open, and when he took his place beside Nanfoodle, Regis understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the gnome\u0027s guesses had been correct, obviously, and the translation of the text was clear to see, and to read. It wasn\u0027t unknown for orcs to steal and incorporate Dethek runes, of course, as was most evident with Hulgorkyn. But there was something more than that, a willful blending of related but disparate languages in a balanced manner, one that indicated compromise and coordination between dwarf and orc linguists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe translation was laid bare for them to see. Digesting the words, however, proved more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bruenor won\u0027t like this,\" Regis remarked, and he glanced around as if expecting the dwarf king to crash into the room in a tirade at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is what it is,\" Nanfoodle replied. \"He will not like it, but he must accept it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis looked back at the translated paragraph and read again the words of the orc philosopher Duugee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You place too much value in reason,\" the halfling muttered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-orc-king-transitions-1/page-24.html","bookId":2187,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:14 PM"}
