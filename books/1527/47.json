Tucker signaled his dog, who lowered his haunches, readying to spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like the elevator dropped much farther than just one floor, but at last, the doors opened. Gray took a shooter’s stance and quickly inspected a small, utilitarian lobby, dimly lit and drab. He searched for any guards, but it appeared empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped out cautiously, leading the way. Hallways branched off, with color-designated lines painted on the floor, likely to direct the hotel staff toward kitchens, laundry facilities, maintenance closets, and storage spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like a maze down here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray waved everyone forward. “Tucker, have Kane hunt for Amanda’s trail. She could be anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker set to work with his partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray noted that two other elevators flanked this one. It seemed only three of the twelve elevators came down to this level. He had Kowalski hold their door open, in case they needed a fast exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall set of windows along one wall drew Gray’s attention. He moved closer and stared into a cavernous neighboring space. The room was encased in concrete and climbed two stories high. Inside sat a row of massive turbine generators, looking like oversize metal elephants. Control panels covered another wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The building’s power plant,” Seichan said, joining him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray remembered Jack Kirkland’s description of the tidal turbines that powered this building. This must be them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker came back after only a minute. “Nothing,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned around, surprised. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker shrugged. “Kane checked all of the hallways leading out from here. Found no sign of Amanda.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossible. She has to be down here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have him check again,” he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do it, but it’s a waste of time. I’ll vouch for Kane’s nose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s right,” Seichan argued. “Coming down here made sense, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only path. There are fifty other floors. The longer we wait …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more danger Amanda faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed heavily, conceding to the logic, but not happy about it. “Back upstairs, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others piled inside the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray paused at the threshold, staring at the two doors that flanked this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on.” He stepped over, pressed the call button, and summoned the other two elevators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” Seichan asked from inside the cage, as Kowalski continued to hold the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two elevators arrived. Gray inspected both cages. He returned to the others and studied the touch-screen display in their lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Seichan pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All three of these cages reach the service levels, so why did Amanda’s captors use the middle elevator? Human nature says they would have just gone to the one closest to the lobby.” Gray pointed to the first set of doors. “I checked those other two. This control panel is two inches longer than the others.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?” Kowalski asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan bent down and studied the lower section of the touch screen. “You think there are other buttons here, hidden ones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “Leading to restricted levels that only this elevator can reach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan searched the edges of the screen. “But I don’t see any keyholes or slots for pass cards to activate those levels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray hit the lobby button, sending the cage back up, demonstrating. “The screen is touch-sensitive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan got it, her eyes smiling. “It could be keyed to a fingerprint.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stepped back into the lobby as the doors opened. “The soldier who Kane took out. He looked like he was the head of the security escort from Africa. He might have been granted access below.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned to Kowalski.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man rolled his eyes and sulked out, mumbling under his breath, “Why do I get all the dirty work?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned a minute later, wiping a blade on his pants. He held out his hand. “I brought both. Just in case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResting on his palm were a thumb and a forefinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski also carried the dead man’s beret and tugged it on his head. “That guy was more my size,” he said and pointed toward the ceiling of the cage. “In case of any more cameras. I’m not playing prisoner again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray took the severed thumb, pressed it against the empty space below the LL button, and kept it there. He held his breath—then a new button bloomed to life under the thumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had any doubt before, it ended as that odd symbol appeared. Gray flashed to Somalia, to running across the abandoned camp toward the tent cabin. He remembered the same marking had been painted on the outside of the jungle hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crimson cross with tiny finial decorations along its crosspieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cage fell again, dropping much deeper now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski’s face had a sick tint to it. “How far down did these pirates bury their treasure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pictured the giant concrete pylons that supported the island. The outer ones were twenty meters across, but the centermost pylon, the one directly under Burj Abaadi, was far larger. He knew that it was not uncommon for the support pillars of oil platforms to have caissons engineered in them, hollow pockets used for storing oil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why not here, too? But instead of oil, an entire base could be hidden inside a pillar this huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray knew Amanda was down there. His doubt centered on a larger concern. It weighed heavily as they dropped like a rock toward the heart of the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs she still alive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:25 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Edward Blake watched the sheen of hatred fade from Amanda’s eyes as he injected the last of the propofol into her IV line. Her lids slid to half-mast, her breathing deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer last words had been a curse, a promise of revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will see you both in hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was an impotent threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda, the person, the loving mother, would be gone in a few more minutes. All sentience would be wiped away, leaving behind nothing but the most basic of functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should scrub up,” Petra said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nurse was already gowned and adjusting a monitor that showed Amanda’s CT scan. The young woman lay on a surgical table, draped from the neck down, her bald head gleaming under the surgical halogens overhead. Small blue markings decorated her scalp, like so much scientific nomenclature tattooed in place. The markings delineated the multiple drill sites and electrode insertion points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetra prepared the stereotactic system for the pending surgery. It integrated his surgical workstation with an intra-operative MRI and microscopy setup for visualization. She secured Amanda’s head inside a fluid-filled alignment cuff, a vast improvement from the older head frames that had to be screwed into a patient’s skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter working in the mountains of Somalia and having to deal with tools that seemed antiquated in comparison, Edward felt a surge of childish joy at having such fine equipment to play with. The station in Somalia had served its purpose for the past few years, allowing him to harvest eggs, embryos, and collect viable or promising subjects for the various other reproductive labs around the world. But he had always had larger ambitions. It was pure happenstance that Amanda Gant-Bennett had landed on his doorstep versus one of the many other reproductive facilities and egg-collection centers in India, Malaysia, Australia, or countless other points around the globe. It allowed him the opportunity to shine in the eyes of his superiors, to climb higher up that ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, besides a few hiccups, matters had been proceeding smashingly. Amanda’s death had been framed as an unfortunate encounter with Somali pirates; the child had been delivered and secured in the new high-tech research lab here; and after this last bloody bit of work, Amanda would be shipped off, no longer his problem, leaving him in peace to dissect and test the new research material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newborn slept in a small crib down the hall, waiting his turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut first, to attend to his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn array of surgical instruments shone brightly: drills, bone curettes, cranial rongeurs, scalpels, suction and irrigation tubing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t help but be excited. Though the technique had been developed here, he had only performed this procedure once. A few of the region’s reproductive scientists had been rotated through here to learn it. But it had been fairly easy. The right and left sides of the cerebral cortex were connected with a layer of neural tissue. Using the surgical imaging as guidance, he would first perform a procedure known as a corpus callosotomy, which cuts the brain into two halves. It was a radical technique originally developed to treat severe epileptics, to sever that wild flow of electricity through the brain, which caused seizures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second stage of the procedure was one developed by another of his superiors’ agencies. It was called α-ECT, or alpha-alternating electroconvulsive therapy. Electrodes would be permanently inserted into the two severed hemispheres. Small electric shocks of alternate polarity would be administered to those two halves. The resultant whirlwind of mini-seizures trapped within either cranial hemisphere, swirling in opposite polarities, caused total shutdown of the cerebral cortex, leaving only the brainstem functional, which continued to control such vital tasks as heart rate and rhythm, respiration, even gastrointestinal activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the body was left intact, but the mind was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA perfect tool for reproductive studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward glanced one last time toward Amanda’s prone form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter this, there would be no more Amanda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he exited the surgical suite for the scrub room, a chime sounded from a wall monitor overhead. It was a security feature of the station, announcing the arrival of the elevator. Every room had such a screen. A name scrolled across the bottom of the monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuggas Abdiwalli\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the captain of Edward’s personal security force. The screen showed a black-and-white view of the tops of helmets and a black beret. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-47.html","bookId":1527,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM"}
