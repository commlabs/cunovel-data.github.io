But he finds another job with a mysterious employer--someone with a brand-new Lear 45-- who\u0027s willing to pay Tuck generously and ask no questions about his record. The jet and job are on Alualu, a speck in the Pacific Ocean, and Tucker has nowhere else to go. But first he has to get to Alualu, and once there, he faces a hurricane, Shark People, atypical missionaries, and boredom ... and the responsibilities assigned to him by Capt. Vincent Bennidetti, U.S. Air Force, deceased bomber pilot and present-day deity of the Shark People. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/island-of-the-sequined-love-nun.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/island-of-the-sequined-love-nun.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:47 PM"}
