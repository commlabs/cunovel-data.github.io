I spun around and went into a clumsy karate stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, you’re out of shape, my inner voice reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Noehring was standing in front of me, a brilliant smile on his face. He enjoyed startling me. His hands were inside the pockets of his Italian wool overcoat. I had no idea what was in his hands inside his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jumpy, jumpy,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noehring,” I said as if pronouncing his name would placate my fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the third time we’ve met in the past three days. Once more and I’ll have you cited for harassment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not to worry, not to worry.” He removed his hands from his pockets, showing me that they were empty. “Just trying to make a point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What point is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can reach out to you anytime I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But bad for you.” Noehring smiled his Robert Redford smile again. “Just remember what I told you and it’ll all work out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must have checked on me. You can’t possibly believe I’m going to give you the ransom. You’re not that fucking stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tsk, tsk, tsk. Such language. You know, you should do a little research of your own before you make such an important decision. Ask for some advice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From whom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nina Truhler. Her daughter, Erica, too. Seems to me you’re sweet on both of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to die, Noehring?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled again. “All I want is the money,” he said. “I’ll get it, by hook or by crook. Think about it, McKenzie. Make it easy on yourself. And your friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned then and walked swiftly to the stairwell. He disappeared behind the door. I didn’t know if he went up or down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped behind the steering wheel of the Audi and gripped it tightly while I fought my anger, telling myself to relax, relax, breathe, breathe. It was difficult. Noehring had threatened Nina and Erica. It was a calculated risk on his part because if he had indeed checked me out, he would know that I would kill for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started the Audi and sat for a moment, listening to the engine purr while I pondered the same question I had asked myself the day before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How the hell did he know I was here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillard had no trouble following me to Rickie’s, and we entered the club together. I suggested a booth, but he liked the bar, so we pulled up a couple of stools and sat. Jenness Crawford was spelling the regular bartender, and after greeting us, she asked for our drink preferences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s get this settled right now,” Gillard said. He tapped his chest with both hands. “Everything is on me. McKenzie’s money is no good here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie’s money has never been good here,” Jenness said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My girlfriend owns the place,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s wonderful,” Gillard said. He looked directly into Jenness’s eyes. “You are lovely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenness blushed. She knew she was blushing and brought her hands to her cheeks to hide it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That may be so,” I said, “but Jenness is not my girlfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even better,” Gillard said. He stood on the rungs of the stool and leaned over the bar, his hand extended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, I’m Jeremy Gillard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenness returned the handshake. “I’m Jenness Crawford,” she said. “Pleased to meet you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The pleasure is all mine,” Gillard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the dance began, the two of them taking turns trying to outflirt each other. I might have been amused by the exchange except I kept thinking about Noehring and what he had said. Somehow my Summit Ale was served without my noticing. I took a long pull and wondered, how many times have I put Nina in danger? Just that once, I reminded myself, but that was already once too often, and I had vowed to never do it again. Now this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy frustration must have shown on my face, because when Nina came out of her office and saw me sitting at the bar she asked, “What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, that’s just my friend McKenzie psyching himself up for the big game like any great athlete,” Gillard said. “See the ball, be the ball.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What big game?” Nina asked. “Who are you? Never mind. McKenzie. McKenzie, you’re going after the Lily, aren’t you? You said you weren’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you know about the Jade Lily?” Gillard asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is my boss, Nina Truhler,” Jenness told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alrighty then,” Gillard said. “You’re McKenzie’s squeeze. I get it now. This is a great joint you have here, Nina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina ignored him. “McKenzie,” she said, “I thought you said you were washing your hands of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some unscrupulous types appealed to his benevolent nature,” Gillard said. “They also doubled his fee. Hi, I’m Jerry Gillard. I own the Lily.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/curse-of-the-jade-lily-mac-mckenzie-9/page-35.html","bookId":2218,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:54 PM"}
