Her lips drew back in a rictus of terror, her eyes looked beyond Granny, beyond the world, towards something else. One knuckled hand flew to her mouth and she made a little whimpering noise. She froze, like a rabbit that has just seen a stoat and knows, without any doubt, that it is the last stoat that it will ever see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What have you done to her?\u0027 said Magrat, the first to dare to speak.

There\u0027s a little trick to it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave Magrat a condescending smile. \u0027I\u0027ll show you one day, if you like.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagrat thought about it. \u0027It\u0027s horrible,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nonsense,\u0027 Granny smiled terribly. \u0027Everyone wants to know their true self. Now, she does.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sometimes you have to be kind to be cruel,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg approvingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I think it\u0027s probably the worst thing that could happen to anyone,\u0027 said Magrat, as the duchess swayed backwards and forwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027For goodness\u0027 sake use your imagination, girl,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027There are far worse things.

Stuff with pliers.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Red-hot knives up the jacksie,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Handle first, too, so you cut your fingers trying to pull them out—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This is simply the worst that I can do,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax primly. \u0027It\u0027s all right and proper, too. A witch should act like that, you know. There\u0027s no need for any dramatic stuff. Most magic goes on in the head. It\u0027s headology. Now, if you\u0027d—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA noise like a gas leak escaped from the duchess\u0027s lips. Her head jerked back suddenly. She opened her eyes, blinked, and focused on Granny. Sheer hatred suffused her features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Guards!\u0027 she said. \u0027I told you to take them!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny\u0027s jaw sagged. \u0027What?\u0027 she said. \u0027But – but I showed you your true self . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m supposed to be upset by that, am I?\u0027 As the soldiers sheepishly grabbed Granny\u0027s arms the duchess pressed her face close to Granny\u0027s, her tremendous eyebrows a V of triumphant hatred. \u0027I\u0027m supposed to grovel on the floor, is that it? Well, old woman, I\u0027ve seen exactly what I am, do you understand, and I\u0027m proud of it! I\u0027d do it all again, only hotter and longer! I enjoyed it, and I did it because I wanted to!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thumped the vast expanse of her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You gawping idiots!\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re so weak. You really think that people are basically decent underneath, don\u0027t you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd on the stage backed away from the sheer force of her exultation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, I\u0027ve looked underneath,\u0027 said the duchess. \u0027I know what drives people. It\u0027s fear. Sheer, deep-down fear. There\u0027s not one of you who doesn\u0027t fear me, I can make you widdle your drawers out of terror, and now I\u0027m going to take—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point Nanny Ogg hit her on the back of the head with the cauldron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She does go on, doesn\u0027t she?\u0027 she said conversationally, as the duchess collapsed. \u0027She was a bit eccentric, if you ask me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, embarrassed silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny Weatherwax coughed. Then she treated the soldiers holding her to a bright, friendly smile, and pointed to the mound that was now the duchess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Take her away and put her in a cell somewhere,\u0027 she commanded. The men snapped to attention, grabbed the duchess by her arms, and pulled her upright with considerable difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Gently, mind,\u0027 said Granny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her hands together and turned to Tomjon, who was watching her with his mouth open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Depend on it,\u0027 she hissed. \u0027Here and now, my lad, you don\u0027t have a choice. You\u0027re the King of Lancre.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But I don\u0027t know how to be a king!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We all seed you! You had it down just right, including the shouting.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s just acting!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Act, then. Being a king is, is—\u0027 Granny hesitated, and snapped her fingers at Magrat. \u0027What do you call them things, there\u0027s always a hundred of them in anything?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagrat looked bewildered. \u0027Do you mean per cents?\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Them,\u0027 agreed Granny. \u0027Most of the per cents in being a king is acting, if you ask me. You ought to be good at it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomjon looked for help into the wings, where Hwel should have been. The dwarf was in fact there, but he wasn\u0027t paying much attention. He had the script in front of him, and was rewriting furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBUT I ASSURE YOU, YOU ARE NOT DEAD. TAKE IT FROM ME.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe duke giggled. He had found a sheet from somewhere and had draped it over himself, and was sidling along some of the castle\u0027s more deserted corridors. Sometimes he would go \u0027whoo-oo\u0027 in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis worried Death. He was used to people claiming that they were not dead, because death always came as a shock, and a lot of people had some trouble getting over it. But people claiming that they were dead with every breath in their body was a new and unsettling experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I shall jump out on people,\u0027 said the duke dreamily. \u0027I shall rattle my bones all night, I shall perch on the roof and foretell a death in the house—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT\u0027S BANSHEES.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I shall if I want,\u0027 said the duke, with a trace of earlier determination. \u0027And I shall float through walls, and knock on tables, and drip ectoplasm on anyone I don\u0027t like. Ha. Ha.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT WON\u0027T WORK. LIVING PEOPLE ARENT ALLOWED TO BE GHOSTS. I\u0027M SORRY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe duke made an unsuccessful attempt to float through a wall, gave up, and opened a door out on to a crumbling section of the battlements. The storm had died away a bit, and a thin rind of moon lurked behind the clouds like a ticket tout for eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath stalked through the wall behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well then,\u0027 said the duke, \u0027if I\u0027m not dead, why are you here?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumped up on to the wall and flapped his sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWAITING.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wait forever, bone face!\u0027 said the duke triumphantly. \u0027I shall hover in the twilight world, I shall find some chains to shake, I shall—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped backwards, lost his balance, landed heavily on the wall and slid. For a moment the remnant of his right hand scrabbled ineffectually at the stonework, and then it vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath is obviously potentially everywhere at the same time, and in one sense it is no more true to say that he was on the battlements, picking vaguely at non-existent particles of glowing metal on the edge of his scythe blade, than that he was waist-deep in the foaming, rock-toothed waters in the depths of Lancre gorge, his calcareous gaze sweeping downwards and stopping abruptly at a point where the torrent ran a few treacherous inches over a bed of angular pebbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while the duke sat up, transparent in the phosphorescent waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I shall haunt their corridors,\u0027 he said, \u0027and whisper under the doors on still nights.\u0027 His voice grew fainter, almost lost in the ceaseless roar of the river. \u0027I shall make basket chairs creak most alarmingly, just you wait and see.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath grinned at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNOW YOU\u0027RE TALKING.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt started to rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamtop rain has a curiously penetrative quality which makes ordinary rain seem almost arid.

Outside, the rushing of the rain even drowned out the distant roar of the river. It soaked the stage.
