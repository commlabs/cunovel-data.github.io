{"id":46192,"no":875,"title":"Chapter 873: Xiaochun?","content":"\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s mind was almost a complete blank. He didn’t dare to descend into reminiscence. Instead, he focused on one thing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Li… you \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to be alive….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxiety gripped his heart, profound nervousness generated, not from fear for himself, but from the possibility that he might hear news that could crush him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMental pressure began to mount, and his cultivation base was going crazy. All of the anxiety and madness swirled together, making a cyclone that dimmed heaven and earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun moved so fast that not even Bruiser could keep up. He shot through the air alone, leaving thunderous sonic booms behind him as he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive sound caused by his passage attracted the attention of local cultivator clans, small-scale sects, and city after city. Everyone looked up in shock, and yet, they couldn’t see Bai Xiaochun! They only saw a long wound-like streak appear above them in the sky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless gasps and exclamations of shock filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that sound?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The sky… is being ripped open?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, the streak he left behind really did look like a rift opening up in the sky!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime ticked by. In the end, it took less time than an incense stick takes to burn. In his rage and anxiety, Bai Xiaochun appeared… in the mountains containing the Dao River Court!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sect headquarters was made of seven mountain peaks, each one a different color!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the routing of the three sects back on the battlefield had happened so quickly, the Dao River Court in general wasn’t fully aware of what had happened. In fact, most of them didn’t even know that their patriarch had lost his fleshly body. Only a few people had been informed, who then ordered that the sect’s grand spell formation be activated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, when Bai Xiaochun arrived, he saw a glittering light shield surrounding the sect, preventing anyone from entering!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a powerful shield which radiated intense pressure. After all… it was the grand spell formation of the number one sect in the Middle Reaches cultivation world of the eastern Heavenspan River!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no matter how powerful that spell formation was, it couldn’t compare to the spell formation that had protected the former Great Wall. Bai Xiaochun’s Undying Hex had been able to pierce through that spell formation, and therefore, this trifling formation belonging to a Middle Reaches sect couldn’t possibly do anything to him, not even if it had been created by a deva!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun didn’t slow down for even a moment. In fact, he sped up. Rumbling sounds filled the air as he bore down on the Dao River Court, which currently housed several tens of thousands of cultivators who hadn’t been mobilized during the war. That group included three Nascent Soul experts and many in the Core Formation stage. When they saw something streaking toward them through the sky, their eyes went wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The sky… is being ripped open? But how?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on? That rift is actually heading right toward us!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one in the group, not even the Nascent Soul experts, were able to see Bai Xiaochun. He was moving too quickly! The only thing they could see was that rift being slashed open in the sky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as they began to cry out in alarm, the rift reached the grand spell formation. And yet, bizarrely, the spell formation didn’t react at all. There wasn’t even the slightest ripple! Bai Xiaochun pierced right through it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the power of the Undying Hex!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he was inside the Dao River Court, he slammed into one of the mountains, causing the sky to tremble and the land to vibrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRRRUUUUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mountain immediately began to crumble, with countless bits of rock and rubble showering down. Tens of thousands of cultivators dashed out of the way, crying out in alarm. Only at this point did the figure which had previously been impossible to see suddenly become clear in midair above the crumbling mountain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he hovered there, terrifying fluctuations rolled out, as well as a massive vortex which seemed capable of destroying the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disciples of the Dao River Court gasped and trembled. Even the Nascent Soul cultivators were shaking in nervousness. However, this was their sect headquarters, so no matter how scared they were, they had to brace themselves and attack. Instantly, countless beams of light that represented magical techniques began to slash through the air toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, deadly beams of light shot from the other mountain peaks in his direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get the hell out of my way!!” Bai Xiaochun roared, waving his hands out in front of him. A blast of wind spread out in all directions, slamming into the beams of light and magical techniques. All of them were crushed as easily as dried weeds, and yet, the blast of wind didn’t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sect headquarters trembled, and blood sprayed out of the mouths of countless disciples. Screams echoed out as they fell back, and yet, before they could get anywhere, Bai Xiaochun’s divine sense shot out. In the blink of an eye, it filled the entire Dao River Court. Not even restricted areas and places locked down by spell formations were able to remain hidden. It was at this point that, deep underground beneath the Dao River Court… he found Li Qinghou’s aura!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, in a dank dungeon beneath the sect, were numerous prisoners, one of whom was the unconscious Li Qinghou… who appeared to be gasping on the verge of death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bai Xiaochun saw that Li Qinghou was still alive, he breathed a sigh of relief. However, it was then that he realized what bad shape Li Qinghou was in, and his rage mounted. Without the slightest hesitation, he blurred into motion, unleashing a fist strike directly at the ground!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrevices snaked out as the earth was ripped open. Numerous Dao River Court disciples were sent tumbling away from the force of the blow, their minds reeling and their hearts shivering in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is that?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s Bai Xiaochun. He’s the one… who beat the three devas! He killed one, devastated the other, and sent the third running away!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, what is he doing here…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun had already destroyed one of the seven mountains that comprised the sect headquarters. Now, his blow caused a second mountain to be ripped up and transformed into rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, Bai Xiaochun realized that one of the strange features of the Dao River Court’s headquarters was its unusually thick ground. The seven mountain peaks of the sect were all connected at the base, which meant that to get to the underground area, all of the mountains had to be destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was in no mood to go about it one at a time. Rapidly performing an incantation gesture, he let out a shout, utilizing the Living Mountain Incantation to cause countless rocks in the area to rush toward him and transform him into a gigantic stone golem!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stone golem’s face looked exactly like Bai Xiaochun\u0027s! Without the slightest hesitation, he unleashed a second fist strike, which shattered more of the lands below. At the same time, two of the remaining five mountains began to collapse. Cries of alarm and terror filled the air as countless disciples fled in terror, unwilling to stay behind in their own sect headquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they fled, Bai Xiaochun let out a shout that caused the sky to distort. A third fist strike landed like a meteor falling from the heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOOOOOOOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining three mountain peaks collapsed amidst deafening rumbling sounds. The Dao River Court… had been reduced to rubble!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the time Bai Xiaochun arrived until the deed was done, not even sixty breaths of time had passed!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, the only thing that remained in the ground was a massive crater!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bottom of that crater was the Dao River Court’s dungeon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout pausing for a moment, Bai Xiaochun blurred into motion, vanished, and then reappeared outside of Li Qinghou’s cell!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intense noise from moments ago caused Li Qinghou’s eyes to flutter open. His aura was profoundly weak as he looked over at Bai Xiaochun. When he saw who it was, his eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiaochun?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-872\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-874\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-873","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
