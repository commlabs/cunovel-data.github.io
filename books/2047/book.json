Between scenes of punks bowling frozen turkeys on the graveyard shift in a supermarket, or snapping turtles loose in a loft and gnawing on designer shoes, this novel has comic charm to spare. But it also packs an appealingly downbeat message about the consumer culture: Becoming a vampire has given the twentysomething heroine \"a crampless case of rattlesnake PMS\"--a grumpy mood in which she realizes that she can dress to the nines as a \"Donner Party Barbie\" and still end up disillusioned and unhappy, just another slacker doing her own laundry and watching sucky TV \u0027til the sun rises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/bloodsucking-fiends-a-love-story-a-love-story-1.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/bloodsucking-fiends-a-love-story-a-love-story-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:43:37 PM"}
