I’m only here for two more days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the ground, his palms flat on the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to swallow but couldn’t, my speech turning shaky. “There’s something I need to tell—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that I don’t want you.” His voice was soft, and he didn’t look at me when he spoke. “I lied, earlier, when I said I was protecting you.” His chin came up and we stared at each other across the room. “I’m protecting myself.” He took a visible breath, his chest rising and falling. “I don’t want to be your rebound, Jacqueline.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory of Operation Bad Boy Phase crashed into me. Erin and Maggie had hatched the plan for me to use Lucas to get over Kennedy, as though he had no feelings of his own, and I’d gone along with it. I had no idea then that he’d been watching me the whole semester. That once we began talking, his interest would grow stronger. That finally, he would feel the need to turn away from me because of the depth of those feelings, not because he felt nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why are you assuming that role?” I unfolded myself from the tight little ball I’d become in the corner of his sofa, and walked across the room, slowly. “It’s not what I want, either.” As I approached, he remained frozen in place, sucking the ring on his lower lip into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStraightening, he stared down at me as though he thought I might disappear in front of his eyes. His hands came up to cup my face. “What am I gonna do with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirked up at him. “I can think of a couple of things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother’s name was Rosemary. She went by Rose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis disclosure brought me back to earth. Lying pressed to his side, I’d been distractedly tracing the dark red petals over his heart, wondering how to tell him what I knew. Or if. “You did this in memory of her?” A lump stuck in my throat as my finger outlined the stem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” His voice was low and weighty in the dark room. He was so heavy with secrets that I couldn’t imagine how he survived it day after day, never sharing the burden with anyone. “And the poem on my left side. She wrote it. For my dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes stung. No wonder his father had shut down. From what Dr. Heller told me, Ray Maxfield was a logical, analytical person. His only emotional exception must have been his wife. “She was a poet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head on his arm, I watched his ghost smile appear in profile, and it looked different from that angle. His face was scruffy, unshaved, and several places on my body boasted the slightly chafed evidence of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Usually, she was a painter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought to ignore my conscience, which wouldn’t quit babbling that I should tell him what I knew. That I owed him the truth. “So she’s responsible for those artist genes all mixed up with your engineering parts, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning onto his side, he echoed, “Engineering parts? Which parts might that be?” A mischievous smile tugged at his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched a brow and he kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have any of her paintings?” My fingers followed an orbit around the rose, and the hard muscle beneath it flexed with my touch. Pressing my hand to his skin, I absorbed the measured thump-thump of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah… but they’re either in storage, or displayed in the Heller’s place, since they were close friends of my parents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your dad isn’t still friends with them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, watching my face. “He is. They were my ride home at Thanksgiving. They can’t get him to come here, so every other year, they all go there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about my parents and the friends and neighbors with whom they socialized. “My parents don’t have any friends close enough to be incorporated into actual holidays.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared up at the ceiling. “They were all really close—before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grief was so tangible. I knew in that moment that he’d not worked through it—not at all in the eight years it had been. His protective wall had become a fortress holding him hostage rather than giving sanctuary. He might never fully recover from the horror of what happened that night, but there had to be a point where it wouldn’t consume him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucas, I need to tell you something.” His heart drummed under my hand, slow and steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than shifting his gaze to me, he didn’t move, but I felt his withdrawal as he waited. I assured myself that the disconnection was all in my mind—a product of my guilt and nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to know how you lost your mother, and I could tell it upset you to talk about it. So… I looked online for her obituary.” My breathing went shallow as the seconds ticked by and he said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he spoke, and his voice was undeniably flat and cold. “Did you find your answer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, but my voice was a whisper. “Yes.” I couldn’t hear myself over the rapid thud of my heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted his eyes from me and lay back, biting his lip, hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s one more thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inhaled and exhaled, staring at the ceiling, waiting for my next confession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and blurted it out. “I talked to Dr. Heller about it—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” His body was like rock against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucas, I’m sorry if I invaded your privacy—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If?” He shot up, unable to look at me, and I sat, pulling the covers up with me. “Why would you go talk to him? Weren’t the gory details in the news reports sickening enough for you? Or personal enough?” He pulled on his boxers and jeans, his movements rough. “Did you want to know how she looked when they found her? How she’d bled out? How even when my dad ripped out the carpet with his bare hands—” he exhaled harshly “—there was a yard-wide circle of bloodstained flooring underneath that couldn’t be sanded deep enough to get it all?” His voice broke and he stopped talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn shock and out of words, I could hardly breathe. He sat on the edge of the bed, silent, his head in his hands. He was so close that I could have reached out to stroke the cross that ran along his spine, but I didn’t dare. I scooted carefully from the bed and got dressed. I pulled on my UGGs and walked to stand at the foot of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis elbows pressed into his thighs, his hands obscuring his face like blinders. I stared at the dark hair grazing his shoulders, the flexed muscles of his arm and the ink circling his bicep and flowing down his forearm, his beautiful, lean torso and the words etched into his side like a brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want me to leave?” I surprised myself, uttering the words with a steady voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know why I thought he would say no, or say nothing. I was wrong, either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears started flowing then, but he couldn’t see them. He didn’t move from his position on the bed. I couldn’t even be angry, because I’d crossed a line and I knew it, and meaning well wasn’t good enough. I grabbed my purse and keys from the kitchen table and my coat from the sofa, ears pricked for the sound of him coming after me, telling me to stay. There was nothing but silence from his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened the door, Francis shot inside, along with a burst of cold air. I pulled the door shut behind me before a sob broke free. Gulping the frigid air and wondering how I’d managed to screw this up so thoroughly, I was determined not to cry until I was in my truck. I slid my hand along the railing as I rushed clumsily down the steps, because I couldn’t see through the combination of a moonless night and my tears. A splinter pierced my hand two steps from the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ow! Dammit.” The physical pain provided the ideal excuse for the sobbing to start. I sprinted down the long, curved driveway, unsuccessful in my attempt to curb my tears long enough to get into the truck. “Damn. Damn. Damn. Fuck.” I jammed my key into the lock by feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDéjà vu. That was the first thing I thought when I felt myself propelled across the bench seat. That was where the resemblance ended, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuck shut the door behind him and slapped the automatic lock. His weight immobilized my lower legs and he had my left wrist in his hand before I could make out who he was, though I knew. “Good enough to spread your legs for anybody but me, huh Jackie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my back, with my head at an awkward angle against the passenger door, I jerked at my arm and struggled without success to move my legs. “Get off!” I yelled the words, knowing they would be meaningless to him. I was parked in the street—too far for anyone else to hear me. “Get out of my truck!” I’d dropped my keys onto the truck floor when he’d shoved me into the truck, and I searched the floor with my right hand, intending to use them as a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so.” He grabbed my right wrist and shook his head like he could read my mind. “You’re not going anywhere until we’re done talking. You and your lying cunt friend have ruined my fucking life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, I heard Ralph’s voice in my head. Your body is already a weapon. You just need to know how to use it. Abruptly, I stopped struggling and took stock: I couldn’t kick. I could possibly get my wrists free by rotating and jerking them straight down, but then what? He would just grab me again, immobilize me further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed him closer—the last thing I would naturally seek. I turned my eyes away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to me when I’m talking to you, goddammit!” He grabbed my chin roughly, his fingers digging in as he leaned over me and forced me to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight hand free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile shoving my hand between us, grabbing and twisting his balls and yanking up as hard as I could, I slammed my forehead into his nose with as much force as I could manage in a straight upward trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night in the frat parking lot, everything had happened so quickly that getting my bearings was impossible until it was over. This time, everything was in slow motion—so for an impossibly stretched space of time, I was positive that nothing I’d just done had worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he screamed, and his nose started gushing. I had never seen so much blood so close-up. It poured out of him as though I’d opened a faucet full-blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeft hand free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was listing to the side. Still yanking up on his balls, I raised my left knee and turned into him, shoving his shoulder with my left hand. He fell sideways into the cramped crevice in front of my truck’s bench seat. The feeling rushed back into my legs, tremors wracking through me, and I went for the door, shoving it open so violently that it almost bounced all the way back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust before I cleared the door, his right hand shot out and grabbed my wrist, like the never-quite-dead psycho in a horror movie. I spun and smashed my fist down on the sensitive spot on his upper forearm, inches down from his the crook of his arm, and he released me, bellowing angrily and attempting to flail himself into an upright position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t wait to see if he succeeded. I vaulted from my truck and ran. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/easy-contours-of-the-heart-1/page-37.html","bookId":2743,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM"}
