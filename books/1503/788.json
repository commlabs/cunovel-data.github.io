Although the Heavenly Demon Sect had suffered such a calamity, they still had a third of their power. Especially since they still had this Demonic Emperor, a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, they were still a force to be reckoned with. As long as the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue still lived, who would dare say that the Heavenly Demon Sect had truly been exterminated?

All I hope is that once you inherit the position of Heavenly Demon Sect Master, you can lead the Heavenly Demon Sect to grow back to a position of power. At the same time, I hope that your future child with Hanyue will inherit the Heavenly Demon Sect in the future as well. Those are my two simple requests, and I do not need you to do anything else.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe two requests that Wu Yunyue had brought up were flawless and impeccable indeed, almost exactly the same as the conditions that Zhou Weiqing had proposed to Shangguan Tianyang previously in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. The only difference was that Wu Yunyue actually wanted to pass the entire Great Saint Land to him, while on the Heaven’s Expanse Palace end, Zhou Weiqing had been forced into action. One could just imagine the sheer difference between the two.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile as he said: “Senior, you think too highly of me.

In truth, before I actually met you, I was still very hesitant about this decision of mine. However, now I can set my resolve with ease. In the first place, you have the Demonic Attribute, and it is even the purest first generation Demonic Attribute. I believe that with the Heavenly Demon Sect in your hands, it can only grow stronger. At least, it will be far better than heading towards destructions in my hands. If you are willing to be the Heavenly Demon Sect Master, I am willing to be your assistant. At the same time, I can guarantee that all your orders will definitely be obeyed by everyone in the Heavenly Demon Sect, myself included.

At this point, Little Witch slowly raised her head, her eyes, still red from sobbing, subconsciously look at him… and he could clearly see the hope in them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf Zhou Weiqing really accepted the Heavenly Demon Sect, that would mean she truly had a chance. The past few years had not been kind to her at all. Ever since that time when Zhou Weiqing had taken her, she had been waiting for him to go look for her. Alas, she had not even seen a trace of him. Little Witch also understood that he definitely had many things to take care off, and thus even though she was so agitated that she cried upon seeing him, she did not truly blame him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHaving grown up in a Great Saint Lands, she naturally knew what was most important to a man like him.

As long as you are willing to be the Sect Master, that means the entire Heavenly Demon Sect will be fully joining the Heavenly Bow Empire. I am sure that this is of extreme importance to you as well. If you have any other requests, you can also bring it up now.” In truth, Wu Yunyue did not have any other choice. This was actually a very intelligent choice. On the surface, it might seem like he was just giving away the Heavenly Demon Sect, but this was the only way the Heavenly Demon Sect could truly survive.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf he passed on the Heavenly Demon Sect to other Great Saint Lands, then it would not be days before even last traces of the entire Heavenly Demon Sect would vanish. However, Zhou Weiqing was different. He was just a single person, at most with his Master, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor. Even after handing the reins over to Zhou Weiqing, Wu Yunyue would still have some influence. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing was definitely a young talent of limitless potential… a Heavenly King at twenty three years old! He had even heard from Ming Yu that he was able to fight against a Heavenly Emperor! Under his leadership, the Heavenly Demon Sect could only grow stronger.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFurthermore, there was the connection between Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch to consider, and if the child of his daughter and this young man were to inherit the Heavenly Demon Sect, then wouldn’t it still be eventually passing down to his own bloodline?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWu Yunyue did not hide his thoughts, and he had already stated things out explicitly.

Furthermore, should Zhou Weiqing chose to accept the Heavenly Demon Sect, his relationship with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain might turn tricky. Furthermore, it also meant he would now have to deal with the possibility of the Blood Red Hell turning their full attentions on them, with the possibility of being attacked at any time. All of these were pressures and burdens that would be extremely heavy for the current Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTaking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing looked at Wu Yunyue and said: “Senior, I can agree to your terms, but only on one condition.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt the side, Ming Yu couldn’t restrain himself as he said angrily: “The Sect Master is already giving you his position, what other conditions do you still want?

The reason why I want the Heavenly Demon Sect to change its name is not because of any personal desires, but for the sake of the Sect’s future. Have you ever wondered why all these years, the Heavenly Demon Sect could be discriminated against by the other Great Saint Lands, and most of the Heavenly Jewel Masters would shun the Sect, just upon hearing the name?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That is because our name contains the word ‘Demon’, especially with the rumours of the Demonic Attribute which have been greatly exaggerated.

The reason why the Heavenly Demon Sect had become a Great Saint Land in the past was because the first Demonic Emperor and Sect Master was the strongest power during his time.
