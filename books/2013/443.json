Fiddler, collect Gesler and Hellian and Urb-you’re the first four-and take your squads through. At a damned run if you please.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the grey light of early dawn, four figures emerged from a smear of blurred light twenty paces from the dead Azath Tower behind the Old Palace. As the portal swirled shut behind them, they stood, looking round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge gave Quick Ben a light push to one side, somewhere between comradely affection and irritation. ‘Told you, it’s reunion time, wizard.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where in Hood’s name are we?’ Quick Ben demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re in Letheras,’ Seren Pedac said. ‘Behind the Old Palace-but something’s wrong.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull Sengar wrapped his arms about himself, his face drawn with the pain of freshly healed wounds, his eyes filled with a deeper distress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge felt some of his anticipation dim like a dying oil lamp as he studied the Tiste Edur. The poor bastard. A brother murdered in front of his eyes. Then, the awkward goodbye with Onrack-joy and sadness there in plenty, seeing his old friend and the woman at his side-a woman Onrack had loved for so long. So long? Damned near incomprehensible, that’s how long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now-Trull Sengar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tiste Edur slowly looked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge shot Quick Ben a glance, then he said, ‘We’ve a mind to escort you and Seren. To her house.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This city is assailed,’ Trull Sengar said. ‘My youngest brother-the Emperor-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That can all wait,’ Hedge cut in. He paused, trying to figure out how to say what he meant, then said, ‘Your friend Onrack stole a woman’s heart, and it was all there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her eyes, I mean. The answer, that is. And if you’d look, just look, Trull Sengar, into the eyes of Seren Pedac, well-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For Hood’s sake,’ Quick Ben sighed. ‘He means you and Seren need to get alone before anything else, and we’re going to make sure that happens. All right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surprise on Seren Pedac’s face was almost comical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Trull Sengar then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge regarded Quick Ben once again. ‘You recovered enough in case we walk into trouble?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Something your sharpers can’t handle? Yes, probably. Maybe. Get a sharper in each hand, Hedge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good enough… since you’re a damned idiot,’ Hedge replied. ‘Seren Pedac-you should know, I’m well envious of this Tiste Edur here, but anyway. Is your house far?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, it is not, Hedge of the Bridgeburners.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then let’s get out of this spooky place.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilts swirled up round his feet, spun higher, engulfing his shins, then whirled away like smoke on the current. Strange pockets of luminosity drifted past, morphing as if subjected to unseen pressures in this dark, unforgiving world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruthen Trana, who had been sent to find a saviour, walked an endless plain, the silts thick and gritty. He stumbled against buried detritus, tripped on submerged roots. He crossed current-swept rises of hardened clay from which jutted polished bones of long-dead leviathans. He skirted the wreckage of sunken ships, the ribs of the hulls splayed out and cargo scattered about. And as he walked, he thought about his life and the vast array of choices he had made, others he had refused to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wife, no single face to lift into his mind’s eye. He had been a warrior for what seemed all his life. Fighting alongside blood kin and comrades closer than any blood kin. He had seen them die or drift away. He had, he realized now, watched his entire people pulled apart. With the conquest, with the cold-blooded, anonymous nightmare that was Lether. As for the Letherii themselves, no, he did not hate them. More like pity and yes, compassion, for they were as trapped in the nightmare as anyone else. The rapacious desperation, the gnawing threat of falling, of drowning beneath the ever-rising, ever-onrushing torrent that was a culture that could never look back, could not even slow its headlong plunge into some gleaming future that-if it came at all-would ever only exist for but a privileged few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis eternal seabed offered its own commentary, and it was one that threatened to drag him down into the silts, enervated beyond all hope of continuing, of even moving. Cold, crushing, this place was like history’s own weight-history not of a people or a civilization, but of the entire world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was he still walking? What saviour could liberate him from all of this? He should have remained in Letheras. Free to launch an assault on Karos Invictad and his Patriotists, free to annihilate the man and his thugs. And then he could have turned to the Chancellor. Imagining his hands on Triban Gnol’s throat was most satisfying-for as long as the image lasted, which was never long enough. A bloom of silts up into his eyes, another hidden object snagging his foot. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-443.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
