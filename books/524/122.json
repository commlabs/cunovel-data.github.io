{"id":21373,"no":122,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"It was not the first time death had visited Reuben, but it was the first time death had touched him. His father\u0027s death, his mother\u0027s, George\u0027s, Albert\u0027s, had all somehow seemed much more distant than this very distant death in Africa. Even Naomi\u0027s had not impressed him so much with sorrow for her loss as sorrow for the inadequacy of her life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But David\u0027s death struck home. David and William were the only two children whom he had really loved. They were his hope, his future. Once again he tasted the agonies of bereaved fatherhood, with the added tincture of hopelessness. He would never again see David\u0027s brown, strong, merry face, hear his voice, build plans for him. For some days the paternal feeling was so strong that he craved for his boy quite apart from Odiam, just for himself. It had taken eighty years and his son\u0027s death to make a father of him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An added grief was the absence of a funeral. Reuben did not feel this as the relief it would have been to some. He had given handsome and expensive funerals to those not half so dear as this young man who had been hurried into his soldier\u0027s grave on the lonely veldt. In course of time William sent him a snapshot of the place, with its little wooden cross. Reuben dictated a tremendously long letter through Maude the dairy-woman, in which he said he wanted a marble head-stone put up, and \"of Odiam, Sussex,\" added to the inscription.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The neighbourhood pitied him in his loss. There was indeed something rather pathetic about this old man of eighty, who had lost nearly all his kith and kin, yet now tasted bereavement for the first time. They noticed that he lost some of the erectness which had distinguished him, the corners of his mouth drooped, and his[Pg 418] hair, though persistently thick, passed from iron grey to a dusty white.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One day when he was walking through the village he heard a woman say as he passed—\"There he goes! I pity un, poor old man!\" The insult went into him like a knife. He turned round and gave the woman his fiercest scowl. Old indeed! Had one ever heard of such a thing! old!—and he could guide the plough and dig furrows in the marl, and stack, and reap with any of \u0027em. Old!—why, he was only—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e —He was eighty. He suddenly realised that, after all, he was old. He did not carry himself as erectly as he had used; there were pains and stiffness in his limbs and rheumatic swellings in his joints. His hair was white, and his once lusty arms were now all shrivelled skin and sinew, with the ossified veins standing out hard and grey. He was what Harry was always calling himself—\"only a poor old man\"—a poor old man who had lost his son, whom cottage women pitied from their doorsteps—and be hemmed to them, the sluts!\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59494.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:30 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:30 PM"}
