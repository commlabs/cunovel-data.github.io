Late-comers had to stumble in the dark up the last flight of stairs, and bark their shins over the brooms and pails which Beatrice invariably left standing about on the landing. One evening in April Lettice was sitting at work, brow buried in her hands, tensely courting the Muse, when she was startled by a sudden tremendous clatter. The door burst open and Denis fell into the room, in company with a mop and a banister brush.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dear, dear!\" said Lettice with her usual inadequacy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish you\u0027d not keep an ironmonger\u0027s shop on your landing,\" said Denis, annoyed, and rubbing his knee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You, you—you are so violent!\" Lettice protested in her pianissimo drawl. She went outside for a moment. \"There, I\u0027ve put them all away in the cupboard, so you won\u0027t have to break your poor nose when you go home,\" she consoled him. \"Now, how nice it is to see you again!

How many months was it since he had last filled that place? Lettice had not so much as seen him since the Olympia day; but neither by word nor look did she remind him of the gap. She was an adept at taking things for granted. It was enough to see him sitting there, the same old Denis, talking in the same old way. And yet, not quite the same. Even in his silence there was a new quality. He had matured; he had lived through the wreck of an ideal, and built up his faith again, steady and sure, upon a rock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lettice put away her papers with delicate neatness, and sat down in a low chair with her needlework—not a green dragon this time, but a pair of combinations, which she darned serenely under the masculine eye. Denis had a nice[Pg 212] mind, he would never see. Now if it had been a certain other person—Lettice made a graceful figure, soft brown hair and hazel eyes, long throat and little head, slight drooping shoulders and slim waist, set off by the soft gray-blue silk of her dress. She was fond of that peculiarly soft and feminine fabric known to dressmakers as crêpe de Chine. She could not spend much on her clothes, but she chose and wore them with that French fineness and perfection of detail which she, in common with her sisters, had learned from their foreign upbringing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I didn\u0027t come here to talk about German invasions,\" said Denis, rousing himself. \"The fact is, I\u0027m rather badly worried about Gardiner, Lettice.

She would never, if she could help it, say: \"I thought.\" She was sometimes driven to say, \"I did,\" but even then she kept to the bald facts, uncolored by her personality.

She did not imagine that she could move Denis, but there were certain things he ought to know, and which, in justice to Dorothea, she meant to set before him.

Denis sat silent, staring into the fire and pulling absently at his forelock, a trick he had when deep in thought. The soft sounds of Lettice\u0027s business did not break the stillness of the room. The alarm clock which Denis had given her to get up by in the morning (Lettice had long been mortally afraid of the alarm, and she still handled it as gingerly as if she expected it to explode) ticked on through the stillness. It struck seven; Denis glanced at his watch, and got up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 216]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I must go,\" he said confusedly. \"I—I\u0027d no idea it was so late.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took his hat and stick, and Lettice thought he was really going then and there, without another word; but he thought better of it, and from the landing came back and stood in the doorway, visibly struggling with himself. \"You—you mustn\u0027t think I mind what you said, Lettice,\" he got out. \"I\u0027d always listen to you.

And that was all she learned, then or for many months to come, of Denis\u0027s feelings for Dorothea, of his wanderings in the wilderness, of the manner of his deliverance. Not till many months later, in alien scenes, in unimaginable circumstances, in a different world, did he reopen that subject.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He straightened himself, glancing again at his watch. \"I really must go.

Lettice turned slowly and deeply pink; not on account of the kiss, however. She took her lamp and stood torch-bearer to light him down the stairs. When the quick military tread had reached the lower landing she was turning back to her room, but a quick scuffle in the cupboard and a breathless voice stopped her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 217]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Lettice—wait!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Dorothea scrambled out from among the brooms and brushes, bringing a shower of them with her. \"Oh, bother!\" said she, turning to stuff them back unceremoniously, and precipitating a fresh avalanche.

That proving inadequate, she rummaged through half a dozen pockets and dragged out a dingy red square which had evidently been used as an oil rag. She held it out by the corners. \"Oh dear, I must have stolen Turner\u0027s—oh dear, I wish I could manage to hit something between a doily[Pg 218] and a duster—never mind, a hanky\u0027s a hanky,\" said she, and blew her nose and dried her tears forthwith.

It does mean such a lot, Lettice! It isn\u0027t only that he is what he used to be, what I thought he never could be again; it\u0027s ever so much more than that. Denis wasn\u0027t made to think of women as he thought of—of me and Mrs. Byrne. He was made to marry, Lettice. Can\u0027t you see how perfectly sweet he\u0027d be to his wife?—yes, and to his boys and girls too; how he\u0027d love them (I expect he\u0027d have a pet little girl, and call her Letty), and how they\u0027d all adore him? He\u0027s one of those men who—who only truly mellow in their own homes.

Dorothea had room in her little head for but one idea at a time, and therefore was apt to overlook what lay under her little nose; but, her attention once aroused, she was keen on a scent, and her intuition, the prerogative of semi-civilized minds, had a way of landing her dead on the truth. Now there were certain things which Denis might be permitted to see, but which Dorothea might not—no! not on any account.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There isn\u0027t any news at all, if you want to know,\" she said. \"He hit a warder, so all his letters and things have been stopped off.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But isn\u0027t Denis going to visit him quite soon?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s stopped too.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh!\" said Dorothea blankly, \"oh dear!

Oh, she mustn\u0027t, she mustn\u0027t be allowed to guess! All this passed through Dorothea\u0027s mind in the space of half-a-second, and under the stimulus of that last thought she pulled herself round, with a mighty effort, to ask as innocently as she could: \"Did—did Denis know about this the day of the show?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027d just heard.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh,\" said Dorothea, \"oh, I wonder he didn\u0027t strike me to the ground!

Lettice looked at her sharply; but the pose was so natural, and any pose seemed so foreign to Dorothea, and Lettice so much wanted to be taken in, that she was. Not wholly; but she stuck her head in the sand and refused to see her own doubts. And behind the red handkerchief Dorothea, too much overwhelmed to cry, sat among the ruins which she had pulled down on her own head and wondered helplessly when she would see the end of all the harm she had done. \"I was so happy about Denis, and now there\u0027s this!\" Her love for Denis had been a sort of sublimated selfishness, but now she was thinking about other people—about Lettice, yes, and about Gardiner, though there she was all at sea. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ve done to him, but it must be something very bad for Lettice to be like this!\" she reflected. \"But, oh dear! after all, what should I feel like if it were Denis in prison?

They came on from flight to flight, up the bare boards to the attics, and ended with a single bang on the door. \"Miss Lettus, \u0027s a letter for you!\" Lettice went with her soft, unhurried step to take it in.
