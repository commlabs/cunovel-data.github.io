Bit of an old favourite, that one”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn\u0027t look as though it\u0027s attacking him now,” said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. That\u0027s all changed. Now it flies down every day and tells him about its hernia operation. Now it\u0027s effective, I\u0027ll grant you,” said the demon sadly, “but it\u0027s not what I\u0027d call torture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind turned away, but not before catching a glimpse of the look of terminal agony on the victim\u0027s face. It was terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was worse, however. In the next pit several chained and groaning people were being shown a series of paintings. A demon in front of them was reading from a script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“- this is when we were in the Fifth Circle, only you can\u0027t see where we stayed, it was just off to the left there, and this is that funny couple we met, you\u0027d never believe it, they lived on the Icy Plains of Doom just next door to -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric looked at Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s showing them pictures of itself on holiday?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both shrugged and walked away, shaking their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was a small hill. At the bottom of the hill there was a round rock. Beside the rock sat a manacled man, his despairing head buried in his hands. A squat green demon stood beside him, almost buckling under the weight of an enormous book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve heard of this one,” said Eric. “Man who went and defied the gods or something. Got to keep pushing that rock up the hill even though it rolls back all the time -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But first,” it trilled, “he must listen to the Unhealthy and Unsafety Regulations governing the lifting and moving of Large Objects.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolume 93 of the Commentaries, in fact. The Regulations themselves comprised a further 1,440 volumes. Part 1, that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind had always liked boredom, treasuring it if only because of its rarity value. It had always seemed to him that the only times in his life when he wasn\u0027t being chased, imprisoned or hit were when he was being dropped from things, and while falling a long way always had a certain sameness about it, it did not really count as “boring”. The only time he could look back on with a certain amount of fondness was his brief spell as assistant Librarian at Unseen University, when there wasn\u0027t much to do except read books, make sure the Librarian\u0027s banana supply wasn\u0027t interrupted and, rarely, help him with a particularly recalcitrant grimoire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he realised what made boredom so attractive. It was the knowledge that worse things, dangerously exciting things, were going on just around the corner and that you were well out of them. For boredom to be enjoyable there had to be something to compare it with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhereas this was just boredom on top of more boredom, winding in on itself until it became a great crushing sledgehammer which paralysed all thought and experience and pounded eternity into something like flannel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is dreadful,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chained man raised a haggard face. “You\u0027re telling me?” he said. “I used to like pushing the ball up the hill. You could stop for a chat, you could see what was going on, you could try various holds and everything. I was a bit of a tourist attraction, people used to point me out. I wouldn\u0027t say it was fun, but it gave you a purpose in the afterlife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I used to help him,” said the demon, its voice raw with sullen indignation. “Give you a bit of a hand, sometimes, didn\u0027t I? Pass on a bit of gossip and that. Sort of encourage him when it rolled back and that. I\u0027d say things like `whoops, there goes the bleeder again,` and he\u0027d say `Bugger it`. We had some times, dint we? Great times.” It blew its nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind coughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u0027S\u0027getting too much,” said the demon. “We used to be happy in the old days. It wasn\u0027t as if it used to hurt anyone much and, well, we was all in it together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s it,” said the chained man. “You knew if you kept your nose clean you\u0027d stand a chance of getting out one day. You know, once a week now I have to stop this for craft lessons?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That must be nice,” said Rincewind uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s eyes narrowed. “Basketwork?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I been here eighteen millennia, demon and imp,” grumbled the demon. “I learned my trade, I did. Eighteen thousand bloody years behind the pitchfork, and now this. Reading a -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sonic boom echoed the length of Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oi oi,” said the demon. “He\u0027s back. He sounds angry, too. We\u0027d better get our heads down.” And indeed, all over the circles of Hades, demons and damned were groaning in unison and getting back to their private hells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chained man broke into a sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, Vizzimuth,” he said, “couldn\u0027t we just sort of miss out one or two of paragraphs -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s my job,” said the demon wretchedly. “You know He checks up, it\u0027s more than my job\u0027s worth -” He broke off, gave Rincewind a sad grimace, and patted the sobbing figure with a gentle talon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell you what,” he said kindly, “I\u0027ll skip some of the sub-clauses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind took Eric by an unresisting shoulder. “We\u0027d better get along,” he said quietly. “This is really horrible,” said Eric, as they walked away. “It gives evil a bad name.” “Um,” said Rincewind. He didn\u0027t like the sound of Him being back and Him being angry. Whenever something important enough to deserve capital letters was angry in the vicinity of Rincewind, it was usually angry with him. “If you know such a lot about this place,” he said, “perhaps you can remember how to get out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric scratched his head. “It helps if one of you is a girl,” he said. “According to Ephebian mythology, there\u0027s a girl who comes down here every winter.” “To keep warm?” “I think the story says she actually creates the winter, sort of.” “I\u0027ve known women like that,” said Rincewind, nodding wisely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or it helps if you\u0027ve got a lyre, I think.” “Ah. We could be on firmer ground here,” said Rincewind. He thought for a bit and then said, “Er. My dog... my dog has six legs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The kind you play,” said Eric patiently. “Oh.” \"And, and, and when you do leave, if you look back... I think pomegranates come into it somewhere, or, or, or you turn into a piece of wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never look back,” said Rincewind firmly. “One of the first rules of running away is, never look back.” There was a roar behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Especially when you hear loud noises,” Rincewind went on. “When it comes to cowardice, that\u0027s what sorts out the men from the sheep. You run straight away.” He grabbed the skirts of his robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they ran and ran, until a familiar voice said: “Ho there, dear lads. Hop up. It\u0027s amazing how you meet old friends down here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd another voice said, “Wossname? Wossname?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are they!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sub-lords of Hell trembled. This was going to be dreadful. It might even result in a memo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They cant have escaped,” rasped Astfgl. “They\u0027re here somewhere. Why can you not find them? Am I surrounded by incompetents as well as fools?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My lord -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon princes turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speaker was Duke Vassenego, one of the oldest demons. How old, no-one knew. But if he didn\u0027t actually invent original sin, at least he made one of the first copies. In terms of sheer enterprise and deviousness of mind he might even have passed for human and, in fact, generally took the form of an old, rather sad lawyer with an eagle somewhere in his ancestry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd every demonic mind thought: poor Vassenego, he\u0027s done it this time. This won\u0027t be just a memo, this will be a policy statement, c.c.\u0027d to all departments and a copy for files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstfgl turned slowly, as though mounted on a turntable. He was back in his preferred form now but had pulled himself together, as it were, on a higher level of emotion. The mere thought of living humans in his domain made him twang with fury like a violin string. You couldn\u0027t trust them. They were unreliable. The last human allowed down here alive had given the place a terribly bad press. Above all, they made him feel inferior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the full wattage of his anger focused on the old demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You had a point to make?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was merely going to say, lord, that we have made an extensive search of all eight circles and I am really certain -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Silence! Don\u0027t think I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on,” growled Astfgl, circling the drawn figure. “I\u0027ve seen you - and you, and you” - his trident pointed at some of the other lords -“plotting in corners, encouraging rebellion! I rule here, is that not so? And I will be obeyed!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVassenego was pale. His patrician nostrils flared like jet intakes. Everything about him said: you pompous little creature, of course we encourage rebellion, we\u0027re demons! And I was maddening the minds of princes when you were encouraging cats to leave dead mice under the bed, you small-minded, paper-worshipping nincompoop! Everything about him said this except his voice, which said, calmly, “No-one is denying this, sire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then search again! And the demon who let them in is to be taken to the lowest pit and disassembled, is that clear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVassenego\u0027s eyebrows rose. “Old Urglefloggah, sire? He was foolish, certainly, but he is loyal -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you by any chance endeavouring to contradict me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVassenego hesitated. Dreadful as he privately held the king to be, demons are strong believers in precedence and hierarchy. There were too many young demons pressing below them for the senior lords to openly demonstrate the ways of regicide and coup, no matter what the provocation. Vassenego had plans of his own. No sense in spoiling things now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sire,” he said. “But that will mean, sire, that the dread portal is no longer -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Luggage arrived at the dread portal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way to describe how angry you can get running nearly twice the length of the space-time continuum, and the Luggage had been pretty annoyed to start with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked at the hinges. It looked at the locks. It backed away a bit and appeared to read the new sign over the portal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossibly this made it angrier, although with the Luggage there wasn\u0027t any reliable way of telling because it spent all its time beyond, in a manner of speaking, the hostility event horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors of Hell were ancient. It wasn\u0027t just time and heat that had baked their wood to something like black granite. They\u0027d picked up fear and dull evil. They were more than mere things to fill a hole in the wall. They were bright enough to be dimly aware what their future was likely to hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched the Luggage shuffle back across the sand, flex its legs and crouch down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lock clicked. The bolts dragged themselves back hurriedly. The great bars jerked from their sockets. The doors flung themselves back against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Luggage untensed. It straightened. It stepped forward. It almost strutted. It passed between the straining hinges and, when it was nearly through, turned and gave the nearest door a damn good kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a great treadmill. It didn\u0027t power anything, and had particularly creaky bearings. It was one of Astfgl\u0027s more inspired ideas, and had no use whatsoever except to show several hundred people that if they had thought their lives had been pretty pointless, they hadn\u0027t seen anything yet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eric-discworld-9/page-16.html","bookId":1628,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM"}
