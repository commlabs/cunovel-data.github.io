{"id":16988,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV TUNING UP THE “LOON”","content":"Knowing that Mr. Mackworth’s plans did not include a trip north of Mt. Osborne, the boys laid out a program of their own. They knew that Lord Pelton and Captain Ludington were extremely anxious to get unusual trophies. Therefore, if they could put both in the way of bagging such a prize as Husha the Black Ram they would be giving Mr. Mackworth something approaching adequate return for his trouble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the first opportunity they meant, if possible, to get the English guests in the Loon and then visit “Baldy’s Bench.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Long before breakfast the next morning the Teton was the center of new activity. “Grizzly” Hosmer had one of his wagons at the car by breakfast time and the camp equipage and provisions were stowed away under his tarpaulin. Guns and ammunition followed. After breakfast the second wagon arrived. In[189] this, gasoline and a?roplane extra parts were to be carried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Loon sections were then hauled from the baggage compartment. A few cans of gasoline were stored in a shed near the depot to be available if it were found necessary to make a voyage back to Michel during the hunt. Just after breakfast Frank, Phil and Mr. Mackworth made an examination of Michel. Where the ground was level, switch tracks make it impossible to use the places for setting up the airship or for its running start.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s one improvement that must be made in airships before they are completely practical,” said Mr. Mackworth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t see why you say that,” exclaimed Frank. “You might as well say railroad engines are not perfect because you have to lay tracks for them.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I would,” replied Mr. Mackworth, “if engineers claimed they could run engines anywhere.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Disappointed over the situation the investigators turned back down the one street of the town. The country round about was not more[190] promising than the town; the mountain slope began on each side and, at each end, the little valley spread out at once in rough trails, rock covered undulations and jack pines. Suddenly Phil stopped and began laughing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I think we’re like the old woman who couldn’t find her spectacles because they were on her forehead. Here’s your startin’ place,” he exclaimed sinking his heel in the street.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This is the public street and the only one,” said the surprised Frank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s why it’s just the thing,” answered Phil. “Look at it!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’d do if it wasn’t the street,” said Frank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You say you could set up and start flying in the road?” broke in Mr. Mackworth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sure, if they’d let us,” answered Frank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hurry back and unload your apparatus,” replied Mr. Mackworth. “I’ll see to the rest.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’ll be just the thing,” insisted Phil. “I’d think they’d be glad to let us use it—just for the show.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Mackworth waved the boys forward and, knowing that he usually got what he wanted, they started on a run for the car.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [191]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The business of Michel related mainly to mining. The houses were small and all faced the one street. Opposite the depot was the one hotel, two or three stores and half a dozen saloons. Several yards north of the hotel was a two-story frame building, the town hall. When Mr. Mackworth reached this, he stopped. In a half hour he was back at the car with the mayor of Michel, the hotelkeeper, and the principal storekeeper in his company. The town marshal was already at the car. The marshal and Mr. Mackworth’s other guests were ushered into the dining room of the Teton and for a quarter of an hour Jake Green was busy. Within an hour two ropes had been stretched across the street. On each hung this sign: “Take the back trail or hitch. Airship goes up at four P. M. to-morrow.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From the time the Loon crates began to be unloaded, the vicinity of the private car resembled a circus lot. More than once the town marshal had to clear the place of crowding spectators. Frank and Phil, stripped to their shirts, were busy and happy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loungers pulled down their hat brims or[192] sought the shade of the sidewalk awnings. But Frank and Phil seemed to mind neither heat nor dust. Mr. Mackworth, Captain Ludington and Lord Pelton had put off their smart traveling clothes and were in camp togs—flannel shirts, khaki trousers and laced knee boots.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hosmer and Sam Skinner worked over the wagon outfits until noon and then announced all ready. After a hasty luncheon the entire party, including Skinner and old “Grizzly,” gathered near the boys. Mr. Mackworth had found nothing missing and there was no need of a trip to Fernie. For a time this seemed fortunate for, much to their surprise, the boys found a defect in the apparatus that slowed them up considerably.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The spruce upright holding the left landing wheel frame and its shock absorbing spring was discovered to have a fracture. This was the wheel that had caught in the tree the night the two boys made their perilous flight through the thunderstorm. The strain of packing or unpacking this part of the airship had developed a crack in the aluminum paint covering the upright. This indicated an interior fracture[193] and a new upright had to be fashioned. The village carpenter was found and, supplying him with extra spruce, Frank spent two hours in the old man’s shop contriving a new support.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In spite of this, a little before six o’clock the monoplane had been completely set up. Disconnected from its shaft the beautiful engine responded immediately when started. Then a new problem arose. The boys had no hesitation in leaving the airship out of doors at night—there was nothing that dew or rain could harm—but they were apprehensive as to what the curious townspeople might do. But this question was quickly solved. Sam Skinner asking only for his blanket and permission to smoke, offered to sleep in the airship, “which,” he remarked, “beats any sleepin’ car shelf I ever saw.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The boys were tired. Neither their condition nor Jake’s dinner could restrain them, however, and before their elders had finished their coffee the lads were back at the airship. The temptation was too great; they meant to give the Loon a short trip out in mountain land.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The marshal was busy as usual. At sight of[194] him it occurred to Frank that an invitation to this official to have a ride in the Loon would be a proper return for the courtesies extended. The marshal not only refused but seemed afraid that he was about to be forced to accept the invitation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their own party finally appearing on the scene, each in turn was invited to make a flight. One after another had some excuse, Sam and “Grizzly” announcing simply that they were afraid.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lord Pelton was the only one who had not been positive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My arm is pretty stiff,” explained Frank, “and I’m sure Phil wants company. It’s as safe for two as for one.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That may be,” responded Lord Pelton with a weak smile, “as safe for two as for one. What say, Captain?” he asked turning to Captain Ludington. The latter waved his hand as if in doubt. “I’ll go,” exclaimed Lord Pelton. “We came for sport and I might as well get my share of it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll be back in a few moments,” said Phil springing into the monoplane cabin. “I’ll just take a turn to the north to warm up.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [195]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With Phil in the car arranging for his start, Frank stationed men at the rear and he and Jake Green took their places at the two propellers. Turning the wheels off center Frank waited for Phil to start the engine and, with its first “chug,” he and Jake threw the propellers over. The engine responded to the cranking and the yellow blades flew into a whirr.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hold on, you fellows,” yelled Frank through his trumpeted hands to the men at the rear who were already on the ground with their heels set in the road, “and you fellows get to one side,” he called to the spectators including Mr. Mackworth and his friends, “she’ll throw the dust.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This they had already discovered. Dirt and rubbish were shooting rearward like a sand blast. And it was a gale that had picked them up for, as Phil opened up the engine and the propellers reached a greater speed, the Loon trembled and pulled like a frightened horse. Suddenly Phil, in his seat, nodded his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All back,” shouted Frank. “Let go,” he cried and the Michel men who had been acting as anchors fell backwards in the dirt, choked with dust.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [196]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Loon darted down the empty street, springing a few feet in the air and then bumping the ground again, for about one hundred feet. Then, springing upward it did not touch again but went skimming above the street like the bird for which it was named. This only for a moment when, checking herself slightly under Phil’s movement of her planes and rudder, the monoplane began mounting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Certainly a beautiful sight,” exclaimed Captain Ludington.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Phil drove the Loon skyward and the rays of the setting sun struck the monoplane high in the air, the yells gave place to “Oh’s” and “Ah’s.” The planes of the ship were aluminum in color, while the guiding rudders and the horizontal plane and tail were white. On each, the sun rays cast a different tint and it seemed as if some powerful golden searchlight had focussed itself to paint a picture on the deep sapphire, cloudless sky.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the Loon grew smaller, Mr. Mackworth asked how high it was.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “About 3,000 feet,” answered Frank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Three thousand feet!” exclaimed Lord Pelton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [197]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’ll like it,” said Frank. “It’s a nice, safe height.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just then several hundred spectators saw the Loon veer off to the west, dip its plane downward and an instant later dash earthward in a series of spiral whirls. The men gasped and cried out but Frank only laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s only a quick descent,” he reassured his friends. “He’s all right.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Almost as he spoke, a thousand feet above the earth Phil, with a wider sweep, came on an even keel and then headed directly for the center of the town. A moment later the sound of the whirring propellers came within the hearing of the spellbound observers and then suddenly ceased.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He’s gliding now without power,” exclaimed Frank, “stand back everybody.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just as the Loon seemed about to strike with a crash in the street far beyond the crowd, there was a jump upward, a new glide earthward, another tilt of the ship skyward and then, the speed of the monoplane almost checked, a new drop earthward and Phil skilfully landed fifty feet from where he started.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e “Get out,” exclaimed Frank enthusiastically, “my arm feels better. All aboard, Lord Pelton. I’ll initiate you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Phil climbed out the Englishman hesitated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t let her get cool,” called out Phil. “All aboard.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And almost before he knew it the Englishman had been helped aboard and into the seat just behind the new aviator.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2715/74638.html","bookId":1436,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 8:14:14 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 8:14:14 AM"}
