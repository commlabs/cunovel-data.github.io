(1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dan Dun Battle Team\u0027s second round was against the Kalise Empire, and naturally there was no suspense regarding the result once more.\u0026nbsp; Like the Bai Da Empire, the Kalise Battle Team also surrendered without a fight. As such, though this Group One looked to be a Group of Death, it was more for the other teams within. In truth, in such a preliminary phase, it did not draw as much attention at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Heavenly Bow Battle Team admitted defeated, Zhou Weiqing did not remain for long in his own rest house, instead silently heading towards the ZhongTian Battle Team rest house. The reason was simple; before the fights had begun, he had already spotted Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er there. Only the two sisters were there at the ZhongTian Battle Team rest house, and the reason why he was certain Shangguan Bing’er wasn’t here was because of their eyes. Zhou Weiqing believed that if Bing’er was here, she would be extremely agitated to see him, and her eyes would be different from Xue’er and Fei’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Zhou Weiqing could enter the ZhongTian Battle Team Rest House, he was stopped. One of the ZhongTian Battle Team members lifted his hand to block him, saying: “What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “I am the Team Leader of the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, here to greet your Team Leader. Is that alright?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words and tone were polite, and thus the ZhongTian Battle Team member was not rude in return. Before he could speak, Shangguan Xue’er’s voice rang out from within. “Let him in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and walked on into the ZhongTian Battle Team, not being polite in just finding a seat to sit in. His sneaky eyes hidden behind the bamboo hat were roving on both Shangguan Sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday’s ZhongTian Battle Team was clearly very different from yesterday’s. Not only were the two Shangguan Sisters Fei’er and Xue’er here, even Little Miss Muddle was here. It could be said that besides Shangguan Bing’er, this was the ZhongTian Battle Team’s strongest power gathered here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xue’er, from the looks of things, you all were actually planning on giving us a good fight today?” Zhou Weiqing said with a speechless look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er did not open her mouth, and it was Fei’er who spoke instead. “Tsk… little coward, drinking cold water[1. She is just making a pun/rhyme. It sounds much better in Chinese]. How could you just surrender to us like that? Aren’t you afraid of not being able to advance to the next stage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Shangguan Fei’er spoke, Shangguan Xue’er who was right beside her waved her hands, and a light blue shield of light enveloped the three of them. This was a Water Attribute Skill that could shield them from prying ears. Anyone below the cultivation level of Heavenly King Stage who tried to eavesdrop would not be able to hear anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, how could I possibly take action against you all, my heart would ache too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er stuck out her tongue at Zhou Weiqing. Looking at her cute look, if they weren’t in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament competition grounds, Zhou Weiqing truly felt like holding her in his arms and getting intimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er remained her usual icy self. This time, it really wasn’t against Zhou Weiqing, but rather she was afraid that the other ZhongTian Battle Team members would suspect. She could only bring up a sound proof barrier, but was unable to block their vision. If anyone saw the usually cold and icy her smile at Zhou Weiqing, it would cause too much suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t you trying to act like a pig to eat some tigers? Why did you run here today, wouldn’t it spark suspicion?” Shangguan Xue’er said passively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing immediately said: “I’m being wronged totally! Who can I be acting like a pig to eat a tiger here? My Battle Team’s overall power is really below your ZhongTian Battle Team! As such, I decided it was a wiser strategy to surrender. Furthermore, for yesterday’s fight, I did send out our core power members, and did not try to hide anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er burst out in giggles, saying: “Come on now, others might not know you, but wouldn’t we know you well enough? If you weren’t trying to act, why wear that bamboo hat and even veils to mask all your appearances? Isn’t it because you are afraid many people will recognize you? By admitting defeat today, you are planning on sitting on the hill to watch tigers fight right? Aren’t you afraid that we will lose to the Dan Dun Empire tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing started momentarily, saying: “Is the Dan Dun Battle Team that strong this year? Even you all do not have absolute confidence in beating them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er nodded and said: “Indeed, we do not have absolute confidence. If Bing’er was here, perhaps we would have a much stronger chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing her words, Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: “You all are really torturing me! You know how much I miss Bing’er, how come you do not allow her to come see me today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er said: “Bing’er also misses you a lot. However, she has only just come out of closed door cultivation not long ago. In the last few years, she has spent in closed door cultivation, and her cultivation level has risen dramatically. However, that also means her current state is very unstable, and she cannot have too much emotional upheaval. Once you enter the finals, if you can enter the Heavenly Jewel Island then, you will naturally be able to see Bing’er.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing sighed and said: “I hope that the Dan Dun Battle Team can be sensible and strategic then, and just surrender tomorrow. If I were them, I would not waste time clashing against you in just the preliminary matches.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er started momentarily. However, the next instant, both of them understood his meaning. Indeed, they had neglected that possibility because they knew how strong the Heavenly Bow Battle Team was, but… the Dan Dun Battle Team would not know that! Shangguan Fei’er couldn’t help but exclaim: “So… your plan is to actually force out the Dan Dun Battle Team in the preliminary stages!? No wonder you would choose to admit defeat today… that is targeted at the Dan Dun Battle Team and cause them to underestimate you. With their confidence and arrogance, they would not deem you as a worthy foe at all. In that case, they would think that it is guaranteed for them to advance along with us… and because of that they might actually just surrender to us without fighting. In that case… as long as you can defeat them in the sixth round, then the Dan Dun Battle Team would not even be able to advance from the preliminary stages. That is your real plan right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and said: “You are truly my precious Fei’er, so intelligent! I am also helping you all! To remove a strong opponent in the preliminary stages, it will be much easier in the finals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er was left speechless momentarily, before she said: “However, did you think that if you advanced as the second rank in the First Group, then you would likely have to face the top ranker of the Third Group in the top eight fights. That would definitely be the Bao Po Battle Team. Even if you can defeat the Dan Dun Battle Team, it will not be without injuries. Do you have the confidence to beat the Bao Po Battle Team in that state then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Why should I not have confidence? The top eight matches are all single combat fights. The Bao Po Battle Team’s greatest strength is their husband and wife team combos. In one versus one fights, their greatest strength will be diminished. Furthermore, don’t you have confidence in your own husband?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whose your wife?” Both Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er retorted as one. In that instant, even Shangguan Xue’er’s face blushed slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other ZhongTian Battle Team members were not blind, and after Shangguan Xue’er had used the sound insulation barrier, they would glance in often. At this point, seeing Shangguan Xue’er blushing, their eyes almost bulged out of their sockets. What kind of situation was that? First Young Miss… was actually… actually showing such a feminine side?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, not far off from the ZhongTian Battle Team Rest House, the Dan Dun Rest House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did that Heavenly Bow Battle Team fellow enter the ZhongTian Battle Team Rest House?” The youth seated at the main seat asked with an overcast expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other Dan Dun Battle Team members said disdainfully: “I guess that they are seizing the chance since they surrendered to express their goodwill towards the ZhongTian Empire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShen Little Demon was seated a few seats down, and her brow furrowed deeply as she said: “I’m not sure why… but that person from the Heavenly Bow Battle Team gives me a strangely familiar feeling… as if I had seen him … or her… before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youth on the main seat looked at Shen Little Demon, and his eyes grew slightly gentler. “Just a mere bunch of cowardly fools who hide themselves. When it is our turn to fight them, it will be the end of their act. There is no need to worry about them. On the other hand, our fight tomorrow is with the ZhongTian Empire… what do you all think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShen Little Demon thought for a moment and said: “This time, the ZhongTian Battle Team is being led by the Shangguan Sisters, Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er. Their powers are both beyond mine. If we truly wish to clash headon against them and defeat them, I’m afraid we will have to reveal all of our hidden aces in order to do so. Our main aim is to enter the finals, so I recommend we do not draw too much attentions to ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youth at the head nodded slowly. In the depths of his eyes, a cold blood-red light flashed momentarily before vanishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second day of the competition continued without a hitch all the way. There were a few dark horses, but they were relatively minor, with more of the traditional stronger teams winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Zhou Weiqing had chosen not to bet at all. In fact, there was no way for him to bet at all. For their fight against the ZhongTian Battle Team, the odds were 1 to 1000, and it was pretty much pointless even if he wanted to bet on the ZhongTian Battle Team. Of course, the thought of betting on themselves and pushing through to win the fight. However, if they did so, the ZhongTian Empire would not let him go so easily. After all, even with the ZhongTian Empire’s wealth, they could not afford to pay out almost a hundred billion!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, Zhou Weiqing could only give up that dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament had already passed, and the bettors already had a certain judgement of all the Battle Teams’ overall power, and there were already favourites regarding the teams who would advance from each groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second day’s fights, perhaps the most surprising result was that the Fei Li Battle Team had actually lost. Ye Paopao and his sister had strong powers indeed, but they met a powerful team from one of the southern empires who had used strategy against them to win in a final result of 3v2. However, the group which the Fei Li Battle Team was in could be said to be relatively weakest, and they would have no problems advancing into the top eight. One could say that sometimes, luck was part of strength, equally important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird day of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly in the morning, Zhou Weiqing led his entire team out, stealthily heading to a betting station to begin his bets. Today was one of the most anticipated fights in the preliminary stages, that was the First Group’s ZhongTian Battle Team against the Dan Dun Battle Team. Of course, the anticipation was mostly a view of the citizens, and Zhou Weiqing did not think any fight would happen at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he still placed a lot of importance on today’s competitions. Of course, his main focus was on earning money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, when they reached the betting station, Zhou Weiqing could only stare in shock… as he looked on at a 1 to 100 odds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this third day of the tournament, the Heavenly Bow Battle Team would meet the Geritimo Battle Team, also one of the stronger teams in the Group. Normally speaking, even if the odds was 10 to 1, Zhou Weiqing would not be surprised, but 1 to 100 was rather exaggerated. What Zhou Weiqing could not accept was that the odds was to his disadvantage instead! Someone had actually placed a massive bet on them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-23-chapter-214-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-23-chapter-215-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-23-chapter-215-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
