He could only stare helplessly on as Lin Ming used the Chain of Stars to kill seven or eight of his Snowcap Sect disciples. Every single disciple that was qualified to come to this gathering of heroes was an astounding young elite of their generation. But, before they could even grow, Lin Ming had already chopped them down as if he were cutting vegetables!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Since you dare to kill my Snowcap Sect’s disciples, then I, Lian Shiyu, will never allow you to leave here alive!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hahaha!” Lin Ming sneered, “To think another idiot would speak such pathetic words at this point.

A long scar of blood crossed across his spine and brutal thunderfire energy wrecked its way into Hall Master Situ’s body, recklessly savaging his meridians and causing him to vomit a mouthful of blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Destiny Decree master had been severely wounded by Lin Ming’s spear!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ahhhh!” Hall master Situ crazily roared.

He suddenly moved forwards, stepping on Golden Roc Shattering the Void again, chasing right behind Hall Master Situ. Thunder and fire howled in the air.

If Lin Ming continued to attack then he would be struck by this Skysplit Sword! Old Man Yan had attacked Lin Ming in order to protect Hall Master Situ. At this moment, all of them were in the same boat. Once Hall Mater Situ died, their situation could only become worse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut facing this sword strike, Lin Ming didn’t even acknowledge it. He had relied on his ghostly speed in order to create this opening. If he couldn’t cause heavy damage to Hall Master Situ in this single attempt then the next sneak attack would be far more difficult. As long as the four Destiny Decree masters protected each other, it was possible for them to jointly ruin all of his attacks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThus, Lin Ming could not give up on this attack midway.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming forcefully resisted Old Man Yan’s Skysplit Sword and chased after Hall Master Situ with this fatal spear strike.

Or does he scorn my attack?” As Old Man Yan thought this, anger burned in his heart.

Lin Ming gave a deafening roar as energy erupted within his entire body and he revolved his protective true essence to the limit. Old Man Yan was a Destiny Decree master after all; his sword easily ripped through Lin Ming’s protective true essence and continued cutting into Lin Ming’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKacha!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe four foot long sword was blocked by the Demon Emperor Armor. After over half of the raging energy was dispersed by the armor’s protection, the rest surged into Lin Ming’s meridians.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s body had already been tempered by the profound gold divine fruit and the Eight Inner Hidden Gates – he was as tough as a treasure. He forcefully withstood the aftermath of Old Man Yan’s Skysplit Sword!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBlood tumbled in his body. Lin Ming grit his teeth, abruptly suppressing the chaos in his body. Then, he swiveled his wood spirit jade masked-face towards Old Man Yan. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that instant, Lin Ming’s eyes had become as cold as the nine nether hells.

It was like he was looking into the eyes of the dead, without a single trace of human emotion within them. He suddenly felt as if he had returned to his days of mortality and was thrust into the field of endless ice with polar gusts buffeting him. In this icy cold, his soul nearly froze!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Your attack is far too weak!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe voice of a devil suddenly echoed in Old Man Yan’s ears. His mind went momentarily dizzy as the world seemed to flip upside down. He heard a sharp breaking sound within him; a crack had appeared within his sword heart!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis sword heart wasn’t weak or fragile at all. But, after suffering such a blow and facing this Lin Lanjian that seemed to be the god of death incarnate, his confidence had completely collapsed!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Be careful!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLian Shiyu’s shout sounded out in his ears. A feeling of imminent crisis rose in Old Man Yan’s heart. Without explanation, he recklessly cut his sword outwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith only a loud explosion, Old Man Yan felt his ears go deaf and his eyes go blind. He felt a strong impact force strike him, as if his chest had been smashed by a mountain!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe four foot long heaven-step sword broke in half. Old Man Yan’s chest was swept through by the sword light and his protective true essence shattered. His arms shook as his sword light was torn apart; many of his ribs shattered. Old Man Yan coughed up a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying backwards like a broken ragdoll!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a frontal collision, the spear had the advantage to begin with. Moreover, Lin Ming’s explosive force and physical strength far surpassed Old Man Yan’s. If it were just this, then it still wouldn’t be enough to break Old Man Yan’s heaven-step treasure sword. But, Old Man Yan’s sword heart had been shaken and this caused him to not be able to display even half of his complete strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Sovereign Yan!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLian Shiyu ran up to catch Old Man Yan. Old Man Yan had still been able to block Lin Ming’s last spear strike and he had only been swept up in the spear light, thus he had only suffered a severe wound instead of being fatally injured. But, Hall Master Situ was in a much more miserable state. Lin Ming’s spear had penetrated through his body. Although the spear had avoided the fatal point of his heart it had still broken most of the meridians in his body and most of his organs had also been destroyed by the hidden energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this moment, Hall Master Situ had completely lost all combat efficiency!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a single face off and just with the exchange of several moves, out of four Destiny Decree powerhouses, one had been severely wounded and another stood on the precipice of death!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHow could the disparity be so great!?!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs heroic young elites saw this, they completely lost any courage they had remaining. They already heard that Lin Lanjian was powerful, but even though they acknowledged this fact, none of them had actually understood this. And seeing Lin Ming today, only now did they realize that this fellow was an absolute devil!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe was already stood on a completely different level from these young elites. Even the famous Elders of the various sects had no ability to resist him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese young elites only cursed themselves for being attracted by the potential rewards and deciding to come to the Jagged Slope Mountain Branch Division to participate in this damned gathering of heroes. If they hadn’t been tempted then they wouldn’t have entered into this Asura hell and they wouldn’t have had to face this death god!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe four great masters also felt their hearts quake. If they had protected each other from the very beginning then they would have been able to resist. But now two of them had been made useless; how could they continue fighting in this situation?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHall Master Situ continued to cough up mouthfuls of blood. As he looked at Lin Ming, his pupils were somewhat vacant. From the beginning to end, he hadn’t even been able to use a single move!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd the reason for all of this was Lin Ming’s terrifying speed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe had used his absolute advantage in speed to launch a sneak attack behind Hall master Situ, and then relied on his abnormally powerful defensive power to resist Old Man Yan’s all-out attack. With that, he had vacillated Old Man Yan’s sword heart and his spear had then been able to severely wound him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt may have seemed as if Lin Ming had easily won, but the truth was that all of this depended on his ruthless decisiveness and ability to fully display his absolute advantage in battle to the greatest extent. Otherwise, if he had truly fought all four of the Destiny Decree masters together in frontal combat, then even opening the third of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates wouldn’t allow Lin Ming to win.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Situ, open the array otherwise we will all die here!” Lian Shiyu said to Hall Master Situ with a true essence sound transmission. His voice was filled with hysterical panic. At this time, he didn’t dare to arouse Lin Ming’s attention.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHall Master Situ struggled to support himself. He still couldn’t understand, just where had the three Demo Envoys gone? What had they done after flying outwards for four hours? Why had Lin Lanjian returned alone?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat Hall Master Situ didn’t know was that the three Demon Envoys were still flying back from 4000 miles away.
