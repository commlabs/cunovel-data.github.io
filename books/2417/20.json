There aren\u0027t many times I see the likeness between Kelly Arguello and her uncle. I see it when she smiles. Though, on Kelly, thank God, the smile doesn\u0027t have the same maniacal edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned out for one last curl of honeysuckle that hung over the window. \"Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough for now. There\u0027s a cooler on the porch. Get that Shiner Bock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s tenthirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a light beer instead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the Shiner. Kelly drank a Pecan Street Ale. We sat on her wooden porch swing while she booted up a little blue portable computer, then started copying the information I had so far on Les SaintPierre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laptop beeped unpleasantly. She cursed, held it aloft by the screen, resettled herself so her bare feet were pulled up under her, then put the computer back in her lap and hit the delete key several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New toy?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrinkled her nose, rabbit style, and kept it that way for a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ralph?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I told him I was saving up for one. Next thing I know he\u0027s bought it for me. He\u0027s always doing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just upset you got all those scholarships. Had his heart set on paying your way through college.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably he\u0027d beat up my professors if they didn\u0027t give me straight A\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true,\" I insisted. \"He\u0027d pay to have them beat up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t look amused. She kept typing, squinting as she tried to read Milo Chavez\u0027s handwriting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lo hace porque le importas, Kelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe acted like she hadn\u0027t heard me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want all the paperwork on this guy?\" she asked. \"Like last time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get his marriage certificate. DMV. Credit. He\u0027s also got an air force record. We can at least get his date and nature of discharge on that. Check the tax rolls, especially deeds, building permits—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Basically everything,\" she summed up. She flipped through some more papers, gaining confidence in the task until she hit the personnel files from Julie Kearnes\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomputer, all seven pages worth. \"Whoa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scanned a few lines, looked up at me wideeyed. \"What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Part of our problem. This guy might be a vanisher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded slowly, trying to decide whether she should pretend she was following me or not. \"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s say you were into something dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But you know you\u0027re going to be making some enemies and you want to leave yourself an escape hatch. Or maybe you\u0027re just unhappy with your life anyway and you\u0027ve been planning to skip for a long time, then something bad comes up and you figure the time is ripe. Either way, you want to disappear off the face of the earth for a while, maybe forever. What would you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly thought about it. It can take law students a while to turn their training around—to look at the illegalities that are possible rather than the legalities. When they finally start thinking in reverse, though, it\u0027s scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d start constructing a new identity,\" she decided. \"New ID, new credit, completely clean paper trail. Maybe I\u0027d butter up somebody who had access to employee files for some big corporations, like these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scanned the printouts more closely. \"I\u0027d look for somebody deceased who was about my age, somebody who died far away from their town of birth so their birth and death paperwork would\u0027ve never met up. I could order their birth certificate from their home county, get a new social security number with that, then a driver\u0027s license, even a passport. That about right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"A plus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People really do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple of hundred times a year. Hard to get figures because nobody ever advertises success.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means—\" She started to recalculate the job I was asking her to do. \"Holy shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means we have to narrow the field. We have to find the most likely candidates from those files who might make viable new Les SaintPierres—males in their late forties who were born out of state and died fairly recently. There shouldn\u0027t be too many. Then we have to find out if any of those dead folks have requested new ID paperwork in the last, say, three months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That could still mean five or six names to track. And even then we might miss him. If he really did disappear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long do we have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until next Friday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me. \"That\u0027s impossible. I\u0027ll have to get down to Vital Statistics today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrows. \"Sure. I can do anything. But it\u0027s going to cost you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plinked the rim of my beer bottle. \"Kelly, your uncle owns a very large collection of guns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What—I can\u0027t ask you to dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I just can\u0027t accept.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. \"That\u0027s such bullshit, Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed quiet and drank my beer. Kelly stuffed the personnel files back into the folder and returned to typing. Every once in a while the fragrance of clipped honeysuckle would drift across the porch, a strange smell for midOctober.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled five of Milo\u0027s bills from my backpack and handed them to Kelly. \"You run into any unusual expenses, let me know.\" \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dug back into the folder and pulled out Les Saint Pierre\u0027s photograph. \"Yuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to shape her expression like Les\u0027. She couldn\u0027t quite get the eyebrows right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the street a businessman stumbled out his front door and spilled coffee on his tie. He lifted both arms in a Dracula pose and swore, then walked more carefully toward his BMW. His duplex looked like it had been built in the last twelve hours—all white aluminium siding and the lawn still made up of little green squares that hadn\u0027t grown together. The house next to his was an old red shack with a store on the side that sold ceramics and crystals. Austin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was it like growing up without your mother?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly lifted one eyebrow, then looked at me without turning her head. \"What makes you ask that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No reason. Just curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stuck out her lower lip so she could blow away the strand of grapecoloured hair that was hanging in her face. \"I don\u0027t think about it much, Tres. It\u0027s not like I spent my childhood thinking I was different or anything. Dad was always around? five or six uncles in the house. Things were just the way they were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swirled the last ounce of beer in my bottle. \"You remember her at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly\u0027s fingers flattened on the keyboard. She stared at her doorway and, momentarily, looked older than she was. \"You know the problem with that, Tres? Your relatives are always telling you things. They remind you of things you did, the way your mom was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou mix that with the old photos and pretty soon you\u0027ve convinced yourself you have these memories. Then if you want to stay sane you bury them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Because it\u0027s not enough. You grow up with men, you have to learn to deal with men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact you don\u0027t have a mom—\" She hesitated, her eyes still searching for some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ething in the doorway. \"With a mom, I guess you get some intuition, some understanding and talking. With a bunch of guys in the house, little girl has to take a different tack. Learn sneaky ways to get them to do what you want. Good training for working in law firms, actually. Or working for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly smiled. She looked through the other documents in my packet, found little that would help her, then resealed the manila envelope. She closed the laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call you as soon as I get something,\" she told me. \"You\u0027re heading back to S.A.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"You want me to tell your uncle anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly stood up so quickly the porch swing started moving cockeyed. She opened the screen door. \"Sure. Tell him I\u0027m expecting a dinner out of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to get me killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled like I\u0027d guessed the exact thing she had in mind, then shut the door behind her and left me alone on the porch, the swing still zigzagging around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two staterun rest stops between Austin and San Antonio, leftovers from simpler times before developers plopped convenience stores and outlet malls at hundredyard intervals all the way down the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resisted the urge to pull into the first, even though Kelly Arguello\u0027s Shiner Bock was working its way through my system, but by the time I\u0027d passed through New Braunfels my bladder was twisting itself into funny little balloon animals. I decided to exit at the second rest stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made such haste parking the VW and shuffling up the steps toward the john that I didn\u0027t take much notice of the pickup and horse trailer I\u0027d parked behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor did I take much notice of the guy next to me at the urinal. He smelled faintly of cigarette smoke and the checkered shirt and the profile of his face looked familiar, but there is no space quite so inviolable as the space between two men at the pee trough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look at him until we\u0027d both suited up and were washing our hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brent, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clamped his hands on the paper towel a few times, frowning at me. He hadn\u0027t changed clothes since yesterday, nor shaved. The bags under his eyes were puffy, like the extra tequila from last night\u0027s gig had drained into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tres Navarre,\" I said. \"We met last night at the Cactus, sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent threw away his towel. \"Cam Compton\u0027s forehead.\" \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent looked past me, out the entrance of the john. I was standing between him and the exit, which made it difficult for Brent to get around me. He obviously wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men having a conversation in the bathroom was only slightly less awkward than acknowledging each other at the urinal. Maybe I should compensate by offering him some Red Man. Mention the playoffs. Bubba etiquette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You with Miranda?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around, uncomfortably. \"No. Just the equipment.\" \"Ah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuffled a little more. I took mercy and stepped aside so we could both walk out at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest stop was doing a pretty good business for a weekday. Down on one end of the grassy oval island the picnic benches were overflowing with a huge Latino family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFat men in tank tops drank beer while the women and children streamed back and forth between the tables and their battered station wagons, bringing ice chests and boxes of potato chips and marshmallows. A little dog was doing circles around the kids\u0027 legs. The far curb of the turnout lane was lined with semis, the cabs dark and the drivers inside sleeping or shaving or eating, staring at the horizon and thinking whatever it is truckers think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA local Baptist church had set up an outreach table at the bottom of the bathroom steps. Several perky blondhaired women offered DUI fliers and free pocket Bibles and donuts and coffee. A green poster board sign announcing CHRIST LOVES TRAVELERS, TOO flapped in the humid wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent Daniels wasn\u0027t thrilled when he realized we had parked next to each other—my VW right behind his pickup and trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent\u0027s rig was a white Ford with brown stripes. The windows were tinted almost pure silver, making it impossible to see inside the cab. The trailer was a onehorse job, brown metal, with the words ROCKING U RANCH thinly painted over in a beigebrown that didn\u0027t match the rest of the metal. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-20.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
