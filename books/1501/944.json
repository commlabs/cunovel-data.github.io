Torrents of electric light and watery light transformed into enormous swords that furiously hacked at everything near them. The towering golem was assaulted by endless attacks, but it simply roared with fury as it charged towards Ning’s group. The Yin-Yang Sword Domain wasn’t able to do anything to it at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhooosh. Heartlord Solewind rose high up into the air, his red robes fluttering. He actually seemed to transform into a divine bird that was bathed in flames. More and more of these flaming birds began to appear in the area around him, as well as enormous amounts of blazing lava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Focus.” Solewind instantly manifested a total of eighteen arms, and each arm represented a beak of a firebird as they all flew towards that golem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Attack!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkyfire Brightshore and Waterlord Firesurge joined forces in a practiced manner. They had long ago grown accustomed to combination attacks, and thus they sent intertwined attacks of water and fire straight towards the golems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Ning, he first used [Three Heads, Six Arms], then drew out his six divine swords. Prince Greatjoy actually manifested six arms as well, a rare sight to behold. The two of them had the most powerful attacks… and were the final ones to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“GWAAAAR!” The massive golem roared furiously as it chopped horizontally with the massive black greataxe in its hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis chop seemed to sever the heavens from the earth itself. Ning and the others all instantly felt their hearts turn cold!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeartlord Solewind had used his heartworld projection to manifest eighteen blazing firebirds, but they were all chopped into two pieces by this blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Careful.” Skyfire Brightshore was sent flying back by the chop as well, and he furiously cried out to warn the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoooosh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaterlord Firesurge’s body was cleaved apart at the waist. Blood flew everywhere, and a look of shock and rage was in his eyes. And then, his entire body transformed into a flow of water that tried to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Greatjoy’s six enormous golden palms began to descend from the skies, striking against the edge of that greataxe and preventing it from continuing its attacks. Thanks to him, Skyfire and Firesurge were saved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brother Darknorth!” Prince Greatjoy vomited out a mouthful of blood as he flew backwards, but he still managed to send an urgent mental call to Ning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix silent streaks of sword-light. As Prince Greatjoy tied down the greataxe, the six streaks of sword-light scraped past it and stabbed directly towards the fingers of the golem’s right hand. Ning knew very well that this was a golem which was as tough and resilient as a magical treasure! To actually destroy this golem? Not even a Daolord of the Fourth Step would be able to do this, to say nothing of Ning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing’s Blood Drop stance had penetrating power, true… but it wouldn’t be able to pierce through the golem’s body by even an inch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, Ning had only one goal – to attack the finger-joints on the golem’s right hand, then seize its greataxe! Ning had been able to tell quite quickly that this golem was at an extremely high level of skill in wielding a greataxe. If Ning was able to disarm it and take the greataxe, the golem would instantly lose the majority of its power! This was similar to how if Ning himself lost his six Eternal swords he would only be able unleash 10-20% of his true power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. Clang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe six streaks of sword-light simultaneously stabbed into different finger-joints on the golem’s right hand. The terrifying penetrative power of the Blood Drop stance caused the fingers of the mighty golem’s right hand to involuntarily unclench just slightly, causing its grip over the greataxe to grow weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing was delighted to see this. Just as he was about to move forwards and seize the greataxe…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Darknorth, careful!” Solewind’s voice rang out in Ning’s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh?!” Ning’s face turned pale, because an enormous shield was crashing towards his head with an absolutely unstoppable amount of power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golem smiled coldly as it sent its enormous shield spinning towards Ning. Its greatest proficiency lay in the art of using shields! It was created in order to serve as a guardian for its master in dangerous situations, so as to help buy its master some extra time. The only reason it was also quite skilled in wielding axes was because it had been assigned to work as a miner for countless years now. Still… comparatively speaking, its true expertise still lay in wielding shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumble…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the shield came crashing down, it was as though the skies themselves were pressing down upon Ning. Even a chaos star would most likely be reduced to dust by a blow from this shield! As the shield moved closer and closer to Ning, layers of multicolored space generated by the terrifying pressure began to appear right in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way for Ning to seize the greataxe. All he could do was to use his sword-arts to defend as best as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!!!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shield slammed directly onto Ning’s six swords. Although Ning was skilled in using his longswords to defend, that meant very little when there was such an enormous disparity in power. The shield crushed through Ning’s six arms and slammed into Ning’s body. Ning felt his head grow dim as he was sent flying backwards with a boom. He almost instantly slammed into the walls of the pavilion, and blood immediately spewed out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faces of Prince Greatjoy, Heartlord Solewind, Skyfire Brightshore, and Waterlord Firesurge all turned pale when they saw this. They were all completely stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strike from that shield… it was far more powerful than the strikes from the greataxe had been!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You actually made me lose my grip over my greataxe. What a formidable sword-art! I’ll make your death a cleaner one.” The golem charged forwards, each step causing the pavilion to tremble. He continued to wield the shield in one hand and the greataxe in the other as he pounced towards Ning. Clearly, the fact that Ning had caused him to temporarily lose his grip over his greataxe had rather irritated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Greatjoy and the others felt their hearts turn cold when they saw this. Right now, they didn’t really care about the greataxe any longer. It was that shield which had them worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I, I…” Ning’s mind was still woozy, and he was only slowly regaining full consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust now, he had been knocked completely unconscious for a brief moment. Thankfully, he had a suit of Eternal armor protecting him, and had already completely mastered the [Golden Idol] technique. That was the only reason why he had been able to survive that terrifying strike! If he had a slightly inferior protective divine ability, such as one which only made his body comparable to the toughness of an ordinary Dao weapon, he probably would’ve died from that collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, Ning’s body was as tough as a top-grade Dao weapon. It wasn’t that easy to destroy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dodge, brother Darknorth!” Prince Greatjoy once more struck out with his six golden palms towards the golem, and the golem once more bashed out with his shield, causing that immense level of power to once more descend upon the cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe six golden palms collided head-on with the enormous shield!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, Prince Greatjoy’s palm-arts were actually quite similar in function and effect to the golem’s shield. In fact, Prince Greatjoy’s techniques actually evinced a much deeper understanding of the Dao! The problem was that the golem was simply too overwhelmingly powerful. Prince Greatjoy just barely qualified as having the physical power of a Daolord of the First Step, but this golem had the power of an apex Daolord of the Third Step! Even though its technique was rather weak, perhaps comparable to just that of a supreme World God, it would still be able to completely dominate Prince Greatjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a golem to be able to reach a level of mastery in using a shield which was comparable to that of a supreme World God was actually quite incredible. After all, golems were by nature far inferior to true cultivators in terms of being able to understand the Dao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden light radiated from every part of Prince Greatjoy’s body, making him seem as though he was made out of gold. And yet, he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of golden liquid as he was sent flying backwards. Still, his interception gave Ning the time he needed to fully regain consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DIE!” The golem struck out with his greataxe once more, this time chopping towards Skyfire Brightshore and Waterlord Firesurge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill him.” Ning had come back to his senses, and a cold look was in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoooosh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight ripple suddenly appeared with the pavilion. The ripple was very delicated, and even Ning’s Yin-Yang Sword Domain found it difficult to detect it. However, once the ripple moved next to the golem, the golem revealed a look of shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwish!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vicious, insidious streak of sword-light suddenly appeared, avoiding both the greataxe and shield as it slashed at the golem’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumble…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golem couldn’t help but be knocked backwards. As it was knocked backwards, that viper-like streak of sword-light appeared once more. This time, it actually began to twist as it quickly bound the golem up in rings of sword-light, completely trussling it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get in here.” A figure wreathed in black mist suddenly appeared, causing the golem to disappear with a wave of the hand. The figure glanced at Ning. “Per Master’s orders, you are permitted to have me help you one time. Now that I have dealt with this golem, I have completed my promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm.” Ning was still slumped on the ground of the pavilion. He nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis figure wreathed in black mist was one of the four golems which Emperor Mirrorsnow had prepared for his personal disciples… the golem known as ‘the assassin’!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoosh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin instantly disappeared, returning to the world of the Mirrorsnow Painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin that world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin, the golden-robed emperor, the fisherman, and the swordsman were all together, staring at the shield-bearing and axe-wielding golem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really moved quite quickly,” the golden-robed emperor laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This guy isn’t too bad. He can be considered to be as physically strong as an apex Daolord of the Third Step,” the assassin said coldly. “His shield-wielding techniques are weak, though, and his greataxe-wielding abilities are even weaker. Overall, he can just barely be considered as strong as a weak Daolord of the Third Step. I was the perfect counter for him in every respect. This was an easy win.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of them were all comparable to apex Daolords of the Third Step. In terms of speed and power, they had actually reached the threshold of Daolords of the Fourth Step, and they all had exceedingly profound sword-arts. Although Ning had ‘defeated’ them, that was because Emperor Mirrorsnow had ordered them to only use a certain level of sword-arts! But of course, their skills were slightly inferior to that of the sword-arts of a true Daolord of the Third Step. Thus, they averaged out to be as strong as an apex Daolord of the Third Step!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrength? Speed? Comprehension? They surpassed this new golem in every way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the pavilion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing continued to sit there on the ground. Waterlord Firesurge slowly reformed his true body out of the currents of water, while Skyfire Brightshore turned to look towards Ning. Solewind let out a long, relaxed sigh. As for Prince Greatjoy? He began to roar with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was close,” Solewind laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brother Darknorth, I owe you my life.” Prince Greatjoy looked towards Ning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing let out a sigh of relief as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat golem had brought them far, far too much pressure! In the end, they were still just a five-man group of World-level cultivators. When faced with a golem that was comparable to a Daolord of the Third Step, they were completely flattened with each class. If too much time passed, they probably would’ve lost their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-28-chapter-11\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-28-chapter-13\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/desolate-era/de-book-28-chapter-12","bookId":1501,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM"}
