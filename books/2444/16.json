{"id":79523,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u003cp\u003eIT WAS almost dawn before we got to bed (Debbie dismissed her police guard earlier in the night). Everyone crammed into the two hotel rooms. Harkat, Vancha and I slept on the floor, Mr. Crepsley in his bed, Steve on the couch, and Debbie in the bed in the other room. Vancha had offered to share Debbie\u0027s bed if she wanted someone to keep her warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she\u0027d said coyly, \"but I\u0027d rather sleep with an orangutan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She likes me!\" Vancha declared as she left. \"They always play hard to get when they like me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt dusk, Mr. Crepsley and I checked out of the hotel. Now that Vancha, Steve and Debbie had joined us, we needed to find somewhere quieter. Steve\u0027s almost deserted apartment block was ideal. We took over the two apartments next to his and moved straight in. A quick spot of tidying-up and the rooms were ready to inhabit. They weren\u0027t comfortable - they were cold and damp - but they\u0027d suffice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was time to go vampaneze hunting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe paired off into three teams. I wanted to go with Debbie, but Mr. Crepsley said it would be better if she accompanied one of the full-vampires. Vancha immediately offered to be her partner, but I put a quick stop to that idea. In the end we agreed that Debbie would go with Mr. Crepsley, Steve with Vancha, and Harkat with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with our weapons, each of us carried a mobile phone. Vancha didn\u0027t like phones - a tom-tom drum was the closest he\u0027d got to modern telecommunications - but we convinced him that it made sense - this way, if one of us found the vampaneze, we\u0027d be able to summon the others swiftly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisregarding the tunnels we\u0027d already examined, and those that were used regularly by humans, we divided up the city\u0027s underground terrain into three sectors, assigned one per team, and descended into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long, disappointing night lay ahead of us. Nobody found any trace of the vampaneze, although Vancha and Steve discovered a human corpse that had been stashed away by the blood-suckers many weeks earlier. They made a note of where it was, and Steve said he\u0027d inform the authorities later, when we\u0027d finished searching, so the body could be claimed and buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie looked like a ghost when we met at Steve\u0027s apartment the following morning. Her hair was wet and scraggly, her clothes torn, her cheeks scratched, her hands cut by sharp stones and old pipes. While I cleaned out her cuts and bandaged her hands, she stared ahead at the wall, dark rims around her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you do it, night after night?\" she asked in a weak voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re stronger than humans,\" I replied. \"Fitter and faster. I tried telling you that before, but you wouldn\u0027t listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Steve isn\u0027t a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He works out. And he\u0027s had years of practice.\" I paused and studied her weary brown eyes. \"You don\u0027t have to come with us,\" I said. \"You could co-ordinate the search from here. You\u0027d be more use up here than-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she interrupted firmly. \"I said I\u0027d do it and I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I sighed. I finished dressing her wounds and helped her hobble to bed. We\u0027d said nothing about our argument on Friday - this wasn\u0027t the time for personal problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Crepsley was smiling when I returned. \"She will make it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think so?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I made no allowances. I held to a steady pace. Yet she kept up and did not complain. It has taken its toll - that is natural - but she will be stronger after a good day\u0027s sleep. She will not let us down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie looked no better when she woke late that evening, but perked up after a hot meal and shower, and was first out the door, nipping down to the shops to buy a strong pair of gloves, water-resistant boots and new clothes. She also tied her hair back and wore a baseball cap, and when we parted that night, I couldn\u0027t help admiring how fierce (but beautiful) she looked. I was glad it wasn\u0027t me she was coming after with the arrow gun she\u0027d borrowed from Steve!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWednesday was another wash-out, as was Thursday. We knew the vampaneze were down here, but the system of tunnels was vast, and it seemed as if we were never going to find them. Early Friday morning, as Harkat and I were making our way back to base, I stopped at a newspaper stand to buy some papers and catch up with the news. This was the first time since the weekend that I\u0027d paused to check on the state of the world, and as I thumbed through the uppermost paper, a small article caught my eye and I came to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" Harkat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. I was too busy reading. The article was about a boy the police were looking for. He was missing, a presumed victim of the killers who\u0027d struck again on Tuesday, murdering a young girl. The wanted boy\u0027s name? Darren Horston!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI discussed the article with Mr. Crepsley and Vancha after Debbie had gone to bed (I didn\u0027t want to alarm her). It said simply that I\u0027d been at school on Monday and hadn\u0027t been seen since. The police had checked up on me, as they were checking on all students who\u0027d gone absent without contacting their schools (I forgot to phone in to say that I was sick). When they couldn\u0027t find me, they\u0027d issued a general description and a plea for anyone who knew anything about me to come forward. They were also \u0027interested in talking to\u0027 my \u0027father - Vur Horston\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suggested ringing Mahler\u0027s to say I was OK, but Mr. Crepsley thought it would be better if I went in personally. \"If you call, they may want to send someone to interview you. And if we ignore the problem, someone might spot you and alert the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe agreed I should go in, pretend I\u0027d been sick and that my father moved me to my uncle\u0027s house for the good of my health. I\u0027d stay for a few classes - just long enough to assure everyone that I was OK - then say I felt sick again and ask one of my teachers to call my \u0027uncle\u0027 Steve to collect me. He\u0027d remark to the teacher that my father had gone for a job interview, which would be the excuse we\u0027d use on Monday - my father got the job, had to start straightaway, and had sent for me to join him in another city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an unwelcome distraction, but I wanted to be free to throw my weight behind the search for the vampaneze this weekend, so I dressed up in my school uniform and headed in. I reported to Mr. Chivers\u0027 office twenty minutes before the start of class, thinking I\u0027d have to wait for the perennial late-bird, but was surprised to find him in residence. I knocked and entered at his call. \"Darren!\" he gasped when he saw me. He jumped up and grasped my shoulders. \"Where have you been? What happened? Why didn\u0027t you call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran through my story and apologized for not contacting him. I said I\u0027d only found out that people were looking for me this morning. I also told him I hadn\u0027t been keeping up with the news, and that my father was away on business. Mr. Chivers scolded me for not letting them know where I was, but was too relieved to find me safe and well to bear me a grudge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d almost given up on you,\" he sighed, running a hand through hair that hadn\u0027t been washed lately. He looked old and shaken. \"Wouldn\u0027t it have been awful if you\u0027d been taken as well? Two in a week... It doesn\u0027t bear thinking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two, sir?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Losing Tara was terrible, but if we\u0027d-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tara?\" I interrupted sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tara Williams. The girl who was killed last Tuesday.\" He stared at me incredulously. \"Surely you heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read the name in the papers. Was she a student at Mahler\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great heavens, boy, don\u0027t you know?\" he boomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tara Williams was a classmate of yours! That\u0027s why we were so worried - we thought maybe the two of you had been together when the killer struck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran the name through my memory banks but couldn\u0027t match it to a face. I\u0027d met lots of people since coming to Mahler\u0027s, but hadn\u0027t got to know many, and hardly any of the few I knew were girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must know her,\" Mr. Chivers insisted. \"You sat next to her in English!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze, her face suddenly clicking into place. A small girl, light brown hair, silver braces on her teeth, very quiet. She\u0027d sat to the left of me in English. She let me share her poetry book one day when I left mine in the hotel by accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" I moaned, certain this was no coincidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Mr. Chivers asked. \"Would you care for something to drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head numbly. \"Tara Williams,\" I muttered weakly, feeling a chill spread through my body from the inside out. First Debbie\u0027s neighbours. Now one of my classmates. Who would be next...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no!\" I moaned again, but louder this time. Because I\u0027d just remembered who sat to my right in English - Richard!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allies-of-the-night-the-saga-of-darren-shan-8/page-16.html","bookId":2444,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:09 PM"}
