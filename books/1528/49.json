With the augment, she has a full life, as short as that might be. Many children are born doomed from the start, given life sentences by medical conditions. Leukemia, AIDS, birth defects. Shouldn’t we seek to give them the best quality of life, rather than quantity?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat scowled. “You only want to use her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since when is mutual benefit such a bad thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat turned her back on him, frustrated with his arguments and justifications. It was monstrous. How could he rationalize any of this? Especially with the life of a child in the balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSasha continued to work in her coloring book. She drew with a dark green crayon. Her hand moved rapidly across the page, filling in one spot, then another, totally at random.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should she be coloring?” Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri stirred, roused by their talking. “Some release is good after such an episode,” he mumbled, clearing his throat. “Like opening a pressure valve. As long as the augment is not activated remotely, triggering her, such calm work will ease her mentally.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, she does seem happy,” Kat admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she worked, Sasha’s face was relaxed with a faint ghost of a smile. She straightened and reached a small hand to Kat. She spoke in Russian and tugged at her sleeve with her tiny fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat glanced to Yuri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offered a tired grin. “She said you should be happy, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSasha pushed her book toward Kat, as if she wanted Kat to join her in coloring the pages. Kat sank into a seat and accepted the book. She frowned when she saw the girl had not been filling in lines but had been working on a blank page. With amazing clarity, she had drawn a scene. A man poled a wooden raft through a dark forest with a faint suggestion of other figures seated behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat’s hands began to tremble. She saw who manned the raft. She struggled to understand. It looked like Monk. But she had no memory of Monk ever being on a raft. Why would the girl draw such a thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSasha must have sensed her distress. Her smile wilted to confusion. Her lips trembled, as though fearful she had done something wrong. She stared from Yuri to Kat. Tears glistened. She mumbled in Russian, apologetic and scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri scooted closer and reassured her with the soft voice of a grandfather. Kat forced down her reaction—for the child’s sake. Still, her heart pounded. She remembered seeing Yuri stiffen when he saw the child’s earlier picture. At the time, for a split second, she had thought maybe he had recognized the face on the paper, but that was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride climbed out of his chair and approached the bed, plainly curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat ignored him. It was none of his business. Instead, her gaze fixed on Yuri. The man met her stare over the top of Sasha’s head. Like the child, he wore an apologetic expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muffled explosion rocked through the facility, echoing down from above. Alarm bells rang out. All eyes turned toward the ceiling, but Kat leaped to her feet. She was a fraction of a second too slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride lunged out and grabbed Dr. Lisa Cummings by her blond French braid. He pulled her toward him while he backpedaled to the wall. Kat Bryant grabbed for him but missed. He slammed back into the corner, out of direct sight line from the door and the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis other hand pulled his cell phone from his jacket pocket. He pressed a button on its side, and the top half flipped in his fingers, revealing a small barrel. He shoved it hard against Lisa’s throat, pointing it up toward her skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t move,” he whispered in her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCell phone guns had become the scourge of security forces. But the device Mapplethorpe had given him was state-of-the-art. He could even take calls on it. It had passed through the security search and scanner without a blip of concern. Chambered in .22-caliber rounds, there was unfortunately a limit to the weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have five bullets!” he shouted to the stunned room. “I will kill the doctor first—then the child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guard leveled a weapon at him, but he kept shielded behind Lisa’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drop your gun!” he boomed at the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard kept his position, weapon never wavering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one has to die!” McBride said. He nodded his head upward. “We only want the child. So put down your pistol!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat straightened from her tumbled grab. She had come close to nabbing him. He would have to watch her closely. In turn, she eyed him, studying him like a book. Still, the woman motioned for the guard to lower his weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drop it and kick it over here!” McBride ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith another nod from Kat, the sidearm skittered over to his toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcBride’s mission was simple: to secure the child until Mapplethorpe and his forces arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All we have to do is wait!” he said. “So no sudden moves, no heroes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the explosion rocked though the subterranean bunker, Painter instinctively turned to the wall monitor on his left. The large screen displayed a live feed from Sasha’s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter shot to his feet. His heart pounded, and his vision narrowed with fury. He brought up the sound with a blind punch to his keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No sudden moves, no heroes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean rose on the other side of the desk. Gunfire echoed down to them. Painter brought up the camera feed from the top level of Sigma and displayed it on the screen behind his desk. He tore his eyes away from Lisa and checked the other monitor. Smoke filled the passageway. Helmeted figures in Kevlar vests and face masks ran low through the pall, rifles on their shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe the bastard’s goddamn nerve,” Sean said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to guess who he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMapplethorpe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re going for the girl,” Sean growled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bullhorn echoed from the topmost level of Sigma. “EVERYONE DOWN ON THE FLOOR! ANY RESISTANCE WILL BE MET WITH DEADLY FORCE!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean crossed to Painter. “There’s no way this is sanctioned. We would have been issued a stand-down order first. The bastard’s gone rogue.” Sean turned toward him. “You know what you have to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter’s attention returned to Lisa. He saw the weapon pressed under her jaw, a tender neck he kissed each morning. But he slowly nodded. There was a fail-safe if Sigma was ever under attack by a hostile force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut first he needed to get his people out of harm’s way. This war was between Painter and Mapplethorpe. He picked up the phone. “Brant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir!” His aide’s voice was curt and ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sound Protocol Alpha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new klaxon rang out, ordering all personnel to evacuate to the nearest emergency exit. Mapplethorpe just wanted a clear path to the child. To protect his people, Painter intended to provide that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean headed to the door. “I’m going up. I’ll attempt to negotiate, but if I fail…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Understood.” Painter turned, pulled a drawer, and removed a Sig Sauer P220 pistol. “Take this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean shook his head. “Firepower isn’t going to get us out of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friend left. Painter gripped the pistol and studied the screen. He had one last duty to Sigma. He shifted to his computer and typed in the fail-safe code, then pressed his thumb to the fingerprint reader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red square appeared, layered over a blue schematic of the facility’s air-ventilation system. The default countdown was set at fifteen minutes. Painter doubled the time and synchronized it with his watch to go active at 0100. He stared between the door and the wall screen. He had a lot to accomplish in such a short time. Still…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyping rapidly, Painter entered the final code to activate. The numbers started counting down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith pistol in hand, he ran for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7:05 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouthern Ural Mountains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sun first peeked over the surrounding mountains, Monk shoved with his pole and drove the raft deep into the reeds. The prow ground into a muddy bank. At long last, they’d made landfall, as soggy as that might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay here,” he ordered the kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the pole, he tested for solid footing. Satisfied, he climbed off the raft, then turned and helped Pyotr and Kiska onto a hillock of grass nearby. Konstantin leaped on his own, as spry as ever, but the boy landed roughly. His exhaustion showed in the dark lines under his eyes and the tremble as he stood. Marta fared little better, lunging with both legs and landing in a knuckled crouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk waved them onward. The way remained muddy and sodden for another quarter mile, but slowly the ground rose out of the swamp and firmed underfoot. The forest shed the watery willows and stood taller with birches and spruces. Meadows opened, green with wild gentian and edelweiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the top of a rise, and a clear view spread ahead of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mile away, a small town, split by a silver-flowing creek, dotted the lower slope of the neighboring mountain. Monk studied the place. It appeared long deserted and abandoned. The derelict mix of stone and wooden buildings climbed the slopes around a switchbacking gravel road. An old mill neighbored the rocky creek. Its waterwheel lay fallen and broken across the stream like a bridge. Several other structures had collapsed in on themselves, and the place had a wild overgrown look to it, buried in high grasses and lush with juniper bushes and fir trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s an old mining town,” Konstantin explained. The boy unfolded the map, to check their bearings. “No one lives there. Not safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much farther until we reach the mine shaft?” Monk asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy measured with his thumb on the map, then pointed to the ramshackle collection of buildings. “Another half mile past the town. Not far.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin glanced off to the right of the town. His expression soured. He didn’t have to say anything. Half hidden behind the shoulder of the mountain, a large greenish black body of water stretched off to the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLake Karachay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk checked his badge. It still registered a reddish hue. But to reach the town, they would have to head directly toward the lake, deeper into its radioactive shadow. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-49.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
