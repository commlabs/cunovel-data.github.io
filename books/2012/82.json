They’d drink and tell of missions that had ended in disaster. A dead mage, lost in unknown lands, no way home. The few lucky ones would find a place to book passage, or perhaps another Trygalle carriage would find them, half starved and half mad, and these ones would come home broken, their eyes empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at the morning sky. Was the flying lizard still up there? Did it mock them with its cold eyes? She doubted it. If we make it out of this, it will be a miracle. The longest tug of the Lady’s luck this world has ever seen. And let’s face it, things don’t work out that way. They never do .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I smelled smoke,’ said Amby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. ‘Dawn. The wind had yet to turn. Was running before the sun.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEast. She stood, studied the rumpled wastes. Was that a faint haze? No, that veil was too big. A cloud. ‘Well,’ she said, ‘it’s where we were headed, more or less.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the man wanted to smell things, fine. Made no difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We need water,’ Amby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Faint turned and approached Precious Thimble. The young witch would not meet her eyes. Faint waited for a moment, and then said, ‘Can you conjure water?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I told you—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, the land’s mostly dead. Still. Can you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There’s no point in trying.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Try anyway.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flashed. ‘Who left you in charge?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re a shareholder in the Trygalle. I have seniority here, Precious.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But I’m—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So far,’ Faint cut in, ‘you’re nothing. Show us some magery and that might drag you up a notch or two. Open us a gate home and I’ll personally crown you empress. But until then, Precious, I’m in charge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It hurts.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What does? Listen. People die.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she shook her head. ‘Magic. Here. The ground … flinches .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Precious, I don’t care if it howls. Just get us some water.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It doesn’t want us here. It doesn’t want anyone here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Too bad.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious shivered. ‘There’s something … If it’s a spirit – even the ghost of one. Maybe …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Get started on it.’ Faint walked over to Sweetest Sufferance. ‘Hood’s breath, wake up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m awake, cow.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, turned out everyone felt as miserable as she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hungry,’ said Precious Thimble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods below . Faint looked to the east again. Cloud or smoke? Nearby, Amby made a groaning sound. She glanced over. Something was wrong with his face – mud streaks? Tears? No, too dark. She stepped closer. What, is that blood?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, the packhorse tore free of the stake tethering it and lunged away, hoofs thundering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rattling sound erupted from Sweetest Sufferance. Faint spun. ‘Sweetie?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blanket-swathed form was twitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hungry,’ said Precious Thimble again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpasms surged through Sweetest Sufferance, her limbs jumping. She kicked her way clear of the blankets, rolled on to her back. Her eyes were opened wide, filling with blood. Her face was visibly swelling. Flesh split.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In here?’ asked Precious Thimble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint whirled to the witch – saw the strange tilt to her head, the drool slicking her chin. Her eyes were glazed. She rushed over. ‘Get it out! Precious! Send it away!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweetest Sufferance jerked upright, blood draining down from her fingertips. Bony projections had pushed through her face, closing the space for her eyes, her mouth. Her entire body shook as if something was inside, trying to escape. Tearing sounds burst from under her clothing as more bones thrust past skin, pushed at her sodden clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground beneath the woman seemed to be cracking open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumb with horror, Faint backed up a step. Shock stole her will. ‘Precious – please—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmby suddenly howled and the cry was so raw it jolted Faint awake. Twisting round once more, she rushed to Precious Thimble. Struck the woman in the face, a vicious slap, as hard as she could manage. The young witch’s head rocked. Amby screamed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint glanced back at Sweetest Sufferance – but the woman was mostly gone, and in her place, rising up from the broken earth below, was a stained wrist thick as the bole of an ancient tree. The hand had pushed its fingers through the woman’s body, as if fighting free of an ill-fitting glove. Gore-streaked nails clawed at the air. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-82.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
