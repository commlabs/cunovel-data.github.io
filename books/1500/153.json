As for the little bit that remained, he would only need six hours at most. For injuries that he needed several days to recover from before, he only needed a day or so now to completely recover. This was a benefit of the Black Dragonriders’ advanced medications. The only thing which seemed to be a bit of a hassle now was that the nutrient-filled liquids that were extremely effective for normal people weren’t particularly useful now for Su.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu sat alone in the tent. He turned on the tactical tablet and carefully observed the terrain of this place. It was already noon, and it was close to winter. The sky was covered in thick clouds filled with radiation, and at three in the afternoon, the sky would already become completely black. The temperature already decreased to around negative five degrees. Fortunately, the wind that blew over was still quite dry, so it probably wouldn’t snow for the next two days. If it did snow, then traces of Blue Scorpion’s damaged tank might be completely buried.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThose living in the wilderness often prayed for it to not snow or rain. Rain and snow both possessed fatal levels of radiation, and it covered this great earth in an unforgiving baptism. The fine raindrops and snowflakes sealed up everything from the skies down to the earth like a net. They were even more deadly than the sunlight constantly covered by the clouds. If one was drenched in the rain for a long time, one’s body had a chance of developing mutated tissues.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe direction the damaged tank headed in was the northwestern direction, and roughly speaking, it should pass by a place that wasn’t too far from N958. Of course, there was a chance that it might change directions midway.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu still decided to chase after them alone and see if he was lucky enough to stumble upon their forward operating base. However, before leaving, Su planned to have Li Gaolei bring some people with him a day later to wait at a position fifty kilometers away.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWas this the end of the lone wolf?

Driving a vehicle was normally the quickest route of advance, but Su’s stamina was far greater than an ordinary person’s. In the age of turmoil, almost all roads were damaged, so his running speed wouldn’t be much slower than that of an ordinary off-road vehicle’s. Another thing to consider was fuel. Fuel was extremely expensive, and the long journey would make it even more expensive, to the point where even the current Su wasn’t willing to use it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Su walked out from the camp, Li was currently leaning against a pile of ammunition boxes while tossing an alloy military knife around in a rather bored manner.

I was just going to take a look to see where Blue Scorpion’s forward operating base was so that we aren’t caught completely unprepared next time. This is my line of profession. Don’t forget that I was a hunter before I entered the Black Dragonriders.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi scratched her maroon colored hair and said with a bit of difficulty, “Then, this… I won’t follow you.

He gave Li a departing wave before turning around and leaving for the north.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi suddenly shouted towards his retreating figure. “Hey! Remember to come back alive!

Su turned around and gave her a signal of guaranteed success and said, “Relax!

Why did she have to be so worried about him? The hatred and humiliation from before hadn’t even been settled! Even if Su saved her, she didn’t feel that his reason for doing so was that pure. The wage Su gave her every month was only a hundred yuan. Even though Li wasn’t that sensitive towards money, she could still tell from the list of Black Dragonrider equipment that a hundred yuan seemed like it couldn’t really purchase anything. The little things she liked were, for example, dual-use tanks that possessed both air and land superiority, high speed transport vehicles that could temporarily float in the air and travel underground, or bombardment tanks that could cover an area with firepower. Even if a few zeros were removed from the ends of these things, it would still be more than a hundred yuan.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSo why did she suddenly feel happy after hearing his final sentence? The more Li thought about it, the more depressed she became. Her left hand suddenly moved, and the military knife flew out with lightning speed, nailing itself into the edge of an ammunition chest more than ten meters away. The relatively heavier handle rotated another ninety degrees before stopping.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eKane stared rigidly at the military knife that was less than five centimeters from the tip of his nose, and sweat continuously poured out from his face. Even though he had experienced many life and death situations, this knife suddenly appeared in front of his eyes while he was listening attentively, so it produced an extremely intimidating effect.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi walked over, and after pulling out the knife, she stared fiercely at Kane again before walking off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs he watched Li’s tall and straight figure, Kane shook his head and said in a soft voice to himself, “With this mother dragon’s combat abilities, she would be more than enough even if she went to become a dragonrider.
