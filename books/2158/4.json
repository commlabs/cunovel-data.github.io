{"id":97543,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003eFates help us! Were the original Honored Matres all Reverend Mothers? Do we dare test this hypothesis on ourselves? What can we learn of this from that pair in the no-ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo sources of information lay there under the Sisterhood\u0027s watchful eyes but the key had yet to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoman and man no longer just breeding partners, no longer a comfort and support to each other. Something new has been added. The stakes have been escalated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the comeye record playing at the worktable, Murbella said something that caught the Mother Superior\u0027s full attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We Honored Matres did this to ourselves! Can\u0027t blame anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hear that?\" Bellonda demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade shook her head sharply, wanting all of her attention on this exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t say the same about me,\" Idaho objected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an empty excuse,\" Murbella accused. \"So you were conditioned by the Tleilaxu to snare the first Imprinter you encountered!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to kill her,\" Idaho corrected. \"That\u0027s what they intended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t even try to kill me. Not that you could have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s when...\" Idaho broke off with an involuntary glance at the recording comeyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was he about to say there?\" Bellonda pounced. \"We must find out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Odrade continued her silent observation of the captive pair. Murbella demonstrated a surprising insight. \"You think you caught me through some accident in which you were not involved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I see something in you that accepted all of it! You didn\u0027t just go along with your conditioning. You performed to your limits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn inward look filmed Idaho\u0027s eyes. He tipped his head back, stretching his chest muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a Mentat expression!\" Bellonda accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of Odrade\u0027s analysts suggested this but they had yet to wrest an admission from Idaho. If he was a Mentat, why withhold that information?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the other things implied by such abilities. He fears us and rightly so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella spoke with a sneer. \"You improvised and improved on what the Tleilaxu did to you. There was something in you that made no complaint whatsoever!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how she deals with her own guilt feelings,\" Bellonda said. \"She has to believe it\u0027s true or Idaho would not have been able to trap her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade pursed her lips. The projection showed Idaho amused. \"Perhaps it was the same for both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t blame the Tleilaxu and I can\u0027t blame the Honored Matres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane entered the workroom and sank into her chairdog beside Bellonda. \" I see it has your interest, too.\" She gestured at the projected figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade shut down the projector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been inspecting our axlotl tanks,\" Tamalane said. \"That damned Scytale has withheld vital information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no flaw in our first ghola, is there?\" Bellonda demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing our Suks can find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade spoke in a mild tone: \"Scytale has to keep some bargaining chips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth sides shared a fantasy: Scytale was paying the Bene Gesserit for rescue from the Honored Matres and sanctuary on Chapterhouse. But every Reverend Mother who studied him knew something else drove the last Tleilaxu Master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClever, clever, the Bene Tleilax. Far more clever than we suspected. And they have dirtied us with their axlotl tanks. The very word \"tank\" - another of their deceptions. We pictured containers of warmed amniotic fluid, each tank the focus of complex machinery to duplicate (in a subtle, discrete and controllable way) the workings of the womb. The tank is there all right! But look at what it contains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tleilaxu solution was direct: Use the original. Nature already had worked it out over the eons. All the Bene Tleilax need do was add their own control system, their own way of replicating information stored in the cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Language of God,\" Scytale called it. Language of Shaitan was more appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeedback. The cell directed its own womb. That was more or less what a fertilized ovum did anyway. The Tleilaxu merely refined it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sigh escaped Odrade, bringing sharp glances from her companions. Does Mother Superior have new troubles?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScytale\u0027s revelations trouble me. And what those revelations have done to us. Oh, how we recoiled from the \"debasement.\" Then, rationalizations. And we knew they were rationalizations! \"If there is no other way. If this produces the gholas we need so desperately. Volunteers probably can be found.\" Were found! Volunteers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re woolgathering!\" Tamalane grumbled. She glanced at Bellonda, started to say something and thought better of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda\u0027s face went soft-bland, a frequent accompaniment to her darker moods. Her voice came out little more than a guttural whisper. \"I strongly urge that we eliminate Idaho. And as for that Tleilaxu monster...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you make such a suggestion with a euphemism?\" Tamalane demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill him then! And the Tleilaxu should be subjected to every persuasion we -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it, both of you!\" Odrade ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed both palms briefly against her forehead and, staring at the bow window, saw icy rain out there. Weather Control was making more mistakes. You couldn\u0027t blame them, but there was nothing humans hated more than the unpredictable. \"We want it natural!\" Whatever that means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen such thoughts came over her, Odrade longed for an existence confined to the order that pleased her: an occasional walk in the orchards. She enjoyed them in all seasons. A quiet evening with friends, the give and take of probing conversations with those for whom she felt warmth. Affection? Yes. The Mother Superior dared much - even love of companions. And good meals with drinks chosen for their enhancement of flavors. She wanted that, too. How fine it was to play upon the palate. And later... yes, later - a warm bed with a gentle companion sensitive to her needs as she was sensitive to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of this could not be, of course. Responsibilities! What an enormous word. How it burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting hungry,\" Odrade said. \"Shall I order lunch served here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda and Tamalane stared at her. \"It\u0027s only half past eleven,\" Tamalane complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes or no?\" Odrade insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda and Tamalane exchanged a private look. \"As you wish,\" Bellonda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a saying in the Bene Gesserit (Odrade knew) that the Sisterhood ran smoother when Mother Superior\u0027s stomach was satisfied. That had just tipped the scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade keyed the intercom to her private kitchen. \"Lunch for three, Duana. Something special. You choose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch, when it came, featured a dish Odrade especially enjoyed, a veal casserole. Duana displayed a delicate touch with herbs, a bit of rosemary in the veal, the vegetables not overcooked. Superb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade savored every bite. The other two plodded through the meal, spoon-to-mouth, spoon-to-mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs this one of the reasons I am Mother Superior and they are not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile an acolyte cleared away the remains of lunch, Odrade turned to one of her favorite questions: \"What is the gossip in the common rooms and among the acolytes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered in her own acolyte days how she had hung on the words of the older women, expecting great truths and getting mostly small talk about Sister So-and-so or the latest problems of Proctor X. Occasionally, though, the barriers came down and important data flowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many acolytes talk of wanting to go out in our Scattering,\" Tamalane rasped. \"Sinking ships and rats, I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a great interest in Archives lately,\" Bellonda said. \"Sisters who know better come looking for confirmation - whether such and so acolyte has a heavy Siona gene-mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade found this interesting. Their common Atreides ancestor from the Tyrant\u0027s eons, Siona Ibn Fuad al-Seyefa Atreides, had imparted to her descendants this ability that hid them from prescient searchers. Every person walking openly on Chapterhouse shared that ancestral protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A heavy mark?\" Odrade asked. \"Do they doubt that the ones in question are protected?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want reassurance,\" Bellonda growled. \"And now may I return to Idaho? He has the genetic mark and he does not. It worries me. Why do some of his cells not have the Siona marker? What were the Tleilaxu doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan knows the danger and he\u0027s not suicidal,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know what he is,\" Bellonda complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a Mentat, and we all know what that could mean,\" Tamalane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand why we keep Murbella,\" Bellonda said. \"Valuable information. But Idaho and Scytale...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough!\" Odrade snapped. \"Watchdogs can bark too long!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda accepted this grudgingly. Watchdogs. Their Bene Gesserit term for constant monitoring by Sisters to see that you did not fall into shallow ways. Very trying to acolytes but just another part of life to Reverend Mothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade had explained it one afternoon to Murbella, the two of them alone in a gray-walled interview chamber of the no-ship. Standing close together facing each other. Eyes at a level. Quite informal and intimate. Except for the knowledge of those comeyes all around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watchdogs,\" Odrade said, responding to a question from Murbella. \"It means we are mutual gadflies. Don\u0027t make that more than it is. We seldom nag. A simple word can be enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella, her oval face drawn into a look of distaste, the wide-set green eyes intent, obviously thought Odrade referred to some common signal, a word or saying the Sisters used in such situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any word, dammit! Whatever\u0027s appropriate. It\u0027s like a mutual reflex. We share a common \u0027tic\u0027 that comes not to annoy us. We welcome it because it keeps us on our toes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll watchdog me if I become a Reverend Mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want our watchdogs. We\u0027d be weaker without them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds oppressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t find it so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s repellent.\" She looked at the glittering lenses in the ceiling. \"Like those damned comeyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We take care of our own, Murbella. Once you\u0027re a Bene Gesserit, you\u0027re assured of lifelong maintenance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A comfortable niche.\" Sneering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade spoke softly. \"Something quite different. You are challenged throughout your life. You repay the Sisterhood right up to the limits of your abilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watchdogs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re always mindful of one another. Some of us in positions of power can be authoritarian at times, familiar even, but only to a point carefully measured for the requirements of the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never really warm or tender, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the rule.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affection, maybe, but no love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve told you the rule.\" And Odrade could see the reaction clearly on Murbella\u0027s face: \"There it is! They will demand that I give up Duncan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there\u0027s no love among the Bene Gesserit.\" How sad her tone. There was hope for Murbella yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loves occur, \" Odrade said, \"but my Sisters treat them as aberrations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what I feel for Duncan is aberration?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Sisters will try to treat it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treat! Apply correctional therapy to the afflicted!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love is considered a sign of rot in Sisters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see signs of rot in you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though she followed Odrade\u0027s thoughts, Bellonda dragged Odrade out of reverie. \"That Honored Matre will never commit herself to us!\" Bellonda wiped a bit of luncheon gravy from the corner of her mouth. \"We\u0027re wasting our time trying to teach her our ways.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least Bell was no longer calling Murbella \"whore,\" Odrade thought. That was an improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible. Such people have a tendency to become drunk on violence, a condition to which they are quickly addicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Missionaria Protectiva, Text QIV (decto)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca knelt on the yellow tile floor as she had been ordered to do, not daring to look up at Great Honored Matre seated so remotely high, so dangerous. Two hours Rebecca had waited here almost in the center of a giant room while Great Honored Matre and her companions ate a lunch served by obsequious attendants. Rebecca marked the manners of the attendants with care and emulated them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eye sockets still ached from transplants the Rabbi had given her less than a month ago. These eyes showed a blue iris and white sclera, no clue to the Spice Agony in her past. It was a temporary defense. In less than a year, the new eyes would betray her with total blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe judged the ache in her eyes to be the least of her problems. An organic implant fed her metered doses of melange, concealing her dependence. The supply was gauged to last about sixty days. If these Honored Matres held her longer than that, withdrawal would plunge her into an agony that would make the original appear mild by comparison. The most immediately dangerous thing was the shere being metered to her with the spice. If these women detected it, they certainly would be suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are doing well. Be patient. That was Other Memory from the horde of Lampadas. The voice rang softly in her head. It had the sound of Lucilla but Rebecca could not be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had become a familiar voice in the months since the Sharing when it had announced itself as \"Speaker of your Mohalata.\" These whores cannot match our knowledge. Remember that and let it give you courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe presence of Others Within who subtracted none of her attention from what went on around her had filled her with awe. We call it Simulflow, Speaker had said. Simulflow multiplies your awareness. When she had tried to explain this to the Rabbi, he had reacted in anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have been tainted by unclean thoughts!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been in the Rabbi\u0027s study late at night. \"Stealing time from the days allotted us,\" he called it. The study was an underground room, its walls lined with old books, ridulian crystals, scrolls. The room was protected from probes by the best Ixian devices and they had been modified by his own people to improve them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was allowed to sit beside his desk at such times while he leaned back in an old chair. A glowglobe placed low beside him cast an antique yellow light on his bearded face, glinting off the spectacles he wore almost as badge of office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca pretended confusion. \"But you said it was required of us to save this treasure from Lampadas. Have the Bene Gesserit not been honorable with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the worry in his eyes. \"You heard Levi talking yesterday of the questions being asked here. Why did the Bene Gesserit witch come to us? That is what they ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our story is consistent and believable,\" Rebecca protested. \"The Sisters have taught us ways that even Truthsay cannot penetrate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know... I don\u0027t know.\" The Rabbi shook his head sadly. \"What is a lie? What is truth? Do we condemn ourselves with our own mouths?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is pogrom that we resist, Rabbi!\" That usually stiffened his resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cossacks! Yes, you are right, daughter. There have been Cossacks in every age and we are not the only ones who have felt their knouts and swords as they rode into the village with murder in their hearts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was odd, Rebecca thought, how he managed to give the impression that these events were of recent occurrence and that his eyes had seen them. Never to forgive, never to forget. Lidiche was yesterday. What a powerful thing that was in the memory of Secret Israel. Pogrom! Almost as powerful in its continuity as these Bene Gesserit presences she carried in her awareness. Almost. That was the thing the Rabbi resisted, she told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fear that you have been taken from us,\" the Rabbi said. \"What have I done to you? What have I done? And all in the name of honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the instruments on his study wall that reported the nightly power accumulations from the vertical-axis windmills placed around the farmstead. The instruments said the machines were humming away up there, storing energy for the morrow. That was a gift of the Bene Gesserit: freedom from Ix. Independence. What a peculiar word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking at Rebecca, he said: \" I find this thing of Other Memory very difficult and always have. Memory should bring wisdom but it does not. It is how we order the memory and where we apply our knowledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and looked at her, his face falling into shadows. \"What is it this one inside you says? This one you think of as Lucilla?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca could see it pleased him to say Lucilla\u0027s name. If Lucilla could speak through a daughter of Secret Israel, then she still lived and had not been betrayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca lowered her gaze as she spoke. \"She says we have these inner images, sounds and sensations that come at command or intrude under necessity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Necessity, yes! And what is that except reports of senses from flesh that may have been where you should not have been and done offensive things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther bodies, other memories, Rebecca thought. Having experienced this she knew she could never willingly abandon it. Perhaps I have indeed become Bene Gesserit. That is what he fears, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will tell you a thing,\" the Rabbi said. \"This \u0027crucial intersection of living awareness,\u0027 as they call it, that is nothing unless you know how your own decisions go out from you like threads into the lives of others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To see our own actions in the reactions of others, yes, that is how the Sisters view it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is wisdom. What is it the lady says they seek?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Influence on the maturing of humankind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmmmm. And she finds that events are not beyond her influence, merely beyond her senses. That is almost wise. But maturity... ahhh, Rebecca. Do we interfere with a higher plan? Is it the right of humans to set limits on the nature of Yaweh? I think Leto II understood that. This lady in you denies it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She says he was a damnable tyrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was but there have been wise tyrants before him and doubtless will be more after us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They call him Shaitan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had Satan\u0027s own powers. I share their fear of that. He was not so much prescient as he was a cement. He fixed the shape of what he saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is what the lady says. But she says it is their grail that he preserved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again, they are almost wise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great sigh shook the Rabbi and once more he looked to the instruments on his wall. Energy for the morrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned his attention to Rebecca. She was changed. He could not avoid awareness of it. She had become very like the Bene Gesserit. It was understandable. Her mind was filled with all of those people from Lampadas. But they were not Gadarene swine to be driven into the sea and their diabolism with them. And I am not another Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This thing they tell you about the Mother Superior Odrade - that she often damns her own Archivists and the Archives with them. What a thing! Are not Archives like the books in which we preserve our wisdom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then am I an Archivist, Rabbi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer question confounded him but it also illuminated the problem. He smiled. \" I tell you something, daughter. I admit to a little sympathy with this Odrade. There is always something grumbling about Archivists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that wisdom, Rabbi?\" How slyly she asked it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, daughter, it is. How carefully the Archivist suppresses even the smallest hint of judgment. One word after another. Such arrogance!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do they judge which words to use, Rabbi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhh, a bit of wisdom comes to you, daughter. But these Bene Gesserit have not achieved wisdom and it is their grail that prevents it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see it on his face. He tries to arm me with doubts about these lives I carry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me tell you a thing about the Bene Gesserit,\" he said. Nothing came into his mind then. No words, no sage advice. This had not happened to him for years. There was only one course open to him: speak from the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps they have been too long on the road to Damascus without a blinding flash of illumination, Rebecca. I hear them say they act for the benefit of humankind. Somehow, I cannot see this in them, nor do I believe the Tyrant saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Rebecca started to reply, he stopped her with an upraised hand. \"Mature humanity? That is their grail? Is it not the mature fruit that is plucked and eaten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the floor of junction\u0027s Great Hall, Rebecca remembered these words, seeing the personification of them not in the lives she preserved but in the actions of her captors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat Honored Matre had finished eating. She wiped her hands on the gown of an attendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her approach,\" Great Honored Matre said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain lanced Rebecca\u0027s left shoulder and she lurched forward on her knees. The one called Logno had come up behind with the stealth of a hunter and had jabbed a shuntgoad into the captive\u0027s flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughter echoed through the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca staggered to her feet and, staying just ahead of the goad, arrived at the foot of the steps leading up to the Great Honored Matre where the goad stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down!\" Logno emphasized the command with another jab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca sank to her knees and stared straight ahead at the risers of the steps. The yellow tiles displayed tiny scratches. Somehow, these flaws reassured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat Honored Matre said: \"Let her be, Logno. I wish answers, not screams.\" Then to Rebecca: \"Look at me, woman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca raised her eyes and stared up at the face of death. What an unremarkable face it was to have that threat in it. So... so evenly featured. Almost plain. Such a small figure. This amplified the peril Rebecca sensed. What powers the small woman must have to rule these terrible people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know why you are here?\" Great Honored Matre demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her most obsequious tones, Rebecca said: \" I was told, O Great Honored Matre, that you wished me to recount the lore of Truthsay and other matters of Gammu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were mated to a Truthsayer!\" It was accusation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is dead, Great Honored Matre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Logno!\" This was directed at the aide who lunged forward with the goad. \"This wretch does not know our ways. Now, go stand at the side, Logno, where I will not be annoyed by your impetuosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will speak to me only in response to questions or when I command it, wretch!\" Great Honored Matre shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca cringed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker whispered in Rebecca\u0027s head: That was almost Voice. Be warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever known any of the ones who call themselves Bene Gesserit?\" Great Honored Matre asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally now! \"Everyone has encountered the witches, Great Honored Matre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this is why they brought me here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only what I have heard, Great Honored Matre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they brave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is said they always try to avoid risks, Great Honored Matre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are worthy of us, Rebecca. That is the pattern of these whores. The marble rolls down the incline in its proper channel. They think you dislike us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are these Bene Gesserit rich?\" Great Honored Matre asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I think the witches are poor beside you, Honored Matre,\" Rebecca said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that? Do not speak just to please me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Honored Matre, could the witches send a great ship from Gammu to here just to carry me? And where are the witches now? They hide from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, where are they?\" Honored Matre demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you on Gammu when the one they called Bashar fled us?\" Honored Matre asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knows you were. \"I was there, Great Honored Matre, and heard the stories. I do not believe them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe what we tell you to believe, wretch! What are the stories you heard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That he moved with a speed the eye could not see. That he killed many... people with only his hands. That he stole a no-ship and fled into the Scattering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe that he fled, wretch.\" See how she fears! She cannot hide the trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speak of the Truthsay,\" Great Honored Matre commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great Honored Matre, I do not understand the Truthsay. I know only the words of my Sholem, my husband. I can repeat his words if you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat Honored Matre considered this, glancing from side to side at her aides and councillors, who were beginning to show signs of boredom. Why doesn\u0027t she just kill this wretch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca, seeing the violence in eyes that glared orange at her, shrank into herself. She thought of her husband by his love-name, Shoel, now, and his words comforted. He had shown the \"proper talent\" while still a child. Some called it an instinct but Shoel had never used that word. \"Trust your gut feelings. That\u0027s what my teachers always said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was such a down-to-earth expression that he said it usually threw off the ones who came seeking \"the esoteric mystery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no secret,\" Shoel had said. \"It\u0027s training and hard work like anything else. You exercise what they call \u0027petit perception,\u0027 the ability to detect very small variations in human reactions.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca could see such small reactions in those who stared down at her. They want me dead. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker had advice. The great one likes to show off her power over the others. She does not do what others want but what she thinks they do not want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great Honored Matre,\" Rebecca ventured, \"you are so rich and powerful. Surely you must have a place of menial employment where I may be of service to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wish to enter my service?\" What a feral grin!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would make me happy, Great Honored Matre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not here to make you happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogno took a step forward onto the floor. \"Then make us happy, Dama. Let us have some sport with -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silence!\" Ahhh, that was a mistake, calling her by the intimate name here among the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogno drew back and almost dropped the goad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat Honored Matre stared down at Rebecca with an orange glare. \"You will go back to your miserable existence on Gammu, wretch. I will not kill you. That would be a mercy. Having seen what we could give you, live your life without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great Honored Matre!\" Logno protested. \"We have suspicions about -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have suspicions about you, Logno. Send her back and alive! Hear me? Do you think us incapable of finding her if we ever have need of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Great Honored Matre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are watching you, wretch,\" Great Honored Matre said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBait! She thinks of you as something to capture larger game. How interesting. This one has a head and uses it in spite of her violent nature. So that\u0027s how she came to power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the way back to Gammu, confined to stinking quarters in a ship that had once served the Guild, Rebecca considered her predicament. Surely, those whores had not expected her to mistake their intent. But... perhaps they did. Subservience, cringing. They revel in such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew this came from a bit of her Shoel\u0027s Truthsay as much as from the Lampadas advisors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You accumulate a lot of small observations, sensed but never brought to consciousness, Shoel had said. \"Cumulatively, they say things to you but not in a language anyone speaks. Language isn\u0027t necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had thought this one of the oddest things she had ever heard. But that was before her own Agony. In bed at night, comforted by darkness and the touch of loving flesh, they had acted wordlessly but had shared words, too. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-4.html","bookId":2158,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM"}
