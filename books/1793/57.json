Believe me when I say I understand your feelings on that particular subject.\" Jeremy paused a couple of beats. \"Octavia said I should ask myself whether you or Laura had ever lied to me about other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come up with any answers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Laura lied to me about a couple of other matters. Important stuff. Guess we had a communication problem.\" Jeremy used the chalk on the tip of his cue. \"Couldn\u0027t think of any times when you had lied to me, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick studied the table. \"No offense, but I didn\u0027t even like Laura very much. Always had the feeling that she figured she\u0027d married beneath herself when she married you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No offense, but I didn\u0027t care much for Amelia. Figured she was more in love with Harte Investments than she was with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may have been right.\" He took his shot and waited until the ball dropped. \"But she was a good mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That counts,\" Jeremy said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Counts for a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least you have Carson. I found out the hard way that Laura didn\u0027t want kids. At least she didn\u0027t want them with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carson made it all worthwhile,\" Nick agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the growing crowd in the other room got louder. Someone cranked up the music system another notch. The hard-driving song playing now was about guys getting drunk on cheap whiskey and engaging in bar fights over good women gone bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to think that we both thought we knew what we were doing when it came to the female of the species.\" Jeremy drank some beer while he watched Nick take another shot. \"Guess we had a lot to learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe atmosphere around the table was more comfortable now. A lot of the tension was leaking out of it. Maybe it was the beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Jeremy said, \"who do you think took the Upsall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever is trying to pin the blame on Octavia. This is personal. I can feel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t make sense. Octavia hasn\u0027t hurt anyone here in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but her great-aunt did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the old stories, Claudia Banner\u0027s victims were Hartes and Madisons.\" Jeremy made a bridge and angled his cue stick. \"You think maybe there were others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandfather used the term collateral damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy banked a shot. \"You know, my grandmother was a woman in her twenties when Harte-Madison fell apart. She grew up in this burg and knew everyone. Plays bridge every week with three other women who also have a lot of history in this town. They might remember something useful about the good old days. Want me to talk to her? See if she can get anything out of her bridge group? I\u0027m sure she\u0027d enjoy playing Mata Hari.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d appreciate that,\" Nick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music got louder and so did the crowd. Other players drifted into the back room and took over the remaining tables. Smoke from the cigarettes of neighboring players started to foul the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting late,\" Nick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy shrugged. \"One more game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick had just racked the balls for another round when a familiar voice rumbled from the opening that divided the pool room from the bar area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if it isn\u0027t the SOB who thinks he\u0027s the king of Eclipse Bay.\" Eugene slurred most of the s\u0027s and there were a lot of them in the sentence, but his meaning was clear. \"And will you look at that, Dwayne? He\u0027s shooting a little pool with his good buddy Jeremy. Isn\u0027t that sweet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe players at the other tables did not look toward the pair in the doorway. Everyone pretended to concentrate on their games. But Nick knew that the crowd was listening intently to every word. The tension was suddenly so thick he could have carved it into topiary shapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were right,\" Jeremy said quietly. He did not bother to glance at Eugene and Dwayne either. \"Time to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doin\u0027 here, anyway, Harte?\" Eugene bellowed. \"Shouldn\u0027t you be with that little redheaded suspect of yours? Everyone knows she\u0027s been screwing your brains out so\u0027s you\u0027ll overlook the fact that she stole that painting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick set the cue down very slowly. On the other side of the table, Jeremy did the same. This time they both looked at Mutt and Jeff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark room fell silent. None of the other players moved so much as a finger. Everyone waited for the other shoe to drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick looked at Eugene. \"You don\u0027t want to say anything more, Eugene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was obvious that Eugene was too drunk to worry about consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you can threaten me?\" Eugene stalked closer, hands clenched at his sides. \"You really think I\u0027m gonna put up with that kind of shit from a Harte?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right, Eugene,\" Jeremy said softly. \"You don\u0027t want to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not takin\u0027 any crap off you, either, Seaton. You think you can come back to town after all these years and start actin\u0027 like you\u0027re better than the rest of us again just because your mama married a Seaton and you hang with Nick Harte? Got news for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Nick said to Jeremy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine by me.\" Jeremy started around the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something me and Dwayne, here, been wondering about, Harte.\" Eugene came to a halt, blocking the path to the door. He leered. \"Is she a natural redhead? She as red down there as she is up on top?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick moved around the comer of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy,\" Jeremy said out of the side of his mouth. \"The plan is to get out of here, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The plan,\" Nick said, coming to a halt directly in front of the pool table, \"is to tell everyone here a little story about Eugene and Dwayne\u0027s excellent adventure in Seattle a while back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut your mouth, Harte,\" Eugene roared. \"Just shut your damned mouth. Say one more word and I\u0027ll rip your head off your shoulders and use it for a cue ball.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, nobody cares if you\u0027re screwin\u0027 the redhead. Nobody gives a shit about your sex life, Harte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except you, apparently, Eugene,\" one of the other players offered helpfully. \"But maybe that\u0027s because Harte\u0027s sex life is a lot more interesting than yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene turned purple, drew his head into his shoulders in the manner of a large turtle, and lumbered forward. He was surprisingly fast for a man of his size and bulk. The old football training, Nick figured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell,\" Jeremy muttered. \"So much for a quick exit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick did not move until the last instant. Then he sidestepped the ferocious charge. Eugene still had speed, but his maneuverability was shot. He blundered straight on, past the point where Nick had stood a second earlier, and crashed into the table. He folded over and went facedown on the green felt. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-57.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
