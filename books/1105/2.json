and on the other side of this there arose another mountain, steep but unbroken like that which they were passing,—unbroken, so that the eye could stretch from the river up to the very summit. \u0026nbsp;Not a spot on that mountain side or on their side either was left uncovered by thick forest, which had stood there untouched by man since nature first produced it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But all this was nothing to our travellers, nor was the clang of the macaws anything, or the roaring of the little congo ape. \u0026nbsp;Nothing was gained by them from beautiful scenery, nor was there any fear from the beasts of prey. \u0026nbsp;The immediate pain of each step of the journey drove all other feelings from them, and their thoughts were bounded by an intense desire for the evening halt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then, as the guide had prophesied, the rain began. \u0026nbsp;At first it came in such small soft drops that it was found to be refreshing, but the clouds soon gathered and poured forth their collected waters as though it had not rained for months among those mountains. \u0026nbsp;Not that it came in big drops, or with the violence which wind can give it, beating hither and thither, breaking branches from the trees, and rising up again as it pattered against the ground. \u0026nbsp;There was no violence in the rain. \u0026nbsp;It fell softly in a long, continuous, noiseless stream, sinking into everything that it touched, converting the deep rich earth on all sides into mud.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Not a word was said by any of them as it came on. \u0026nbsp;The Indian covered the baby with her blanket, closer than she was covered before, and the guide who walked by Mrs. Arkwright’s side drew her cloak around her knees. \u0026nbsp;But such efforts were in vain. \u0026nbsp;There is a rain that will penetrate everything, and such was the rain which fell upon them now. \u0026nbsp;Nevertheless, as I have said, hardly a word was spoken. \u0026nbsp;The poor woman, finding that the heat of her cloak increased her sufferings, threw it open again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Fanny,” said her husband, “you had better let him protect you as well as he can.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She answered him merely by an impatient wave of her hand, intending to signify that she could not speak, but that in this matter she must have her way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After that her husband made no further attempt to control her. \u0026nbsp;He could see, however, that ever and again she would have slipped forward from her mule and fallen, had not the man by her side steadied her with his hand. \u0026nbsp;At every tree he protected her knees and feet, though there was hardly room for him to move between the beast and the bank against which he was thrust.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then, at last, that day’s work was also over, and Fanny Arkwright slipped from her pillion down into her husband’s arms at the door of another rancho in the forest. \u0026nbsp;Here there lived a large family adding from year to year to the patch of ground which they had rescued from the wood, and valiantly doing their part in the extension of civilisation. \u0026nbsp;Our party was but a few steps from the door when they left their mules, but Mrs. Arkwright did not now as heretofore hasten to receive her baby in her arms. \u0026nbsp;When placed upon the ground, she still leaned against the mule, and her husband saw that he must carry her into the hut. \u0026nbsp;This he did, and then, wet, mud-laden, dishevelled as she was, she laid herself down upon the planks that were to form her bed, and there stretched out her arms for her infant. \u0026nbsp;On that evening they undressed and tended her like a child; and then when she was alone with her husband, she repeated to him her sad foreboding.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Harry,” she said, “I shall never see my mother again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, yes, Fanny, you will see her and talk over all these troubles with pleasure. \u0026nbsp;It is very bad, I know;

but when she was again taken from her mule she was in tears. \u0026nbsp;The poor servant-girl, too, was almost prostrate with fatigue, and absolutely unable to wait upon her mistress, or even to do anything for herself. \u0026nbsp;Nevertheless they did make the second stage, seeing that their mid-day resting place had been under the trees of the forest. \u0026nbsp;Had there been any hut there, they would have remained for the night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the following day they rested altogether, though the place at which they remained had but few attractions. \u0026nbsp;It was another forest hut inhabited by an old Spanish couple who were by no means willing to give them room, although they paid for their accommodation at exorbitant rates. \u0026nbsp;It is one singularity of places strange and out of the way like such forest tracks as these, that money in small sums is hardly valued. \u0026nbsp;Dollars there were not appreciated as sixpences are in this rich country. \u0026nbsp;But there they stayed for a day, and the guides employed themselves in making a litter with long poles so that they might carry Mrs. Arkwright over a portion of the ground. \u0026nbsp;Poor fellows! \u0026nbsp;When once she had thus changed her mode of conveyance, she never again was lifted on to the mule.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was strong reason against this day’s delay. \u0026nbsp;They were to go down the Serapiqui along with the post, which would overtake them on its banks. \u0026nbsp;But if the post should pass them before they got there, it could not wait; and then they would be deprived of the best canoe on the water. \u0026nbsp;Then also it was possible, if they encountered further delay, that the steamer might sail from Greytown without them, and a month’s residence at that frightful place be thus made necessary.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The day’s rest apparently did little to relieve Mrs. Arkwright’s sufferings. \u0026nbsp;On the following day she allowed herself to be put upon the mule, but after the first hour the beasts were stopped and she was taken off it. \u0026nbsp;During that hour they had travelled hardly over half a league. \u0026nbsp;At that time she so sobbed and moaned that Arkwright absolutely feared that she would perish in the forest, and he implored the guides to use the poles which they had prepared. \u0026nbsp;She had declared to him over and over again that she felt sure that she should die, and, half-delirious with weariness and suffering, had begged him to leave her at the last hut. \u0026nbsp;They had not yet come to the flat ground over which a litter might be carried with comparative ease; but nevertheless the men yielded, and she was placed in a recumbent position upon blankets, supported by boughs of trees. \u0026nbsp;In this way she went through that day with somewhat less of suffering than before, and without that necessity for self-exertion which had been worse to her than any suffering.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were places between that and the river at which one would have said that it was impossible that a litter should be carried, or even impossible that a mule should walk with a load on his back. \u0026nbsp;But still they went on, and the men carried their burden without complaining. \u0026nbsp;Not a word was said about money, or extra pay;—not a word, at least by them; and when Arkwright was profuse in his offer, their leader told him that they would not have done it for money. \u0026nbsp;But for the poor suffering Se?ora they would make exertions which no money would have bought from them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the next day about noon the post did pass them, consisting of three strong men carrying great weights on their backs, suspended by bands from their foreheads. \u0026nbsp;They travelled much quicker than our friends, and would reach the banks of the river that evening. \u0026nbsp;In their ordinary course they would start down the river close upon daybreak on the following day; but, after some consultation with the guides, they agreed to wait till noon. \u0026nbsp;Poor Mrs. Arkwright knew nothing of hours or of any such arrangements now, but her husband greatly doubted their power of catching this mail despatch. \u0026nbsp;However, it did not much depend on their exertions that afternoon. \u0026nbsp;Their resting-place was marked out for them, and they could not go beyond it, unless indeed they could make the whole journey, which was impossible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But towards evening matters seemed to improve with them. \u0026nbsp;They had now got on to ground which was more open, and the men who carried the litter could walk with greater ease. \u0026nbsp;Mrs. Arkwright also complained less, and when they reached their resting-place on that night, said nothing of a wish to be left there to her fate. \u0026nbsp;This was a place called Padregal, a cacao plantation, which had been cleared in the forest with much labour. \u0026nbsp;There was a house here containing three rooms, and some forty or fifty acres round it had been stripped of the forest trees. \u0026nbsp;But nevertheless the adventure had not been a prosperous one, for the place was at that time deserted. \u0026nbsp;There were the cacao plants, but there was no one to pick the cacao. \u0026nbsp;There was a certain melancholy beauty about the place. \u0026nbsp;A few grand trees had been left standing near the house, and the grass around was rich and park-like. \u0026nbsp;But it was deserted, and nothing was heard but the roaring of the congos. \u0026nbsp;Ah me! \u0026nbsp;Indeed it was a melancholy place as it was seen by some of that party afterwards.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the following morning they were astir very early, and Mrs. Arkwright was so much better that she offered to sit again upon her mule. \u0026nbsp;The men, however, declared that they would finish their task, and she was placed again upon the litter. \u0026nbsp;And then with slow and weary step they did make their way to the river bank. \u0026nbsp;It was not yet noon when they saw the mud fort which stands there, and as they drew into the enclosure round a small house which stands close by the river side, they saw the three postmen still busy about their packages.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank God!” said Arkwright.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank God, indeed!” said his brother. \u0026nbsp;“All will be right with you now.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, Fanny,” said her husband, as he took her very gently from the litter and seated her on a bench which stood outside the door. \u0026nbsp;“It is all over now,—is it not?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She answered him by a shower of tears, but they were tears which brought her relief. \u0026nbsp;He was aware of this, and therefore stood by her, still holding her by both her hands while her head rested against his side. \u0026nbsp;“You will find the motion of the boat very gentle,” he said; “indeed there will be no motion, and you and baby will sleep all the way down to Greytown.” \u0026nbsp;She did not answer him in words, but she looked up into his face, and he could see that her spirit was recovering itself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was almost a crowd of people collected on the spot, preparatory to the departure of the canoes. \u0026nbsp;In the first place there was the commandant of the fort, to whom the small house belonged. \u0026nbsp;He was looking to the passports of our friends, and with due diligence endeavouring to make something of the occasion, by discovering fatal legal impediments to the further prosecution of their voyage, which impediments would disappear on the payment of certain dollars. \u0026nbsp;And then there were half a dozen Costa Rican soldiers, men with coloured caps and old muskets, ready to support the dignity and authority of the commandant. \u0026nbsp;There were the guides taking payment from Abel Ring for their past work, and the postmen preparing their boats for the further journey. \u0026nbsp;And then there was a certain German there, with a German servant, to whom the boats belonged. \u0026nbsp;He also was very busy preparing for the river voyage. \u0026nbsp;He was not going down with them, but it was his business to see them well started. \u0026nbsp;A singular looking man was he, with a huge shaggy beard, and shaggy uncombed hair, but with bright blue eyes, which gave to his face a remarkable look of sweetness. \u0026nbsp;He was an uncouth man to the eye, and yet a child would have trusted herself with him in a forest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At this place they remained some two hours. \u0026nbsp;Coffee was prepared here, and Mrs. Arkwright refreshed herself and her child. \u0026nbsp;They washed and arranged their clothes, and when she stepped down the steep bank, clinging to her husband’s arm as she made her way towards the boat, she smiled upon him as he looked at her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is all over now,—is it not, my girl?”—he said, encouraging her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, Harry, do not talk about it,” she answered, shuddering.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But I want you to say a word to me to let me know that you are better.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am better,—much better.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And you will see your mother again;

but it is not so rapid as to make any recognised danger in the embarkation. \u0026nbsp;Below this bank, which is opposite to the spot at which the boats were entered, there were four or five broken trees in the water, some of the shattered boughs of which showed themselves above the surface. \u0026nbsp;These are called snags, and are very dangerous if they are met with in the course of the stream; but in this instance no danger was apprehended from them, as they lay considerably to the left of the passage which the boats would take. \u0026nbsp;The first canoe was pushed off by the German, and went rapidly away. \u0026nbsp;The waters were strong with rain, and it was pretty to see with what velocity the boat was carried on some hundred of yards in advance of the other by the force of the first effort of the paddle. \u0026nbsp;The German, however, from the bank holloaed to the first men in Spanish, bidding them relax their efforts for awhile; and then he said a word or two of caution to those who were now on the point of starting.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The boat then was pushed steadily forward, the man at the stern keeping it with his paddle a little farther away from the bank at which they had embarked. \u0026nbsp;It was close under the land that the stream ran the fastest, and in obedience to the directions given to him he made his course somewhat nearer to the sunken trees. \u0026nbsp;It was but one turn of his hand that gave the light boat its direction, but that turn of the hand was too strong. \u0026nbsp;Had the anxious master of the canoes been but a thought less anxious, all might have been well; but, as it was, the prow of the boat was caught by some slight hidden branch which impeded its course and turned it round in the rapid river. \u0026nbsp;The whole lengths of the canoe was thus brought against the sunken tree, and in half a minute the five occupants of the boat were struggling in the stream.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Abel Ring and the German were both standing on the bank close to the water when this happened, and each for a moment looked into the other’s face. \u0026nbsp;“Stand where you are,” shouted the German, “so that you may assist them from the shore. \u0026nbsp;I will go in.” \u0026nbsp;And then, throwing from him his boots and coat, he plunged into the river.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The canoe had been swept round so as to be brought by the force of the waters absolutely in among the upturned roots and broken stumps of the trees which impeded the river, and thus, when the party was upset, they were at first to be seen scrambling among the branches. \u0026nbsp;But unfortunately there was much more wood below the water than above it, and the force of the stream was so great, that those who caught hold of the timber were not able to support themselves by it above the surface. \u0026nbsp;Arkwright was soon to be seen some forty yards down, having been carried clear of the trees, and here he got out of the river on the farther bank. \u0026nbsp;The distance to him was not above forty yards, but from the nature of the ground he could not get up towards his wife, unless he could have forced his way against the stream.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Indian who had had charge of the baby rose quickly to the surface, was carried once round in the eddy, with his head high above the water, and then was seen to throw himself among the broken wood. \u0026nbsp;He had seen the dress of the poor woman, and made his effort to save her. \u0026nbsp;The other two men were so caught by the fragments of the boughs, that they could not extricate themselves so as to make any exertions;
