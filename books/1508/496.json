If he’s dead then he’s dead. For him to be able to buy a bit of time could be said to be his highest contribution.” Xuan Wuji thought little of this Elder’s death. Compared to the Nirvana Dragon Root, the death of an Elder who wasn’t even of the Xuan bloodline was nothing at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a sneer, Xuan Wuji took out another pale blue array bead from his spatial ring. This bead was obtained by Xuan Wuji the same time that he found the ‘Ancient Devil Arts’ as well as the Demon Emperor’s letter in some ancient ruins. This bead was named the Enchantment Bead!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith Xuan Wuji’s speed, he didn’t fear that Abbot Whitebrow or Nanyun Wang would be able to catch up to him. He was only looking after the other South Sea Demon Region Elders. If too many of their Elders died, then the overall strength of the South Sea Demon Region would suffer a great setback.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What a bunch of stupid pigs. This old man has exhausted himself, suffered endless hardship and paid an immense price all in order to open a path to the Demon God Imperial Palace. How could I possibly give it away like this?” Xuan Wuji activated the spell inside of the bead and tossed it out!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBehind the South Sea Demon Region Elders that followed him, the Enchantment Bead suddenly activated. A pale blue enchantment flashed into existence like a thick spider web, blocking the path.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMeanwhile, the transmission array was just in front of them. Xuan Wuji had already investigated this transmission array earlier. This transmission array could be used!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: left\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs long as he passed through the transmission array, he could escape outside. As for the others, without him and his secret technique, they would likely be trapped in the Demon God Imperial Palace. Just leaving here would be a major problem!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-494\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-496\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-495","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:18 AM"}
