{"id":66818,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\u003cp\u003e63.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black and white kitten was stalking my pencil eraser. It had white paws and a patch of white fur on its chest. It was slowly picking its way across my cluttered desk, around a Vicks Chloraseptic, over the latest James Rollins novel, and finally peering around my water bottle. From there it had a good view of the pencil eraser, which, coincidentally was twitching invitingly in my fingers. Now within perfect pouncing range, the kitten dug its hind paws into the grain of my pine desk, wound itself tight as a drum, then sprang forward, pouncing like a true champion. The eraser didn\u0027t stand a chance. The kitten and pencil rolled together across my desk in a furry ball of black and white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy door opened, and in came defense attorney Charlie Brown and his faithful assistant Mary Cho. Charlie was bald as ever and Mary Cho\u0027s skirt still hung just above her knees. Nice knees. I looked up at her; she was frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaught again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie walked over and dropped an envelope on my desktop. The kitten pounced on the envelope. Charlie jumped back, surprised as hell that something on my desk actually moved. He straightened his tie and cleared his throat, tried his best to look venerable. When he spoke, he kept his eye on the feline just in case it should make an attempt on his jugular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bonus,\" he said to me. \"For catching the bad guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the envelope, which at the moment was feeling the unholy wrath of the furry critter. \"You don\u0027t give a shit about the bad guy. Your client\u0027s free, and that\u0027s all that matters to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do give a shit, and I resent you saying that. That\u0027s slander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So sue me. Know any good attorneys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, Knighthorse. If you quit being such a hardass, I might throw you some more cases, seeing as you performed above expectations on this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flattery will get you nowhere, Charlie,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Charles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the kitten and thrust it toward the attorney; he jumped back, stepping on his assistant\u0027s toes, who stifled a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Would you like to hold him, Charlie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, godammit. And it\u0027s Charlie. I mean Charles. Fuck.\" He turned and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assistant Cho, how about you: would you like to pet my kitty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a pig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were gone, I brought the kitten to my face and kissed his little wet nose. \"What did I say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat Peterson left her abusive husband and she and her daughter moved in with her sister in a modest Spanish-style home in a city called Temecula, in a neighboring county called Riverside, a county made popular in many a Perry Mason novel. I pulled up in front of the house and, kitten in hand, walked up to the front door and rang the bell. As I waited, the kitten made every effort to kill my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been fun having you around,\" I said to him. \"But you\u0027re going to grow up with a little girl now. You take good care of her, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gnawed on my thumb, purring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and once again I found myself staring down at little Alyssa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tinker Bell ran away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bent down and handed her the kitten. She gasped, then ripped the little booger from my fingers and hugged it with everything she had. The kitten, perhaps realizing that it had met its energetic match, submitted to the unabashed love. She twirled him around and around and dashed inside the house screaming for her mother to look at Tinker Bell Jr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf ever a kitten was destined to be gay, it was Tinker Bell Jr. Of course, there\u0027s nothing wrong with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps echoed along the tiled entryway, and Cat Peterson appeared in the doorway. She was smiling, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know her cat ran away?\" she asked me, leaning a shoulder against the doorframe. There was a hint of a smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might be better if you didn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, suddenly somber. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was motionless; she wasn\u0027t looking at me. Suddenly, and with surprising speed, she threw herself into my arms and thanked me over and over again for finding her daughter\u0027s killer. She didn\u0027t let go and I let her hold me and cry on me, and we stood like that for a long, long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e64.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rare spring storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCindy and I were sitting together on my sofa, my arm around her shoulders, looking out through my open patio doors. The rain was coming down steadily and hard, drumming on my glass patio table. In the distance, above the rooftop of the restaurants, the sky was slate gray, low and ominous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like this kind of weather,\" said Cindy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s different. Don\u0027t you ever get tired of the never-ending sunny days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you ever think that it\u0027s nice for the land to replenish itself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only when you bring it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanna walk in the rain?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought your leg hurt in this kind of weather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s nothing like the hurt you\u0027ve been putting it through these past few weeks,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was blinded to the pain,\" I said, \"pursuing an old dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not blinded now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"The blinders are off. And now my leg just hurts like hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your dream?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dream was there for the taking. I didn\u0027t take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People change. Dreams change. Life goes on. If I really wanted it, I would pursue it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t really want it? Is that because of me? God, I feel horrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not because of you. When I was twenty-two, I wanted to prove I could play in the NFL. I wanted to prove I was tough enough. I had no other goals in life, no other conceivable ambition. Then, suddenly, I was forced to rethink and refocus my life, and I discovered that I could live without playing football.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ve always been...bitter towards being a detective. Because it was something your father did. It was something that caused him not to be in your life when you were growing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father runs a big agency. I am determined never to be that big. But you\u0027re right, I was bitter towards my job. It was not my first choice. But then something happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You discovered you were good at detecting,\" she said. \"Damn good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about proving yourself in the NFL?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe some things are better left unproven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you think you could have made it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a heartbeat.\" I said. \"Wanna go for that walk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew she didn\u0027t want to get wet, but she did it for me. We got our coats on. I grabbed an umbrella for her. I didn\u0027t mind getting wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, in the rain, we moved slowly along Main Street. The shops and stores were all open, and a trickle of tourists, looking confused at this unprecedented Southern California weather, moved past us. I heard one of them say: \"We can get rain at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t please everyone,\" I said to Cindy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want some chocolate?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm, sounds yummy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ducked into The Chocolatiers. A massive peanut butter cup for me and a sugar-free almond rocca for Cindy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sugar-free?\" I asked, when we stepped outside again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t taste the difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus it\u0027s half the calories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat down on a bench under an awning and ate our chocolate and watched the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Derrick doing?\" asked Cindy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His family is moving east. Hard to have a normal life after being accused of murder. Kid will be looked at differently, no matter how innocent he is. UCLA is interested in giving him a scholarship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have anything to do with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I happen to know a few people there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So your work here is done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away, inhaling deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out and placed her hand on top of mine. It was warm and comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re thinking of your mother,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept looking away. \"Her killer is still out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain continued to fall. She continued holding my hand. She squeezed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to find him,\" she said. It wasn\u0027t a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what I will do to him when I find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that worry you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it doesn\u0027t worry me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-horse-jim-knighthorse-1/page-23.html","bookId":2351,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:30 AM"}
