She frowned as she slipped on her lab coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Father, haven\u0027t you eaten yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh? Certainly I have...Oh, what\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is lunch. Or it was, once. What you ate must have been breakfast. Now there\u0027s no sense in my buying meals and bringing them here if you\u0027re not going to eat them. I\u0027m just going to make you go home for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get excited. I\u0027ll eat it. I can\u0027t interrupt a vital experiment every time you think I ought to eat, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grew cheerful again over the dessert. \"You have no idea,\" he said, \"the kind of man this Schwartz is. Did I ever tell you about his skull sutures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re primitive. You told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not all. He\u0027s got thirty-two teeth: three molars up and down, left and right, counting one false one that must be homemade. At least I\u0027ve never seen a bridge that has metal prongs hooking it onto adjacent teeth instead of being grafted to the jawbone...But have you ever seen anyone with thirty-two teeth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t go about counting people\u0027s teeth, Father. What\u0027s the right number-twenty-eight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sure as Space is...I\u0027m still not finished, though. We took an internal analysis yesterday. What do you suppose we found?...Guess!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Intestines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pola, you\u0027re being deliberately annoying, but I don\u0027t care. You needn\u0027t guess; 111 tell you. Schwartz has a vermiform appendix, three and a half inches long, and it\u0027s open. Great Galaxy, it\u0027s completely unprecedented! I have checked with the Medical School-cautiously, of course-and appendixes are practically never longer than half an inch, and they\u0027re never open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And just what does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, he\u0027s a complete throwback, a living fossil.\" He had risen from his chair and paced the distance to the wall and back with hasty steps. \"I tell you what, Pola, I don\u0027t think we ought to give Schwartz up. He\u0027s too valuable a specimen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, Father,\" said Pola quickly, \"you can\u0027t do that. You promised that farmer to return Schwartz, and you must for Schwartz\u0027s own sake. He\u0027s unhappy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unhappy! Why, we\u0027re treating him like a rich Outsider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What difference does that make? The poor fellow is used to his farm and his people. He\u0027s lived there all his life. And now he\u0027s had a frightening experience-a painful one, for all I know-and his mind works differently now. He can\u0027t be expected to understand. We\u0027ve got to consider his human rights and return him to his family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Pola, the cause of science-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, slush! What is the cause of science worth to me? What do you suppose the Brotherhood will say when they hear of your unauthorized experiments? Do you think they care about the cause of science? I mean, consider yourself if you don\u0027t wish to consider Schwartz. The longer you keep him, the greater the chance of being caught. You send him home tomorrow night, the way you originally planned to, do you hear?...I\u0027ll go down and see if Schwartz wants anything before dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was back in less than five minutes, face damp and chalky. \"Father, he\u0027s gone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s gone?\" he asked, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Schwartz!\" she cried, half in tears. \"You must have forgotten to lock the door when you left him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShekt was on his feet, throwing a hand out to steady himself. \"How long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But it can\u0027t be very long. When were you last there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not fifteen minutes. I had just been here a minute or two when you came in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" with sudden decision, \"I\u0027ll run out. He may simply be wandering about the neighborhood. You stay here. If someone else picks him up, they mustn\u0027t connect him with you. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShekt could only nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoseph Schwartz felt no lifting of the heart when he exchanged the confines of his prison hospital for the expanses of the city outside. He did not delude himself to the effect that he had a plan of action. He knew, and knew well, that he was simply improvising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf any rational impulse guided him (as distinct from mere blind desire to exchange inaction for action of any sort), it was the hope that by chance encounter some facet of life would bring back his wandering memory. That he was an amnesiac he was now fully convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first glimpse of the city, however, was disheartening. It was late afternoon and, in the sunlight, Chica was a milky white. The buildings might have been constructed of porcelain, like that farmhouse he had first stumbled upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirrings deep within told him that cities should be brown and red. And they should be much dirtier. He was sure of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked slowly. He felt, somehow, that there would be no organized search for him. He knew that, without knowing how he knew. To be sure, in the last few days he had found himself growing increasingly sensitive to \"atmosphere,\" to the \"feel\" of things about him. It was part of the strangeness in his mind, since-since...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thought trailed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the \"atmosphere\" at the hospital prison was one of secrecy; a frightened secrecy, it seemed. So they could not pursue him with loud outcry. He knew that. Now why should he know that? Was this queer activity of his mind part of what went on in cases of amnesia?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed another intersection. Wheeled vehicles were relatively few. Pedestrians were-well, pedestrians. Their clothes were rather laughable: seamless, buttonless, colorful. But then so were his own. He wondered where his old clothes were, then wondered if he had ever really owned such clothes as he remembered. It is very difficult to be sure of anything, once you begin doubting your memory on principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he remembered his wife so clearly; his children. They couldn\u0027t be fictions. He stopped in the middle of the walk to regain a composure suddenly lost. Perhaps they were distorted versions of real people, in this so unreal-seeming real life, whom he must find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were brushing past him and several muttered unamiably. He moved on. The thought occurred to him, suddenly and forcibly, that he was hungry, or would be soon, and that he had no money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked about. Nothing like a restaurant in sight. Well, how did he know? He couldn\u0027t read the signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed into each store front he passed...And then he found an interior which consisted in part of small alcoved tables, at one of which two men sat and another at which a single man sat. And the men were eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least that hadn\u0027t changed. Men who ate still chewed and swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped in and, for a moment, stopped in considerable bewilderment. There was no counter, no cooking going on, no signs of any kitchen. It had been his idea to offer to wash the dishes for a meal, but-to whom could he make the offer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiffidently, he stepped up to the two diners. He pointed, and said painstakingly, \"Food! Where? Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked up at him, rather startled. One spoke fluently, and quite incomprehensibly, patting a small structure at the wall end of the table. The other joined in, impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz\u0027s eyes fell. He turned to leave, and there was a hand upon his sleeve- Granz had seen Schwartz while the latter was still only a plump and wistful face at the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said \"What\u0027s he want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMesster, sitting across the little table, with his back to the street, turned, looked, shrugged his shoulders, and said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranz said, \"He\u0027s coming in,\" and Messter replied, \"So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. Just mentioning it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a few moments later the newcomer, after looking about helplessly, approached and pointed to their beef stew, saying in a queer accent, \"Food! Where? Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranz looked up. \"Food right here, bud. Just pull up a chair at any table you want and use the Foodomat... Foodomat! Don\u0027t you know what a Foodomat is?...Look at the poor jerk, Messter. He\u0027s looking at me as if he doesn\u0027t understand a word I say. Hey, fella-this thing, see. Just put a coin in and let me eat, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave him alone,\" grunted Messter. \"He\u0027s just a bum, looking for a handout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, hold on.\" Granz seized Schwartz\u0027s sleeve as the latter turned to go. He added in an aside to Messter, \"Space, let the guy eat. He\u0027s probably getting the Sixty soon. It\u0027s the least I can do to give him a break...Hey, bud, you got any money?...Well, I\u0027ll be damned, he still doesn\u0027t understand me. Money, pal, money! This-\" And he drew a shining half-credit piece out of his pocket, flipping it so that it sparkled in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got any?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly Schwartz shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, have this on me!\" He replaced the half-credit piece in his pocket and tossed over a considerably smaller coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz held it uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Don\u0027t just stand there. Stick it in the Foodomat. This thing here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz suddenly found himself understanding. The Foodomat had a series of slits for coins of different sizes and a series of knobs opposite little milky rectangles, the writing upon which he could not read. Schwartz pointed to the food on the table and ran a forefinger up and down the knobs, raising his eyebrows in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMesster said in annoyance, \" A sandwich isn\u0027t good enough for him. We\u0027re getting classy bums in this burg nowadays. It doesn\u0027t pay to humor them, Granz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, so I lose point eight five credits. Tomorrow\u0027s payday, anyway...Here,\" he said to Schwartz. He placed coins of his own into the Foodomat and withdrew the wide metal container from the recess in the wall. \"Now take it to another table...Nab, keep that tenth piece. Buy yourself a cup of coffee with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz carried the container gingerly to the next table. It had a spoon attached to the side by means of a transparent, filmy material, which broke with a slight pop under the pressure of a fingernail. As it did so, the top of the container parted at a seam and curled back upon itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe food, unlike that which he saw the others eating, was cold; but that was a detail. It was only after a minute or so that he realized the food was getting warmer and that the container had grown hot to the touch. He stopped, in alarm, and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gravy first steamed, then bubbled gently for a moment. It cooled again and Schwartz completed the meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranz and Messter were still there when he left. So was the third man, to whom, throughout, Schwartz had paid no attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor had Schwartz noticed, at any time since he had left the Institute, the thin, little man who, without seeming to, had managed to remain always within eyeshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBel Arvardan, having showered and changed his clothes, promptly followed his original intention of observing the human animal, subspecies Earth, in its native habitat. The weather was mild, the light breeze refreshing, the village itself-pardon, the city-bright, quiet, and clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot so bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChica first stop, he thought. Largest collection of Earth. men on the planet. Washenn next; local capital. Senloo! Senfran! Bonair!...He had plotted an itinerary all over the western continents (where most of the meager scattering of Earth\u0027s population lived) and, allowing two or three days at each, he would be back in Chica just about the time his expeditionary ship was due.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be educational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs afternoon began to decline he stepped into a Foodomat and, as he ate, observed the small drama that played itself out between the two Earthmen who had entered shortly after himself and the plump, elderly man who came in last of all. But his observation was detached and casual, simply not. ing it as an item to set against his unpleasant experience on the jet transport. The two men at the table were obviously air-cab drivers and not wealthy, yet they could be charitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beggar left, and two minutes later Arvardan left as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets were noticeably fuller, as the workday was approaching its end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped hastily aside to avoid colliding with a young girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dressed in white, in clothing which bore the stereotyped lines of a uniform. She seemed quite oblivious of the near collision. The anxious look on her face, the sharp turning of her head from side to side, her utter preoccupation, made the situation quite obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laid a light finger on her shoulder. \"May I help you, miss? Are you in trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped and turned startled eyes upon him. Arvardan found himself judging her age at nineteen to twenty-one, observing carefully her brown hair and dark eyes, her high cheekbones and little chin, her slim waist and graceful carriage. He discovered, suddenly, that the thought of this little female creature being an Earthwoman lent a sort of perverse piquancy to her attractiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was still staring, and almost at the moment of speaking she seemed to break down. \"Oh, it\u0027s no use. Please don\u0027t bother about me. It\u0027s silly to expect to find someone when you don\u0027t have the slightest idea where he could have gone. \" She was drooping in discouragement, her eyes wet. Then she straightened and breathed deeply. \"Have you seen a plump man about five-four, dressed in green and white, no hat, rather bald?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan looked at her in astonishment. \"What? Green and white?...Oh, I don\u0027t believe this...Look, this man you\u0027re referring to-does he speak with difficulty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes. Oh yes. You have seen him, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not five minutes ago he was in there eating with two men...Here they are...Say, you two.\" He beckoned them over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranz reached them first. \"Cab, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but if you tell the young lady what happened to the man you were eating with, you\u0027ll stand to make the fare, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranz paused and looked chagrined. \"Well, I\u0027d like to help you, but I never saw him before in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan turned to the girl. \"Now look, miss, he can\u0027t have gone in the direction you came from or you\u0027d have seen him. And he can\u0027t be far away. Suppose we move north a bit. I\u0027ll recognize him if I see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis offer of help was an impulse, yet Arvardan was not, ordinarily, an impulsive man. He found himself smiling at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranz interrupted suddenly. \"What\u0027s he done, lady? He hasn\u0027t broken any of the Customs, has he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" she replied hastily. \"He\u0027s only a little sick, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMesster looked after them as they left. \" A little sick?\" He shoved his visored cap back upon his head, then pinched balefully at his chin. \"How d\u0027ya like that, Granz? A little sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes looked askance at the other for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s got into you?\" asked Granz uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something that\u0027s making me a little sick. That guy must\u0027ve been straight out of the hospital. That was a nurse looking for him, and a plenty worried nurse, too. Why should she be worried if he was just a little sick? He couldn\u0027t hardly talk, and he didn\u0027t hardly understand. You noticed that, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sudden panicky light in Granz\u0027s eyes. \"You don\u0027t think it\u0027s Fever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sure do think it\u0027s Radiation Fever-and he\u0027s far gone. He was within a foot of us, too. It\u0027s never any good-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a little thin man next to them. A little thin man with bright, sharp eyes and a twittering voice, who had stepped out of nowhere. \"What\u0027s that, gents? Who\u0027s got Radiation Fever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was regarded with disfavor. \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ho,\" said the sharp little man, \"you want to know, do you? It so happens that I\u0027m a messenger of the Brotherhood, to be sure.\" He flashed a little glowing badge on the inner lapel of his jacket. \"Now, in the name of the Society of Ancients, what\u0027s all this about Radiation Fever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMesster spoke in cowed and sullen tones. \"I don\u0027t know nothing. There\u0027s a nurse looking for somebody who\u0027s sick, and I was wondering if it was Radiation Fever. That\u0027s not against the Customs, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ho! You\u0027re telling me about the Customs, are you? You better go about your business and let me worry about the Customs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little man rubbed his hands together, gazed quickly about him, and hurried northward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There he is!\" and Pola clutched feverishly at her companion\u0027s elbow. It had happened quickly, easily, and accidentally. Through the despairing blankness he had suddenly materialized just within the main entrance of the self-service department store, not three blocks from the Foodomat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see him,\" whispered Arvardan. \"Now stay back and let me follow him. If he sees you and dashes into the mob, we\u0027ll never locate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasually they followed in a sort of nightmare chase. The human contents of the store was a quicksand which could absorb its prey slowly-or quickly-keep it hidden impenetrably, spew it forth unexpectedly; set up barriers that somehow would not yield. The mob might almost have had a malevolent conscious mind of its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Arvardan circled a counter watchfully, playing Schwartz as though he were at the end of a fishing line. His huge hand reached out and closed on the other\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz burst into incomprehensible prose and jerked away in panic. Arvardan\u0027s grip, however, was unbreakable to men far stronger than Schwartz, and he contented himself with smiling and saying, in normal tones, for the benefit of the curious spectator, \"Hello, old chap, haven\u0027t seen you in months. How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA palpable fraud, he supposed, in the face of the other\u0027s gibberish, but Pola had joined them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Schwartz,\" she whispered, \"come back with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Schwartz stiffened in rebellion, then he drooped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said wearily, \"I-go-along-you,\" but the statement was drowned in the sudden blare of the store\u0027s loud-speaker system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attention! Attention! Attention! The management requests that all patrons of the store leave by the Fifth Street exit in orderly fashion. You will present your registration cards to the guards at the door. It is essential that this be done rapidly. Attention! Attention! Attention!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe message was repeated three times, the last time over the sound of scuffling feet as crowds were beginning to line up at the exits. A many-tongued cry was making itself heard, asking in various fashions the forever-unanswerable question of \"What\u0027s happened? What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan shrugged and said, \"Let\u0027s get on line, miss. We\u0027re leaving anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Pola shook her head. \"We can\u0027t. We can\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" The archaeologist frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl merely shrank away from him. How could she tell him that Schwartz had no registration card? Who was he? Why had he been helping her? She was in a whirl of suspicion and despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said huskily, \"You\u0027d better go, or you\u0027ll get into trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were pouring out the elevators as the upper floors emptied. Arvardan, Pola, and Schwartz were a little island of solidity in the human river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back on it later, Arvardan realized that at this point he could have left the girl. Left her! Never seen her again! Have nothing to reproach himself with!...And all would have been different. The great Galactic Empire would have dissolved in chaos and destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not leave the girl. She was scarcely pretty in her fear and despair. No one could be. But Arvardan felt disturbed at the sight of her helplessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had taken a step away, and now he turned. \"Are you going to stay here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because\"-and the tears now overflowed-\"I don\u0027t know what else to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was just a little, frightened girl, even if she was an Earthie. Arvardan said, in a softer voice, \"If you\u0027ll tell me what\u0027s wrong, I\u0027ll try to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three formed a tableau. Schwartz had sunk to the floor in a squatting posture, too sick at heart to try to follow the conversation, to be curious at the sudden emptiness of the store, to do anything but bury his head in his hands in the last unspoken and unuttered whimper of despair. Pola, weeping, knew only that she was more frightened than she had ever thought it possible for anyone to be. Arvardan, puzzled and waiting, tried clumsily and ineffectually to pat Pola\u0027s shoulder in encouraging fashion, and was conscious only of the fact that for the first time he had touched an Earthgirl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little man came upon them thus. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3/page-8.html","bookId":1726,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:10 AM"}
