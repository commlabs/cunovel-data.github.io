In fact, if it weren’t for the existence of the Heretical God Tree, his Laws would be even worse than the Monster Prince’s. After all, what he comprehended were the strong Space and Time Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow, after just several days of time and a deep slumber of a year and a half, Lin Ming’s Laws had reached perfection of the fifth level and he had also traced upon the threshold of the sixth level Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was a simply inconceivable accomplishment. Moreover, he had been sleeping within a time enchantment where the Laws were all in chaos. In this situation, how could he even comprehend the Laws?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe large success of the fifth level Concept was only a single step away from reaching perfection, there were countless Divine Lord powerhouses who had failed to cross this step in their lifetimes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What happened to Lin Ming?

Lin Ming’s talent had already aroused the envy of many heroic young elites. When Lin Ming had fought Hang Chi, many of these people believed that he was trying to show off, thus he received a deep injury which caused him to sleep for a year and a half and even possibly left behind hidden wounds. Because Lin Ming did something too stupid, these envious young elites all looked at him in a joking light.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter a year and a half, Lin Ming appeared on the arena stage and he had even made a breakthrough in the Laws.

With so many top tier geniuses in the First Martial Meeting, his comprehension of Laws was among the most disappointing.

Lin Ming had indeed been weak in the aspect of Laws, but now his Laws were comparable to Dragon Fang’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Just wait and see. His Laws have improved but it won’t change the result of this battle. Lin Ming’s disparity with Frost Dream is too great!

But of those people that came to watch the First Martial Meeting, there were always those old fellows with an immeasurably deep vision and judgment. Although they didn’t know that Frost Dream was the reincarnated half of Divine Dream’s primordial spirit, they could confirm that Frost Dream had some unique secret. She was an invincible enigma.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this battle, no one believed in Lin Ming. Even Jun Bluemoon’s master Old Sword, Vast Universe, or even Lin Ming himself, didn’t have full faith that he could win.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the arena stage, Frost Dream’s eyes flashed with slight surprise. Although she knew that Lin Ming’s recent deep sleep was not as simple as it seemed, she never imagined that his strength would suddenly rise to such a degree.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You have been cultivating for this last year and a half?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAn ephemeral true essence sound transmission spread to Lin Ming’s ears, like a clarion hosanna sung from an immortal paradise.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes.” Lin Ming confidently replied.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Cultivating in a 1:100 time flow time enchantment?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrost Dream was thoughtful for a moment. If one cultivated in a time enchantment, there wouldn’t be a problem if they gathered true essence to make a breakthrough. However, there would be distortions in the Laws they comprehended. This was the difference from cultivating outside. Moreover, one’s age would increase all the same within the time enchantment and the person would use up their life. Unless there was a unique circumstance, geniuses would not cultivate in a time enchantment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin is truly special. Allow me to experience the achievements of your cultivation.” Frost Dream said. Then, she lifted her hand. From her palm, a rippling wave surged out, changing the world. Countless ice lotuses seemed to bloom all around Frost Dream.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe arena vanished.

They didn’t think Frost Dream would use this move so early but would hold back for the first several moves against Lin Ming. But now, after just a single probing attack, Frost Dream had released the divine dream space.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePerhaps this even signaled that the match would end soon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is the divine dream space… I see, so the feeling of standing within the divine dream space is like this.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough Lin Ming had seen the divine dream space in action before, this was his first time experiencing it himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter standing in the divine dream space, Lin Ming felt illusions grow thick in his mind.

In that instant, for a radius of 100 feet around Lin Ming, all of those blooming ice lotuses rapidly shattered, turning into countless shards. Even the cage around Lin Ming wildly trembled as if it would break apart at any moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith his strength, Lin Ming had shoved open a space within the divine dream space!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePuff!
