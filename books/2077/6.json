This guy cut me!\" Blood ran between his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandy lifted the razor again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea reached out with her mind. Not reached. She leaped. It was completely instinctive; she was scared to death, and all she could think of was that he was going to kill Kevin, and maybe Blaise, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught-something. Pain and grief and fury that seemed to be bouncing around like a baboon in a cage. She could hold it for only an instant, but in that instant Eric threw two cups of punch in Randy\u0027s face. Randy yelled and turned away from Kevin, toward Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea felt a surge of pure terror. Randy slashed with the razor, but Eric was fast; he jumped back out of the way, circling to get behind Randy. Randy wheeled and slashed again. They were doing a macabre dance, going round and round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea felt as if the fear was winding tighter inside her with each turn. But Eric kept out of the way of the flashing razor until a rush of movement on the dance floor caught her eye. It was Mr. Adkins and two other teachers. They converged on Randy and there was a lot of confusion. When it was over, Randy was on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSirens wailed outside, coming closer. Eric stepped away from the pile on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing hard, he looked at Thea. She nodded that she was all right, then shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt limp and wrung out and awful. They were going to take Randy away now, and she didn\u0027t think there was much help for him. He definitely seemed too far gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment she was ashamed of being a witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, people,\" Mr. Adkins was saying. \"Let\u0027s move out of here. Let\u0027s get this place cleared.\" He looked at Blaise, who was bending over a seated Kevin, holding a napkin to his cheek. \"You two can stay.\" Then he put a hand on Blaise\u0027s shoulder. \"Are you okay here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaise looked up with wide, tragic gray eyes. \"I think so,\" she said bravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Adkins swallowed. His hand on Blaise\u0027s shoulder squeezed. Thea heard him mutter something like, \"Poor kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, give me a break, Thea thought. But a small, selfish part of her was relieved. Blaise wasn\u0027t going to get in trouble over this one; neither of them was going to get expelled. Grandma wasn\u0027t going to be disgraced in front of the Inner Circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Blaise did seem worried about Kevin. She was bending over him again solicitously. As if she really cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea slipped past a teacher\u0027s outstretched arm. \"Are you okay?\" she whispered to Blaise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaise looked up enigmatically. That was when Thea saw that she had a tiny vial concealed in the napkin. It was full of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You...\" Thea couldn\u0027t find the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaise made a slight grimace that meant: I know. But it was just too good a chance to miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea backed up and ran into Eric. He put a steadying arm around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine. I have to get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric looked into her face. He was rumpled: his hair mussed, his eyes dark. All he said was, \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed Vivienne and Selene on the way out. Thea had to give them credit; they both looked shocked and unhappy. The question was, would it last?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDani was in the parking lot with John Finkelstein. \"I\u0027m going home,\" she said significantly to Thea, and tossed something into a clump of bitterbrush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an empty vial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea felt a tiny uncoiling of relief. She touched Dani\u0027s arm lightly. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDani looked back at the cafeteria. \"I wonder what it was he wanted to know?\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just then a howl came from the lighted doorway, as if answering her question. It didn\u0027t sound like a person; it sounded like an animal in anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whyyyyyy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea turned blindly and almost ran for Eric\u0027s jeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were driving on darkened streets, Eric said quietly, \"I\u0027m presuming he was an old boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last month\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric glanced at her. \"He was pretty messed up, poor guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that, Thea thought, summed it up nicely. He was pretty messed up forever. Poor guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Blaise,\" she said. She hadn\u0027t meant to talk to him about this, but the words were so crowded in her throat that she thought she\u0027d burst if she didn\u0027t let them out. \"She does this and does this, and I can\u0027t stop her. She picks guys up everywhere, and they fall in love with her, and then she dumps them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love? Hm,\" Eric said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea looked at him, astonished. He was looking straight ahead, his long, supple fingers steady on the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell. And I thought you were so naive. Maybe you see more than I realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a kind of love,\" she said. \"It\u0027s like-do you know, in ancient Greece they worshiped the goddess Aphrodite. She was the goddess of love-and the thing about her was that she was absolutely merciless.\" Thea shook her head. \"I saw this play once about a queen named Phaedra. And Aphrodite made her fall in love with her own stepson, and by the end of the play just about everybody was dead on the stage. But Aphrodite just kept smiling. Because she was just doing what a goddess does-the same way that a tornado rips houses apart or a fire burns down a forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped. Her chest was aching and she didn\u0027t have any breath left. But in a way she felt better, as if some pressure had been relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think Blaise is like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Sort of a natural force that can\u0027t help itself. Does that sound completely crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, no.\" Eric gave a wry smile. \"Nature\u0027s rough. Hawks grab rabbits. Male lions kill cubs. It\u0027s a jungle out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that doesn\u0027t make it right. Maybe for goddesses and animals, but not when it gets to the level of humans.\" It was a moment before she realized what she\u0027d said. She was using \"humans\" to mean \"people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, humans aren\u0027t very far from animals, after all,\" Eric said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea sagged back against the seat. She was still confused and unhappy, but what scared her most was that she felt a strong urge to keep talking to Eric about it. He seemed to understand so well... better than anybody else ever had. And not only to understand, but to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you need,\" Eric said suddenly, brightening. \"I was going to suggest we go to the late buffet at Harrah\u0027s, but I know something better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea glanced at the clock, saw that it was almost eleven: \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Puppy therapy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just grinned and turned the jeep south. They pulled up at a modest gray building with a sign that read sun city animal hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is where you work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. We can let Pilar off early,\" Eric said, getting out and unlocking the front door of the building. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pretty girl with shoulder-length brown hair looked up from behind the office counter. Thea recognized her as Pilar Osorio from school. A quiet girl who looked like a good student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was the dance?\" she said. Thea thought her eyes lingered on Eric wistfully as she said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric shrugged. \"Pretty awful, to tell the truth. There was a fight and we left.\" Thea noticed he didn\u0027t mention his part in stopping the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How awful,\" Pilar said sympathetically-but Thea thought she wasn\u0027t entirely sorry that the dance hadn\u0027t gone well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. So how\u0027s our boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay-a little hyper. You might want to take him for a walk later.\" Pilar picked up her jacket. She nodded politely to Thea as she headed for the door. \"See you Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe likes him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door was shut, Thea looked around the office. \"So the clinic\u0027s not open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but somebody has to stay overnight when we\u0027ve got animals boarding here.\" He gave her the grin again. \"Follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led her through an exam room into a corridor and then to a kennel room at the back. Thea looked around with interest. She\u0027d never been in the inner sanctum of an animal hospital before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were several dog runs. Eager whining was coming from the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric looked at her mischievously. \"Three, two, one...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the cage. A big Labrador puppy tumbled out, tail wagging frantically. He was a beautiful color that ranged from deep gold on his back to almost white on his legs and paws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Bud,\" Eric said. \"Hey, pal; who\u0027s a good boy?\" He looked at Thea solemnly. \"This is the ultimate cuddle dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea collapsed on the sheet vinyl floor and made a lap, holding both arms out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-your dress-\" Eric began mildly, but the puppy was already in midair. Thea caught him and he crawled up her, legs on her shoulders, hot breath blowing in her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m in love,\" Thea gasped, her arms full of warm, heavy puppy sweetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappiness surrounded her. She didn\u0027t have to try to merge with the puppy\u0027s mind; he practically took over by force. All his thoughts were good ones, and they were all about now. About how terrific everything smelled this minute, and how great that scratch behind the ear felt on a fleabite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood feelings, happy feelings... I really like this big bald dog... Wonder which of us is dominant?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe puppy bit her and Thea play-bit him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong; I\u0027m the pack leader,\" she informed him, holding his jowls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one odd thing. She could see the way the world looked to the pup-and there was nothing on the right. Just a void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there something wrong with his eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You noticed the cataract. Lots of people don\u0027t see that right away. Yeah, he\u0027s blind in the right eye. When he gets older he may come back for surgery.\" Eric sat back against the wall, grinning madly. \"You\u0027ve really got a way with animals,\" he said. \"But you don\u0027t own any pets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was gentle, not intrusive. Thea said absently, \"Well, usually just temporary ones. I pick them up and when they\u0027re cured I put them back- or find homes for them if they want to be pets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cure them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, the question was gentle, but Thea felt a little shock. Why couldn\u0027t she guard her tongue around this guy? She looked up and found he was looking at her steadily and searchingly, his green eyes alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a breath. \"I feed them, take them to the vet if they need it. Then I wait until they heal up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, but the searching look didn\u0027t go away. \"Did you ever think of being a vet yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea had to look down. She bluffed by kissing the puppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, not really,\" she muttered into blond fur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ve got a gift. Look, I\u0027ve got some material on U.C. Davis. They have a great undergraduate program-and their graduate school is one of the best in the country. It\u0027s not easy to get in, but you could do it. I know you could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t bet on it,\" Thea muttered. She had several dramatic blotches on her academic record- like four expulsions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn\u0027t the real problem. The real problem was that witches weren\u0027t veterinarians. They just weren\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could choose to specialize in gems or herbs or ritual clothing; in chants or runes or research or amulets... in hundreds of things, but nothing taught at U.C. Davis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard to explain,\" Thea said. She didn\u0027t have much room left to be surprised, or she\u0027d have been surprised to find she wanted to explain to a human. \"It\u0027s just-my family wouldn\u0027t really approve. They want me to be something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric opened his mouth, then shut it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe puppy sneezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-maybe you could help me with my application sometime,\" Eric said at last. \"I\u0027m trying to do the essay question and dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou sneak, Thea thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment a buzzer sounded-far away but insistent. Bud barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the... that\u0027s the outside buzzer,\" Eric said. \"But nobody should be here at this time of night.\" He got up and headed for the front of the building. Thea followed, her fingertips just brushing Bud\u0027s head to control him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric opened the door, then stepped back in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rosamund... what are you doing here? Does Mom know you\u0027re out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething like a miniature whirlwind entered the waiting room. It was a kid, a little girl with a mop of sandy hair sticking out from under a baseball cap. She was carrying a rolled-up blue blanket, and what could be seen of her expression under the hair was ferocious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom said Madame Curie wasn\u0027t really sick, but she is. Call Dr. Joan.\" With that, the kid marched into the office and dumped the blue blanket on the counter, pushing aside a clipboard and some vaccination reminder cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey. Don\u0027t.\" When she ignored him, Eric looked at Thea. \"Uh, this is my sister Rosamund. And I don\u0027t know how she got here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I rode my bike and I want Madame Curie fixed now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBud was rearing up and trying to sniff the blue blanket. Thea pushed him down gently. \"Who\u0027s Madame Curie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madame Curie is a guinea pig,\" Eric said. He touched the blanket. \"Roz-Dr. Joan is gone. She\u0027s out of town at a conference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosamund\u0027s ferocious expression never wavered, but her chin began to quiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, listen. I\u0027ll take a look at Madame Curie now, see if I can see anything. But first we have to call Mom and let her know you\u0027re alive.\" He reached for the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take Bud back,\" Thea said. \"I think he thinks Madame Curie is lunch.\" She led the puppy into the back room and coaxed him into the run with a promise of extra petting later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came back to the office, Eric was bent over a small brown-and-white guinea pig. He looked frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s something wrong with her-I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seems weaker than usual and sort of lethargic___\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he jerked his hand back with a yelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not too lethargic,\" he said, eyeing the blood welling up from his thumb. He wiped it on a tissue and bent over the guinea pig again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s in a bad mood,\" Rosamund said. \"And she\u0027s not eating right. I told you yesterday she was sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you didn\u0027t,\" Eric said calmly. \"You told me she was tired of living under patriarchy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she is tired. And she\u0027s sick. Do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kid, I don\u0027t know what to do yet. Hang on.\" He bent closer to the little animal, muttering to himself. \"She\u0027s not coughing... so it\u0027s not strep. Her lymph nodes are okay... but her joints seem swollen. Now, that\u0027s weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosamund was watching him, her green eyes full of fierce trust. Eyes like Eric\u0027s, Thea realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out gently and just touched the guinea pig\u0027s soft fur with her fingers. Her mind reached gently, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrightened-little-animal thoughts. The guinea pig didn\u0027t like being here, wanted the sawdust of her cage,\u0026nbsp; wanted safety.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; She didn\u0027t like\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; clinical\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmells, didn\u0027t like huge, strange fingers descending from the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHome-place, nest-place, she was thinking. And then, something odd. A concept-more smell and taste than picture. Madame Curie was imagining eating something... something crunchy and slightly sharp. Eating and eating and eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there some treat she really likes?\" Thea asked doubtfully. \"Something like cabbage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric blinked, then straightened up as if he\u0027d gotten an electric shock. His green eyes stared straight into hers. \"That\u0027s it! You\u0027re brilliant!\" \"What\u0027s it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you said. She\u0027s got scurvy!\" He dashed out of the office and came back with a thick book full of small print. \"Yeah-here it is. Anorexia, lethargy, enlarged limb joints... she\u0027s got all the symptoms.\" He turned pages feverishly and then said triumphantly, \"All we have to do is give her some of those veggies, or maybe some ascorbic acid in her water.\" Scurvy-wasn\u0027t that a disease sailors used to get? When they were on long trips with no fresh fruits or vegetables? And ascorbic acid was... \"Vitamin C!\" \"Yeah! It\u0027s been hot and we\u0027ve got hard water at our house-all that could deplete the vitamin C in her diet. But it\u0027s easy to fix.\" Then Eric looked at Thea and shook his head wonderingly. \"I\u0027ve been studying for years, besides working here, and you just look at the animal and you know. How do you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked Madame Curie,\" Rosamund said flatly. Thea gave her a wary glance. How come this whole family was so observant? \"Ha ha,\" she said, her voice light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like you,\" Rosamund said, just as flatly as before. \"Now where can I get some cabbage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go look in the vaccine fridge in back,\" Eric said. \"If there isn\u0027t any, we can always use vitamin drops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosamund trotted off. Eric watched her, openly fond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s an interesting kid,\" Thea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s sort of a genius. Also the world\u0027s smallest militant feminist. She\u0027s suing the local Boy Trekkers, you know. They won\u0027t let her in, and the Girl Trekkers don\u0027t trek. They do macrame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea looked at him. \"And what do you think of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? I drive her to the lawyer\u0027s office whenever Mom can\u0027t make it. I figure it stops her griping. Besides, she\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimple as that, Thea thought. She watched Eric as he folded the blue blanket, and heard a voice in her mind like the voice of an announcer describing a game-show prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow. Look at this guy. He\u0027s tender but intense. Brave. Profoundly insightful. Shy but with a wicked sense of humor. He\u0027s smart, he\u0027s honest, he\u0027s an animal lover....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was feeling-well, strange. As if she\u0027d been breathing too much yemonja root. The air seemed sweet and heavy and tingly somehow, as if laced with tropical electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she found herself touching the back of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of the blanket instantly and turned his hand to close on hers. He wasn\u0027t looking at her, though. He was still staring at the office desk. His chest heaved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I think if I blink, you\u0027ll disappear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Eileithyia, Thea thought. Oh, Aphrodite. I\u0027m in terrible trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing was, it was terrible and wonderful. She felt awkward and tremendously safe at once, scared to death and not scared of anything. And what she wanted was so simple. If he only felt the same, everything would be all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just can\u0027t even imagine life without you anymore, but I\u0027m so afraid you\u0027ll go away,\" Eric said, still looking fatalistically at the computer on the desk. Then he turned to her. \"Are you mad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea shook her head. Her heart was threatening to leave her body. When she met his eyes it was as if some circuit had closed. They were connected, now, and being pulled together as if Aphrodite herself was gathering them into her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then everything was warm and wonderful. Better than holding the puppy, because Eric could hold her, too. And the thrills of fear that had been shooting through her seemed somehow to burst like fireworks and turn into exhilaration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cheek was against Eric\u0027s. And she\u0027d never felt anything so blissful before. Eric\u0027s cheek was smooth and firm-and she was safe here, loved here. She could rest like this forever. Peace filled her like cool water. They were two birds enfolding each other with their wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwans mate for life... and when they see their mate, they know, she thought. That\u0027s what happened in the desert. We knew each other; it was as if we each could see the other one\u0027s soul. Once you see into someone\u0027s soul, you\u0027re attached forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, and there\u0027s a word for it in the Night World, part of her mind said, trying to shatter her peace. The soulmate principle. You\u0027re trying to say that your one and only is a human?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Thea couldn\u0027t be frightened, not now. She felt insulated from the Night World and the human world both. She and Eric formed their own reality; and it was enough just to stand here and breathe and to feel his breathing, without worrying about the future....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door creaked and a blast of cool air blew in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea\u0027s eyes were startled open. And then her heart gave a terrible lurch and started thudding painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the door that Rosamund had gone through. It was the front door, which Eric must have left unlocked. And Blaise was standing there in the waiting room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-spellbinder-night-world-3/page-6.html","bookId":2077,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:35:57 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:35:57 AM"}
