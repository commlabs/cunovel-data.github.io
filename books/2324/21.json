Bobby was wearing a gray sweatshirt with the sleeves cut off. Around his neck was a blue plastic whistle on one of those lanyards of plastic braid that boys make at summer camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The actor is feeling his way into the role,\" Skip said, aiming a thumb at Bobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a call-back on a commercial,\" Bobby said. \"I\u0027m a basketball referee, I\u0027m with these kids at a playground. They all tower over me, that\u0027s part of the point of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody towers over you,\" Skip said. \"What are they supposed to be selling? Because if it\u0027s deodorant, you want to wear a different sweatshirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s brotherhood,\" Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brotherhood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Black kids, white kids, Spanish kids, all united in brotherhood as they drive for the fuckin\u0027 hoop. It\u0027s some public-service thing, show it during slow spots on the Joe Franklin show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get paid for this?\" Skip demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit, yes. I think the agencies donate their time, and the TV stations run it free, but the talent gets paid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The talent,\" Skip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Le talent, c\u0027est moi,\" Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ordered a drink. Skip and Bobby stayed with what they had. Skip lit a cigarette and the smoke hung in the air. My drink came and I sipped it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were going to make it an early night,\" Skip said. I said I\u0027d been unable to sleep. \"Because of tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Just not tired yet. Restless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get that way. Hey, actor,\" he said. \"What time\u0027s your audition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Supposed to be two o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Supposed to be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can get there and sit around a lot. I\u0027m supposed to be there at two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You be done in time to give us a hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no problem,\" he said. \"These agency cats, they got to catch the five forty-eight to Scarsdale. Couple of pops in the bar car, then find out how Jason and Tracy did in school today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jason and Tracy are on summer break, dumbbell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he\u0027s got to see the postcard they sent home from camp. They go to this fancy camp in Maine, the postcards are already written by the staff, all they gotta do is sign them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy boys would be going to camp in a couple of weeks. One of them had woven me a lanyard like the one Bobby wore. I had it somewhere, packed away in a drawer or something. Or was it still in Syosset? If I were a proper father, I thought, I\u0027d wear the damned thing, whistle and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip was telling Bobby that he needed his beauty sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m supposed to look like a jock,\" Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t get you outta here, you\u0027re gonna look more like a truss.\" He looked at his cigarette, dropped it in what was left of his drink. \"I never want to see you do that,\" he told me. \"I never want to see either of you do that. Disgusting habit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE sky was lightening up outside. We walked slowly, not saying much. Bobby bobbed and weaved a ways ahead of us, dribbling an imaginary basketball, faking out an invisible opponent and driving for the hoop. Skip looked at me and shrugged. \"What can I tell you?\" he said. \"The man is my friend. What else is there to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just jealous,\" Bobby said. \"You got the height but you haven\u0027t got the moves. A good little man can fake you out of your socks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wept because I had no shoes,\" Skip said solemnly, \"and then I met a man who had no socks. What the hell was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn explosion echoed half a mile or so to the north of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kasabian\u0027s mortar,\" Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fucking draft-dodger,\" Skip said. \"You wouldn\u0027t know a mortar from a pessary. I don\u0027t mean a pessary. What is it a pharmacist uses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pestle,\" Skip said. \"You wouldn\u0027t know a mortar from a pestle. That\u0027s not what a mortar sounds like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounded like blasting for a foundation,\" he said. \"But it\u0027s too early, the neighbors would kill anybody started blasting at this hour. I\u0027ll tell you, I\u0027m glad it\u0027s done raining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we had enough of it, didn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose we needed it,\" he said. \"That\u0027s always what they say, isn\u0027t it? Every time it rains its ass off, somebody says how we needed it. Because the reservoirs are drying up, or else the farmers need it or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a wonderful conversation,\" Bobby said. \"You\u0027d never get a conversation like this in a less sophisticated city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you,\" Skip said. He lit a cigarette and started coughing, got control of the cough and took another puff on the cigarette, this time without a cough. It was like a drink in the morning, I thought. Once you got one to stay down you were all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The air\u0027s nice after a storm,\" Skip said. \"I think it cleans it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Washes it,\" Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" He looked around. \"I almost hate to say this,\" he said, \"but it ought to be a beautiful day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt six minutes past eight, the phone on Skip\u0027s desk rang. Billie Keegan had been talking about a girl he\u0027d met the previous year on a three-week holiday in the west of Ireland. He stopped his story in midsentence. Skip put his hand on the phone and looked at me, and I reached for the phone that sat on top of the file cabinet. He nodded once, a quick bob of the head, and we lifted the two receivers in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA male voice said, \"Devoe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then get a pencil and write this down. You want to get in your car and drive to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" Skip said. \"First you got to prove you got what you say you got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Read the entries for the first week of June. That\u0027s this June, June of \u002775.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. Then the voice, taut now, said, \"You don\u0027t give us orders, man. We\u0027re the ones say frog, you\u0027re the ones jump.\" Skip straightened up a little in his chair, leaned forward. I held up a hand to stop whatever he was about to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"We want to confirm we\u0027re dealing with the right people. We want to buy it as long as we know you\u0027ve got it to sell. Establish that much and we\u0027ll play out the hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not Devoe speaking. Who the hell are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a friend of Mr. Devoe\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a name, friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scudder. You want us to read something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip told him again what to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get back to you,\" the man said, and broke the connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip looked over at me, the receiver in his hand. I hung up the one I was holding. He passed his own from hand to hand like a hot potato. I had to tell him to hang up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d they do that?\" he wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they had to have a conference,\" I suggested. \"Or get the books so they can read you what you want to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe they never had them in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so. They\u0027d have tried to stall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hanging up on somebody\u0027s a pretty good way to stall.\" He lit a cigarette, shoved the pack back into his shirt pocket. He was wearing a short-sleeved forest-green work shirt with Alvin \u0027s Texaco Service embroidered in yellow over the breast pocket. \"Why hang up?\" he said petulantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he thought we could trace the call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could we do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard even when you\u0027ve got the cops and the telephone company cooperating on it,\" I said. \"It\u0027d be out of the question for us. But they don\u0027t necessarily know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catch us tracing calls,\" John Kasabian put in. \"We had our hands full installing the second phone this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had done that a few hours earlier, running wires from the terminal on the wall and hooking an extension phone borrowed from Kasabian\u0027s girl\u0027s apartment into the line so that Skip and I could be on the line at the same time. While Skip and John were doing that, Bobby had been auditioning for the role of referee in the brotherhood commercial and Billie Keegan had been finding someone to fill in for him behind the stick at Armstrong\u0027s. I\u0027d used that time to stuff two hundred and fifty dollars into a parish fund box, light a couple of candles, and phone in another meaningless report to Drew Kaplan in Brooklyn. And now we were all five in Miss Kitty\u0027s back office, waiting for the phone to ring again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of a southern accent,\" Skip said. \"You happen to notice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounded phony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he got angry,\" I said. \"Or pretended to get angry, whatever it was. That bit about jump when he says frog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t the only one got angry just about then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed. But when he first got angry the accent wasn\u0027t there, and when he started with the frog shit he was putting it on thicker than before, trying to sound country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned, summoning up the memory. \"You\u0027re right,\" he said shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it the same guy you talked to before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. His voice sounded phony before, but it wasn\u0027t the same as I was hearing tonight. Maybe he\u0027s a man of a thousand voices, all of them unconvincing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guy could do voiceovers,\" Bobby suggested, \"in fucking brotherhood commercials.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time we made less of a thing out of synchronizing our answering, since I\u0027d already made my presence known. When I had the receiver to my ear, Skip said, \"Yeah?\" and the voice I\u0027d heard before asked what he was supposed to read. Skip told him and the voice began reading ledger entries. Skip had the fake set of books open on his desk and followed along on the page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter half a minute the reader stopped and asked if we were satisfied. Skip looked as though he wanted to take exception to the word. Instead he shrugged and nodded, and I spoke up to say we were assured we were dealing with the right people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then here\u0027s what you do,\" he said, and we both took up pencils and wrote down the directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TWO cars,\" Skip was saying. \"All they know is me and Matt are coming, so the two of us\u0027ll go in my car. John, you take Billie and Bobby. What do you think, Matt, they\u0027ll follow us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Somebody may be watching us leave here,\" I said. \"John, why don\u0027t you three go ahead now. Your car\u0027s handy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m parked two blocks from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The three of you can drive out there now. Bobby, you and Bill walk on ahead and wait at the car. I\u0027d just as soon you all didn\u0027t walk out together, just in case somebody\u0027s keeping an eye on the front door. You two wait ahead, and John, give them two, three minutes, and then meet them at the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then drive out to- where is it, Emmons Avenue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Sheepshead Bay. You know where that is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vaguely. I know it\u0027s the ass end of Brooklyn. I\u0027ve gone out on fishing boats there, but somebody else drove and I didn\u0027t pay too much attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can take the Belt, the Shore Parkway.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-21.html","bookId":2324,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM"}
