{"id":11094,"no":28,"title":"SECTION 27.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Hal was so startled by this discovery that he stopped in his tracks and gazed at the man. He had heard a lot about “trouble-makers” in the camps, but so far the only kind he had seen were those hired by the company to make trouble for the men. But now, here was a union organiser! Jerry had suggested the possibility, but Hal had not thought of it seriously; an organiser was a mythological creature, whispered about by the miners, cursed by the company and its servants, and by Hal\u0027s friends at home. An incendiary, a fire-brand, a loudmouthed, irresponsible person, stirring up blind and dangerous passions! Having heard such things all his life, Hal\u0027s first impulse was of distrust. He felt like the one-legged old switchman who had given him a place to sleep, after his beating at Pine Creek, and who had said, “Don\u0027t you talk no union business to me!” \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seeing Hal\u0027s emotion, the organiser gave an uneasy laugh. “While you\u0027re hoping I\u0027m not a \u0027dick,\u0027 I trust you understand I\u0027m hoping you\u0027re not one.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hal\u0027s answer was to the point. “I was taken for an organiser once,” he said, and his hands sought the seat of his ancient bruises.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The other laughed. “You got off with a beating? You were lucky. Down in Alabama, not so long ago, they tarred and feathered one of us.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dismay came upon Hal\u0027s face; but after a moment he too began to laugh. “I was just thinking about my brother and his friends—what they\u0027d have said if I\u0027d come home from Pine Creek in a coat of tar and feathers!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Possibly,” ventured the other, “they\u0027d have said you got what you deserved.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, that seems to be their attitude. That\u0027s the rule they apply to all the world—if anything goes wrong with you, it must be your own fault. It\u0027s a land of equal opportunity.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And you\u0027ll notice,” said the organiser, “that the more privileges people have had, the more boldly they talk that way.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hal began to feel a sense of comradeship with this stranger, who was able to understand one\u0027s family troubles! It had been a long time since Hal had talked with any one from the outside world, and he found it a relief to his mind. He remembered how, after he had got his beating, he had lain out in the rain and congratulated himself that he was not what the guards had taken him for. Now he was curious about the psychology of an organiser. A man must have strong convictions to follow that occupation!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He made the remark, and the other answered, “You can have my pay any time you\u0027ll do my work. But let me tell you, too, it isn\u0027t being beaten and kicked out of camp that bothers one most; it isn\u0027t the camp-marshal and the spy and the blacklist. Your worst troubles are inside the heads of the fellows you\u0027re trying to help! Have you ever thought what it would mean to try to explain things to men who speak twenty different languages?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, of course,” said Hal. “I wonder how you ever get a start.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, you look for an interpreter—and maybe he\u0027s a company spy. Or maybe the first man you try to convert reports you to the boss. For, of course, some of the men are cowards, and some of them are crooks; they\u0027ll sell out the next fellow for a better \u0027place\u0027—maybe for a glass of beer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That must have a tendency to weaken your convictions,” said Hal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” said the other, in a matter of fact tone. “It\u0027s hard, but one can\u0027t blame the poor devils. They\u0027re ignorant—kept so deliberately. The bosses bring them here, and have a regular system to keep them from getting together. And of course these European peoples have their old prejudices—national prejudices, religious prejudices, that keep them apart. You see two fellows, one you think is exactly as miserable as the other—but you find him despising the other, because back home he was the other\u0027s superior. So they play into the bosses\u0027 hands.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88710.html","bookId":649,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:39:13 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:39:13 AM"}
