The sun was entirely behind the mountains now, edging them with gold fire, making the shadows around things look long and purple. The only three vehicles left in the parking lots were the hotel truck, Ullman\u0027s Lincoln Continental, and the battered Torrance VW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got your keys, then;\" Ullman said to Jack, \"and you understand fully about the furnace and the boiler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nodded, feeling some real sympathy for Ullman. Everything was done for the season, the ball of string was neatly wrapped up until next May 12-not a day earlier or later-and Ullman, who was responsible for all of it and who referred to the hotel in the unmistakable tones of infatuation, could not help looking for loose ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think everything is well in hand,\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ll be in touch.\" But he still lingered for a moment, as if waiting for the wind to take a hand and perhaps gust him down to his car. He sighed. \"All right. Have a good winter, Mr. Torrance, Mrs. Torrance. You too, Danny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, sir,\" Danny said. \"I hope you do, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it,\" Ullman repeated, and he sounded sad. \"The place in Florida is a dump, if the out-and-out truth is to be spoken. Busywork. The Overlook is my real job. Take good care of it for me, Mr. Torrance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it will be here when you get back next spring,\" Jack said, and a thought flashed through Danny\u0027s mind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(but will we?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Of course it will\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUllman looked out toward the playground where the hedge animals were clattering in the wind. Then he nodded once more in a businesslike way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-by, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked quickly and prissily across to his car-a ridiculously big one for such a little man-and tucked himself into it. The Lincoln\u0027s motor purred into life and the taillights flashed as he pulled out of his parking stall. As the car moved away, Jack could read the small sign at the head of the stall: RESERVED FOR MR. ULLMAN, MGR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Jack said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched until the car was out of sight, headed down the eastern slope. When it was gone, the three of them looked at each other for a silent, almost frightened moment. They were alone. Aspen leaves whirled and skittered in aimless packs across the lawn that was now neatly mowed and tended for no guest\u0027s eyes. There was no one to see the autumn leaves steal across the grass but the three of them. It gave Jack a curious shrinking feeling, as if his life force had dwindled to a mere spark while the hotel and the grounds bad suddenly doubled in size and become sinister, dwarfing them with sullen, inanimate power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Wendy said: \"Look at you, doc. Your nose is running like a fire hose. Let\u0027s get inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they did, closing the door firmly behind them against the restless whine of the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart Three.
