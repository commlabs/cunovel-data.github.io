Don\u0027t get snappish on me. The answer to your question is no, I haven\u0027t had to endure a lot of them. Not for quite a while. You want to know the truth? It\u0027s been one hell of a long time since I\u0027ve been with a woman. Contrary to popular female opinion, a man does get to a stage in his life when he realizes he can abstain for extended periods of time without committing hara-kiri. Or maybe he just gets to the point where he finds it\u0027s easier to do without than go through the postmortems.\" He paused and then said a little roughly, \"I\u0027m sorry I was clumsy with you last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t clumsy,\" Verity snapped. \"I\u0027ve already told you that. I doubt if you could be clumsy if you tried. Things got a bit rushed, that\u0027s all. Everything was going beautifully until I found that earring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finding it scared you, didn\u0027t it?\" He stopped and pulled her into his arms beside the deserted road. The warm sun beat down on both of them as he caught her questioning face between his palms. \"I\u0027m sorry about that, too, Verity. The last thing I want to do is frighten you. Let\u0027s just give ourselves some time, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that what you were asking for last night? Time to get to know each other? We\u0027ve got lots of time, sweetheart. I made up my mind this morning to back off. You don\u0027t have to be afraid I\u0027m going to show up on your doorstep every night trying to talk you back into bed. I won\u0027t rush you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity smiled tremulously. \"Dad said he saw you reading Machiavelli this morning. Is this new strategy a result of a refresher course in the sneaky uses of power and politics?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you admitting I\u0027ve got some power over you, sneaky or otherwise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled but his eyes were serious and intent. \"You\u0027re important to me, Verity. I don\u0027t want to screw things up between us by pushing you too hard. Just give me a chance. I give you my word I\u0027ll take it easy for a while. I want you to trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about the earring that had fallen out of his pocket last night. Then she thought about all the things she had learned about men from watching her father over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were very few males in the world who would take a romantic gesture as far as Jonas had taken it when he traced her out of Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man who followed his own whims, a man who had absorbed the spirit and philosophy of a bygone age, a man who could quote Renaissance love poetry might be one of the select few who would think it perfectly normal to follow a woman a couple of thousand miles, carrying her lost earring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity touched Jonas\u0027s wrists on either side of her face. She could feel the corded strength in them, a compelling contrast to the astonishing sensitivity of his elegant hands. \"You\u0027re important to me, too, Jonas. I don\u0027t know how or why, but you are very important to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew a deep breath and pulled her close for a quick, hard kiss. \"Then we\u0027ll take it from there. And we\u0027ll take it slow. Everything\u0027s going to be all right, little tyrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaitlin Evanger showed up for dinner that night accompanied by Tavi. They came alone. Verity wasn\u0027t surprised, after the conversation she\u0027d had with Laura Griswald that afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a fascinating woman, I\u0027ll admit,\" Laura had said, \"but it was something of a strain trying to entertain her. Rick said he\u0027ll take a garden variety yuppie any day before he\u0027ll take another artist out to dinner. You and Caitlin seemed to hit it off well, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like her,\" Verity had admitted. \"And I admire her tremendously. She\u0027s a woman who\u0027s made it on her own. She\u0027s talented and hardworking. And, for some reason, I feel a little sorry for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you mean. I think she\u0027s more than hardworking and talented,\" Laura said thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she\u0027s driven. There\u0027s something strange about her, Verity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe all true artists are driven. Maybe that\u0027s what makes them able to produce art,\" Verity had suggested. \"Maybe that\u0027s what men such as my father and Jonas lack, a sense of drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe you\u0027re luckier than you know,\" Laura had said. \"I think it would be very difficult to live with someone who was obsessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Caitlin Evanger is obsessed with her art?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s obsessed with something. I can see it in her eyes. Oops, there\u0027s the other line. I\u0027ve got to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee you later, Verity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity had hung up and sat for a few minutes thinking of Caitlin Evanger\u0027s eyes. Laura had a point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something unsettling about Caitlin\u0027s compelling gaze. More ghosts. But that knowledge only made Verity feel a greater sense of compassion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaitlin and Tavi both ordered the fresh pea soup with mint and the vegetable pilaf. Caitlin selected a bottle of wine, and Emerson, who was helping out as a waiter, served it with a flourish. Caitlin nodded austerely to him when he finally poured but she did not seem overly impressed by the dramatics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Emerson complained as he came back to the kitchen. \"Talk about the original iceberg. Brrr.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas\u0027s mouth twisted wryly. \"Better you than me. I had to put up with her last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut it out, both of you,\" Verity ordered. \"You just don\u0027t understand her, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" Her father gave her a sour look. \"Well, it\u0027s your turn. She\u0027s asking for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity smiled loftily. \"She probably wants to tell me how much she enjoyed the pilaf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t count on it,\" Jonas cautioned. \"She probably wants to tell you she\u0027s going to report you to the health authorities because she found a fly in her soup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professional restaurateurs do not appreciate that sort of low humor, Jonas.\" Verity moved to stride past him into the dining room, aware that Jonas and her father were exchanging grins over her head. The male-bonding bit was getting a bit thick, she decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she should have expected Jonas and her father to get along well. They were, after all, two of a kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was everything, Caitlin?\" Verity asked as she came to a halt beside the table. A quick glance showed that both women had eaten most of their meal. A reassuring sign. As usual when anyone showed obvious evidence of having enjoyed her cooking, Verity was pleased. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-35.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
