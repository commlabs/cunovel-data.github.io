The painting screeched like an animal and the mouth on the painting opened wide. The painting launched itself at the shadow man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVelvet Jesus bit his head off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow man’s body evaporated like a cloud of car exhaust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was a flash, so bright that I couldn’t close my eyes to it because they were already closed, but the brightness penetrated to the back of my eyeballs, burning all through me. There was a thud in the ground, a shock wave that sent a ripple through reality. The painting disappeared. The furgun exploded in a miniature supernova of blue light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how I ended up flat on my back, but I was staring up at the still, gray clouds and trying to blink spots out of my eyes. All was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn appeared over me and said, “When they write the sequel to the Bible, that shit is definitely gonna be in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ears were ringing. Somehow, all of my senses were ringing. Overload. Then John was pulling me to my feet and saying, “Look! Look at that one’s face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pointing to one of the still life–infected REPER men, one I didn’t even know had been standing there when the world froze. It had been in the process of rounding the burning truck, running toward us. It would have reached Amy in about three seconds if John had not called his Soy Sauce time-out. I walked over to the infected spaceman. His eyes were a pair of road flares, sizzling and crackling and smoldering with white light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parasites were burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the parasites were burning—at least the ones around us. The white, crackling pinpricks of light were twinkling from the infected spacemen, the sizzle of the frying spiders filling the preternatural silence in that still world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the lights blinked out, one by one, the sizzling of the flesh fading, as the last of the parasites in the field died. The men they had lived in would not suddenly wake up and find themselves cured—happy endings like that never happened in Undisclosed. When time sped up, they would collapse, dead. But they would be free. And they would be no threat to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the stillness of the aftermath I said, “Man, I need a nap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around at the frozen battle, one that nobody involved in knew had just taken a radical turn in the infinity between ticks on the clock. “What happens now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn surveyed the landscape and said, “We just got to get out of the way, right? Time starts back up and the army realizes the zombies are all down and they’ll stop shooting and then they’ll give us all medals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Amy is still out in the open. If I position myself so that I’m kind of pushing her over, when time starts back up we’ll tumble down into the ditch, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I guess so. Try not to break her neck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go down there and get ready to catch us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn jumped down into the ditch, looking over Falconer, who had been shot multiple times. He certainly looked dead because he wasn’t moving, but nobody was moving so we couldn’t know for sure. I walked toward Amy, her frozen arms outstretched toward me like she was trying to ward me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething hit me in the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, I ran into something. Something hovering in midair, something small and sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bullet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn inch long and as thick as a pencil. Fired from one of the many guns bristling out of the line of green vehicles behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no mistaking the trajectory. It was heading right for Amy. Specifically, right for Amy’s heart. In the frantic fog of zombie combat some guy—who had probably enlisted to help pay for his college education—had taken a shot at the waving figure next to the ditch, and the shot was good. It was going to take her right out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn saw me standing there, slackjawed, looking at this frozen projectile, this little copper-jacketed death warrant hanging in the air about eight feet away from Amy. He looked back and forth between the bullet and the frozen Amy and didn’t need me to mutter, “Headed right for her,” though I did it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “Okay, okay. Let’s think it through. What if we—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of us has to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, that’s not true—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Either it tears through her heart, or one of us stands in front of her and lets it tear through ours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bullshit. It doesn’t have to be your heart. You can, like turn sideways to it, press your bicep against it, get that big bone in your arm in front of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A bullet like this … John, this thing is traveling at half a mile per second. They design them to punch through military-grade helmets and body armor. It’ll smash through the bone and rip through your lungs and take out your heart anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know that—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do, because, Marconi was right. I knew he was right. They still need their freaking sacrifice. Otherwise this thing won’t end. It’s a bill that needs to be paid. Somebody has to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. I’ll do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dave…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t understand the symmetry here, well, just think about it. It has to be me. It’s right. It fits. You said yourself that time won’t resume until we do what we’re supposed to do. If you stand here, in front of this thing, you’re going to be waiting forever. It won’t go off pause until I do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “Fine. Then leave it on pause. We’ll go do, whatever. Whatever we want. Piss off the top of the Statue of Liberty. Walk across the ocean and screw with frozen tourists in Paris. We got all the time in the world. We’ll use it. We’ll tour the world, you and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. “And leave her here, this thing hovering in front of her heart? Knowing things could suddenly snap into action at any second? No, I’d never be able to relax, knowing that. We’re screwing around somewhere on the other side of the world and suddenly she takes a bullet and she dies here, alone? Calling for me, her last thought to wonder where I am? No. I spent my whole life putting off what I knew I needed to do. No more of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well fuck you, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. Fuck me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait! You can leave a note. Like, a final message to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have anything to write with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have the contents of your own body. Smear the note onto the street. With your shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. “Yes, John, let’s have that be Amy’s last memory of me. I mean, once time starts again all of this is going to just be instantly in front of her. So from her point of view, she stood up, then in the blink of an eye suddenly I’m sprawled dead in front of her and I LOVE YOU BABE spontaneously appears onto the pavement, spelled out in smeared human feces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God, do it! You’ll be a legend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said to John, “Good-bye, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just … just wait, okay? There’s no hurry. There’s a whole list of things I need to say first—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, there isn’t. There really isn’t. Whatever you think you need to say, I already know. Trust me. Just … if you make it out of here, don’t…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought, and shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just don’t waste yourself. Do you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, almost imperceptibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded toward Amy and said, “And take care of her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She takes care of herself, if you haven’t noticed. I’ll see you on the other side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” I didn’t mean it. “You got your phone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got your phone. Want me to call somebody?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You’re going to get video of this. Once things start up again, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a feeling time was going to whip back up to speed the moment I was in position. “Let’s do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, my last, I figured, and stood about a foot in front of the bullet, its shiny tip aimed right at my sternum. I had been shot before, and it hurt quite a bit. But I had a feeling I was never going to feel this one. I thought this bullet had a serious chance of passing through my breastbone and through the soft tissue behind it, through my spine and then out again. But by then the bullet would be badly off course, tumbling through the air, breaking into fragments. It should miss her easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI steeled myself, trying to make my body harder, as if that would make a difference. I stared down the projectile, waiting for time to resume. I started to get impatient, and made a twirling motion with my fingers. “Come on. Start the clock, damn it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last second before time resumed and the bullet exploded forward, I registered an orange blur, bouncing along the ground. I turned—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSacrifice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn explosion of noise crashed in on me from every direction. In an instant, the guns were barking and the wind was howling and the stink of smoke was burrowing into my nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orange blur was right in front of me, kicking and thrashing through the air. And then there was a thud and a yelp and Molly was bleeding at my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy was yelling “DON’T SHOO—” at the soldiers, finishing her sentence from before the Great Pause, her words choked off in confusion. In a blink, there I was, standing in the road in front of her—to her eyes, I had teleported there. And there, on the ground in front of me, was Molly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun and dove and tackled Amy, pinning her to the ground, sending her glasses askew. The guns thundered behind us, and I craned my head around to see that Tennet’s army of infected were, as I thought, simply collapsing dead where they stood, like marionettes whose strings had all simultaneously been cut. Their parasite puppeteers had been burned to ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorturous minutes stretched out as we lay there and the gunfire continued over and around us, the amped-up soldiers getting their money’s worth. Bullets skipped off pavement and whistled overhead. But slowly, finally, one gun after another got the cease fire command. The Zulus were down. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/this-book-is-full-of-spiders-john-dies-at-the-end-2/page-75.html","bookId":2488,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:47 PM"}
