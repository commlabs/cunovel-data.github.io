It wasn\u0027t a field she recognized either. There were no sheep, no fences, and no indication of where she might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSettling her bag more firmly on her shoulder, she started toward the white frame house and cluster of outbuildings that the other end of the field rolled up against. Maybe she could get directions, or use their phone...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... or get run off for trespassing by a large dog and a farmer with a pitchfork.\" She was pretty sure they did that sort of thing in the country, that it was effectively legal, and that it didn\u0027t matter because she wasn\u0027t going back into those woods. She\u0027d take on half a dozen farmers with pitchforks first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she approached, wading knee-deep through grass and goldenrod and thistles, she became convinced that no one had worked this farm for quite some time. The barn had a faded, unused look about it and she could actually smell the roses that climbed all over one wall of the white frame house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe field ended in a large vegetable garden. Vicki recognized the cabbages, the tomato plants, and the raspberry bushes - nothing else seemed familiar. Which isn\u0027t really surprising. She picked her way around the perimeter. My vegetables usually come with a picture of the jolly green...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello.\" The elderly man, who had appeared so suddenly in her path, continued to stare, obviously waiting for her to elaborate further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, uh, got lost in the woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze started at her sneakers, ran up her scratched and bitten legs, past her walking shorts, paused for a moment on her Blue Jays\u0027 T-shirt, flicked over to her shoulder bag, and finally came to rest on her face. \"Oh,\" he said, a small smile lifting the edges of his precise gray mustache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe single word covered a lot of ground, and the conclusion it drew would\u0027ve annoyed the hell out of Vicki if it hadn\u0027t been so accurate. She held out her hand. \"Vicki Nelson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carl Biehn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis palm was dry and leathery, his grip firm. Over the years, Vicki had discovered she could tell a lot about a man based on how he shook hands with her - or if he\u0027d shake hands at all. Some men still seemed absolutely confused about what to do when the offered hand belonged to a woman. Carl Biehn shook hands with an economy of movement that said he had nothing to prove. She liked him for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like you could use some water, Ms. Nelson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could use a lake,\" Vicki admitted, rubbing at the sweat collected under her chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile broadened. \"Well, no lake, but I\u0027ll see what I can do.\" He led the way around the raspberry bushes and Vicki fell into step beside him. Her first view of the rest of the garden brought an involuntary exclamation of delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like it?\" He sounded almost shy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s... \" She discarded a pile of adjectives as inadequate and finished simply. \"... the most beautiful thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" He beamed; first at her and then out over the flower beds where a fallen rainbow, shattered into a thousand brilliant pieces, perched against every possible shade of green. \"The Lord has been good to me this summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki tensed, but he made no other reference to God. And thank God for that. She had no idea if her admiration had broken through the elderly man\u0027s reserve or if he simply had none when it came to the garden. As they walked between the beds, he introduced the flowers they passed as though they were old friends - here adjusting a stake that held a blood red gladioli upright, there swiftly beheading a dying blossom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... dusty orange beauties are dwarf hemerocallis, day lilies. If you make the effort to plant early, middle, and late varieties, they\u0027ll bloom beautifully from June on into September. They\u0027re not a fussy grower, not hard to work with, just give them a little phosphate and potash and they\u0027ll show their appreciation. Now these shasta daisies over here... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving spent most of her life in apartments, Vicki understood next to nothing about gardens or the plants that grew in them but she could - and did - appreciate the amount of work that had gone into creating and maintaining such an oasis of color amid the summer-toasted fields. She also could appreciate the depth of emotion that Carl Biehn lavished on his creation. He wasn\u0027t soppy or twee about it but the garden was a living being to him; it showed subtly in his voice, his expressions, his actions. People who cared that much about something outside themselves were rare in Vicki\u0027s world and it reinforced her first favorable impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old-fashioned hand pump stood on a cement platform, close by the back door. Carl led the way across the lawn toward it, finishing his enthusiastic monologue about the new heritage roses just as he reached for the handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cup appears to be missing again, Ms. Nelson. I hope you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki grinned. \"I may just stick my entire head under if that\u0027s all right with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be my guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all its apparent age, the pump worked smoothly, pulling up clear, cold water with only the slightest taste of iron. Vicki couldn\u0027t remember the last time she\u0027d tasted anything as good and the sudden shock of it hitting the back of her head erased much of the morning\u0027s stickiness. If the pump had been a little higher off the ground, she\u0027d have stuck her entire body under it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlicking her wet hair back off her face, she straightened and indicated the pump. \"May I?\" When Carl admitted that he wouldn\u0027t mind, they changed places. There was more pressure against the handle than Vicki had anticipated and she found herself having to lean into the mechanism. Gardening had obviously kept her elderly benefactor in good condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It really is incredible,\" she murmured. \"I\u0027ve never seen anything like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have seen it last week. Then it was really something.\" He stood, wiping his hands dry on his pants and gazing proudly out over the vast expanse of color. \"Still, I have to admit, it doesn\u0027t look bad. Everything out there from A to Zee, from asters to zinnias.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki stepped back as a bumblebee, leg pouches bulging with pollen, flew a slightly wobbly course just past the end of her nose. From this angle, she could look out over the flowers, to the vegetables, to the fields beyond. The contrast was incredible. \"It looks like shredded wheat out there. How do you keep the garden watered? It must be almost a full-time job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all.\" He rested one foot up on the cement platform and leaned a forearm across his thigh. \"I use an underground irrigation system, developed by the Israelis. I merely turn on the tap and the system does all the work. Just to be on the safe side, however, I\u0027ve run a water line out into the garden with a hundred feet of hose, in case a specific plant needs a little attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved a hand between the brown and the green. \"I just can\u0027t get over the difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sometimes even the Lord needs a little help, his wonders to perform. Have you been saved, Ms. Nelson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question came so unexpectedly, in such a rational tone, that it took Vicki a moment to realize what had been said and a moment beyond that to come up with what she hoped would be a definitive reply. \"I\u0027m an Anglican.\" She wasn\u0027t, really, but her mother was, sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" He nodded, stepping back off the platform. \"Church of England.\" For just a second, caught between the sun and the concrete, the damp sole of his shoe left a print - concentric half circles of tread last seen pressed into pine gum in the crotch of a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression carefully neutral over a sudden surge of adrenaline, Vicki put her own foot up on the platform and bent to tie her shoe. In the heat of the sun, the print dried quickly but it was a definite match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, so was the print she left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick look told her they were wearing the same brand of running shoe. A brand that seemed to cover the feet of half the civilized world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. Shit. Shit! Good news and bad news. Or bad news and good news, she wasn\u0027t quite sure. Evidence no longer pointed directly to the feet of Carl Biehn but her suspect list, based on the sneaker print at least, had just grown by millions. There\u0027d be small differences of course - size, cracks in the rubber, wear patterns - but the possibilities of an easy match had just evaporated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right, Ms. Nelson? Perhaps you should sit down for a moment, out of the sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\" He was watching her with some concern so she pulled up a smile. \"Thank you, Mr. Biehn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe we\u0027d best see about getting you back where you belong. If I could offer you a lift somewhere... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you can\u0027t, I most certainly will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki turned. The man standing in the doorway was in his early thirties, of average height, average looks, and above average self-opinion. He leered genially down at her, his pose no doubt intended to show off his manly physique - which, she admitted, wasn\u0027t bad. If you like the squash and health club types... Which she didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipping on a pair of expensive sunglasses, he stepped out into the sunlight, hair gleaming like burnished gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bet he highlights it. A quick glance showed he wore blue leather deck shoes. Without socks. Vicki hated the look of shoes without socks. Although odds were good he owned a pair of running shoes, she somehow doubted he\u0027d be willing to ruin his manicure by climbing a tree. Which was a pity as he seemed to be exactly the type of person she\u0027d love to feed to the wer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, she heard Carl suppress a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Nelson, may I introduce you to my nephew, Mark Williams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger man grinned broadly at his uncle. \"And here I thought your only hobbies were gardening and bird-watching and saving souls.\" Then he turned the force of his smile on Vicki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome expensive dental work there, she thought, picking at a bit of dried pine gum on her T-shirt and trying not to scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Nelson got lost in the conservation area,\" Carl explained tersely. \"I was just about to drive her home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh please, allow me.\" Mark\u0027s voice stopped just short of caressing and more than a little past what Vicki considered insulting. \"If I know my uncle, once he gets a lovely woman alone in a car all he\u0027ll do is preach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, don\u0027t put yourself out.\" Her tone made it more a command than a polite reply and Mark looked momentarily nonplussed. \"If you wouldn\u0027t mind ...\" she continued, turning to Carl. Being preached at would be infinitely preferable to being with Mark. He reminded her of a pimp she\u0027d once busted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all.\" Carl was doing an admirable job of keeping a straight face, but Vicki caught sight of the twinkle in his eye and a suspicious trembling at the ends of his mustache. He waved a hand toward the driveway and indicated Vicki should precede him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t hard to connect the car with the man. The late model, black jeep with the gold trim, the plush interior, the sunroof, and the rust along the bottom of the doors was practically a simulacrum of Mark. The ten-year-old, beige sedan with the recent wax job just as obviously - although not as loudly - said Carl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki had her hand on the door handle when Mark called, \"Hey! I don\u0027t even know your first name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and the air temperature plummeted around her smile. \"I know,\" she told him, and got into the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very expensive stereo system surprised her a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to listen to gospel music while I drive,\" Carl explained, when he saw her looking at enough lights and buttons and switches to fill an airplane cockpit. He stopped the car at the end of the driveway. \"Where to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere to, indeed; she had no idea of the address or even the name of the road. \"The, uh, Heerkens sheep farm. Are you familiar with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suppressed emotion in that single word pulled Vicki\u0027s brows down. \"Is there a problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis knuckles were white around the steering wheel. \"Are you family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Just the friend of a friend. He thought I needed some time out of the city and brought me here for the weekend.\" Mike Celluci wouldn\u0027t have believed the lie for a moment - he\u0027d often said Vicki was the worst liar he\u0027d ever met - but some of the tension went out of Carl\u0027s shoulders and he turned the car out onto the dirt road and headed north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just met them this weekend,\" she continued matter-of-factly. Experience had taught her that the direct approach worked best with no nonsense people like her host. \"Do you know them well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl\u0027s mouth thinned to a tight white line but after a moment he said, \"When I first moved here, ten, eleven years ago now, I tried to get to know them. Tried to be a good neighbor. They were not interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they are pretty insular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Insular!\" His bark of laughter held no humor. \"I tried to do my duty as a Christian. Did you know, Ms. Nelson that not one of those children have been baptized?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki shook her head but before she could say anything, he continued. \"I tried to bring that family to God, and do you know what I got for my caring? I was told to get off their property and to stay off if I couldn\u0027t leave my God at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re lucky you didn\u0027t get bit, Vicki thought. \"I bet that made you pretty mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God is not something I carry around like a pocketbook, Ms. Nelson,\" he told her dryly. \"He is a part of everything I do. Yes, it made me angry... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngry enough to kill? she wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... but my anger was a righteous anger, and I gave it to the glory of the Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did the Lord do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe half turned toward her and smiled. \"He put it to work in His service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that could mean any number of things. Vicki stared out the window. How do you bring up the subject of werewolves? \"Your nephew mentioned that you\u0027re a birder... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I can spare time away from the garden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever go into the conservation area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On occasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a cousin who\u0027s a birder.\" She had nothing of the sort; it was a textbook interrogation lie. \"He tells me you can see all sorts of fascinating things out in the woods. He says the unusual and bizarre lurk around every corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he? His list must be interesting then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the most interesting species you\u0027ve ever identified?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray brows drew down. \"I had an Arctic tern once. No idea how it got so far south. I prayed for its safe flight home and as I only saw it the once, I like to think my prayers were answered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An Arctic tern?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That,\" he told her without taking his eyes off the road, \"was exactly the reaction of the others I told. I never lie, Ms. Nelson. And I never give anyone a chance to call me a liar twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt as though he\u0027d just slapped her on the wrist. \"Sorry.\" Well, that got me exactly nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like good hunting out here,\" she said casually, peering out the car window, watching trees and fields, and more trees and more fields go by. \"Do you hunt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" The single syllable held such abhorrence, such strength of emotion, Vicki had to believe it. \"Taking the lives of God\u0027s creatures is an abomination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squirmed around to face him, wondering how he\u0027d rationalize his diet. \"You don\u0027t eat meat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not since 1954.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" His point. \"What about your nephew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my house he follows my rules. I don\u0027t try to run the rest of his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor do you approve of the rest of his life, Vicki realized. \"Has he been staying with you long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Then he added, \"Mark is my late sister\u0027s son. My only living relative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich explains why you let the slimebag stay around at all. She sensed his disapproval, but whether it was directed at her or at Mark she couldn\u0027t say. \"I\u0027ve, uh, never hunted,\" she told him, attempting to get back into his good graces. Technically it was the truth. She\u0027d never hunted anything that ran on four legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you. Do you pray?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not as much as I should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat startled him into a smile. \"Probably not,\" he agreed and pulled over at the end of the long lane leading to the Heerkens farm. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, this is as far as I can take you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse you? You\u0027ve saved me a long hot walk, I\u0027m in your debt.\" She slid out of the car and with one finger holding her glasses, leaned back in through the open window. \"Thanks for the ride. And the water. And the chance to see your garden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded solemnly. \"You\u0027re welcome. Can I convince you to join me at worship tomorrow, Ms. Nelson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well.\" He seemed resigned. \"Be careful, Ms. Nelson; if you endanger your soul you endanger your chance of eternal life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki could feel his sincerity, knew he wasn\u0027t just saying the words, so she nodded and said, \"I\u0027ll be careful.\" and stepped back onto the shoulder. She waited where she was until he maneuvered the big car around in a tight three point turn then shifted the weight of her bag on her shoulder, waved, and started toward the lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was when she saw Storm emerge from the hedgerow about a hundred meters down the road. Tongue lolling, he trotted toward her, sunlight shimmering in the golden highlights of his fur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTires growled against gravel, the big sedan picked up speed, and headed right for the young wer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki tried to yell - to Storm, to Carl, she wasn\u0027t sure\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ut all that came out of a mouth gone suddenly dry was a strangled croak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, in a spray of dirt and small stones, it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl Biehn, his car, and his God, disappeared down the road and Storm danced a welcome around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs her heart started beating again, Vicki settled her glasses back on her nose, her free hand absently rubbing the warm fur between Storm\u0027s ears. She could have sworn... I must\u0027ve got just a little too much sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding nothing to interest him in the highly overrated great outdoors, Mark Williams wandered back into the house and pulled a cold beer out of the fridge. \"Thank God dear Uncle Carl has nothing against \u0027alcohol in moderation.\u0027 \" He laughed and repeated, \"Thank God.\" Hopefully, that blonde bitch was getting an earful of peace and love and the rest of that religious crap from the crazy old coot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t been his type anyway. He liked his women smaller, more complacent, willing to be overwhelmed. The kind he could be sure wouldn\u0027t go screaming to the police over every little bending of the rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I like is the kind of woman that doesn\u0027t land me in the middle of goddamned nowhere.\" He took a long swallow of beer and looked out the kitchen window at the fields shimmering in the heat. \"Shit.\" He sighed. \"This is all Annette\u0027s fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Annette hadn\u0027t been ready to blow the sweet little operation he\u0027d been running out of Vancouver, he wouldn\u0027t have had to have her killed so quickly that he\u0027d had to hire professional help, and sloppy professional help at that. He shuddered to think of how close he\u0027d come to spending his most productive years behind bars. Fortunately, he\u0027d been able to arrange it so that the hired help had ended up taking the fall. He\u0027d barely been able to close down the business, realize most of the projected profits, and get out of the province before the hired help\u0027s family had arrived to demand their share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And thus I find myself in the ass-end of civilization.\" He finished the beer and yawned. It could\u0027ve been worse; the nights, at least, offered rare sport. Grinning, he tossed the empty into the case. Last night\u0027s bit of fun had proven his skills were still as sharp as they\u0027d ever been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second yawn threatened to dislocate his jaw. He\u0027d been up until the wee small hours of the morning and been awakened obscenely early. Maybe he should head upstairs for a nap. \"Don\u0027t want the fingers trembling at a critical moment. Besides,\" he grabbed another beer to take with him, \"there\u0027s bugger all else to do until dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen an overgrown lilac hedge blocked the line of sight from the road, Vicki silently handed Peter his shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. What were you doing with old man Biehn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came out of the woods on his property.\" It certainly wasn\u0027t going to hurt anything if Peter believed she\u0027d chosen her direction on purpose. \"He gave me a ride back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Good thing Uncle Stuart didn\u0027t see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your uncle really ran him off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah, and if Aunt Nadine hadn\u0027t stopped him, he\u0027d have probably attacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki felt her brows go up and she turned her head to look at Peter directly. She gotten used to the disembodied voices of the people walking beside her but occasionally she just had to see expressions. \"He\u0027d have attacked over a difference in religion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what old man Biehn said?\" Peter snorted. \"Jennifer and Marie were six, maybe seven, and Aunt Nadine was pregnant with Daniel. Old man Biehn came over - he dropped by pretty often back then, trying to save our souls, and it was driving us all nuts - and he started talking about hell. I don\u0027t know what he said \u0027cause I wasn\u0027t there, but he really scared the girls and they started to howl.\" Peter\u0027s brows drew down and his ears went back. \"You don\u0027t do that to cubs. Anyway, Uncle Stuart showed up and that was that. He\u0027s never come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was pretty angry about it,\" Vicki offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as angry as Uncle Stuart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you must see him occasionally... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter looked confused. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki thought about that for a moment. Why, indeed? She hadn\u0027t seen the two young men who lived in the back basement apartment of her building since the day they\u0027d moved in. If in almost three years she hadn\u0027t run into them in the hallway, by the only door... Well, the odds are good you can miss someone indefinitely out here in all this space. \"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, the fine spray of red-gold hair on his chest glinting in the sun. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d come to the end of lane and Vicki leaned gracefully against the huge tree that anchored it to the lawn. Mopping her dripping brow, she opened her mouth to ask where everyone was when Peter threw back his head and ran his voice wordlessly up and down a double octave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose wants to tell you something,\" he said by way of explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose wanted to tell her about Frederick Kleinbein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she\u0027s imagining things,\" Peter volunteered after his sister finished talking. \"What do you think, Ms. Nelson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Vicki told them, \"that I\u0027d better go speak to Mr. Kleinbein.\" She didn\u0027t add that she doubted the tree\u0027s falling at that time and in such a way had been entirely natural. Off the top of her head, she could think of at least two ways it could be done without leaving a scent for the wer to trace. Had Peter actually left the car, she was pretty certain he\u0027d have returned to find his twin had been shot the same way as Silver and Ebon. Which meant the assassin\u0027s pattern wasn\u0027t tied to that tree in the woods. Which opened up a whole new can of worms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God for Frederick Kleinbein. His arrival had no doubt saved Cloud\u0027s life and, simultaneously, removed him from the suspect list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll things considered though, she thought she\u0027d better have a talk with him anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose shot a triumphant look at her brother. \"He lives just back of the crossroads. I can tell you how to get there if you want to take Henry\u0027s car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry\u0027s car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. It\u0027s about three and a half miles, maybe a bit more. It\u0027s easy enough for four legs but a bit of a hike for two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter leaned forward, nostrils flared. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing\u0027s wrong. But, just as I suspected, I\u0027m piss useless out here. You see, I can\u0027t. See that is. And I can\u0027t drive. How the hell am I supposed to do anything and what the hell can I tell you...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped as Rose reached out and stroked her arm, callused fingers lightly running over sweaty skin. She realized the touch was for comfort, not pity, and stopped herself from jerking the arm away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t drive,\" she told them, her voice hard-edged to keep it from shaking. \"I can\u0027t see well enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, is that all.\" Peter leaned back relieved. \"No problem. We\u0027ll drive you. I\u0027ll just go get the keys.\" He flashed her a dazzling grin and loped off to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, is that all? Vicki watched Peter disappear into the kitchen then turned to look at Rose, who smiled, pleased that the problem had been solved. Don\u0027t judge them by human standards. The phrase was rapidly becoming a litany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... anyway, Uncle Stuart says that if you want the wood, it\u0027s yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, good. You tell your uncle, I get it when heat breaks.\" Frederick Kleinbein swiped at his dripping face with the palm of one beefy hand. \"So, I have late raspberries that rot because I am too fat and lazy to pick; you interested?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twins turned to Vicki, who shrugged. \"Just don\u0027t ask me to help. I\u0027ll stay here in the shade and talk to Mr. Kleinbein.\" And as Mr. Kleinbein very obviously wanted to talk to her...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he began a moment later, \"you are visiting from the city. You know Heerkens for long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not long at all. I\u0027m a friend of a friend. Do you know them well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not what you call well. No.\" He glanced over to where Rose and Peter were barely visible behind a thick row of raspberry canes. \"They keep apart that family. Not unfriendly, distant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And people respect that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Farm is paid for. Kids go to school.\" The finger he waggled in her direction looked like a half cooked sausage. \"No law says got to be party animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki hid a smile. Party animals - now that was a concept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward, his whole bearing proclaiming he had a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere it comes, Vicki thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay with them so you must know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, fighting to keep her expression vaguely confused. \"Know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Heerkens... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... the whole family... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned forward herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... are... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir noses were practically touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... nudists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki blinked and sat back, momentarily speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrederick Kleinbein sat back as well and nodded sagely, his jowls bobbing an independent emphasis. \"They must keep clothes on for you so far.\" Then his entire face curved upward in a beatific smile. \"Too bad, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know this?\" Vicki managed at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sausage ringer waggled again. \"I see things. Little things. Careful people, the Heerkens, but sometimes there are glimpses of bodies. That\u0027s why the big dogs, to warn them to put on clothes when people come.\" He shrugged. \"Everyone knows. Most peoples, they say bodies are bad and go out of way to avoid Heerkens but me, I say who cares what they do on own land.\" He waved a hand at the raspberry bushes. \"Kids are happy. What else matters? Besides,\" this time the smile carne accompanied by a decidedly lascivious waggling of impressive eyebrows, \"they are very nice bodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki had to agree. So the surrounding countryside thought the Heerkens were nudists, did it? She doubted they\u0027d have been able to deliberately create a more perfect camouflage. What people believe defines what people see, and people looking for flesh were not likely to find fur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0027s a hell of a lot easier to believe in a nudist than a werewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that someone, she reminded herself, feeling the weight of the second silver bullet dragging at her bag, isn\u0027t following the party line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough his nephew\u0027s jeep was still in the driveway, Mark himself appeared to be nowhere around. Carl sat down at the kitchen table and leaned his head in his hands, thankful for the time alone. The boy was his only sister\u0027s only son, flesh of his flesh, blood of his blood, and the only family he had remaining. Family must be more important then personal opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it a sin, he wondered, that he couldn\u0027t find it in his heart to care for Mark? That he didn\u0027t even like him very much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarl suspected he was being used as a refuge of some sort. Why else would this nephew he hadn\u0027t seen in years suddenly appear on his doorstep for an indefinite stay? The boy - the man - was a sinner, there was no doubt about that. But he was also family and that fact had to outweigh the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the Lord had sent Mark here, at this time, to be saved. Carl sighed and rubbed at a coffee ring on the table with his thumb. He was an old man and the Lord had asked a great deal of him lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I ask Mark where he goes at night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I have the strength to know? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-trail-vicki-nelson-2/page-6.html","bookId":2465,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:00 PM"}
