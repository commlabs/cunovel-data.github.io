This was why they had all gathered here to leave a positive memory behind in the two children’s minds.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“If they had something useful, I would take it, but…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere was no hidden treasure or skill in this village, he had already checked with his Read All Creation ability.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBasically, he had nothing to gain from the villagers. This town had no special characteristics aside from the the fact that the heroes were born here. This was basically a quintessential starter’s village!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Nothing good will come from getting involved with them. Even if we received and completed a request, they would probably give us some grass as reward.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I’m good at eating grass. When I was young, father taught me which grass I could eat.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I\u0027m not going to eat grass, I’m not a cow. Are you a cow?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“No!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Then you shouldn’t eat it from now on.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Yes!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe didn’t care about the worries of the villagers, they didn’t interest Artpe. The fact that he was a hero now was annoying, so he didn’t feel the need to get involved in other people’s business! The only things he needed were money, level, skills and spells!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“This is why we have to run away. If we stay put, we might be dragged away to the castle.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I also don’t want food that tastes bad!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaetel let out an energetic shout as if she agreed with Artpe. However, she soon asked a question in low spirits.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“If father comes back to find me missing, he’ll be sad. If I go to the castle, I can contact him, but I can’t do that if I go with you.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“You are sharp in regards to some topics… Well… Mmmm.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt this point in time, Maetel’s father had died in a remote part of the continent. Artpe had been in charge of investigating her, so he was sure of it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, he couldn’t just tell her that her father was dead just because it was so in his previous life! Artpe’s existence might have changed the fate of Maetel’s father, but that possibility was very low. However, he didn’t feel the need to attack Maetel mentally at this point in time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis was why he made up a reasonable-sounding excuse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“We’ll leave behind a letter. Your father knows that you are close with me, so he’ll probably come looking for you at this hut.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Artpe. I know how to read letters, but I don’t know how to write...”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“It’s all right, I know human... I know how to read and write in the Kingdom\u0027s Language.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“That’s amazing!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen Artpe raised his right hand, a blue light appeared at the end of his index finger. This couldn’t be called magic, it was the most basic mana technique called Mana Manifestation. It was possible to engrave letters into wood using the hot mana. Maetel’s eyes became brighter. Artpe grinned as he confirmed something with her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Does your father know the Kingdom Language?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Of course!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“All right, hero. Do you have anything you want to tell your father?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Yes, I do! So…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eArtpe transcribed all of Maetel’s words onto the wall of the hut. He let out a sigh as he stepped back. He thought this was pointless, but if he could keep her morale up, it was worth it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e‘I’ve gone through the trouble of doing this. You should come back alive and search this hut.’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe grumbled as he gave his wish, and he grabbed Maetel’s hand. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eKyahh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaetel let out a bashful sound, but he ignored it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Let’s run away.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Y…yes!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Ah, Artpe!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Maetel!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe two of them charged out of the hut’s door in an energetic manner and the villagers rushed forward. Artpe didn’t know when the priest would be coming back, so he didn’t have the time to deal with the villagers. He chose the weakest looking villager, glaring at him as he spoke.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“We have to go to the restroom.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I...I’m sorry.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVillage person D backed off.
