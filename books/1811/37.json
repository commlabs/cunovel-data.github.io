Then her smile drops as she grabs Drew’s arm and drags him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile John chats with an associate next to him, Dee leans in and tells me quietly, “I don’t like how your friend was running his mouth at my cousin—and Kate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my arm around her. “He’s just competitive. It’s business—a dog-eat-dog kind of thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I have no doubt Drew would give up his right ball for the chance to eat Kate Brooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee’s not pacified. “If he comes back and decides to be a dick again, I’m going to tell him he’s risking getting his cut off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the weeks since meeting her, I’ve seen many sides to Delores—carefree, seductive, tender, silly. But this is the first time I’ve witnessed her protective side. I’ve got a lot of respect for loyalty. The fact that Dee is so violent about expressing hers is goddamn adorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my lips to the top of her head. “Let’s just hope it doesn’t come to that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kate and Drew didn’t return to the conference room within a couple of minutes, I’m guessing Billy went searching for them. Because ten minutes later, Billy and Kate appear at Dee’s side—both looking uncomfortable. Tense. Definitely not happy campers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew doesn’t come back to the party at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jack takes his leave a half hour later, I assume he and Drew made plans to start bar-hopping early. Given her recent threats against Drew, it’s probably not the best night to bring Dee out with the guys after all. So when the office party winds down, Kate, Billy, Dee, and I hit the city together. We walk a few blocks and grab a table at a just-starting-to-get-crowded tavern that’s hosting an open mic night on its small stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores and Kate harass Billy to sign up to perform. Billy nudges Kate with an elbow. “Sing with me. Like old times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate shakes her head. “No way. My singing days are over. I’ve hung up the microphone for good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough her tone is joking, Warren looks . . . disappointed. Maybe even a little wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter downing our first round of drinks, his name comes up and he takes the stage—borrowing one of the tavern’s guitars. He sings a cover of “Here’s to Us.” I don’t remember the name of the original band, but I know their sound leans toward heavy metal and their lead singer is a smoking hot redhead with killer pipes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I have to say—I’m pretty frigging impressed with Billy Warren. His guitar playing is really good and his voice is awesome—smooth, with just the right amount of gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee raises her glass, claps, and calls, all while bobbing her head in time to the tune. Kate, however, watches Billy with proud—but serious—eyes. I guess some of the lyrics are kind of sad, in a way. Poignant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talk about toasting love, good times, mistakes, and moving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren hits the last note of the song perfectly, and the whole place erupts in applause. Kate smiles and stands when he comes back to the table, telling Billy he did a great job. I shake his hand and say the same. While Dee goes for the more exuberant approach. “Awesome job, Jackass!” Then she hugs him until he turns red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate excuses herself to the bathroom. And I turn to Delores. “So . . . I guess your cousin got all the musical genes in the family, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly adds, “I see you’ve sampled Dee-Dee’s singing skills.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Screw you both—I’m an excellent singer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cousin chuckles. “Sure you are, Rain Man. Cats come from miles around just to hear you—hoping to get lucky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and tap my beer bottle to Warren’s. Then he ducks as Dee whips a pretzel at his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate sits back down next to Billy, and I can’t help but notice the space between their chairs. Billy leans forward and says, “So . . . I’ve got some news. That music producer who came to my gig a few months back called. He wants me to come out to California . . . says he can get me into a studio.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee smiles joyously. “Oh my God! That’s fantastic!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut judging by the look on her face, fantastic isn’t what Kate thinks it is at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When . . . when did this happen?” she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly shrugs. “A few days ago.” He sips his beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why am I just hearing about it now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension sweeps across the air like a swarm of locusts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly stares hard. “When was I supposed to tell you, Kate? You’re never around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer frown deepens. “We live together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And even when you’re at the apartment, you’re not there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks away and pushes a hand through her hair. Delores watches them—worriedly—like a child of divorce stuck between two bickering parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t . . .” Kate starts. “I can’t go to California now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly keeps his eyes on his beer bottle. “Yeah . . . I know. That’s why I’m going by myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate looks completely blindsided—hurt, and a little angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But . . . we had a plan. You supported me when I was in school and now I . . . it’s my turn to do that for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly pushes his chair back from the table. Defensive frustration makes his hands clench and his expression tight. “Well, plans change, Katie. I mean really, will you even f**king notice when I’m gone? ’Cause it sure doesn’t feel like you will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s about to ask what he means. It’s right there on the tip of her tongue. But she stops short and says, “I don’t want to fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis just pisses Warren off more. “Of course you don’t want to fight. You don’t want to do anything with me these days! You’re too busy to go anywhere—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m working!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignores her. “You don’t want to argue, or talk; you don’t want to have sex . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s cheeks flush pink, but I can’t tell if it’s because she’s embarrassed or mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All you want to do is look over your f**king files and decide what suit you should wear to the office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not fair!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know business is a man’s world, but I didn’t know you had to dress the part.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores jumps in. “Don’t be a dick, Billy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay out of it, Dee-Dee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith fire in her eyes, Kate gets in her financé’s face. “Screw you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs in a bitter way. “Interesting choice of words. I’m not sure who you’ve been screwing lately, but it hasn’t been me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tamed-tangled-3/page-37.html","bookId":1811,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM"}
