Then he gestured toward the couch and television. “Do you mind if I...?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh! Yeah, sure. Go right ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, best idea ever. I’d latch onto anything to wipe away the uncomfortable tension between us. And the television was a perfect outlet. I wished I’d thought of it and offered it first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great, thanks. I’ve been itching to catch up on Psych.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him into the living room area, curious. “Psych?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed an engaging grin at me over his shoulder. “It’s this hilarious detective show I found on Netflix. We don’t get Netflix at my apartment, so I can only watch it here. And Cora can’t stand it, so I sneak it in when I’m waiting for her to...” He made air quotes as he grinned at me, “change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t help it. I grinned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flopped down on the couch and made himself at home, flipping up the middle cushion to reveal a center console nook hiding a handful of remote controls. Taking one out, he turned on the television and pushed another series of buttons to get into the show and the very episode he wanted. When he clicked on an option that said “resume playing,” I realized how much more he was familiar with my new apartment than I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must’ve been incredibly strange for him to wait in the hallway until I’d given him permission to enter. And then he’d even had to ask to sit down. My face heated; I felt like a moron. He was Cora’s boyfriend; of course he knew his way around. He’d demonstrated that last night when he’d told me where everything was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, I felt completely out of my element.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe show popped on, and the two guys on the screen instantly captured my attention as they argued about something completely inconsequential over the body of some dead guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptivated, I inched further into the room and slid tentatively down into a side chair. Within seconds, I was giggling. I slapped my hand over my mouth just as Quinn grinned at me as if happy to see me enjoying his show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more people arrived at the scene. They looked like detectives. “That’s Jules and Lassiter,” Quinn explained. “Shawn, the main guy there, has had a major crush on Jules since the beginning. I think they’re going to get together.” Then he sent me a rueful grin. “At least they better get together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back, completely charmed. But, aww, he was a romantic. I loved that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kept watching, totally engrossed in the show. I asked question after question. Quinn was currently working his way through season four, but seemed happy to explain everything he knew and catch me up to speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were both laughing over something Gus was saying to Shawn’s dad when Cora strolled into the room, wearing a tiny pair of shorts that were unbelievably shorter than my own, and no shirt over her skimpy bikini top. She looked suntanned and flawless—not at all like she was suffering from kidney failure—as she artfully tossed a beach towel over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everybody ready?” she asked before focusing on the television and making a face. “Oh God. Please don’t tell me you’re pushing that dumb show on Zoey now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn just grinned at her. “She’s laughing,” he argued, still smiling up at Cora as she sauntered across the living room to crawl into his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face heated at her bold move, and I shifted, uncomfortable to watch such intimacy. Facing him and straddling his lap, Cora grabbed onto the back of the couch on either side of him, caging him in. Quinn set his hands on her hips and gazed into her eyes as she tsked and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you weren’t so cute, I’d have to reevaluate our relationship. Because dating someone who actually likes this show...” She sighed as if he was hopeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill grinning, Quinn framed her face in his hands. “You look really pretty today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora threw back her head and laughed, her gorgeous blonde hair spilling down her spine. “Of course, your being a total sweetheart helps your case considerably.” Then she leaned in to kiss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy skin buzzed with awareness as I quickly glanced away to give them a measure of privacy. But I’d already seen enough for my core temperature to skyrocket. The way Quinn had closed his eyes, his too long lashes resting against the tops of his cheeks, was like art. His hands continued to cup Cora’s face as if he treasured her. And his mouth. The way it moved against hers compelled me to cop another peek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over again just as he pulled away. But the adoration in his eyes as he simply gazed at Cora seemed just as, if not more, intimate than the kiss they’d shared. He really liked her. It was a shock to the system to see such affection between two people. My father had certainly never looked at any of the women he dated this way. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-15.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
