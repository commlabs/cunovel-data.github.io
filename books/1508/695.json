Yesterday, Lin Ming had been in a hurry so they didn’t even really greet each other, much less have an in-depth conversation.

The three of them all had third stage Life Destruction cultivation. Because of you, they lost a Nirvana Dragon Root. If news of your survival spreads, then it would be bad for you if you caught their attention.

Although my strength has its limits, with the Giant Leviathan, I have the strength to deter a sect that even has a transcendent third stage Life Destruction powerhouse.

Since he had returned, he had no intention of acting in a low-key manner. Otherwise, it would be the same as showing weakness to others. This was a world of martial artists—only when the strong were feared by their enemies. Every fool knew that the four Divine Kingdoms controlled an unbelievably massive amount of resources, but who would dare to steal it? On the other hand, if someone weak were to have a massive amount of resources, then others would covet it, try to steal it, and even kill to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e…………………..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eAt this time in the meeting hall’s courtyard, three old men and a youth stepped out from a spirit boat. The yellow-clothed young man was around 30 years old, and he was tall with an arrow-straight posture. He was Yin Yang Profound Palace’s Little Palace Master, Xing Yang. As for the three old men behind him, they were the Elders of Yin Yang Profound Palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“Fairy Maiden Mu, it’s been a while.

Because someone had snatched away his chance to meet the Divine Kingdom Crown Prince first, he was in a poor mood. Thus, he decided to switch his aim towards Divine Phoenix Island. He was hoping to obtain Mu Bingyun and Mu Qianyu’s Primordial Yin Energy. Although this was less beneficial than befriending the Divine Kingdom Crown Prince, it would still help pave his road to becoming an Emperor-level powerhouse in the future. Additionally, if he could really subdue these two women and marry them as their husband, then enjoying their love-making and warm nights in bed would also be great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eThinking this, Xing Yang grinned from ear to ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“Thanks to the blessing of your Yin Yang Profound Palace, this old woman still hasn’t died yet.” Mu Fengxian’s response was a bit dreary. In negotiations within the world of martial artists, one never made concessions to the other party because of something as silly as courtesy. Indeed, if it weren’t because of all this then Mu Fengxian would never have bothered speaking to such a slimy snake like Xing Yang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“Hehe, Fairy Maiden Mu, then let’s cut with the nonsense and continue with our previous conversation—the secret transplant method of the Vermillion Bird blood essence!” As Xing Yang spoke, he walked straight over to the meeting table and gestured. “I’ve come with enough sincerity this time in the hope that Fairy Maiden Mu will know when to kindly give way!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eXing Yang’s voice was filled with warning. Divine Phoenix Island had hurriedly taken asylum within Yin Yang Profound Palace, not even having time to discuss all the major details.

She was well aware of just what disgusting plans this Xing Yang was making.

He was sure that he didn’t see Lin Ming when Divine Phoenix Island first came to Yin Yang Profound Palace. If he did, then he definitely would have remembered him. Lin Ming seemed to be only 20 some-odd years old but his cultivation was at the early Revolving Core. Not just that, but the true essence around his body was exceptionally thick.

After all, a martial artist aged at a very slow pace. There wasn’t that great a difference between 30 years and 20 years of age.

He didn’t understand Divine Phoenix Island’s history too much, so he temporarily didn’t associate this Lin character with “that” Lin Ming. He only found it strange that Divine Phoenix Island still had this sort of talent remaining. Still, since he was a Divine Phoenix Island disciple, there simply wasn’t anything to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eHe began to think about finding an excuse to punish Lin Ming, and then quietly slipping him some medicine to ruin his abilities to function as a man in bed, thus removing his chances of taking Mu Qianyu’s virginity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eBut then, at this moment, Lin Ming opened his mouth wide to spout out some fantastical and stunning words….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eLin Ming said, “You there, the one called Xing Yang, I came here today to tell you…negotiations are over. Immediately return the Vermillion Birds. Yin Yang Profound Palace will also divide half of their territory as a temporary residence for Divine Phoenix Island. This includes practice arrays, medicine garden supplies, true essence stone, and all other resources. Half of everyone’s daily share will be given to Divine Phoenix Island as an offering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming finished speaking, Xing Yang’s jaw fell wide open. He nearly couldn’t believe his own ears.

Even the normally indifferent Mu Bingyun was staring at Lin Ming with a puzzled expression. Lin Ming definitely didn’t seem as if he were joking around. Thus, she turned to look at Mu Qianyu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eMu Qianyu was also surprised. She never thought that Lin Ming would suddenly demand such excessive conditions. This was the same as slicing off the flesh from Yin Yang Profound Palace!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eDuanmu Qin, Feng Shen, and Lan Xin all seemed to not care too much. As descendants from a Holy Land, they naturally didn’t have any interest in the resources of a minor fifth-grade sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eHow valuable could it possibly be? Any one of the earth-step Demon God Bones that Lin Ming had obtained in the 1000-mile forbidden zone was enough for a fifth-grade sect to recklessly spend wealth for ten years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eAfter several breaths of time, Xing Yang suddenly laughed. “I thought you were some sort of genius but I never imagined you were such an idiot. You must have thought these negotiations were too boring so you wanted to tease me into laughing! Hahahaha! You not only succeeded, but you also did a great job!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eXing Yang’s expression then turned icy. “Elder Jiang, Elder Sun, seize that boy for me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eBehind Xing Yang there were three black-clothed Elders. Two of them were late Revolving Core and the last was at the first stage of Life Destruction.

Because they lacked masters, most of their Elders were actually at the mid or late Revolving Core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eXing Yang simply couldn’t bother to deal with Lin Ming himself. Elder Jiang and Elder Sun behind him both had cultivation at the late Revolving Core, more than enough to deal with the likes of Lin Ming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eLin Ming casually swept his eyes over the two Elders and chuckled.

Mu Yuhuang and Mu Fengxian’s complexions changed. They were well aware that Lin Ming wasn’t an idiot, but what could he do in this situation? Even if he was extraordinarily strong, what would happen even if he was able to jump ranks and defeat these two Revolving Core Elders? Could he take the entire Yin Yang Profound Palace as his enemy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eAt this time, Lan Xin clucked her tongue as she slightly tittered, her laugh sweet like silver bells. Her tone was laced with sarcasm as she bluntly said, “Is this still a fifth-grade sect? A fifth-grade sect’s Elders should accordingly be Life Destruction masters. But you use late Revolving Core Elders as an in-between and still think that you can be acknowledged as a fifth-grade sect! How ridiculous!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eAs Lan Xin said this, Elder Sun and Elder Jiang both became furious. This was not only cruelly mocking Yin Yang Profound Palace but also mocking them, exposing all of their shortcomings that no one dared to voice out loud. What Lan Xin had said was truly toxic. Although Yin Yang Profound Palace was known as a fifth-grade sect, they really did have many places where they didn’t meet the definition of a fifth-grade sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“Little girl, since you want to die so badly then this old man will show you just how high the heavens are and how the low earth is!” Elder Jiang couldn’t see what Lan Xin’s cultivation or race was. He assumed that she was some sect talent, and was also the naïve sort that had never left their sect before. The type that assumed just because their talent was a little high they could act like an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“Haha, you’re going to make me die of laughter! I’m standing right here. If you can approach within three feet of me then I’ll count you as having won!” Lan Xin winked at Duanmu Qun. She had never been a polite, good little girl to begin with. With such a fun opportunity in front of her, she certainly wouldn’t want to miss it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eDuanmu Qun was speechless. He thought that Lan Xin would take action, but he never expected that this little lady would circle everything back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eIndeed, with Lan Xin’s strength she would be able to defeat Elder Jiang. But it wouldn’t be easy; she might even be wounded. If so, it would be difficult for her to maintain her lofty attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“You are far too arrogant!
