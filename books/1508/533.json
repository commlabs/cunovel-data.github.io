Even amongst the first group he was ranked near the top. However, even this character had been quickly dispatched by Lin Ming. So who would still dare to challenge Lin Ming?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven the usually insidious and avaricious Imps were looking at Lin Ming with fear and hate in their eyes. Some of them felt uncomfortable and quickly left. But there were many Fey women that looked at Lin Ming with interest. There were some that even batted their eyes at him and were sending him flirtatious signals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe entire arena had been muted.

A stirring emotion filled his heart as he said, “It’s a complete blowout…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mmm…in Skysplit Tower, it’s been over ten years since a human has caused a complete blowout…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis so-called blowout was when no one dared to challenge a martial artist in the arena. This sort of situation usually only happened with the Giant Demons and the Fey.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEvery level of Skysplit Tower had certain requirements for a martial artist’s cultivation. The martial artists that had a higher cultivation had to go to a higher level of Skysplit Tower. Therefore, those martial artists that were able to cause a complete blowout amongst those at their cultivation level had to be the most supreme of talents. To humans, this was far too difficult. Even Saint level talents weren’t enough.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is incredible. I have no idea what sect he’s from. This sort of talent, as long as he doesn’t perish, will absolutely become a Peerless Emperor!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘It’s best if we don’t involve ourselves with this sort of matter. There are martial artists that don’t like to reveal their origin.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTime slowly passed. During the pregnant silence of the arena, a formal looking blue-skinned middle-aged man stepped onto the stage. He calmly proclaimed, “In half an incense stick of time, no one has come up to challenge. This is a complete blowout!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Congratulations. With this trial, you have earned the right to enter the second level of Skysplit Tower, an Invincible Glory Emblem, as well as 10 slaughter points.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Invincible Glory Emblem? Slaughter points?” Lin Ming’s eyebrows rose. He knew very few of Skysplit Tower’s rules; this was his first time hearing about these things.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe blue-skinned man smiled. He could already tell that Lin Ming was unfamiliar with the customs and rules of Polaris City. Really, just where had this young man come from?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe continued to explain, “In Skysplit Tower, every martial artist has a corresponding authority. A normal martial artist only has an authority rank of one star. Every time you obtain a Glory Emblem, your authority will rise by another star. The highest is 12 stars. For instance, you currently have a two star authority rank. On all of Skysplit Tower’s expenses, you may receive a 5% discount. As your authority increases, so will the benefits you receive. There are many areas in Skysplit Tower that you can’t enter if your authority isn’t high enough.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm? What sort of places?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe blue-skinned man mysteriously smiled and said, “For example, there are special auctions, or special cultivation areas and treasures…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Cultivation areas?” Lin Ming’s mind stirred. After practicing martial arts for so many years, he was fully aware of just how important one’s cultivation place was. Back when he had cultivated at the Seven Profound Martial House, his experience was completely different after using the seven great killing arrays there.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, the difference between the Seven Profound Martial House and Skysplit Tower was like the heavens and earth. The Skysplit Tower was a source of infernal energy in the Blood Slaughter Steppes, and also contained strange laws that even Emperor level powerhouses weren’t able to break through. The quality of these cultivation areas could be imagined!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What sort of Glory Emblems are there?” Lin Ming asked. He was very interested in these cultivation areas.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There are many of them. Besides the Invincible Emblem, there is the 100 Victory Emblem, 1000 Killer Emblem, Destructor Emblem, Lord Emblem, and so on…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming wasn’t clear was the so-called Destructor Emblem and the others were. He asked, “What are slaughter points? What are they used for?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Slaughter points can be used to purchase special things. For instance, when I previously mentioned cultivation spaces, those spaces require not just authority, but one also needs to pay Blood Demon Crystals and slaughter points in order to enter. Also, for certain specialized auction houses, there are certain goods that can only be purchased with slaughter points.” The blue-skinned man patiently explained to Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Understood. When I entered Skysplit Tower, I heard that strength was the only rule here. But you just spoke about so many different rules. Were these rules of Skysplit Tower already established since long ago, or were they developed by individuals?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe blue-skinned man smiled and said, “Some of these rules were naturally written by others. But, it is exactly because they are strong that they are able to maintain these rules. The reason that these rules still exist is because the one who maintains them is the Ten Winged Lord.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ten Winged Lord? Not twelve wings?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You don’t have to worry about these things. When you arrive at that level, you will know.” The blue-skinned man was silent after he spoke.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had to give up on his questions. He took the emblem from the blue-skinned man – this was the Glory Emblem. After he thanked the man, he walked down the arena stage steps.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWherever Lin Ming walked, the crowd would naturally part in front of him. No one dared to block his path. Several Fey women actually coyly blinked at Lin Ming, but as they saw that he didn’t even look their way, they only gave a snappy humph.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t bother with them. He walked towards the exit. Now that there wasn’t any problem with him entering the second floor, he just wanted to find a place to rest and refine the infernal energy within his dantian.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Greetings, Brother!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming reached the exit, a human martial artist called out to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs he turned around, he saw that this martial artist that called out to him was one of the human martial artists that was being forced away by Zha Na.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs they saw Lin Ming look over to them, they awkwardly smiled. Compared to Lin Ming, they were a bit ashamed by their actions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe human martial artist at the front cleared his throat and said, “I thought that fellow brother is not too familiar with Skysplit Tower. If you don’t mind, then you’re welcome to come with us. I’ll take you to find a quiet place where you can stay, and also give you an introduction to Skysplit Tower’s rules. How about it…?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming thought about it for a moment and then simply agreed. If he had a guide then things would be much easier.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Then I’ll have to trouble you.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha, Brother is too polite. The ones that should be saying thanks are us. You have really regained the pride of the humans in Skysplit Tower. You might not know, but usually humans don’t come to the arena. If it wasn’t for you appearing today, then we might have been in danger. Even if we left safely, we would still have been humiliated.” The human martial artist sighed from the heart. The arena was truly the world of Giant Demons and Fey. When humans came, they would be under an unimaginable amount of pressure.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot just that, but there were many places in Skysplit Tower where killing was not forbidden.
