{"id":104798,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed unguarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We jump?\" Susan asked, dismayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk nodded. \"Can you swim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan nodded. \"I\u0027m a marine biologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa balked. They were a good fifty feet above the water. Shouts echoed in the direction of the bow. Monk glanced at Lisa\u0027s leg, then up to her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. No other choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to go as a group,\" Monk said. \"One big splash will draw less attention than four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey climbed over and held themselves steady on the rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk leaned farthest out. \"Ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNods all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa\u0027s stomach churned, her leg throbbed. Pain made her see stars in the dark water, brief flashes of electric streaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk counted down, and they all leaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArms flailing for balance, Lisa plunged feet first. She had done some cliff-diving in the past. Still, when she struck the water it was like landing on hard-packed dirt. The blow impacted her entire frame. Her knees buckled—then the sea gave way. She shot deep into the warm water. After the chill of the rain and wind, the lake felt like a welcoming bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer momentum slowed, braking further with her arms out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was rising. She kicked and stroked back to the surface, breaking through with a gasp. All around, rain pebbled the water. Winds spat in contrary gusts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTreading water, Lisa spotted the three others. Monk was already headed to the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder helped Susan. He glanced over to Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved him to the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer boots and sodden clothes made it harder, but she kept pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk reached the speedboat first and hauled himself up and into it like a beaching seal. He stayed low and surveyed the tender dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo shouts arose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship still rang with alarms. Everyone was probably still heading to the upper deck, where the fugitives had last been spotted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder reached the boat next with Susan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Monk helped them aboard, Lisa closed the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was almost to the boat when— —something struck her leg, bumping it hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, she floundered a bit. She searched the dark waters. Something brushed against her hip. It left a tracery of green fire in the water, flashing, then gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands grabbed her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost cried out. She had not known she had reached the boat. Ryder hauled her up and over the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa sprawled across the floor. Abandoned tools pinched her backside. She smelled oil in her hair. But she didn\u0027t move. She breathed deeply, slowing her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine behind her suddenly gave a watery growl. Ryder yanked off the mooring lines. Monk edged the boat away from the dock. He went slow at first, keeping their noise to a minimum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa sat up and glanced back to the dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shape stepped out of the ship and onto the planks of the tender dock. Even with his face shadowed, Lisa pictured his tattoos. Rakao. The Maori leader had not been fooled. He knew there were only so many ways off this ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go!\" Lisa shouted. \"Full throttle, Monk!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine shook, coughed a bit of water, then roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lisa stared, Rakao lifted his arm. She remembered his giant horse pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down!\" she yelled. \"Everyone down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuzzle fire flashed. The metal side of the boat rang from a glancing shot. The boat\u0027s speed kicked up, churning a thick wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRakao fired again, but even he must have realized it was wasted. He already had a radio to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk sped away from the cruise ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa noted another speedboat appear from around the stern of the cruise ship, still some distance off. It must be returning from the beachside village. It suddenly sped faster, aiming for the tender dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRakao must have summoned it, preparing to give chase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had a good lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is, until the engine choked with a loud clank and an oily gout of smoke. The speedboat shuddered and slowed. Lisa sat higher, twisting around. She stared down at the tools she had sprawled atop. The oily towel crumpled in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat had not been waiting to ferry passengers between boat and village—it was being repaired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine\u0027s smoking grew worse. Its roar became a putter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder swore, climbed past her, and opened the hatch on the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore smoke poured out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder scowled. \"This little tinny\u0027s gone tits up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the cruise ship, Rakao leaped from the dock to the speedboat. It took off after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no choice,\" Monk said, turning the wheel as they weakly limped along. The engine sputtered a bit more speed. \"We\u0027ll have to make for shore, Hope for the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stared at the beach, then back toward Rakao\u0027s boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would still be a close call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk cajoled as much horsepower as he could. The dark forest rose before them. At least it looked dense enough to hide them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half minute later, the engine finally died completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swim for it!\" Ryder said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beach was not far. Less than fifty yards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abandon ship,\" Monk agreed. \"And haul ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, they all leaped into the lake. Lisa kicked off her boots and followed. Rakao\u0027s boat roared toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly after she hit the water did she remember something bumping her earlier, her momentary panic. But right now Rakao scared her more. Having been diving all her life, Lisa had been bumped by her fair share of inquisitive sharks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRakao was definitely scarier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicked for shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing behind her, she noted strange flashes in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerald, ruby, sapphire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScintillations, like fire underwater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey streaked through the water, aiming for their group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa suddenly knew what had bumped her, what sped toward them, a pack of hunters, communicating with flashes of light, a predatory Morse code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swim!\" she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paddled faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wouldn\u0027t make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt FOLLOWS THE scent trail of blood in the water. Lateral fins undulate and glide. Muscles pump water through its mantle and out its rigid rear funnel, jetting its six-foot bulk through the water. It clenches its eight arms into a tight point, a sleek muscular arrow. Its two longest tentacles flash with brilliance at their tips. Streaks of luminescence shiver in stripes along its flanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuiding the pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge globular eyes read the messages of its brethren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome sweep wide, others go deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood scent grows richer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa kicked and paddled in clean strokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic would only slow her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beach spread ahead, a slivery strand between the black water and dark jungle. It was a finish line she intended to cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRakao\u0027s boat growled behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Maori pirate was not who she was racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreaks of watery fire jetted toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawn by her sliced calf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour yards ahead, Monk and Ryder slogged out of the water, dragging Susan between them. Lisa kicked harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monk!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWITH ONE FINAL muscular squeeze, it sweeps toward the churn of water. It unfurls its arms, billowing them wide. Two longer tentacles shoot out, snaking through the water, blistering with yellow lights, lined by suckers barbed with chitinous hooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:05 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk heard his name called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa paddled toward shore, looking frantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly three yards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her the pirate boat skimmed at full throttle right toward their group. Rain poured from the open sky, dimpling the lake. Beneath the surface, winking flashes of fire, like tracer rounds in the night, shot toward Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk remembered the stories of this lagoon. Told by a toothless local. Demons of the deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaped back into the water. The shore fell away steeply. In two steps he was waist-deep. \"Lisa!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced to him, eyes meeting. Then suddenly she jerked to a stop, snagged. Her eyes widened. \"Go—\" Monk lunged for her, arms out. \"Your hand! Too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flurry of tentacles exploded from the water, enveloping her. With neck-breaking speed, Lisa was twisted and slammed below, swamped away. The monster rolled briefly into view, sleek and fringed with small lateral wings, rippling with thin bands of electric flashes. A large black eye stared back, then vanished away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne sleeved arm broke the surface, already two yards farther out. Then with impossible speed, it ripped through the water, a fish on a zipping line. The limb snapped back into the deep. Lisa. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk took another step, preparing to dive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut blasts of gunfire shattered through his shock. Rounds peppered the water, driving him back, out of the water, to the sand. \"Here!\" Ryder yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore shots coughed up divots of sand. Rifle fire cracked. He had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk stumbled back, into Ryder\u0027s grip, into the dark forest. Lisa. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa struggled to hold her breath, tangled within constricting arms. Giant hooks bit into flesh, made painless by panic. She kicked and writhed. Eyes open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrailing flashes of light shot through the darkness. This was how she would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:06 p.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk allowed himself to be pulled farther into the jungle. He had no choice. There was nothing he could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough a break in the foliage, he stared back toward the black water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pirates\u0027 boat had slowed near the beach. Rifles bristled toward shore, searching. But Rakao stood braced in the bow, a dark silhouette with long spear in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a heave, the Maori hunter drove the length of steel into the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcs of blue lightning sizzled outward from where it struck, brilliant in the darkness, lighting up the night and the depths of the lagoon. Waters hissed with a bubble of steam around the spear\u0027s shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was he doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarely conscious, Lisa gasped the last of her trapped air. A painful shock clenched through her. The squid\u0027s embrace locked harder, experiencing the same agony, possibly even more sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen its arms released her with a final savage twist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeawater burned into her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes open, she saw the creature streak down into the dark depths, an arrow of emerald fire. Others followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuoyancy floated her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen hands grabbed her, pulled by her hair. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-45.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
