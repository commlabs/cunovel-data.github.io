{"id":37769,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. MR. HALL\u0027S DISCOMFITURE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;The paper which John had discovered among the rubbish in the stove was a half sheet of foolscap, which was covered with imitations of Mr. Berry\u0027s handwriting, the words occurring being those of the note of hand which Hall had presented for payment. The first attempts were inexact, but those further down, with which pains had evidently been taken, were close copies of Mr. Berry\u0027s usual handwriting. This of course John could not know, not being familiar with his uncle\u0027s hand, but his aunt confirmed it. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is clear,\" said John, \"that Mr. Hall has forged the note which he presented against my uncle\u0027s estate.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What a wicked man,\" said Mrs. Berry, \"to seek to defraud me and my poor fatherless children! I never could have suspected him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was the love of money, aunt. He thought you would not detect the fraud.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [290]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should not but for you, John. How lucky it was you came! Now tell me what I ought to do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is there a lawyer in the place?\" asked John.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; there is Mr. Bradley.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then, aunt, you had better send for him, and ask his advice.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will do so; I think that will be the best way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Bradley, though a country lawyer, was a man of sound judgment, and quite reliable. When the circumstances were communicated to him, he gave his opinion that John\u0027s suspicions were well founded.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should like to see Mr. Hall here,\" he said. \"Can you not ask him to be present, and bring the note with him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The store closes at nine. I will invite him then, if you can meet him at that hour.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That will suit me, Mrs. Berry,\" said the lawyer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Hall was not surprised at the message he received. He expected that the widow would be troubled about the claim he had presented, and he was prepared to listen to entreaties that payment might be postponed. That his fraud was suspected he did not dream.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Mr. Hall entered the little sitting-room he was somewhat surprised to see Mr. Bradley, the lawyer;[291] but it occurred to him that Mrs. Berry in her trouble had applied to him to mediate between them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-evening, Mr. Bradley,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good-evening, Mr. Hall,\" said the lawyer, rather coldly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is rather cool this evening,\" said Hall, trying to appear at ease.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I understand,\" said Mr. Bradley, not appearing to notice this remark, \"that you have a claim against the estate of my late friend, Mr. Berry.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And the amount is—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Two thousand dollars,\" said Hall, promptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So I understood. Did you bring the note with you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hall opened his pocket-book, and produced the note. The lawyer took it, and scanned it closely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you know what led Mr. Berry to borrow this amount?\" asked the lawyer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He wanted to put it into his business.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did he extend his business then? He might have done it to a considerable extent with that sum.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I believe not,\" said Hall, hesitating.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But I thought he borrowed the money with that object.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The truth is,\" said Hall, after a pause, \"he was[292] owing parties in Boston for a considerable portion of his stock, and it was to pay off this sum that he borrowed the money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose you are aware, Mr. Hall, that this claim will sweep away two-thirds of Mr. Berry\u0027s estate?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sorry,\" said Hall, hesitating. \"I didn\u0027t know but he left more.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Scarcely a thousand dollars will be left to the family. Mrs. Berry will have a very hard time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I won\u0027t be hard upon her,\" said Hall. \"I don\u0027t need all the money now. I will let half of it, say, stand for a year.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But it will have to be paid finally.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I suppose I must have my money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is rather strange that Mrs. Berry never knew anything of this. Her husband usually told her of his business affairs.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She thought so,\" said Mr. Hall, significantly,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you mean to imply that he did not?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It seems that he did not tell her of this.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So it appears, and yet it is a very important matter. By the way, Mr. Hall, it was very creditable to a young man, like yourself, to have saved up so considerable an amount of money. Two thousand dollars is quite a little sum.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [293]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I did not save it up,—that is, not all of it,\" said Hall, perceiving that this would lead to suspicion. In fact, he was beginning to feel rather uneasy under the lawyer\u0027s questioning.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You did not save it up?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not all of it. I received a legacy a little more than two years since from a relative.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You were fortunate. What was the amount of the legacy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Fifteen hundred dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And you loaned all this to Mr. Berry?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And five hundred dollars more.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You never mentioned this legacy at the time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Only to Mr. Berry.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where did your relative live, Mr. Hall?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In Worcester,\" said Hall, hesitating.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What relative was it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My aunt,\" answered Hall, beginning to feel uncomfortable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What was her name?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t see why you ask so many questions, Mr. Bradley,\" said Hall, beginning to find this catechising embarrassing, especially as he had to make up the answers on the spot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [294]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Surely you have no objection to answer my question, Mr. Hall?\" said the lawyer, looking fixedly at the young man, who changed color.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It isn\u0027t that,\" said Hall; \"but it seems unnecessary.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You must consider, Mr. Hall, that this claim is a very unexpected one. Mr. Berry never mentioned to any one, so far as I know, that he had borrowed this money of you. Remember, also, that it will reduce Mrs. Berry to poverty, and you will not be surprised that we want to know all the particulars respecting the transaction.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think the note ought to be sufficient,\" said Hall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"True, the note. Let me examine it once more.\" The lawyer scrutinized the note, and, raising his eyes, said:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This note is in Mr. Berry\u0027s handwriting, is it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By the way, Mr. Hall, the interest has been paid on this note at regular intervals.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ye—es,\" said Hall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How often?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Every six months,\" he answered, more boldly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah, then I suppose we shall find corresponding entries on Mr. Berry\u0027s books.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [295]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose so,\" said Hall; but he began to feel very uncomfortable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So that no interest is due now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"About a month\u0027s interest; but never mind about that, I won\u0027t say anything about that,\" said Hall, magnanimously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are very considerate, Mr. Hall,\" said the lawyer; \"but I am sure Mrs. Berry will not accept this favor. She intends to pay you every penny she owes you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Hall brightened up at this intimation. He thought it looked encouraging.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want to be hard,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t care for the trifle of interest due.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I repeat that Mrs. Berry means to pay every penny that is justly due, but not one cent that is not so due,\" said the lawyer, emphasizing the last words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course,\" said the clerk, nervously; \"but why do you say that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you wish me to tell you, Mr. Hall?\" asked Mr. Bradley, fixing his keen glance upon the young man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I will tell you. Because I believe this note which I hold in my hand to be a base forgery.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hall jumped to his feet in dismay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [296]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you mean to insult me?\" he asked, with quivering lips.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sit down, Mr. Hall. It is best that this matter should be settled at once. I have made a charge, and it is only fair that I should substantiate it, or try to do so. Did you ever see this sheet of paper?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So saying, he produced the crumpled half sheet which John found in the stove.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Hall turned pale.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know what you mean,\" he faltered; but there was a look upon his face which belied his words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think you do know, Mr. Hall,\" said the lawyer. \"You must be aware that forgery is a serious matter.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Give me back the note,\" said Hall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you admit it to be a forgery?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I admit nothing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Hall, I will hand you the note,\" said the lawyer, after a slight pause, \"merely reminding you that, if it is what I suppose, the sooner you destroy it the better.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hall took the note with nervous haste, and thrust it into the flame of the lamp. In an instant it was consumed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [297]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You have done wisely, Mr. Hall,\" said Mr. Bradley. \"I have no further business with you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall leave Wilton to-morrow, Mrs. Berry,\" said Hall. \"I must ask you to get somebody else in my place.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will pay you to-night whatever wages are due you\" said the lawyer, \"in behalf of Mrs. Berry.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But how shall I manage about the store?\" asked Mrs. Berry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will take charge of it, aunt,\" said John, promptly, \"if you will get some one to assist me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well, John; but I am afraid it will be too much for you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never fear, aunt; I haven\u0027t been in the store long, but I\u0027ve learned a good deal about the business.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hall was paid, and that was the last that was seen of him. He went away in the stage the next morning, and it is to be hoped that he has found out that honesty is the best policy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After he had left the room, Mr. Bradley advanced to Mrs. Berry, and, grasping her hand, said, cordially:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I congratulate you on the new and improved look of your affairs.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It has lifted a great weight from my mind,\" said[298] the widow. \"Now I feel sure that I shall be able to get along, especially with John\u0027s help. He was the first to suspect Mr. Hall of attempting to cheat me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You ought to be a lawyer, John,\" said Mr. Bradley. \"You have shown that you have a good head on your shoulders.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps I may be one some time,\" said John, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you ever do, my office is open to you. Good-night, Mrs. Berry; we\u0027ve done a good evening\u0027s work.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next day John undertook the chief management of his aunt\u0027s store. He engaged James Sanford, who had had some experience in another town, to help him, and things went on smoothly for a few weeks. At the end of that time John received an important letter from Hampton.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2986/82335.html","bookId":326,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 8:12:19 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 8:12:19 AM"}
