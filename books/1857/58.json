Except maybe Josh, who’s always known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emilia,” she says, and hugs me. “You have a beautiful voice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe some things aren’t the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Answer me something,” Josh says, a month after I’ve gotten back. I’m in the chair in his garage and I’m doing homework, not woodworking, because I may never catch up. I could go inside and study in the air conditioning, but I love this place. And being out here, breathing sawdust in Josh Bennett’s garage with him, is worth any amount of sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve answered everything, Josh. I don’t think there are any questions left to ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just one,” he says, laying down a screwdriver and coming over to lean against the workbench opposite me. He pushes his boots out far enough so that they just touch mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close the book and try not to smile at him, because I know what’s coming. It’s the question I’ve been waiting for him to ask since the day I got lost and ended up at his house in the middle of the night, before he even knew what the question was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you see when you died?” He has that tentative half smile, like he’s almost embarrassed by what he’s saying. “Because I’m guessing it wasn’t the Sea of Tranquility.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when I look at him, I’m not so sure it wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you go?” His voice drops just slightly and he loses even the suggestion of a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s watching me like he’s not sure he’s allowed to ask the question, and he’s not even sure he wants the answer. I can almost see his grandfather’s words and Josh’s doubts about them swimming in his head. On every side of me are the lights and the tools and the wood and the boots and the boy I want to see forever. And if my Sea of Tranquility were real, it would be this place, here, with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t say anything right away, because I just want one minute to look at his face before I give him my last secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your garage.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sea-of-tranquility/page-58.html","bookId":1857,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:43 PM"}
