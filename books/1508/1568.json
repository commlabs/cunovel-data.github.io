During these seven years, Empyrean Divine Mist had nearly never spoken about his past. Lin Ming had only once asked him how long he had been stranded in Tragic Death Valley and Empyrean Divine Mist had responded with an approximate figure – 35 million years.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe flow of time in Tragic Death Valley was increased in a 10:1 ratio from the outside. That meant that 35 million years within Tragic Death Valley was equal to 3.5 million years outside, a figure consistent with the 3.47 million years that Qin Yi had spoken of!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was inevitable that he formed some connections in his mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe most likely explanation was that in the past, when Divine Void wanted to kill Divine Mist, the reason was to compete for the qualifications to become a True Divinity!

Empyrean Divine Mist and Great Emperor Divine Void were brothers to begin with. If the two brothers were willing to support each other then they could truly dominate the world, unrivalled by anyone.

Empyrean Divine Mist and Great Emperor Divine Void had similarly astonishing levels of talent to begin with and their cultivation conditions were similar. So, why did Divine Void step into the True Divinity realm whilst Divine Mist remained at the extreme Empyrean realm? When an Empyrean stepped into True Divinity, that was an entirely new level altogether; it wasn’t a minor difference.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf one had to think about it, then several million years ago, the two brothers Divine Void and Divine Mist must have stumbled onto some opportunity to becoming a True Divinity. But, this opportunity could only help one person realize their dreams. And for this chance, Divine Void had harmed Divine Mist. If so, then everything made sense!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“So originally… the reason Divine Mist fell into Tragic Death Valley was because of some chance of becoming a True Divinity!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Ming sighed with emotion. Millions of years ago, Empyrean Divine Mist had been at the prime of his life. He could be called a dashing and heroic figure who had even learned about a chance to become a True Divinity. If he had succeeded then his prospects would have been endless and his name would have been preserved in the annals of history.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBut no one could predict the heavens or the hearts of others. In the end, Divine Mist had been harmed by his brother and had lost his chance of becoming a True Divinity.

If possible, I hope that all of you can become divine runic masters. Of course… because the examination is considerably strict, the chances of that happening aren’t too high.

Lin Ming had gone to numerous shops where he was rejected many times. Finally, he had to sell the Overwhelming Rune on consignment. The price was low to the point that it seemed to be an inscription symbol drawn by an apprentice. During the process, he even encountered his old sweetheart Lan Yunyue. She had looked at him with a sadness unfit for an outsider.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs Lin Ming recalled all of this, his movements became much slower. It was like the scene of dozens of years ago when he first drew up the Overwhelming Rune was replaying itself in his mind. He recalled walking down that difficult early road, adding halo upon halo to his body until he shined with radiance. He was moved just by thinking about this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was immersed in his own drawing, every stroke of his was filled with a sincere earnestness.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAnd to the side, there was someone that was staring at Lin Ming the entire time. This person was Old Man Xue.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOld Man Xue was all smiles. He planned to see just what tricks Lin Ming was going to bring up. But as Lin Ming started to draw up the Overwhelming Rune, his happy expression slowly froze on his face, to be replaced by one of growing astonishment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn his opinion, it was impossible to produce a divine runic master without dozens of years of hard work. This was also in a situation where there was a teacher guiding them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOf course, if one was a heaven-gifted rare talent and also had the hands-on help of a teacher, then learning enough to become a divine runic master in 10 years wasn’t a problem at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFor instance, Qin Yi had only practiced the divine runic arts for 15 years. And looking at his appearance, he was definitely more skilled than a first grade divine runic master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, no matter how ridiculous one’s talent was, Old Man Xue didn’t believe that Lin Ming could learn how to honestly draw up a divine runic symbol in a single year. Although Lin Ming’s movements were slow, they were steady and true!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHis fundamentals could be called solid.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was especially astonishing because Lin Ming was a human martial artist!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This boy… just how did he practice?

At that time, there was no point in pretending. After all, Lin Ming wasn’t a child.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Could he have had some fortuitous encounter?

All of his concentration was placed on Lin Ming as he closely observed Lin Ming’s movements. If Lin Ming could maintain this state then there really was the chance that he could complete a divine runic symbol!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOf course, it was too early to make any guesses right now. Lin Ming’s movements weren’t fast and completing a single divine runic symbol required forming hundreds and thousands of tiny runes.

If this level of talent could be maintained, then Lin Ming would absolutely be able to become a divine runic master in two years. Within five or six years, he could become a second grade divine runic master.
