Exposure cases on the Outer Worlds are common enough--an everyday affair--and Ive read a great deal about them.\" Treatment consisted in part of an antiviral serum and the use of a microwave wrapping.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"This ought to take care of it,\" the doctor said. \"On the Outer Worlds, they make use of much more elaborate equipment in hospitals, but we dont have that, of course, on Trantor. This is a treatment for mild cases and Im sure it will do the job.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors thought later, as Seldon was recovering without particular injury, that it was perhaps because he was an Outworlder that he had survived so well. Dark, cold, even snow were not utterly strange to him.
