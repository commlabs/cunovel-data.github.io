{"id":43196,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II.","content":"For some moments the two young men walked on in silence, which was at last broken by Ainsley.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I say, Phil,\" he began, eagerly, laying his hand on his friend\u0027s shoulder, \"do you think any one of those three beauties would accept an invitation to go down and see the yacht-race with me to-morrow afternoon?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ravenswood looked shocked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are surely jesting to ask my opinion as to whether any one of those young girls would accompany a stranger to a place of amusement. You certainly know, as well as I do, that they wouldn\u0027t entertain such a thought for an instant. And even suppose they did? Their parents would soon let you know what they thought on the subject. Like all sweet rosebuds, they are guarded by thorns. A very stern duenna usually accompanies them on their afternoon rambles, and woe to anything masculine who attempts to hold a few moments\u0027 conversation with any one of them. I confess I was surprised to find them alone to-day—very much surprised, I must say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fate interposed in my behalf,\" laughed Ainsley, nonchalantly; adding: \"I tell you, Phil, I am a strong believer in fate, no matter what any one says to the contrary, believing with the poet—everything is preordained,[10] planned out ahead for us, and we can not escape it. We are to meet certain people. One girl makes no impression upon us whatever, no matter how pretty she may be; we meet another, and lo! with the first glance from her eyes, the mischief\u0027s done—we are done for. Now, am I not correct?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope you have not made such a fool of yourself as to fall in love at first sight with any one of those young ladies to whom I was mad enough to introduce you, Ainsley!\" cried Ravenswood, very much nettled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And why not, pray?\" returned Royal Ainsley, coolly. \"You should blame fate if I have done so, not me, my dear fellow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sorry for you, Ainsley, if such is indeed a fact,\" declared Philip Ravenswood, gravely, \"for I do not think you could win the girl. Plainly speaking, you are no match for either of them. You know that. But which one of them is it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The one with the pansy velvet dark eyes—with the face of a damask rose—Ida May, I believe you called her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ravenswood looked wonderfully relieved. As long as it was not Hildegarde, he would not trouble himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"By George!\" exclaimed Ainsley, stopping short, \"I believe those three young girls ride the bicycle. Now that I think of it, I\u0027m sure I saw them whirl past the club yesterday morning. They wore natty navy blue suits and blue veils. I couldn\u0027t see what their faces were like. Two elderly gentlemen accompanied them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, they ride the wheel,\" assented Ravenswood, reluctantly. \"The two gentlemen were Mr. Ryder and Mr. Cramer, who are very enthusiastic over the sport.[11] There\u0027s a millionaire\u0027s club of wheelmen here at Newport.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I presume they will be at the fancy masquerade cycle tournament next week, then?\" said Ainsley, carelessly, though he listened anxiously for the reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No doubt,\" returned Ravenswood. \"They were all at the last one. By the way, it\u0027s a very select affair. One has to be a member of the club, or have considerable outside influence, to secure tickets.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you a member?\" asked Ainsley, quickly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" returned Ravenswood. \"It was Hildegarde\u0027s father who proposed my name. I did not get even one black ball, and was consequently voted a member.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you suppose, if you had been a poor devil of a clerk, instead of a millionaire\u0027s son, you would have been voted in?\" asked Ainsley, a trifle bitterly, a hard light flashing into his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Possibly not,\" replied Ravenswood, with a good-humored laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should have thought you would have improved the opportunity of seeing considerable of the Three Graces awheel,\" said Ainsley, after a few moments\u0027 pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Their fathers discourage anything of that kind,\" laughed Philip; \"as more than one young man has found out.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But Miss May\u0027s relatives—do none of them ride?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They are too old for that sort of thing,\" laughed Ravenswood. \"The old gentleman is as deaf as a post, and is relegated to the hotel piazza because of the gout. His wife is equally as deaf, and is too unwieldly to venture far from her corner of the piazza. It is laughable to hear them shout at each other through their ear-trumpets. I have often thought what a lonely life of it that beautiful[12] young girl must have with those two old people. It would be unendurable, I fancy, if it were not for her two young friends.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Probably they make up for not being companionable by not being so strict with their pretty prospective little heiress?\" suggested Ainsley, again listening eagerly for his friend\u0027s reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They certainly allow their granddaughter, or niece, whichever she is, more liberty than Hildegarde\u0027s or Lily Ryder\u0027s parents do. Still, I suppose they are confident that she can come to no harm, surrounded by such careful friends and companions.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you say, Philip, you were going to the fancy-dress masquerade tournament?\" asked Royal Ainsley, slowly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do not propose to miss it,\" responded Ravenswood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think you can secure me a ticket, Phil?\" asked Ainsley, point-blank. \"Grant me that favor if you can. Remember, I ask it as a great favor. Surely you can manage it somehow for me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll try,\" replied Ravenswood. \"If it\u0027s possible, you shall attend.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During the next few days that followed, handsome Royal Ainsley saw as much of the Three Graces as was possible. One day he was content with a bow or a smile—on the next, a few words in passing; but he was wise enough to keep out of the way whenever their relatives were about.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1691/49774.html","bookId":1156,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM"}
