Like a biiiiiig hug? Or that she...\" She stopped, because Matt was already shaking his head vehemently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was no innocent biiiiiig hug. We were alone, in the doorway there, and she just...well, I couldn\u0027t believe it. She\u0027s only fifteen, but she acted like an adult woman. I mean...not that I\u0027ve ever had an adult woman dothat to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking embarrassed but relieved at having got this off his chest, Matt\u0027s gaze went from face to face. \"So what do you think? Was it just a coincidence that Caroline was there? Or did she...say something to Tamra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No coincidence,\" Elena said simply. \"It\u0027d be toomuch of a coincidence: Caroline coming on to you and then Tamra acting like that. I know - I used to know Tami Bryce. She\u0027s a nice little girl - or she used to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She still is,\" Meredith said. \"I told you, I went out with Jim a few times. She\u0027s a very nice girl, and not at all mature for her age. I don\u0027t think she would normally do anything inappropriate, unless...\" She stopped, looking into the middle distance, and then shrugged without finishing her sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie looked serious now. \"But we have to stop this,\" she said. \"What if she does that to some guy who\u0027s not nice and shy like Matt? She\u0027s going to get herself assaulted!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the whole problem,\" Matt said, turning red again. \"I mean, it\u0027s pretty difficult.... If she had been some other girl, that I was going on a date with - not that I go out with other girls on dates...\" he added hastily, glancing at Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But youshould be going out on dates,\" Elena said firmly. \"Matt, I don\u0027t want eternal fidelity from you - there\u0027s nothing I\u0027d like better than to see you dating a nice girl.\" As if by accident, her gaze wandered over to Bonnie, who was now trying to crunch celery very quietly and neatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan, you\u0027re the only one who can tell us what to do,\" Elena said, turning to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan was frowning. \"I don\u0027t know. With only two girls, it\u0027s pretty hard to draw any conclusions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027re going to wait and see what Caroline - or Tami - does next?\" Meredith asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just wait,\" Stefan said. \"We\u0027ve got to find out more about it. You guys can keep an eye on Caroline and Tamra Bryce, and I can do some research on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn!\" Elena said, hitting the ground with one fist. \"I can almost - \" She stopped suddenly and looked at her friends. Bonnie had dropped her celery, gasping, and Matt had choked on his Coke, going into a coughing fit. Even Meredith and Stefan were staring at her. \"What?\" she said blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith recovered first. \"It\u0027s just that yesterday you were - well, very young angels don\u0027t swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just because I died a couple of times, it means I have to say \u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;reg;darn\u0027 for the rest of my life?\" Elena shook her head. \"Not. I\u0027m me and I\u0027m going to stay me - whoever I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" said Stefan, leaning over to kiss the top of her head. Matt looked away and Elena gave Stefan an almost dismissive pat, but thinking,I love you forever , and knowing that he would pick it up even if she couldn\u0027t hear his thought in return. In fact she found shecould pick up his general response to it, a warm rose color seemed to hang around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this what Bonnie saw and called an aura? She realized that most of the day she\u0027d seen him with a light, cool, emerald sort of shadowing around him - if shadows could be light. And the green was returning now as the pink faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately she glanced over the rest of the picnickers. Bonnie was surrounded by a roselike color, shading to the palest of pinks. Meredith was a deep and profound violet. Matt was a strong clear blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt reminded her that up until yesterday - only yesterday? - she\u0027d seen so many things that no one else could see. Including something that had scared her silly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had itbeen ? She was getting flashes of images - little details that were scary enough by themselves. It could be as small as a fingernail or as large as an arm. Bark-like texture, at least on the body. Insect-like antennae, but far too many of them, and moving like whips, faster than any insect ever moved them. She had the general crawly feeling she got whenever she thought about insects. It was a bug, then. But a bug built on a different body plan than any insect she knew of. It was more like a leech in that respect, or a squid. It had a completely circular mouth, with sharp teeth all around, and far too many tentacles that looked like thick vines whipping around in back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could attach itself to a person, she thought. But she had a terrible feeling that it could do more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could turn transparent and pull itself inside you and you would feel no more than a pinprick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndthen what would happen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena turned to Bonnie. \"Do you think that if I show you what something looks like, you could recognize it again? Not with your eyes, but with your psychic senses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it depends on what the \u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;reg;something\u0027 is,\" Bonnie answered cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena glanced over at Stefan, who gave her briefest of nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then shut your eyes,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie did so, and Elena put her fingertips on Bonnie\u0027s temples, with her thumbs gently brushing Bonnie\u0027s eyelashes. Trying to activate her White Powers - something that had been so easy before today - was like striking two rocks together to make a fire and hoping one was flint. Finally she felt a small spark, and Bonnie jerked backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s eyes snapped open.\"What was that?\" she gasped. She was breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I saw - yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena said slowly, \"Inside Damon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what does it mean? Was he controlling it? Or...or...\" Bonnie stopped and her eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena finished the sentence for her. \"Was it controlling him? I don\u0027t know. But here\u0027s one thing I do know, almost for certain. When he ignored your Calling, Bonnie, he was being influenced by the malach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The question is,if not Damon , who was controlling it?\" Stefan said, standing up again restlessly. \"I picked that up, and the kind of creature Elena showed you - it\u0027s not something with a mind of its own. It needs an outside brain to control it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like another vampire?\" Meredith asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan shrugged. \"Vampires usually just ignore them, because vampires can get what they want without them. It would have to be a very strong mind to get a malach like that to possess a vampire. Strong - and evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those,\" Damon said with biting grammatical precision, from where he was sitting on a high limb of an oak, \"are they. My younger brother and his...associates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marvelous,\" murmured Shinichi. He had draped himself even more gracefully and languidly against the oak than Damon had. It had become an unspoken contest. Shinichi\u0027s golden eyes had flared once or twice - Damon had seen it - upon seeing Elena and at the mention of Tami.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t even try to tell me you\u0027re not involved with those rowdy girls,\" Damon added dryly. \"From Caroline to Tamra and onward, that\u0027s the idea, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi shook his head. His eyes were on Elena and he began to sing a folksong softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With cheeks like blooming roses\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd hair like golden wheat...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t try it onthose girls.\" Damon smiled without humor. His eyes were narrow. \"Granted, they look about as strong as wet tissue paper - but they\u0027re tougher than you\u0027d think, and they\u0027re toughest of all when one of them is in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, it\u0027s not me doing it,\" Shinichi said. He looked uneasy for the first time since Damon had seen him. Then he said, \"Although I might know the originator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do tell,\" Damon suggested, still narrow-eyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well - did I mention my younger twin? Her name is Misao.\" He smiled winningly. \"It means maiden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon felt an automatic stirring of appetite. He ignored it. He was too relaxed to think of hunting, and he wasn\u0027t at all sure thatkitsune - fox-spirits, which Shinichi claimed to be - could be hunted. \"No, you didn\u0027t mention her,\" Damon said, absently scratching at the back of his neck. That mosquito bite was gone, but it had left behind a furious itching. \"It must have somehow slipped your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she\u0027s here somewhere. She came when I did, when we saw the flare of Power that brought back...Elena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon felt sure that the hesitation before the mention of Elena\u0027s name was a fake. He tilted his head at thedon\u0027t think you\u0027re fooling me angle and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Misao likes to play games,\" Shinichi said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes? Like backgammon, chess, Go Fish, that sort of thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi coughed theatrically, but Damon caught the glint of red in his eye. My, he reallywas overprotective of her, wasn\u0027t he? Damon gave Shinichi one of his most incandescent smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love her,\" the young man with the black hair licked by fire said, and this time there was an open warning in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do,\" Damon said in soothing tones. \"I can see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, well, her games usually have the effect of destroying a town. Eventually. Not all at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon shrugged. \"This flyspeck of a village isn\u0027t going to be missed. Of course, I get my girls out alive first.\" Now it was his voice that held an open warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as you like.\" Shinichi was back to his normal, submissive self. \"We\u0027re allies, and we\u0027ll keep to our deal. Anyway, it would be a shame to waste...all that.\" His gaze drifted to Elena again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way, we won\u0027t even discuss the little fiasco with your malach and me - or hers, if you insist. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve vaporized at least three of them, but if I see another one, our business relationship is over. I make a bad enemy, Shinichi. You don\u0027t want to find out how bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi looked suitably impressed as he nodded. But the next moment he was gazing at Elena again, and singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...hair like golden wheat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall a-down her milk-white shoulders;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pretty pink, my sweet...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll want to meet this Misao of yours. For her protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I know she wants to meet you. She\u0027s caught up in her game at the moment, but I\u0027ll try to tear her away from it.\" Shinichi stretched luxuriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon looked at him for a moment. Then, absent-mindedly, he too stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi was watching him. He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon wondered about that smile. He had noticed that when Shinichi smiled, two little flames of crimson could be seen in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was really too tired to think about it right now. Simply too relaxed. In fact he suddenly felt very sleepy....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027re going to be looking for these malach things in girls like Tami?\" Bonnie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly like Tami,\" said Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think,\" Meredith said, watching Elena closely, \"that Tami got it somehow from Caroline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I know, I know - the question is: where did Caroline get it from? And that Idon\u0027t know. But, again, we don\u0027t know what happened to her when she was kidnapped by Klaus and Tyler Smallwood. We don\u0027t know anything about what she\u0027s been doing for the last week - except that it\u0027s clear she never really stopped hating us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt held his head in his hands. \"And then what are we going todo? I feel as if I\u0027m responsible somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - Jimmy\u0027s responsible, if anyone is. If he - you know, let Caroline spend the night - and then let her talk about it with his fifteen-year-old sister.... Well, it doesn\u0027t make himguilty , but he sure could have been a little more subtle,\" Stefan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s whereyou\u0027re wrong,\" Meredith told him. \"Matt and Bonnie and Elena and I have known Caroline forages andwe know what she\u0027s capable of . If anyone qualifies as their sister\u0027s keeper - it\u0027s us. And I think we\u0027re in serious delinquency of duty. I vote we stop by her house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I,\" Bonnie said sadly, \"but I\u0027m not looking forward to it. Besides, what if shedoesn\u0027t have one of those malach things in her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where the research comes in,\" Elena said. \"We need to find out who\u0027s behind it all. Someone strong enough to influence Damon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful,\" Meredith said, looking grim. \"And given the power of the ley lines, we only have every single person in Fell\u0027s Church to choose from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifty yards west and thirty feet straight up, Damon was struggling to keep awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi reached up to brush fine hair the color of night and flames licking upward off his forehead. Under his lowered lids he was watching Damon intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon meant to be watching him as intently, but he was simply too drowsy. Slowly, he imitated Shinichi\u0027s motion, brushing a very few strands of silky black hair off his own forehead. His lids drooped inadvertently, just a little more than before. Shinichi was still smiling at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we have our deal,\" he murmured. \"We get the town, Misao and I, and you don\u0027t stand in our way. We get the rights to the power of the ley lines. You get your girls safely out...and you get your revenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Against my sanctimonious brother and that...that Mutt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt.\" Shinichi had sharp ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. I just won\u0027t have Elena hurt, is all. Or the little red-headed witch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes, sweet Bonnie. I wouldn\u0027t mind one or two like her. One for Samhain and one for the Solstice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon snorted drowsily. \"There aren\u0027t two like her; I don\u0027t care where you look. I won\u0027t have her hurt either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about the tall, dark-haired beauty...Meredith?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon woke up.\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry; she\u0027s not coming to get you,\" Shinichi said soothingly. \"What do you wantdone with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Damon lounged back again in relief, easing his shoulders. \"Let her go her own way - as long as it\u0027s far away from mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi seemed to deliberately relax back against his branch. \"Your brother will be no problem. So it\u0027s really just that other boy down there,\" he murmured. He had a very insinuating murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But my brother - \" Damon was almost asleep now, in the exact position that Shinichi had taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, he\u0027ll be taken care of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mm. I mean, good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we have a deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mm-hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Damon didn\u0027t respond. He was dreaming. He dreamed that Shinichi\u0027s angelic golden eyes snapped open suddenly to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damon.\" He heard his name, but in his dream it was too much trouble to open his eyes. He could see without opening them, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dream, Shinichi leaned over him, hovering directly over his face, so that their auras mixed and they would have shared breath if Damon had been breathing. Shinichi stayed that way a long time, as if he were testing Damon\u0027s aura, but Damon knew that to an outsider he would appear to be out on all channels and frequencies. Still, in his dream Shinichi hung over him, as if he were trying to memorize the crescent of dark lashes on Damon\u0027s pale cheek or the subtle curve of Damon\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the dream-Shinichi put his hand under Damon\u0027s head and stroked the spot where the mosquito bite had itched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, growing up to be a fine big lad, aren\u0027t you?\" he said to something Damon couldn\u0027t see - to somethinginside him. \"You could almost take full control against his own strong will, couldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi sat for a moment, as if watching a cherry blossom fall, then shut his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" he whispered, \"that that\u0027s what we\u0027ll try, not too long from now. Soon. Very soon. But first, we have to gain his trust; get rid of his rival. Keep him blurred, angry, vain, off balance. Keep him thinking of Stefan, of his hatred for Stefan, who took his angel, whileI take care of what needs to be done here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he spoke directly to Damon. \"Allies, indeed!\" He laughed. \"Not while I can put my finger on your very soul. Here. Do you feel it? What I could make you do...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then again he seemed to address whatever creature was already inside Damon: \"But right now...a little feast to help you grow up much faster and get much stronger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dream, Shinichi made a gesture, and lay back, encouraging previously invisible malach to come up the trees. They slunk up and slid up the back of Damon\u0027s neck. And then, hideously, they slipped inside him, one by one, through some cut he hadn\u0027t known he had. The feeling of their soft, flabby, jellyfish-like bodies was almost unbearable...slipping inside of him....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi sang softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come a\u0027 tae me, ye fair pretty maidens\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaste ye lassies tae my bosom\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome tae me by sunlight or moonlight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the roses still are in blossom...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his dream, Damon was angry. Not because of the nonsense about malach inside him. That was ludicrous. He was angry because he knew that the dream-Shinichi was watching Elena as she began to pack up the remains of the picnic. He was watching every motion she made with an obsessive closeness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They blossom ever where you tread\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...Wild roses bloody red.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Extraordinary girl, your Elena,\" the dream-Shinichi added. \"If she lives, I think she\u0027ll be mine for a night or so.\" He stroked the remaining strands of hair off Damon\u0027s forehead gently. \"Extraordinary aura, don\u0027t you think? I\u0027ll make sure her death is beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Damon was in one of those dreams where you can neither move nor speak. He didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, dream-Shinichi\u0027s dream-pets continued to climb the trees and pour themselves, like Jell-O, inside him. One, two, three, a dozen, two dozen of them.More .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Damon could not wake, even though he sensed more malach coming from the Old Wood. They were neither dead, nor living, neither man nor maiden, mere capsules of Power that would allow Shinichi to control Damon\u0027s mind from far away. Endlessly, they came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi kept watching the flow, the bright sparkle of internal organs sparkling into Damon. After a while he sang again,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Days are precious, dinna lose them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlo\u0027ers will fade and so will ye...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome to me, ye fair young maidens\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile young and fair ye still may be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon dreamed that he heard the word \"forget\" as if whispered by a hundred voices. And even as he tried to remember what to forget, it dissolved and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe woke up alone in the tree, with an ache that filled his entire body. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-17.html","bookId":2035,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:14 PM"}
