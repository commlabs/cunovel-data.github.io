Translations into English of works of this kind are rare, and often so belated as to have lost much of their value by the time they are produced. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Modern developments in means of communication and intercourse are daily bringing us into closer touch with the Continent of Europe, and there can be no doubt that the rising generation of officers would do well to make themselves masters of the not over-difficult art of reading French and German, that they may be able to appreciate such works and keep themselves abreast of the times. They will find such knowledge of the greatest service, not only in the profession of arms, but in the course of everyday life.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My thanks are due to Major W.H. Greenly, D.S.O. 12th Lancers, for his kind and able assistance in correcting proofs.\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2783/77113.html","bookId":1309,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:48:36 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:48:36 AM"}
