This is what the writer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook how black the sky is, the writer said.

The writer was a blind guide who was slowly disappearing. I was now alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything I did had an intent that was solely mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stairs seemed steeper as I climbed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened Robby’s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe computer was off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(It was on when I had been interrupted.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I restarted it I sat in front of its screen for three hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment I typed in the password to open the MC file the computer screen flashed back to the desktop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen started blinking, its edges shallowing out, and then it burned green and was stubbled with static.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept trying to wade through the glitches. I kept telling myself that if I could read those files everything would become untroubled and weightless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unplugged the Gateway. I restarted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on hold with the company’s emergency hotline for an hour before I hung up, realizing there was nothing they would be able to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes were aching as I kept tapping keys with one hand while moving the mouse around in useless circles on its pad with the other, my face flushed with concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe computer was now a toy made from stone that just stared back at me. The computer was not going to lose this game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach keystroke took me further from where I wanted to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was receding from the information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the random flashing and static I could occasionally make out the hills of Sherman Oaks rising up out of the San Fernando Valley, or I glimpsed the shoreline of a hotel in Mexico, my father standing on a pier and he was lifting his hand, and the sound of the ocean was coming from the computer’s speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriefly there was a shadow of the Bank of America on Ventura Boulevard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother familiar apparition: Clayton’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the computer was dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the sound faded out completely there was the faint and muffled verse from “The Sunny Side of the Street.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the computer whirred itself into silence and died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only answers were going to come from Robby, I told myself as I pushed away from the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer immediately materialized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer asked in his thin voice: Do you really believe that, Bret? Do you really believe your son will supply the answers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I responded affirmatively, the writer said: That is sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Marta I would be picking Robby up from Buckley. I didn’t let her say anything. I just walked out of her office as I announced this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear her reluctantly agreeing as I moved down the hall to the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the wind kept altering its direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the interstate I saw my father standing motionless on the walkway of an overpass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I unrolled the window and flashed my driver’s license to a security guard, I pulled into a line of cars waiting in the parking lot in front of the library. The spires of gnarled pines rose up around us, encircling the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the scar in the palm of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was either going to be an ending\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(endings were always so easy for you)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor something would get healed, and the healing would forestall a tragedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer, in his own way, vehemently disagreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrivileged children mumbled warnings to one another as they headed toward the fleet of SUVs waiting for them. Security cameras followed the boys. Sons would always be in peril. Fathers would always be condemned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby’s backpack was flung over his shoulder and his shirt was untucked and the gray and red striped tie loosened, hanging slackly from around his neck: the parody of a tired businessman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby was staring at the Porsche and at the man in the driver’s seat. Robby looked at the man questioningly, as if I were someone who had never known his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy questions were going to merge with his answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel his doubt as he stood rigidly in front of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was begging him to move forward. You have to surrender, I was begging. You have to give me another chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer was about to hiss something, and I silenced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as if he had heard me, Robby shuffled toward the car, forcing a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his backpack off before opening the passenger door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up?” He was grinning as he placed the backpack on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he sat down he closed the passenger door. “Where’s Marta?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-97.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
