{"id":20208,"no":10,"title":"The Charge of the Light Brigade","content":"Forward the Light!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Such was the order given during a great battle to the leader of a band of six hundred British soldiers. Forward! And there in front was a line of cannon ready to shoot them down as they came, while on the hills on either side of the valley were the guns and riflemen of the Russians.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Surely someone has blundered! My men are sent to certain death,\" thought the leader of the Light Brigade.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Forward!

The smoke of the enemy\u0027s fire closed round and hid them from their watching comrades, but now and again the scarlet lines could be seen cutting down those who tried to stop their charge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Flashed all their sabres bare,\n\u003cbr\u003e Flashed as they turned in air,\n\u003cbr\u003e Sabring the gunners there,\n\u003cbr\u003e Charging an army, while\n\u003cbr\u003e All the world wonder\u0027d.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then only, when the strange order had been obeyed, when their duty had been nobly done in the face of death, did the Light Brigade—all that was left of it—turn to ride back. Alas! there were not then six hundred. Barely two hundred brave men, wounded, and blackened by smoke and powder, reached the British camp. The rest of the noble band lay dead or dying in the valley of Death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When can their glory fade?\n\u003cbr\u003e O the wild charge they made!\n\u003cbr\u003e All the world wonder\u0027d.\n\u003cbr\u003e Honour the charge they made!\n\u003cbr\u003e Honour the Light Brigade,\n\u003cbr\u003e Noble six hundred!\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2154/60889.html","bookId":596,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:35:23 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:35:23 AM"}
