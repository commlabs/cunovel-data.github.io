Her head fell back, eyelids sliding to half mast. Watching her eyes go smoky proved headier than merlot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" he demanded. \"Talk to me. Do you want more of this—\" he brought them closer, increasing the frustrating incredible friction \"—or this?\" His hands returned to her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both, as long as you\u0027re looking at me. Most of all I melt over the way you look at me. The way your eyes turn a different shade of green when you\u0027re seeing me, just me. I didn\u0027t notice it at first. I just thought,\" she babbled in a litany of near indiscernible encouragement, \"that...they were always this color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I started watching you too and I realized they were different for the rest of the world, more kelly-green.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about when I\u0027m looking at you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re darker, emerald. Hot.\" She leaned to kiss him, her molten brown eyes staying open. \"Warming me all over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep talking,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember,\" she purred against his mouth, phrases and kisses alternating, \"the first time you kissed me.\" \"Oh, yeah?\" \"The day our rotation in Cantou officially ended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we weren\u0027t working together directly anymore.\" His initial pursuit of her in the bar had been stalled once they were paired together for war missions. But he\u0027d known it was only a matter of time until their rotation ended. Then he would make his move, because every day he spent with her made him more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edetermined that she would be his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were heading back to England and I was returning to North Carolina.\" Her hands traveled over his shoulders into his hair while she talked, kissed, rocked, a master at multitasking and driving him crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You met me at my plane and right there in front of God and the whole squadron you asked...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to go get a drink sometime?\" he said, repeating his words from more than a year ago, the past and present merging in a mating dance even more important now with the stakes all or nothing in this their last chance. \"Preferably just the two of us this time. Although, if you want to ask the whole damned squadron along for drinks, too, I can deal with that, because when you walk in a room it\u0027s not like I even see anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stilled, her eyes wide, her heart hammering against him. \"You remember.\" \"I remember. And you answered...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a date. I\u0027ll meet you in the Azores.\" Islands halfway across the Atlantic, the midway point between them at that time, and somehow those thousands of miles seemed easier to cross than the emotional distance between them lately. \"I didn\u0027t think there was a chance it could work. But then you kissed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked her tousled hair from her face. \"Right there in front of God and the whole squadron.\" \"And then I knew it had to work.\" Her words sent his heart hammering as hard as hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to touch her, more of her, all of her. His hand skimmed down, parting her, stroking lightly. He couldn\u0027t think about much of anything except the scent of her damp, satiny heat against him, her moans and sighs and yes, more pleadings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA passionate flush spread along her skin, an unmistakable sign of how close she was to completion. A good thing since he was about to lose it and he hadn\u0027t even been inside her yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter not think about being inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with the need to finish thundering through him, he kept himself in check, in the moment, so damned grateful for the chance to touch her again he vowed not to squander even a second. Anything with Alicia was better than everything with anyone else. And this was more than just anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to scrounge words to keep her talking to distract her from thinking too much. Words were tough to find. Maybe he should have spent more time distracting her out of bed, too, so she wouldn\u0027t have pushed him out of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was anything but pushing away now. The flush along her body darkened and he stroked her higher and higher until...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer whole body tensed, bowed, the velvet heat clamping and massaging her release along his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheer honesty of it all threatened to hurtle him over the edge with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this moment, at least, she was completely his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe afterglow swallowed Alicia completely. She sagged against Josh, grateful he still had the ability to hold her up because her sated, mellow muscles weren\u0027t working all that well at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she be so glad and scared at once? And why did she have to think? She wanted to enjoy her hot, na*ed husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia traced bunched muscles along his back. \"I can feel you smiling against my neck.\" \"Is that a bad thing?\" His steamy breath caressed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA much-needed laugh broke free. \"Not really, I guess. I\u0027ll give you thirty more seconds for your macho-male testosterone victory dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his head and chuckled into her mouth with his kiss. \"I\u0027m just happy for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m happy for me, too. And we\u0027re about to be really happy for you as well.\" \"Oh, we are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laugh and smile untwined fears and tension working to coil inside her again. Light and simple was good. Before, sex with them had been so intense. She enjoyed his sense of humor and yet they\u0027d never brought it into the bedroom with them, an odd oversight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d told her to let him know what she needed. Well, she needed fun. Light. Uncomplicated. And him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his back. Most of all, she wanted to give to him as much as he\u0027d given her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia shoved him backward onto the sleeping bags, walking playful fingers down his chest. His eyes widened in surprise and, my, how she enjoyed surprising this man. She understood great sex couldn\u0027t sustain a marriage, but she wanted to tell herself if they could fix this, somehow that could fix everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took him in her hand, took him inside her, and yes, this process was every bit as wonderful as she remembered. More so since she could simply glide in the moment as she glided against him. No thoughts of the past or future or worries about what he would expect from her, just the present and them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to me,\" she commanded in impish retaliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk?\" he growled through clenched teeth. \"In a few more minutes I\u0027ll recite the whole preamble to the Constitution for you, but at the moment you\u0027ve pretty much shut down my brain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sleepy seduction of his definitely dark green eyes sent a shower of heat tingling over her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension knotted inside her again, surprising her, because wait, hadn\u0027t she already...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she couldn\u0027t think anymore. Her head fell back, her eyes tight as she focused on the firm grip of his hands on her hips, the synching of their rapid breaths. Increasing need climbed along with the rising passion. Together. This was more than just a process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what to call it, just wanted to devour the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open your eyes,\" he demanded. \"See me see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyelids heavy, she forced herself to look down, and was it ever worth the effort. Deep green stared back up at her, only her, until tension pulled tighter within her. His hands trekked up to cup her breasts, to her shoulders, up farther until his fingers threaded into her hair. He massaged a firm caress that brought back the sensual unraveling of the hair wash earlier, water and Josh pouring over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burning tingle along her skin increased. Her gasps paced with Josh\u0027s, matched rhythm, just like in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplane, until a shout rolled deep inside her, out to mingle with Josh\u0027s hoarse groan of completion. Echoes cycled around them like a spiraling aircraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia collapsed forward onto Josh\u0027s chest, his arms already around her. Aftershocks rocked through her, physical and emotional. And as much as she wanted to bask in the moment, fear flickered. For a woman accustomed to taking charge of her life, the thought of giving her heart fully left her shaking all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil this moment, it hadn\u0027t occurred to her how little experience she had in equal give-and-take relationships of any kind. Her mother had died so early, leaving Alicia to step into more of a parental role with her siblings. And of course her dating history pretty much sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she felt for Josh went far beyond anything she\u0027d felt for Ben. She knew she could trust this incredibly funny, stubborn, honorable man beneath her. She just wasn\u0027t certain she could trust herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with her heart lying there at his feet, she realized more than being hurt, she feared hurting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours later, Josh buried his face in Alicia\u0027s neck while angling on his elbows to keep his weight off her. After round three of loving Alicia, he willed his slugging heart to slow to a halfway normal pace. He wasn\u0027t smiling against the soft curve of her shoulder now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, he could feel her retreating from him. Making love to her each time with no holds barred had been every bit as incredible as he\u0027d expected. Just the thought of her unraveling in his arms had him throbbing to life inside her. But their pocket of time here was ticking to an end. They would have to dress soon and evaluate what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his face against the sweet scent of her skin toward the hazy glow rippling across the Plexiglas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorthern lights streaking across the night sky cast banners of purple and pink through the dark in their own holiday light display. Sunrise wasn\u0027t far off. \"Merry Christmas Eve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed his shoulder. \"I\u0027m sorry you had to spend Hanukkah alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want to think about their last fight or the breakup. They\u0027d had every reason to be happy, finally living in the same city, and still they\u0027d screwed up. \"We could always float the date, like you used to do as a kid so your whole family could celebrate together. We could make this the holiday season for both of us. We\u0027ve had your star to follow by. And it seems my Bic lighter has an endless supply of fuel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how I love quirky and mismatched, so it definitely works for me. Hey, maybe we should create a pamphlet for military folks since they spend the holidays in so many odd places. Something like a thousand and one ways to celebrate the holidays in a tent—or Quonset hut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded absently, humor tougher to scrounge than normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tapped his forehead. \"What are you thinking? I\u0027m not a mind reader, either, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonesty. He\u0027d demanded it of her and she deserved the same from him. He rolled off her onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m wondering what we\u0027ll do when we return to base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they would make it home, damn it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up, sleeping bag clasped to her chest. \"I don\u0027t know how we went so wrong. You\u0027re the answer man. I only know that no one can touch me, frustrate me, hurt me...move me as much as you. I suspect that much, at least, is mutual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked the backs of his fingers along her jaw. \"That sums it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re so different. You with your logic, me with my quirky ways and mismatched clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed reason and plans in his life. She was all about the unexpected, flying by gut and instinct while he plotted the odds and targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh sat up beside her, dropped a quick kiss on her mouth before standing. \"We should get dressed. The storm\u0027s easing and we\u0027ll need to start moving again. My guess is that this Quonset is near the river. We shouldn\u0027t have far to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back into his boxers and unhooked his flight suit from the clothesline. His snow pants and parka swayed like ghostly apparitions, reminding him of those chem-gear suits hanging in the cave. More than their own lives depended on them returning to base in one piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning back against the wall, he rolled on his socks. Sounds of Alicia dressing tormented the hell out of him. He could wade through quantum physics without hesitation, but he didn\u0027t have a clue how to ease the awkwardness between them. Whatever happened to reveling in the afterglow of great sex?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncredible sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia padded to a stop beside him, her reindeer toe socks making a perfect Alicia-contrast to the military precision of her flight suit. \"We should have dated longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cross-Atlantic relationship had frustrated the hell out of both of them while they spiked long distance bills to rival the national debt. Sure they had leave time, but scheduling it to coincide was nearly impossible. Getting married was the only way to guarantee a joint assignment. And even that had taken six months to shake down before they\u0027d both made it to Alaska—two people so much in love, married and virtual strangers even after eighteen months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdd the stress of a move and high-pressure military jobs and was it any wonder they\u0027d crashed and burned on the relationship front? So logical he should have seen it coming, but he hadn\u0027t stopped hoping for a different outcome all the way to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tugged the zipper up on her flight suit until his knuckles rested against her delicate collarbone. The buzz in his head predicted failure if he didn\u0027t get his act together. \"Yes, we should have. But we didn\u0027t have that luxury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached to clasp his hand in hers. \"Have we already done too much damage to our relationship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo our love? The rest of her sentence stayed unspoken but was clear as the spirals of light playing through the window. The echo of her softly spoken words rattled around inside his head along with the buzz in his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drone increased. Built. Until he realized it wasn\u0027t in his head at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vehicle was approaching the Quonset hut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh yanked Alicia by the arm, jerking her away from the small window inset in the door. He shut down emotions until his brain focused only on processing information. \"Someone\u0027s out there. Snowmobiles, I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink. Sounds like two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scooped her mukluks as he dragged her toward the woodstove. \"Let\u0027s hope it\u0027s a rescue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, he hoped. His gut told him otherwise. He jammed his feet into his boots. \"We\u0027ll know soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilitary rescue forces would call out first. Of course someone from the mining operation might try calling out with a bluff, but he was damned good at detecting bluffs. Either way, he wouldn\u0027t let the past replay again into some kind of twisted holiday massacre, most definitely not with Alicia playing any part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere to go? He considered standing to the side of the door and simply ambushing whoever came through. Answers could come afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started a step in that direction—then stopped. Frowning, he studied their tin-can shelter. Serious intruders would shoot first, enter later, and the thin metal of the rusting Quonset hut would barely slow a bullet, much less stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Between the stacks of wood, lie flat,\" he ordered. Not much of a hiding place, but it would provide protection with the stove beside them as well. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/soldier-s-christmas-wingmen-warriors-8/page-11.html","bookId":2640,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:46 PM"}
