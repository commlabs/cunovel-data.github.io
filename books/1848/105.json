I loved him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He loved you, too.\" Brenna said feelingly, and Jenny felt slightly better until Brenna added, \"Unlike Father, he loved you more than he despised our \u0027enemy.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny closed her eyes. \"Please,\" she whispered to them both. \"Do not do this to me. I—I know what is right…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was spared the need to say more, however, by the sudden blast of clarions as the trumpeters rode onto the field, followed by the heralds, who waited until there was a semblance of quiet and then began proclaiming the rules:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tournament was to be preceded by three jousting matches, the herald cried out, the three matches to be between the six knights judged to be the finest in the land. Jenny held her breath, then slowly expelled it: the first two combatants were a French knight and a Scotsman; the second match was Royce\u0027s against a Frenchman named DuMont; and the third was Royce\u0027s against Ian MacPherson—the son of Jenny\u0027s former \"betrothed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd went wild; instead of having to wait all day and perhaps two to see the Wolf, they were going to see him twice in the first hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rules at first seemed perfectly ordinary: the first knight to accumulate three points won the match; one point was given a knight each time he struck his opponent hard enough to splinter his spear. Jenny assumed it would take at least five passes for any knight to accumulate three points, considering that it was no mean feat to successfully level a lance, take aim atop a galloping horse, and strike an opponent at precisely the right spot to shiver a lance—particularly since the smooth surface of the armor was designed to make the lance skid off. Three points, and the match, were automatically awarded to a knight if he actually unhorsed his opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next two announcements made the crowd roar with approval and Jenny cringe: the jousts were to be fought in the German style, not French—which meant the massive regular lances would be used, rather than poplar ones—and the deadly spear heads would not be blunted with protective coronals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bellows of enthusiasm from the crowd were so loud there was a long delay before the herald could finish by announcing that the tournament would follow the trio of jousts and that the remaining jousts would take place throughout the next two days. However, he added, due to the illustriousness of the knights attending, the jousts that followed the tournment would be organized according to the importance of the knight if such could be determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the crowd roared with enthusiasm. Instead of having to watch obscure knights joust with even lesser ones, they\u0027d have their greatest pleasure served first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the ring, the constables had finished checking saddle fastenings to make certain no knight intended to use leather straps, rather than good horsemanship and brute strength, to stay on his mount. Satisfied, the chief constable gave the signal, the heralds trotted off the field, and then kettle drums, pipes, and trumpets began to blast, announcing the ceremonial parade onto the field by all the knights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Jenny was not proof against the dazzling spectacle that followed: six across, the knights paraded onto the tourney field wearing full armor, mounted on prancing warhorses decked out in dazzling silver bridles and bells, colorful headdresses, and trappings of brilliant silks and velvets, that displayed the coat of arms of the knight. Polished armor glinted in the sun so brightly that Jenny found herself squinting as before her eyes paraded tabards and shields emblazoned with coats of arms showing every imaginable animal from noble beasts like lions, tigers, falcons, tiercels, and bears to whimsical dragons and unicorns; others bore designs of stripes and squares, half moons and stars; still others bore flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blindingly bright hues of color combined with the ceaseless roar of the crowd so delighted Aunt Elinor that she clapped her hands for an English knight who rode by with a particularly stunning coat of arms bearing three lions rampant, two roses, a falcon, and a green crescent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt any other time, Jenny would have thought this the most exciting spectacle she\u0027d ever beheld. Her father and stepbrother rode past along with what she judged to be about four hundred knights. Her husband, however, did not appear, and the first pair of jousters ended up riding onto the field to the disappointed roar of \"Wolf! Wolf!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore confronting each other, each of the two knights trotted over to the gallery where his wife or his lady love was seated. Tipping down their lances, they awaited the ceremonial bestowal of a favor—her scarf, ribbon, veil, or even a sleeve, which she proudly tied on the end of the lance. That accomplished, they rode over to opposite ends of the field, adjusted their helmets, checked visors, tested weights of lances, and finally awaited the blast from the trumpet. At the first note, they dug spurs into their mounts and sent them hurtling forward. The Frenchman\u0027s spear struck his opponent\u0027s shield slightly off center, the Scotsman swayed in his saddle and recovered. It took five more passes before the Frenchman finally took a blow that sent him crashing to the ground amidst a pile of shining steel legs and arms and the accompaniment of deafening cheers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny scarcely noticed the outcome, even though the fallen knight was practically at her feet. Staring at her clutched hands in her lap, she waited, listening for the call of the trumpets again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it came, the crowd went wild, and despite willing herself not to look, she lifted her head. Prancing onto the field, his horse draped in gorgeous red trappings, was the Frenchman she had particularly noticed during the parade, partially because he was physically huge and also because the couteres that protected his elbows were enormous, pleated pieces of plate that fanned out into points that reminded Jenny of bat wings. Now she also noticed that although he wore a handsome baronial necklace at his throat, there was nothing \"whimsical\" or beautiful about the gruesome figure of a striking serpent emblazoned on his breastplate. He turned his horse toward one of the galleries for the usual bestowal of a favor, and as he did so, all the noise of the crowd began to die away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor of dread made Jenny quickly divert her gaze, but even without looking, Jenny knew when Royce finally rode onto the field—because the crowd suddenly became eerily still. So still that the periodic blasts of the trumpeters tolled out into the awed silence like a death knell. Unable to help herself, she lifted her head and turned; what she saw made her heart stop: in contrast to the gaiety and color and flamboyance everywhere, her husband was garbed entirely in black. His black horse was draped in black, its headpiece was black, and on Royce\u0027s shield he did not display his coat of arms. Instead there was a head of a snarling black wolf. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-105.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM"}
