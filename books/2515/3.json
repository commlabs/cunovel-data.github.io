I know her address, her bank account number, even her supposed birthdate. She is supposed to have lived in a house not far from where I lived when I gave birth to Kalika. I am very curious as I drive to her house after flying into LAX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place is modest, nondescript even, stucco walls with a wooden fence surrounding an uninspired yard of grass and a few bushes. Slowly I walk toward the front door. There is someone inside watching TV and drinking what smells like beer. The sounds and odors drift out through a torn screen door. I knock lightly and brace myself for instant death. Yet I have a matrix in my pocket, and I have finally figured out how to operate the ray gun. It is a totally cool weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bearded fellow in a frayed T-shirt answers the door. He looks as if he\u0027s on his second six-pack. Twenty-five, at most, his gut hangs over his belt like a sausage off the side of a breakfast plate. But I warn myself that Heidi--Linda--appeared to be very ordi?nary until her psychic force field went up. This guy might be more than he appears, but it\u0027s hard to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" I say. \"Is Linda home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe burps. \"She\u0027s out of town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least he doesn\u0027t know she\u0027s missing her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Alisa,\" I say. \"I\u0027m an old friend. Do you know when she\u0027ll be back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK.\" I catch his eye through the screen door and squeeze his neuron currents. \"Would it be OK if I come in and search through her personal things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brain is soft mud, easy to impress--I think. \"Sure,\" he says, and opens the door for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave him in the living room, watching a baseball game. But my ears never leave him. If he tries to sneak up on me, he\u0027ll fail. But I won\u0027t kill him, if he shows strange powers, not right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda\u0027s room is neat and tidy. She seemed to enjoy sewing and the Dodgers. And if I begin to think I have the wrong house, there are pictures of her and Brother Bud on the mirror on top of the chest of drawers, cheap Polaroids shot with a camera with a dusty lens. Heidi is Linda and I am in the right bedroom. In each of the pictures Linda smiles as if someone just told her to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI search the drawers and find nothing important. Even the closet is boring--clothes and baseball caps, shoes and socks. And this is the creature who said we all have powers? Talk about a double life. I am on the verge of leaving when a stack of papers under the bed catches my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are all about UFOs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, newsletters from a UFO foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOF--Flying Objects Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened to the unidentified? I don\u0027t care. All the newsletters are addressed to Linda Clairee. She was definitely a member of this group, and it is the only wrinkle in her ordinary life that I have found. Holding the papers in my hand, I return to the living room and Bud. He is, in fact, finishing a can of Budweiser as I walk in. I turn off the TV without asking his permission and sit down across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he says, annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch his eye and burn a tiny hole in his frontal lobes. It will probably do him good, in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did Linda say she was going?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe replies in a flat voice, staring straight ahead. \"Phoenix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s in Phoenix?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A convention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A UFO convention?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.

He doesn\u0027t even realize I interrupted it. \"Goodbye,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a plane leaving for Phoenix in fifty minutes and I get on it. Linda\u0027s newsletters have told me where the FOF convention is being held--a Holiday Inn beside a busy freeway. Once in Phoenix, I rent a Jeep and drive to the hotel, but all the rooms are taken. Taking a room at a nearby hotel, I shower and then go for a walk in the desert. Perhaps the UFO freaks took a hotel near the edge of town so they could look at the night sky. It is late--I study the stars as I walk, but nothing flies down from the sky to whisk me away. Yet I feel no pleasure beneath the heavens. A past I cannot remember haunts me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are of an ancient tradition. Our line is mingled with yours, and with that of others. We hold all powers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Linda wanted more of my blood, if she had any of it to begin with. Yet she must have had something unique. She was fast and strong, more powerful than virtually any vampire Yaksha made. Plus she had technology that put the government\u0027s most secret toys to shame. But so many of her answers had made no sense. What did she want to initiate me into?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But to join us you must sacrifice him. It is part of your initiation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost as if she wanted to introduce me to the black mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know about such things, sexual magic, from the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe torture and the blood, the sudden awakenings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I have not thought of them in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find a sandy bluff and sit atop it to mentally survey my life, trying to find a point where my blood could have been taken without my knowledge. But except for Arturo and his alchemy, I think, my blood has always been mine to do with as I chose. Yet a faint feeling of dread sweeps over me as I look back. My shadow is long and dark. In it could lie secrets, hidden from even me, where blood was exchanged and vows were pledged that my conscious memory never re?corded. It is as if I sense a blank spot, a place of reality that wasn\u0027t real after all. But I only sense its existence--I don\u0027t see it. I have to wonder if my imagination leads me to a wall of illusion. My thoughts are never far from those I left behind in Tahoe: John, Seymour, Paula. But Paula swears they are safe there, for now, and she should know. She who has deep visions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shooting star crosses the sky and I make a wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Krishna,\" I whisper, \"don\u0027t let me die until I have set right what I made wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzama\u0027s words are with me. God\u0027s plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow I know it was me who messed it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that\u0027s what she had been trying to tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was why she sent me away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/creatures-of-forever-the-last-vampire-6/page-3.html","bookId":2515,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:19:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:19:09 PM"}
