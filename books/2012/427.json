Torn fragments of meat falling from her jaws, Korabas fixed her gaze upon that beckoning horizon. Her allies had drawn away her assailants, won her a reprieve with fatal sacrifice. She did not understand, but she would honour them in the only possible manner available to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this be a destiny offered me, I shall meet it. I shall face it, and, if I can, I shall speak to the world .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if this be the place of my death, so be it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was free, even if only for a moment .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was free .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had pushed them hard, marching them through half the night and without pause through most of this day, and the marines and heavies were staggering as they came within sight of the hill. The muscles of his legs leaden, Fiddler angled towards it. Vast bands of shadow were still tracking the landscape, cast down by the Jade Strangers spanning the entire sky, leaving the captain with a sense that the world was unravelling before his very eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had worked hard not to think about the army they had left behind, and the fate that awaited them. Before the captain now was all that mattered. That forlorn hilltop with its fractured flanks, the lone sword of Otataral thrust deep into the ground at its very centre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe feared that it would not be enough – they had all feared as much, those among them who understood what she was attempting here. The chains that bound the Crippled God had been forged by gods. A single sword to shatter them all? Tavore, you must have believed it was possible. Or that some other force would awaken here, to lend us a blessed hand in this .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout this – this breaking of chains – all that we do here is for naught .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavore, I am trusting you. With the lives of my soldiers – with the meaning to their deaths. I know, it’s unfair, asking this of you. You’re mortal, that and nothing more. But I know – I feel it – I am setting my weight upon your shoulders. We all are, whether we care to admit it or not .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it’s that unfairness that’s tearing me apart .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced off to his left. Hedge walked there at the head of his own troop – Letherii and Khundryl cast-offs, a mix of half-bloods from a dozen subdued tribes of the Lether Empire. They’d had trouble keeping up, so loaded down were the soldiers – Hood knew why they’d felt the need to carry so much. All those kittens, I expect. Hope they’re worth it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge had been keeping his distance, and Fiddler knew why – he could feel his own face transforming whenever his friend drew near, becoming a mask, bleak and broken, and the anguish and dread clawed at him with a strength he could not match. So much of this is unfair. So much . But now Hedge shifted his track, came closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed at the hill. ‘That’s it? Damned ugly, Fid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We can defend it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re too thin, even for a knoll as puny as that one. Listen, I’m breaking up my company. I ain’t making too many big promises here, but my Bridgeburners got a secret—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kittens, aye.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge scowled at him. ‘You had spies! I knew it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gods below, Hedge, never met anyone as hopeless with secrets as you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go ahead and think that. You’re in for a surprise, I promise you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can they match the Moranth munitions, that’s the only thing I need to know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hedge shook his head. ‘Not them. Never mind.’ And then he shrugged, as if dismissing something. ‘You was probably too busy last time, but we made a mess of those Short-Tails.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you didn’t use most of them up? That’s not like you, Hedge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Bavedict concocted more – the man’s a genius. Deranged and obsessive, the best kind of genius. Anyway, we’re packing them all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’d noticed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sure, it’s wore us out, all that stuff. Tell me, Fid, we going to get time to rest up first?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Little late asking me that now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So what? I’m still asking you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To be honest, I don’t know. Depends.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘On what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Whether the Spire’s fallen to us. Whether they got the heart undamaged. Whether they managed to break its own set of chains, or whatever geas is protecting it – could be twenty Kenyll’rah demons for all we know, and imagine the scrap that’d be.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Twenty Kenyll’rah demons? What is this, some bad fairy tale? Why not a demon king? Or a giant three-headed ogre with scorpion tails at the end of every finger, and a big one on his cock for added measure? Breathing fire outa his arse, too.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-427.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
