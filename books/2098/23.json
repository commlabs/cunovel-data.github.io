She sensed the ramshackle house far out in the distance, hidden within the blackened night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called out, Scarlett!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlett didn\u0027t come to Cassie in this dream - Cassie went to her. She forced her way through the pitch-black night as if blind and mad, holl ering Scarlett\u0027s name. It was like traveling through outer space in a starless universe, but with persistence Cassie hit upon what she was searching for. The house. And through the rickety door of the house, Cassie discovered Scarlett. She was bound at the wrists and ankles to a splintered wooden post, and she was screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were whipping her. Whoever they were. Cassie tried to make out the hunters\u0027 faces, but she couldn\u0027t. They didn\u0027t have faces; they were formless black entities like ghosts. She could only sense their trembling dark souls and how they were frightened to the point of brutality. It was their fear driving them, fear of the unknown, of the supernatural, of witchcraft. Like Holy War soldiers, their faith in their own righteousness was unbreakable, and their capacity for violence against their enemies was extreme. They whipped Scarlett mercilessly over and over again, unaffected by her screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie wondered why the hunters didn\u0027t tape Scarlett\u0027s mouth shut, to quiet her. And then the thought occurred to her like a light being switched on. The hunters wanted Scarlett to talk, to spil information - not only the secrets of her magic, Cassie realized, but the secrets of the Circle, who they were and where to find them. Scarlett cried and shrieked and spit at the shapeless hunters, but no words escaped her bruised mouth. Was she bearing all this pain to protect the Circle? And to protect Cassie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer beaten body hung from the wooden post limp and wilted like a dying flower. Her face was a mess of blood and dirt, and one of her eyes had swelled completely shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer damp red hair dripped like blood down her bony shoulders. She\u0027d been stripped almost nude; her torso and legs were streaked with lash marks and purple welts. How much longer could she possibly take such abuse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike in the last dream she\u0027d had, Cassie couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer feet were frozen in place at the doorway - from where she could see Scarlett but wasn\u0027t sure if Scarlett could see her. She called out to her from where she stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlett, I know where you are, she said. And I\u0027ll be there soon. I promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, she jolted awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sister, Cassie thought, my poor, dear sister. She\u0027d rather Scarlett give the hunters what they wanted, to tell them the entire truth about the Circle, if it meant they\u0027d release her alive. Better that than seeing her die to protect them. Scarlett had come to New Salem to seek out the them. Scarlett had come to New Salem to seek out the safety of the Circle, not the other way around. How had the situation come to this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Scarlett was still alive, that much Cassie was sure of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as long as she was still alive, there was still time to rescue her. Maybe if the Circle understood that Scarlett was being tortured for protecting them, they\u0027d consider rescuing her a little more seriously. Maybe they\u0027d finally accept her as one of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was a piercingly loud sound in Cassie\u0027s ear. She looked over at her nightstand and realized her phone was ringing, but who could be calling at this time of night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"hello?\" Cassie answered cautiously, half-believing it was going to be one of the ancient witch hunters from her dream on the other end of the line. But the scratchy voice that apologized for waking her belonged to Deborah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happened?\" Cassie knew if Deborah was calling her in the middle of the night that someone was either hurt or dead, possibly both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone set Laurel\u0027s lawn on fire,\" Deborah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burning in the shape of the hunter symbol.\" If Cassie hadn\u0027t just woken from a nightmare, she would have sworn she\u0027d just entered one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laurel\u0027s been marked,\" Deborah added, in case Cassie didn\u0027t comprehend the full magnitude of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie suddenly felt like she was suffocating, like one of the hunters from her nightmare had grabbed hold of her neck and was squeezing the breath out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie?\" Deborah said. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie coughed. Laurel. Of all people to be marked, they\u0027d gotten to sweet, peace-loving Laurel. How could this be happening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just shocked,\" Cassie said. \"Go on.\" Deborah resumed speaking in her gravelly whisper. \"So we\u0027re going to have a Circle meeting early tomorrow before school. To figure out what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Cassie said. \"I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re meeting at Diana\u0027s. At six thirty A.M.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Cassie felt shaky and weird. Her voice didn\u0027t come out sounding like her own. Those invisible hands were still squeezing her throat closed, making it hard for her to breathe. \"Is Laurel all right?\" she managed to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the phone clicked. Deborah had already hung up. It struck Cassie as strange that of all the Circle members who could have called her with this news, it was Deborah who did it. Not Adam or Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareful not to wake her mother, Cassie got out of bed, slipped on her sneakers, and wrapped her jacket around her shoulders. Then she unlatched the front door and slinked out to the edge of their property. From high up on the bluff she had a long view of the whole block, every old house on crooked Crowhaven Road - the ones in good repair as well as the ones that looked as if they might tip over into splintering timbers in a strong wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie strained her eyes to see far out. First, she saw that the fire had been extinguished, but she could still smell the remnants of smoke and burnt grass in the air. And then she noticed two bodies moving around in the dark, along she noticed two bodies moving around in the dark, along the outskirts of the lawn. It was difficult to make out who it was through the lingering smoke. Cassie squinted her eyes, but it was no use. She considered taking the walk down. It had to be someone in the Circle. But then the bodies began moving closer, and Cassie recognized who it was. It was Adam and Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s long blonde hair shined beneath the streetlights as she walked, closely and carefully with Adam, toward her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie felt a pang of resentment. They were both up and out, together. And neither of them took the time to call Cassie themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had she drifted so far from the two most important people in her life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie turned around and went home with an emptiness in her stomach. She tiptoed across the living room floor, back to her bedroom, and gently closed the door. Then she kicked off her shoes and climbed into bed, sorry she\u0027d ever left it in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could guess what they were doing. They were planning, strategizing, and plotting the meeting that would happen in a few hours. That was just who they were and how they would always be. The brave knight and the high priestess, ever vigilant. They were the real influence behind the group, no matter who was called leader or who wore the Tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam may have been Cassie\u0027s soul mate, but there would always be the Circle. And the Circle, if represented by one person, would be Diana. Not for one second did Cassie suspect that Adam was cheating on her with Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t have to. What he shared with Diana was something above and beyond cheating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie stared up at her ceiling, sleepless. Let them strategize. Cassie was done waiting on the sidelines. She would go to rescue Scarlett herself and destroy the hunters before they marked anyone else - and before they had the opportunity to kill Laurel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cassie knew she\u0027d need two things if she was going to fight the hunters by herself: the diadem and garter from Diana and Faye. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-divide-the-secret-circle-4/page-23.html","bookId":2098,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM"}
