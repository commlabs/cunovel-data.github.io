I don’t know what I expected him to have but I was fantasizing that maybe it was his resignation letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s running fine now. You should be able to drive it home tomorrow.\" He makes his way to his couch and sits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You fixed it?\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I didn\u0027t fix it. I know a guy who was able to put an alternator on it this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis comparison in the parking lot comes back to mind. Somehow I doubt he would have an alternator put on any other student\u0027s vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will, you didn\u0027t have to do that,\" I say as I sit beside him on the couch. \"Thanks though. I\u0027ll pay you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it. You guys have helped me a lot with Caulder lately, it\u0027s the least I can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet again, I\u0027m at a loss for what to say next. It feels like that first day I was standing in his kitchen, contemplating my next move after he helped me with my bandage. I know I should get up and leave, but I like being here next to him. Even if I am finding myself in his debt again. I finally find the confidence to speak again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, can we finish our conversation from earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe adjusts himself in the couch and props his feet on the coffee table in front of us. \"That depends,\" he says. \"Did you come up with a solution?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no,\" I reply, just as a possible solution comes to mind. I lean my head against the back of the couch and meekly suggest my idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose these feelings we have just get more… complex.\" I pause for a moment. I\u0027m not sure how he\u0027s going to take this new suggestion of mine, so I tread lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be opposed to the idea of getting a G.E.D.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous,\" he says, eyeing me sharply. \"Don\u0027t even think like that. There\u0027s no way you’re quitting school, Lake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m Lake again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was just an idea,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it was a dumb one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both think silently, neither of us coming up with any other solutions. My head is still resting against the back of the couch as I watch him. His arms are crossed behind his head as he stares up at the ceiling. His jaw is clenched tight and he\u0027s absentmindedly popping his knuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s no longer wearing the clothes he wears as a teacher. Instead, he has a plain white fitted t-shirt on and grey jogging pants that are almost identical to the ones I\u0027m wearing. For the first time tonight, I notice his hair is wet. I haven\u0027t been this close to him in weeks; I was beginning to forget what he smells like. I inhale as I take in the scent of his aftershave. It smells like the air in Texas right before it starts to rain. If thunder had a smell, I imagine Will would smell just like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a small dab of shaving cream right below his left ear. My hand instinctively moves up to his neck as I wipe it away. He flinches and turns toward me and I defensively hold up my finger as if to prove my reason for touching him. He pulls my hand toward him as he rubs my finger across his shirt, wiping off the excess shaving cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur hands come to rest on his chest as we continue to look at each other in silence. My palm is flat against his heart and I can feel it rapidly beating against my hand. I know this exchange between us is wrong, but it feels incredibly right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe allows my hand to remain on his chest as it moves up and down to the rhythm of his breath. The look in his eyes is the exact look he had when he was watching me in class today. Although this time, my physical response is more intense and I struggle to control the powerful urge to lean in and kiss him. I’ve wanted to talk to him like this for over a month now. I still had so much to say before he started pretending I didn’t exist. I’m afraid as soon as I walk out of his house tonight, the isolation will return. I decide to tell him what I’ve wanted to say to him for weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will?\" I whisper. \"I\u0027ll wait for you-until I graduate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhales and closes his eyes as he strokes his thumb across the back of my hand. \"That\u0027s a long wait, Lake. A lot can happen in a year.\" His pulse increases against my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what comes over me, but I lean closer and turn his face toward mine. I just need him to look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t meet my gaze. Instead, his eyes focus on his hand as he slowly moves it up my arm. All the same sensations that flowed through me the first night we kissed come flooding back. I\u0027ve missed his touch so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch him as he moves his hand to my shoulder. He slides his fingers underneath the strap of my shirt as he traces along the edges. His movements are slow and methodical as he pulls his legs off of the table in front of him and turns his body toward me. His expression seems full of conflict as he slowly leans in and presses his lips against my shoulder. I wrap my arms around him as I inhale. His breath becomes heavier as his lips move across my shoulder and onto my neck. The room starts to spin, so I close my eyes. His lips make their way to my jaw and closer to my mouth. When I feel him pull away I open my eyes again and he\u0027s watching me. There\u0027s a slight moment of hesitation in his eyes just before his lips close over mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, his kisses have been very delicate and smooth. There is a different hunger behind him now as he slides his hands under my shirt and grasps at my waist. I return his kisses with the same feverish passion. I run my hands through his hair and pull him to me as I lay back on the couch. As soon as he begins to ease his body on top of mine, his lips break away and he sits back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to stop,\" he says. \"We can\u0027t do this.\" He squeezes his eyes shut and rests his head against the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit back up and ignore his protest as I slide my hands up his neck and through his hair. I press my lips to his and pull myself onto his lap. His hands wrap around my waist and he pulls me into him as he returns my kiss with even more intensity than before. He’s right; they do get better every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands find the bottom edge of his shirt and I slide it up. Our lips separate for a brief moment as his shirt passes between us. I place my hands on his chest and run them over the contours of his muscles as we continue to kiss. His hands grip my arms and he pushes me down onto the couch. I\u0027m waiting for him to find his way back to my mouth, but instead he pushes away from me and stands up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Layken, get up!\" He demands as he grabs my hand and pulls me up from the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up, still caught up in the moment and unable to catch my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This—this can\u0027t happen!\" He’s attempting to catch his breath too. \"I\u0027m your teacher now. Everything has changed, we can\u0027t do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis timing sucks. My knees are weak so I sit back down on the couch for support. \"Will, I won’t say anything. I swear.\" I don\u0027t want him to regret what just happened between us. For a moment, it felt like we were back where we belonged. Now, seconds later I\u0027m confused again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Layken but it\u0027s not right,” he says as he paces the floor. “This isn\u0027t good for either of us. This isn\u0027t good for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know what\u0027s good for me,\" I snap. I\u0027m getting defensive again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops pacing and turns toward me. \"You won\u0027t wait for me. I won\u0027t let you give up what should be the best year of your life. I had to grow up way too fast, I\u0027m not taking that away from you, too. It\u0027s not fair. I don’t want you to wait for me, Layken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shift in his demeanor and the way my entire first name is flowing from his mouth is causing the oxygen to deplete from the room. I’m dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be giving anything up,\" I reply weakly. I would have screamed it if I could muster enough energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs his shirt and pulls it on over his head as he moves further away from me. He walks to the opposite side of the living room and grips the back of the couch, his head falling between his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My life is nothing but responsibilities. I\u0027m raising a child for Christ’s sake. I wouldn\u0027t be able to put your needs first. Hell, I wouldn\u0027t even be able to put them second. You deserve better than third.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up and walk over to him, kneeling on the couch in front of him. I place my hands on top of his. \"Your responsibilities should come before me, which is why I want to wait for you, Will. You\u0027re a good person. This thing about you that you think is your flaw-it\u0027s the reason I\u0027m falling in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last few words trickle out as though I\u0027ve lost what little control over myself I had left. I don\u0027t regret saying it, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls his hands out from under mine and places them firmly on either side of my face. He looks me directly in the eyes. \"You are not falling in love with me.\" He says this as if it\u0027s a command. “You cannot fall in love with me.” His face is hard as he clenches his jaw again. I feel the tears begin to well in my eyes as he releases me and walks toward the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened tonight-\" He\u0027s pointing to the couch as he speaks. \"That can\u0027t happen again. That won\u0027t happen again.\" He says this as though he\u0027s trying to convince more than just me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he walks outside, he slams the door behind him and I\u0027m left alone in his living room. My hands clutch at my stomach as the nausea intensifies. I\u0027m afraid if I don\u0027t regain my composure soon, I won\u0027t be able to stand long enough to make it out of the house. I inhale through my nose and exhale from my mouth as I count backwards from ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a coping technique I learned when I was younger from my father. I used to have what my parent’s referred to as \"emotional overloads.\" My dad would wrap his arms around me and squeeze me as tight as he could as we counted down. Sometimes I would fake the tantrums just so he would have to squeeze me. What I wouldn\u0027t give for my dad\u0027s embrace right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door opens and Will re-enters carrying a sleeping Caulder in his arms. \"Kel woke up, he\u0027s walking home now. You should go too,\" he says quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel completely embarrassed. Embarrassed of what just happened between us and the fact that he is making me feel desperate; weaker than him. I snatch my keys off the coffee table and turn toward the door, stopping in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re an asshole,” I say. I turn and leave, slamming the door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I get to my bedroom, I collapse on the bed and cry. Although it\u0027s negative, I finally have inspiration for my poem. I grab a pen and simultaneously start writing as I wipe away smudged tears off of the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can’t be like me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut be happy that you can’t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see pain but I don’t feel it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am like the old Tin Man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-The Avett Brothers, Tin Man\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Elizabeth Kubler Ross, there are five stages of grief a person passes through after the death of a loved one: Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a psychology class during the last semester of my junior year when we lived in Texas.
