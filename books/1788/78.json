When it became apparent that no sense could be made from her jumbled words, he hushed her gently and held her against his large, warm body while she sobbed and hid her face. Overwhelmed with relief, she let him rock her as if she were a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Amelia hiccupped and quieted in his arms, Cam asked a few questions of Poppy, who told him about Merripen\u0027s condition and Leo\u0027s disappearance, and even about the missing silverware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally getting control of herself, Amelia cleared her aching throat. She lifted her head from Cam\u0027s shoulder and blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better?\" he asked, holding the handkerchief up to her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia nodded and blew obediently. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said in a muffled voice. \"I shouldn\u0027t have turned into a watering pot. I\u0027m finished now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam seemed to look right inside her. His voice was very soft. \"You don\u0027t have to be sorry. You don\u0027t have to be finished, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized that no matter what she did or said, no matter how long she wanted to cry, he would accept it. And he would comfort her. That made her eyes water again. Her hand crept to the open neck of his shirt, partially open to reveal a glimpse of sun-burnished skin. She let her fingers curl around the linen placket. \"Do you think Leo might be dead?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offered no false hope, no empty promises, only caressed her damp cheek with the backs of his fingers. \"Whatever happens, we\u0027ll deal with it together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam?would you do something for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you find some of that plant Merripen gave to Win and Leo for the scarlet fever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew back and looked at her. \"Deadly nightshade? That wouldn\u0027t work for this, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s a fever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caused by a septic wound. You have to treat the source of the fever.\" His hand went to the back of her neck, soothing the tautly strung muscles. He stared at a distant point on the floor, appearing to think something over. His tangled lashes made shadows over his hazel eyes. \"Let\u0027s go have a look at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think you could help him?\" Poppy asked, springing to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either that, or my efforts will finish him off quickly. Which, at this point, he may not mind.\" Lifting Amelia from his lap, Cam set her carefully on her feet, and they proceeded up the stairs. His hand remained at the small of her back, a light but steady support she desperately needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they approached Merripen\u0027s room, it occurred to Amelia that Win might still be inside. \"Wait,\" she said, hastening forward. \"Let me go first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam stayed beside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntering the room with caution, Amelia saw that Merripen was alone in the bed. She opened the door wider and gestured for Cam and Poppy to enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecoming aware of intruders in the room, Merripen lurched to his side and squinted at them. As soon as he caught sight of Cam, his face contracted in a surly grimace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bugger off,\" he croaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam smiled pleasantly. \"Were you this charming with the doctor? I\u0027ll bet he was falling all over himself to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This may surprise you,\" Cam said, \"but there\u0027s a long list of things I\u0027d prefer to look at rather than your rotting carcass. For your family\u0027s sake, however, I\u0027m willing. Turn over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen eased his front to the mattress and said something in Romany that sounded extremely foul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too,\" Cam said equably. He lifted the shirt from Merripen\u0027s back and pried the bandage from the injured shoulder. He viewed the hideous seeping wound without expression. \"How often have you been cleaning it?\" he asked Amelia. \u0027\"Twice a day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll try four times a day. Along with a poultice.\" Leaving the bedside, Cam motioned for Amelia to accompany him to the doorway. He lowered his mouth to her ear. \"I have to go out to fetch a few things. While I\u0027m gone, give him something to make him sleep. He won\u0027t be able to tolerate this otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tolerate what? What are you going to put in the poultice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mixture of things. Including apis mellifica\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bee venom. Extract from crushed bees, to be precise. We\u0027ll soak them in a water-and-alcohol base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBewildered, Amelia shook her head. \"But where are you going to get? She broke off and stared at him with patent horror. \"You\u0027re going to the hive at Ramsay house? H-how will you collect the bees?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twitched with amusement. \"Very carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you... do you want me to help?\" she offered with difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing her terror of the insects, Cam slid his hands around her head and pressed a hard kiss to her lips. \"Not with the bees, sweetheart. Stay here and dose Merripen with morphine syrup. A lot of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t. He hates morphine. He\u0027ll want to be stoic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, none of us will want him to be awake while I\u0027m applying the poultice. Especially Merripen. The Rom call the treatment \u0027white lightning\u0027 for good reason. It\u0027s not something anyone can be stoic about. So do whatever\u0027s necessary to put him out, monisha. I\u0027ll be back soon.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-78.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
