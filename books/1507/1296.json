My Grandpa Meng?","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[/expand]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain began to fall in the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr perhaps it would be more accurate to call it the tears of the Mountains and Seas.... Tears for the battle, tears for the crumbled ruins, tears for the slaughter, tears because of the mutual destruction unleashed by the cultivators of the Mountains and Seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears began to fall in the instant that Meng Hao said the final words of the incantation. They fell from the starry sky down onto the battlefield, splashing onto all the cultivators there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a gentle rain that seemed to contain no force whatsoever. The cultivators first stared in shock, but then began to relax. The pressure from moments ago had been shocking to the extreme, but in contrast, this rain seemed completely powerless. The Dao Realm experts from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, who had been so nervous moments ago, now had strange expressions on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two who had been fighting with the Noble Ran even chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seal the Heavens Incantation? This is the Seal the Heavens Incantation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How droll. What an amusing magical technique.” Their nervousness instantly began to fade away. After breathing sighs of relief, they then began to laugh loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, they backed up nonetheless. Although they did not fear the Seal the Heavens Incantation, the sudden addition of Meng Hao onto the battlefield was definitely fear-inspiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief Dharma Protector of the Heavengod Society sighed inwardly, and the other almighty Dao Realm experts of the Eighth Mountain and Sea looked on with grim expressions. There were only three people on the battlefield who had different reactions. One was Meng Hao, and another was the Noble Ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Noble Ran was laughing, a laughter filled with happiness and excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third person who was acting completely differently was the boy Xiao Yihan, who was fleeing at top speed, and in a flash had exited the battlefield. Of everyone present, he understood Meng Hao the best, and was completely terrified of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Meng Hao, he was completely calm as he closed his eyes. The Noble Ran’s laughter continued to echo out as he too closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment that Master and apprentice closed their eyes, the entire starry sky began to shake. The falling rain then erupted with a power that could shake Heaven and Earth. As it surged out, the gentleness from before became a burning madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the Mountain and Sea Realm had suddenly gone from being incredibly sad to being exceedingly furious!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was furious that the living beings in the Mountain and Sea Realm would slaughter each other, furious that the 33 Heavens had completely sealed the Mountain and Sea Realm. It was furious at anything and everything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA raindrop exploded, bypassing the cultivators of the Eighth Mountain and Sea to slam into the cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea. Their faces fell as the power of that raindrop’s explosion hit them like a mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMMMMBLLLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne raindrop after another began to explode, filling the battlefield with intense explosions. In the blink of an eye, the whole battlefield was collapsing as the boundless power of the Mountains and Seas erupted out violently!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloodcurdling screams rose up from the cultivators of the Seventh Mountain and Sea, as nearly a million cultivators coughed up huge mouthfuls of blood. That blood merged together into an entire sea of blood which swept out like floodwaters!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings weren’t over yet. The explosions continued as all of the rain detonated. The power of the Mountains and Seas... was thoroughly unleashed; it was like a giant, roaring across the battlefield. Each time it waved its arms, blood sprayed from mouths and cultivators were sent spinning through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dao Realm experts from the Seventh Mountain and Sea wore expressions of shock; they could clearly sense the power of the Mountains and Seas, and could tell that it was incensed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What... what power is this?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can feel the rage of Heaven and Earth, this... this is shocking!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heaven and Earth is furious, the Mountain and Sea Realm is rejecting us! I can even sense my Essence trembling!!” Cries of alarm rose up, filled with disbelief and astonishment. The Dao Realm cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were being suppressed by the will of the Mountain and Sea Realm itself. Rumbling echoed out as blood sprayed out of their mouths, and they were sent tumbling through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis shocking scene played out all over the battlefield. Blood sprayed out of the mouths of all of the cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, and they began to fall back, albeit not voluntarily; they were being shoved backward by a massive force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll across the battlefield, the cultivators of the Eighth Mountain and Sea looked on with gaping jaws. The Chief Dharma Protector of the Heavengod Society was astonished, and the first Patriarch of the Righteous Noble Sect was shocked. All of the Dao Realm experts of the Eighth Mountain and Sea were aghast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was not even to mention the other cultivators who were not in the Dao Realm. Everyone was flabbergasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This power... it\u0027s the power of the Mountain and Sea Realm, the will of the Mountains and Seas!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Seal the Heavens Incantation... the Noble Ran’s Seal the Heavens Incantation can actually control the entire Mountain and Sea Realm!!” Looks of disbelief began to appear on the faces of the Dao Realm cultivators of the Eighth Mountain and Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge gap now existed between the two sides on the battlefield. However, no one was killed. The cultivators of the Seventh Mountain and Sea were injured and shocked, and their cultivation bases were suppressed, but no one was killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven still, what was happening was completely astonishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two Dao Realm experts who had been fighting the Noble Ran were included in that. Their faces were masses of shock and fear, and when they felt the power of expulsion pushing against them, a deep sense of unease rose up in their hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them felt as if they were under attack by some monstrous power, and were sent flying backward accompanied by intense rumbling sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as they tumbled back, Meng Hao’s eyes snapped open, and they blazed with killing intent. Voice cool, he said, “As for you two. You shall die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not a request. It was a command, uttered with extreme calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant the words left his mouth, the two Dao Realm experts screamed miserably as the power of the Mountains and Seas shredded them to bits. Blood and gore spattered out, and although their Nascent Divinities appeared and tried to flee, they were quickly destroyed by the power of the Mountains and Seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose two deaths caused the cultivators on both sides of the battlefield to gasp. Now that the two sides had been forcibly separated, everything went silent. The Noble Ran opened his eyes, and a wide smile broke out on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat smile was one of happiness and contentment, and when he looked at Meng Hao, his eyes glowed with deep gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked around the battlefield, then slowly said, “Who said the Seal the Heavens Incantation was a worthless incantation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one responded. Not a single cultivator dared to say a word. Everyone from both the Seventh Mountain and Sea and the Eighth was completely shaken, and when they looked at Meng Hao, it was with deep awe and dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who could draw upon the power of the Mountains and Seas was someone completely terrifying. Someone like that... was similar to the Mountain and Sea Lords. They wielded power that ordinary people did not possess. Not even Dao Sovereigns were awe-inspiring enough to command the power of the Mountains and Seas, not unless they became Mountain and Sea Lords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere it not for the fact that the Dao Realm experts from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were sure that the Lord of the Eighth Mountain and Sea was slumbering and had not awoken, they would have believed Meng Hao to be the Lord of the Eighth Mountain and Sea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s gaze swept across the crowds, then came to rest on the Noble Ran. Clasping hands, he bowed deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonderful. Wonderful!” the Noble Ran said excitedly, laughing, but also staggering a bit from weakness and his internal injuries. Meng Hao hurried forward and held out an arm to help support him. As soon as he touched him, a gentle power sprang out from within Meng Hao and began to course through the Noble Ran, healing his injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of that moment, all eyes were on the Noble Ran, and as for the cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, their expressions were those of dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Noble Ran felt his injuries healing rapidly, he looked at Meng Hao and mused that he really had made the right decision in taking him as an apprentice. In fact, for Meng Hao’s sake, he had offended everyone in the entire Heavengod Alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master, I can’t stay,” Meng Hao said quietly. “There’s an important matter I have to attend to. Master, please take this jade slip. If... this Mountain and Sea is ever overrun by the enemy, please use it to borrow some of the power of the Seal the Heavens Incantation. Go to... the Ninth Mountain and Sea. That is my home.” He handed the Noble Ran a jade slip that could be used to pierce through the barriers between Mountains and Seas, one of several that he had made at the same time that he had set up the spell formation in the Meng Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Noble Ran smiled kindly and nodded, accepting the jade slip. He looked very content, as well as deeply proud. From this moment on, no one would ever dare to say that the Seal the Heavens Incantation was a worthless incantation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo say that it was worthless was to say that the entire Mountain and Sea Realm was worthless!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao once again clasped hands and bowed deeply to the Noble Ran. Then he looked around at the surrounding cultivators and said, “Anyone who dares to harm my Master, regardless of their status or the level of their cultivation base, will have their entire sect or clan exterminated by me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone, both those from the Seventh Mountain and Sea as well as those from the Eighth, all heard him, and their hearts trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA threat from someone who was similar to a Mountain and Sea Lord was a threat that even a Dao Sovereign had to take seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao once again clasped hands to the Noble Ran, then made his way off the battlefield. The only reason he had come here was because of the Noble Ran. He resolved the situation, healed his Master’s injuries, then said his parting words, certain that his Master would now be safe regardless of what happened in the war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Meng Hao left, neither side on the battlefield felt like fighting any more, and gradually dispersed, faces filled with awe and other mixed emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time since the Mountain and Sea War began that... a battle ended in such a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNews quickly spread among both sides, and soon, everyone in the Eighth and Seventh Mountains and Seas were aware of how terrifying the Seal the Heavens Incantation was. They learned of Meng Hao, and also... that there was someone else in the war who was not to be provoked... the Noble Ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea dared to venture into the interior of the Heavengod Alliance. As for Meng Hao, he proceeded along through the starry sky, getting closer and closer to the Eighth Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he neared, it became more and more clear that the shocking fluctuations coming from the top of the Eighth Mountain... were filled with a familiar aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few more hours passed, and Meng Hao arrived at the foot of the Eighth Mountain. Looking up toward the peak of the mountain, he murmured, “Sir... are you my Grandpa Meng...?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 1292: Are you...
