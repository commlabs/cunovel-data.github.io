He saw one long street, of unusual width, lined with an indiscriminate variety of buildings from one-story saloons and offices to two and three-story buildings. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Inter-Ocean Hotel, in front of which his guide halted, was a fine brick structure of three stories, which seemed hardly at home in the loosely built town, which had sprung up as if by magic on the prairies.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This is where I put up,\" said Mr. Scott.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll take a room here, if they can give me one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll see that you have one. They know me—Jim Scott—and they\u0027d make room if they hadn\u0027t one. Do you know what they used to call this settlement?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Hell on Wheels\u0027 was the name they give it in early days.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Was that to invite settlers?\" asked Paul, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I expect it was because it was about the roughest,[Pg 231] most lawless place between Omaha and Frisco. Why the principal occupation of the first settlers was gamblin\u0027, drinkin\u0027 rot-gut whisky, and shootin\u0027. There wasn\u0027t a day passed hardly but some chap was found lyin\u0027 in the street with a hole in his head or a bullet in his heart. I tell you them was rough times.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope things have changed,\" said Paul, by no means prepossessed in favor of Cheyenne by what he had heard. \"If they haven\u0027t, I don\u0027t think I shall stay here long.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes, it\u0027s settled down, so that life is pretty safe. They had to raise a vigilance committee to set things straight like they did in Frisco. It\u0027s all right now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am glad to hear it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile they had entered the hotel, and Paul succeeded in securing a room adjoining that of Mr. Scott, or Jim Scott, as he insisted on being called.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After he had washed and changed his clothing, he sat down to a substantial meal, which he enjoyed with the hearty appetite of youth. Then Mr. Scott invited him to take a walk about the town.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I say, youngster, have you got a father and mother?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My father is dead, but I have a mother and sister living.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 232]\"And what did your mother say to your comin\u0027 out here?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She was willing, knowing that I had my own way to make.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I haven\u0027t chick or child myself. I had a wife once, but she died twenty years ago. Now I\u0027ve got money, but sometimes I feel lonely.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It isn\u0027t too late for you to marry again, Mr. Scott.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Scott?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I mean Jim.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Maybe you\u0027re right, but there ain\u0027t many women would hitch on to me except for my money, and I\u0027m better without such. I say, youngster, do you mind my keepin\u0027 company with you while you stay in these parts?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly not, Jim. I shall feel fortunate in having one with me who knows so much more about the country than I.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s all right, then. When do you want to start for Custer City?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To-morrow, if there is a chance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I\u0027ll get ready, too.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is the distance?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Two hundred and fifty miles, and pretty long miles, some of \u0027em.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do we travel by stage?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 233]\"Yes. One has been put on lately. When I went first, I traveled by wagon, and was a week on the road, maybe ten days. Now, if you travel at night, we can reach Custer City in forty-eight hours or thereabouts.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose the road is a lonely one?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You may say that. As far as Fort Laramie it is pretty well settled. There is a ranch about every twelve miles.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you call that well settled?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" said Jim, \"we call it so out here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shouldn\u0027t think people would feel crowded, living at such distances.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We like plenty of room, you see, Paul.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next morning Paul and his new friend started for Custer City, and in due time arrived at the Black Hills metropolis without any adventures that need recording.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83104.html","bookId":282,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:54 AM"}
