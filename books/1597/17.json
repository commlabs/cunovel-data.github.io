He could last thirty years, if he didn’t catch an infection. And I hadn’t seen a bedsore yet. But I couldn’t help but suffer a little shiver, thinking about his body, just lying there in the quiet house, dying slowly as his cousin practiced scales down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you, sugar?” Nana asked me as I washed her dishes that evening. I was daydreaming of Sang as I scrubbed her already squeaky-clean plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here,” I said. “Just thinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you find yourself a beau?” she asked. “I can spot the look of a pining woman, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” I said. I could lie to estate-sale clerks, but I wasn’t about to try lying to Nana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, if he’s good enough for you, you be sure to bring him by,” she said, shaking her old feather duster at me. “A good boy always visits the kinfolk. That’s manners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know if it’s going to work out,” I said thoughtfully. “It’s long-distance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was true. Both of them were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll buy the boy a plane ticket, if he’s worth your time,” she said. “You know how it was with your grandpa and me. Hit me like a truck of watermelons, the first time I saw him. Fifty years of marriage, and we were still in love when I lost him.” She sighed wistfully and stared at the picture on the mantel of Grandpa in his judge’s robes. “You listen to me, sugar. You go with your gut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am,” I said automatically, and she nodded sagely. She had no idea what was going on in my gut, and neither did I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of my choices were actually pretty hard to digest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, I went to bed early. Just in case it mattered, I brushed out my hair, washed my face, and flossed my teeth. Then I crawled into bed, curled my hand around the locket, and closed my eyes. I was nervous and excited, and if I had been anyone else, I probably would have had trouble getting to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m me, so I was asleep immediately. I blinked and found myself in total darkness. I gasped in fear. Nothing was familiar. And I was exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a seam of orange light appeared, and a soft voice called, “Letitia, is that you, love?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Criminy?” I said, rubbing my eyes and sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened, and I was bathed in the warm glow of the something-like-electric lamps from the main room. A Criminy-shaped shadow blocked the glare, and as my eyes adjusted, I saw concern and relief on his face. He sat on the side of the bed and held out a gloved hand as if to touch me, but then he stopped at the last moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right?” he asked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think so,” I said. “But I’m so sleepy.” My eyelids started to droop closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay with me, pet,” he said. “Stay in this world a while. It’s my turn to have you.” He smoothed the hair off my face and said, “How was it?” Just that little touch gave me the tingles. I wondered if I had morning breath and ducked my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was … totally normal. I woke up in my bed, took care of my grandmother, went to work. It felt like I didn’t get any sleep, but it was fine.” Then it occurred to me that he looked exhausted, too. “Wait. Did you sleep at all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much,” he said wryly as he rubbed the back of his neck. “I’ll admit I fell prey to a little catnap in the early morning, but the door was locked and Pem was on guard. Had the strangest dream. I was watching you through this big glass window, and you were in a giant castle all surrounded by short green grass, like someone had cut it with scissors and a ruler, and it was raining. And I was soaked to the bone, water pelting down my collar, through my hair. And you sat inside in a sort of ugly blue dress on a plaid sofa, watching a glowing box. I yelled and knocked on the window again and again, but you wouldn’t look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like a nightmare,” I said, but it struck me to the heart. He was describing my old house, Jeff’s house, the carefully trimmed yard, and my favorite robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was,” he said. Then, with a smile, as if it didn’t matter, he added, “If you ever hear me calling you in the rain, let me in, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I could tell something in him was unsettled from the dream, and I didn’t want to talk about it, either. I may have felt a little strange in his world, but he would be entirely out of place in mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, and I went back to the estate sale where I found the locket. I got the book it was in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” He said it lightly. “And what sort of book was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An empty one,” I said. “Red leather, no title, no words on the pages. Only a family register on the front cover. Your family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, from the twelve hundreds until now. What year is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s spring of 1904,” he said. “And you’re saying the names were there, but the pages were blank?” He leaned toward me, intent on my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How bizarre,” he said to himself. “When I sent it out to find you, it was a family grimoire, my most prized possession, full of every spell, incantation, recipe, curse, scam, and joke in the family. And in your world, it’s just empty pages. I wonder if you can bring it back with you somehow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the locket is the only thing that transfers. I mean, I’m wearing the same clothes and hairstyle I fell asleep with here. The makeup doesn’t even pass over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but the grimoire was enchanted along with the locket. There’s a spell on it, a strong one. It wanted to find you, and it wants to come home to me. It belongs in Sang.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” I said, thinking. “It’s under the front seat of my car now, but I can try falling asleep with it in my arms tomorrow night. Although that’s going to feel a little silly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, love. I wouldn’t trade you, but I’d be glad to have both prizes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes met, and we both smiled a bit shyly. He began to move toward me, leaning in for a kiss, but I put a hand against his chest to stop him, paying careful attention to be sure that I only touched his shirt. My stomach flipped inside, but I wasn’t going to give in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop right there,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” he breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I can’t,” I said. “I’ve just woken up in another world. I can’t go kissing strange men before breakfast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a strange man now?” he said, pulling back to pin me with his sharp eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve known you for one day,” I said, pushing him farther back so that I could get out of bed. I went to the washstand and looked at my bed-rumpled face and hair in the mirror. With the smudged black makeup, I looked a little like a Victorian consumptive. It wasn’t entirely unbecoming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One day, and still a stranger. How many days until I cease to be strange?” he asked playfully, peering over my shoulder at his own tired but well-groomed image in the mirror. Despite having spent the entire night in my wagon, he didn’t have a bit of stubble. His hair was pulled back into a low ponytail, and it made him seem a little less unruly, a little more proper. Whereas I was a mess, but he didn’t seem to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the prey animal within urging me to keep away from his predatory grin. But he was just a person. He could walk in the daylight, he showed up in mirrors, he didn’t sleep in a coffin. He wasn’t dead. But I somehow kept expecting him to be more of a monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you’ll always be strange,” I said softly, looking down at the red flowers painted on the china bowl. “Where’s the pitcher of water?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pitcher of water?” He laughed. “What do you think this is—the sixteen hundreds?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached to a small dial on the side of the washstand and flicked a switch, and water began to pour out of the mouth of a ceramic cherub set into the wood under the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We tap the caravan’s pump into the aquifer whenever we park, you see,” he said. When the bowl was filled, he flicked the switch, and the water stopped. “When you’re done, the drain is below the bowl. Just pick it up and dump it down. It’s a little old-fashioned, but it’s better than beating your stockings against a rock.” Seeing the look on my face, he laughed. “Don’t you have running water in your world?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I said. “I guess I thought things were less modern here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Less modern? You don’t even have clockworks where you come from, you said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“OK, OK. You win. You’re more modern,” I said. “Can I get dressed now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. Do you need any help with your laces?” He said it casually, but there was a hungry curiosity in his voice that amused me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably,” I said. “But I need help with everything. Can you send Mrs. Cleavers over?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed that high, wild laugh of his and said, “Mrs. Cleavers doesn’t make house calls, pet. She’s a very important lady. But I’ll send a girl over. I’m better at taking the laces off, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sauntered out the door with a smile on his face and his copper monkey on his shoulder, calling, “And come to the dining car for breakfast when you’re ready, love. Lots to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, someone tapped on my door, and when I opened it an inch, I saw the back of a head plastered in strawberry-blond curls and a riot of purple and yellow leather. A small clockwork bat clutched her shoulder, rubbery wings folded and red eyes blinking bright. It was the girl I’d seen on the tightrope yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun around and gave me a bright but fake smile. It reminded me of the look a popular girl once gave me in high school right before she asked to borrow my homework. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wicked-as-they-come-blud-1/page-17.html","bookId":1597,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:29 PM"}
