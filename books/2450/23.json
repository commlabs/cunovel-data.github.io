But we act as if we hadn\u0027t seen the slaughter in the cafeteria, as if we don\u0027t know what it means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re at the door a minute later. We stare at the bar. If it works, and the door opens, we\u0027re just seconds away from freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody reaches for the bar. Everyone\u0027s afraid of being the one to fail, to dash the hope that we all long for but don\u0027t dare believe in. Finally I sigh and step up to the challenge. I push the bar down. It clicks. I pause a second, then push.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and lean my head against the door. Then I curse and push again, straining, putting everything into it. But I\u0027m wasting my time. It doesn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B,\" Trev says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fire one of my vilest curses his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B,\" he says calmly. \"Look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and spot something on the floor to our left. I saw it before but thought it was just a corpse. Now I see that there are actually two bodies. And one of them\u0027s moving, chewing on the head of the other, slurping down brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we stare with disgust, the zombie pushes its victim away and stands. We all gasp at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Reed!\" I shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie that was once our principal sways from side to side, staring at us blankly, chin drenched with blood and flecked with bits of brain. I get a fix on the body beneath her and cringe. It\u0027s Jonesenzio. He won\u0027t be boring anyone with dry history lectures again. Poor old sod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reed shuffles towards us. Nobody moves. She doesn\u0027t seem to pose an immediate threat. She\u0027s smiling stupidly, eyes unfocused, rubbing her stomach. She burps and giggles softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is unreal,\" the Indian kid sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reed\u0027s eyes settle on him and she frowns. She raises a finger and shakes it slowly. Then she spots me. Her smile spreads again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beeeeeeee,\" she wheezes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloody hell!\" Elephant yelps. \"How\u0027s she talking? Zombies can\u0027t talk! Can they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reed comes closer. She\u0027s within touching distance of me now but I can\u0027t move. I\u0027m rooted. The others back up but nobody runs or screams or tries to pull me away from her. They\u0027re mesmerized, held captive by the spectacle like I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reed strokes my cheek with a finger - there\u0027s no bone sticking out of it - and leaves a trail of blood across my flesh. But she doesn\u0027t scratch me and claim me for one of her own. Her eyes are locked on mine. She looks demented but strangely peaceful at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fullll,\" she whispers, still rubbing her stomach with her other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" Seez asks, distracting her. \"Where did the zombies come from? Who are the freaks in the hoodies? Who locked the doors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reed snarls at him. Then she smiles at me again and taps the side of my head. \"Stayyy. Hungry again... sooooon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I croak, stepping away from her. \"I don\u0027t fancy being eaten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reed looks disappointed, but she shrugs and sits down. Dabs at the bits of brain stuck to her chin and sucks them from her finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m backing away from the zombie principal when I stop. This isn\u0027t right. She\u0027s not like any of the others we\u0027ve encountered. And it\u0027s not just the fact that she can talk and doesn\u0027t have bones sticking out of her fingers. There are no bite marks or scratches. I can\u0027t see where she was wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to study her properly - this seems important - but Trev interrupts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is weird,\" I argue. \"She\u0027s different. I want to know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrev shrugs. \"Then stay and have a chat with her. Me, I\u0027m heading for the front of the building, to get the hell out. They might have barred the doors but they can\u0027t have blocked all the windows. There wasn\u0027t enough time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right,\" Seez says. \"The windows are our best hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have any hope,\" someone snickers behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whirl and spot three people in hoodies. They\u0027re spread across the corridor, grinning viciously. I\u0027m almost certain that the one in the middle is the louse who tried to steal the baby in the museum. Then he points at me and says, \"You should have let me take the boy,\" and my suspicions are confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" I yell. \"Why are you doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" the mutant chuckles, his voice gravelly and gurgly, nothing like a normal person\u0027s. \"You\u0027re in good company. This is happening all over London. This will be a city of zombies by the time the sun sets. And it won\u0027t be the only one. From tomorrow, this world is ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we stare at the mutant with the crazy skin and yellow eyes, horrified by his prediction, he puts his whistle to his lips and blows. The others blow their whistles too. Three long, sharp toots. They\u0027re so piercing, I have to cover my ears with my hands. Then the mutants drop the whistles and smirk. Lowering my hands, I fix on the sound of a flurry of feet stomping down the corridor, dozens of zombies responding to the call of the mutants, closing in on us. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-zom-b-1/page-23.html","bookId":2450,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:45 PM"}
