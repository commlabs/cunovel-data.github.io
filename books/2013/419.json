She and the Imass who had carried the Finnest were both now crouched at the form of a third Imass, a warrior. The woman was cradling the dead or unconscious warrior’s head. ‘Onrack… my friend…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kin first,’ Seren Pedac said. Then she raised her voice and called out to the Imass. ‘Does the fallen one live?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ the warrior replied. ‘My father lives.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sob broke from Trull Sengar and he sagged against her. Seren staggered beneath his weight for a moment, then straightened. ‘Come, my love.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis caught Trull’s attention as, perhaps, nothing else would. He searched her face, her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We must return to my house,’ she said, even as dread clawed at her heart-another, after all 1 have done to those who came before him. Errant forgive me. Another. ‘I carry a sword,’ she added. ‘And would bury it before the threshold.’ And shall 1 then kneel there, dirt on my hands, and cover my eyes? Shall I cry out in grief for what is to come? For all that I will bring to you, Trull Sengar? My burdens-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have dreamed you would say that, Seren Pedac’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes for a long moment, and then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey resumed their journey, and when they reached Fear Sengar, she let Trull settle down onto the ground, and he set the spear down, then reached out to touch his brother’s ashen, lifeless face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom nearby, Udinaas-his face streaked in tears-spoke in a harsh, grating voice. ‘I greet you, Trull Sengar. And I must tell you… your brother, Fear… he died as a hero would.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull lifted his head, stared across at the Letherii. ‘Udinaas. You are wrong. My brother sought… betrayal.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. He saw you, Trull, and he knew the mind of Silchas Ruin. Knew you could never stand against the White Crow. Do you understand me? He saw you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is that helpful?’ Seren Pedac snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas bared bloodstained teeth. ‘With the only alternative betrayal, Acquitor, then yes. Trull, I am… sorry. And yet… Fear-1 am proud of him. Proud to have known him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she saw her beloved nod, then manage a sorrow-filled smile at the ex-slave. ‘Thank you, Udinaas. Your journey-all of you-your journey, it must have been long. Difficult.’ He glanced to her, then back to Udinaas. ‘For remaining at my brother’s side, I thank you both.’, Oh, Trull, may you never know the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnrack the Broken opened his eyes to an ancient dream, and its conjuration twisted like a knife in his soul. Not oblivion, then. Such peace is denied me. Instead, my crimes return. To haunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet… Ulshun Pral-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ancient dream, yes, and hovering just beyond, a far younger dream-one he had not even known to exist. The Ritual of Tellann had stolen from so many men of the Imass this reaching into the future, this creation of sons, daughters, this rooting of life into the soil that lived on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, that had indeed been a dream-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilava Onass suddenly frowned. ‘You stare, Onrack, with all the intelligence of a bhederin. Have you lost your wits?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreams did not berate, did they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah,’ she then said, nodding, ‘now I see you of old-1 see the panic that ever fills a man’s eyes, when all he longed for is suddenly within reach. But know this, I too have longed, and I too now feel… panic. To love in absence is to float on ever still waters. No sudden currents. No treacherous tides. No possibility of drowning. You and I, Onrack, have floated so for a very long time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared up at her-yes, he was lying on hard stone. In the cavern of the gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Kilava smiled, revealing those deadly canines. ‘But I fared better, I think. For you gave me a gift, from that one night. You gave me Ulshun Pral. And when I found this… this illusion, I found for our son a home, a haven.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This realm… dies,’ Onrack said. ‘Are we all illusions now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilava shook her head, the luxuriant black hair shimmering. ‘Gothos gave to our son the Finnest. As for the rest, well, your son has explained it to me. The white-skinned Tiste Andii, Silchas Ruin, delivered the seed of an Azath, a seed in the guise of a child. To accept the Finnest, to use its power to grow. Onrack, soon these gates will be sealed, each and all drawn into the House, into a squat, clumsy tower. And this realm-with an Azath House here, this realm no longer wanders, no longer fades. It is rooted, and so it will remain.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-419.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
