Those Trollocs we were fighting will be joining the battle at the river soon, now that we have left the hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d move the Aes Sedai downriver on this side, then attack them across the water as they moved across the fields to attack her soldiers. \"Tell the archers they’ll be marching with us as well\", she added. \"They may as well put their remaining arrows to good use, until we can get them another supply\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the messenger rushed off, Egwene turned to Leilwin, who was standing with her husband, Bayle Domon, nearby. \"Leilwin, those look like Seanchan cavalry troops across the river. Do you know anything about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mother, they are Seanchan. That man standing over there-\" She pointed to a man with shaved temples standing by a tree down toward the river; he wore voluminous trousers and, incongruously, a tattered brown coat which looked as if it might have come from the Two Rivers. \"—he told me that a legion commanded by Lieutenant-General Khirgan had come from the Seanchan camp, and that they had been summoned by General Bryne\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He also said that they do be accompanied by the Prince of Ravens\", Domon interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did more than accompany them. He do be leading one of the cavalry banners, the ones giving the Sharans a hiding on our army’s left flank. He got there just in time, our pikemen were getting the worst of it before he showed up\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Egwene\", Gawyn said, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the south, a few hundred paces below the ford, a small number of soldiers were hauling themselves from the river. They had stripped to their smallclothes and carried swords tied to their backs. It was too far to be sure, but one of their leaders looked familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that Uno?\" Egwene frowned, then waved for her horse. She mounted and galloped, with Gawyn and her guards, along the river to where the men lay gasping on the bank, and the sound of one man cursing filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uno!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s about bloody flaming time someone came!\" Uno stood as he saluted in respect. \"Mother, we’re in bad shape!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw\". Egwene gritted her teeth. \"I was in the hills when your force was attacked. We did what we could, but there were just too many of them. How did you get out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did we flaming get out, Mother? When the men started dropping all around us and we figured we was goners, we flaming rode out of there like a flaming lightning bolt had struck our flaming hindquarters! We got to the frog-kissing river on the run, stripped and jumped in, swimming for all we were bloody worth, Mother, with all due respect!\" Unos topknot danced as he continued to blaspheme, and Egwene could have sworn the eye painted on his eyepatch became a more intense red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUno took a deep breath and continued, a little more subdued. \"I can’t understand it, Mother. Some goat-headed messenger told us that the Aes Sedai on the hills were in trouble and we needed to go up the flaming backsides of the Trollocs attacking them. I said, who’s going to mind the left flank at the river, and, for that bloody matter, our own bloody flank when we attack the Trollocs, and he said that General Bryne had that taken care of, reserve cavalry would move up into our position at the river, and the Illianers would watch out for our bloody flanks. Some protection they were, all right, one flaming squadron, like a flaming fly trying to fend off a flaming falcon! Oh, they were just waiting for us, like they knew we was coming. No, Mother, this can’t be the fault of Gareth Bryne, we’ve been tricked by some sheep-gutted milk-drinking traitor! With all due respect, Mother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can’t believe that, Uno. I just heard that General Bryne had brought in a legion of Seanchan cavalry. Maybe they were simply late getting here. We\u0027ll sort it all out when I find the general. Meanwhile, get your men back to camp so they can have a proper rest. Light knows you’ve earned it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUno nodded, and Egwene galloped back toward camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing Vora’s sa’angreal, Egwene wove Air and Water, spinning them together. A funnel of water surged up, drawn from the river beneath. Egwene blew her tornado of water into the Trollocs that were beginning their assault against her army’s left flank on the Kandori side of the river. Her tempest of water surged across them. It wasn’t strong enough to pull any of them into the air—she didn’t have the energy for that—but it drove them back, hands to their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her and the other Aes Sedai positioned on the Arafellin side of the river, archers loosed volleys of arrows into the sky. Those didn’t darken the sky the way she would have liked—there weren’t so many—but they did take down more than a hundred Trollocs with each wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the side, Pylar and a couple of other Browns—all adept with weaves of Earth—caused the ground to erupt under the charging Trollocs. Spread out next to her, Myrelle and a large contingent of Greens wove fireballs that they lobbed over the water into bunched-up groups of Trollocs, many of whom continued to run a considerable distance before they collapsed, engulfed in flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trollocs howled and roared, but continued their relentless progress against the defenders at the river’s edge. At one point, several ranks of Seanchan cavalry moved out from the defensive lines and attacked the Trolloc onslaught head-on. It happened so quickly that many of the Trollocs were unable to raise their spears before contact was made; large swaths of the foe in the front ranks went down. The Seanchan swept to the side and returned to their lines at the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene held to her channeling, forcing herself to work through sheer exhaustion. But the Trollocs didn’t break; they grew enraged, attacking the humans with a frenzy. Egwene could hear their yells distinctly over the sounds of wind and water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trollocs grew angry, did they? Well, they would not know anger until they had felt that of the Amyrlin Seat. Egwene pulled in more and more of the Power until she was at the very edges of her ability. She put heat into her tempest so that the scalding water burned Trolloc eyes, hands, hearts. She felt herself yelling, Vora’s sa’angreal thrust before her like a spear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat seemed like hours went by. Eventually, exhausted, she allowed Gawyn to talk her into pulling back for a time. Gawyn went to fetch her horse and as he was returning, Egwene looked across the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no doubt about it; her army’s left flank had already been pushed another thirty paces. Even with the Aes Sedai aid, they \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-181.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
