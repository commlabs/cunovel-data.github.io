The experience of coming so close to being killed had been terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing I need right now is some blonde airhead trying to get me murdered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly sank down on the couch to calm herself and closed her eyes. She tried to meditate and concentrate on a mantra, but it was no use. She was too shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an empty, lonely feeling deep inside her. Mark, I miss you so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople said that as time went by, I would feel better. It\u0027s not true, my darling. Every day makes it worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a food cart being wheeled down the corridor made Kelly realize that she had not eaten all day. She was not hungry, but she knew she had to keep up her strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe phoned room service. \"I\u0027d like a shrimp salad and some hot tea, please.\" \"Thank you. It should be there in twenty-five to thirty minutes, Mrs. Harris.\" \"Fine.\" Kelly replaced the receiver. She sat there, replaying in her mind the meeting with Tanner Kingsley, and she felt as though she had been plunged into a chilling nightmare. What was going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had Mark never mentioned Olga? Was it a business relationship? An affair?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark, darling,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want you to know that if you did have an affair, I forgive you because I love you. I will always love you. You taught me how to love. I was cold and you warmed me. You gave me my pride back, and made me feel like a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about Diane. That busybody put my life at risk. She\u0027s someone to stay away from. That won\u0027t be difficult. Tomorrow I\u0027ll be in Paris, with Angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer reverie was interrupted by the sound of a knock at the door. \"Room service.\" \"Coming.\" As Kelly started toward the door, she stopped, puzzled. She had ordered just a few minutes ago. It\u0027s too soon. \"Just a moment,\" she called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" Kelly picked up the phone and dialed room service. \"My order is not here yet.\" \"We\u0027re working on it, Mrs. Harris. It should be there in fifteen or twenty minutes.\" Kelly replaced the receiver, her heart pounding. She dialed the operator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s-there\u0027s a man trying to get into my room.\" \"I\u0027ll send a security officer right up, Mrs. Harris.\" Two minutes later, she heard another knock. Kelly walked over to the door, wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security.\" Kelly looked at her watch. Too fast. \"I\u0027ll be right there.\" She hurried over to the telephone and called the operator again. \"I called down about security. Is-\" \"He\u0027s on his way up, Mrs. Harris. He should be up there in a minute or two.\" \"What is his name?\" Her voice was strangled with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thomas.\" Kelly could hear low, low whispers in the hall. She pressed her ear against the door until the voices faded. She stood there, filled with blind terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later, there was a knock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security.\" \"Bill?\" Kelly asked. She held her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mrs. Harris. It\u0027s Thomas.\" Kelly quickly opened the door and let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe regarded her a moment and said, \"What happened?\" \"Some-some men tried to get in here.\" \"Did you see them?\" \"No. I-I heard them. Would you walk me out to a taxi?\" \"Certainly, Mrs. Harris.\" Kelly was trying to force herself to stay calm. Too much was happening too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas stayed close by Kelly\u0027s side as they got into the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the lobby, Kelly glanced around, but she could see nothing suspicious. Kelly and the security guard walked outside, and as they reached the taxi stand, Kelly said, \"Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\" \"I\u0027ll make sure that everything is all right when you come back. Whoever tried to break into your room is gone by now.\" Kelly got into a taxi. As she glanced out the rear window, she saw two men hurrying into a parked limousine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where to?\" the cabdriver asked Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limousine had pulled up behind the taxi. Ahead, at the corner, a policeman was directing traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go straight ahead,\" Kelly told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" As they approached the green light, Kelly said urgently, \"I want you to slow down and wait until the light changes to yellow, then make a quick left turn.\" The driver glanced at her in the rearview mirror. \"What?\" \"Don\u0027t go through the green light until it turns yellow.\" She saw the expression on the driver\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly forced a smile. \"I\u0027m trying to win a bet.\" \"Oh.\" Crazy damn passengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the light changed from green to yellow, Kelly said, \"Now!\" The taxi made a fast left turn as the light turned red. Behind them, the oncoming traffic was stopped by the policeman. The men in the limousine turned to each other, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the taxi had gone a block, Kelly said, \"Oh, I forgot something. I\u0027ve got to get out here.\" The driver pulled over to the curb and Kelly got out of the cab and handed him some money. \"Here.\" He watched Kelly hurry into the entrance to a medical building. I hope she\u0027s seeing a psychiatrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the corner, the moment the light turned green, the limousine made a left turn. The taxi was two blocks ahead, and they raced after it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later, Kelly was hailing another cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN DIANE STEVENS\u0027s apartment, Detective Greenburg was saying,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Stevens, did you get a look at the person who took a shot at you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane shook her head. \"No, it happened so fast? \"Whoever it was, was serious. Ballistics dug the bullets out of the wall. They were forty-five calibers, capable of piercing body armor. You were lucky.\" He hesitated. \"We think that whoever it was, he was sent by Tony Altieri.\" Diane swallowed. I\u0027m just going to take it easy for a while, clear up a few old debts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re checking that out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreenburg studied her a moment. \"About the briefcase that\u0027s missing, do you have any idea what was in it?\" \"I\u0027m not sure. Richard usually took it to the laboratory with him most mornings and brought it home at night. I saw some of the papers once and they were very technical.\" Greenburg picked up the wedding ring that was on the table. \"And you said that your husband never took off his wedding ring?\" \"That\u0027s-that\u0027s right.\" \"In the days before his death, did your husband act differently than usual, as though he might be under some kind of pressure, or be worried about something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you remember anything that he said or did on the last night you saw him?\" It was early morning. They were in bed, naked. Richard gently stroked her thighs and said, \"I\u0027m going to be working late tonight, but save an hour or two for me, when I get home, honey.\" She touched him where he liked being touched and said, \"Braggart.\" \"Mrs. Stevens-\" Diane was jolted back to reality. \"No. There was nothing unusual.\" \"I\u0027ll see that you have protection,\" Greenburg said. \"And if-\" The doorbell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you expecting anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreenburg nodded. \"I\u0027ll get it.\" He walked over to the door and opened it. Kelly Harris stormed in and brushed by him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly marched up to Diane. \"We need to talk.\" Diane looked at her in surprise. \"I thought you were on your way to Paris?\" \"I took a detour.\" Greenburg had joined them. \"This is Detective Earl Greenburg. Kelly Harris.\" Kelly turned to Greenburg. \"Someone just tried to break into my hotel room, Detective.\" \"Did you report it to hotel security?\" \"Yes. The men were gone. A guard escorted me out.\" \"Do you have any idea who they were?\" \"No.\" \"When you say someone tried to break in, you mean they tried to force the door?\" \"No, they-they just stood out in the hall. They pretended they were from room service.\" \"Had you ordered room service?\" \"Yes.\" Diane said, \"Then you\u0027re probably imagining things because of what happened this morning, and-\" Kelly snapped at her. \"Listen, I told you, I don\u0027t want any part of this or of you. I\u0027m going to pack and fly back to Paris this afternoon. You tell your Mafia friends to leave me alone.\" They watched Kelly turn and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that all about?\" Greenburg asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her husband was-was killed. He worked for the same company Richard worked for, Kingsley International Group.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN KELLY RETURNED to the lobby of her hotel, she walked over to the desk. \"I\u0027m checking out,\" she said. \"Would you please get me a reservation on the next plane to Paris?\" \"Certainly, Mrs. Harris. Any particular airline?\" \"Just get me out of here.\" Kelly crossed the hotel lobby, stepped into an elevator, and pressed the button for the fourth floor. As the elevator door started to close, two men pushed it open and got in. Kelly studied them an instant, then quickly backed out into the lobby. She waited until the elevator door closed, then headed for the stairs and started to walk up. No use taking any chances, Kelly thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she reached the fourth-floor landing, a huge man was blocking the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" Kelly said. She started to move past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh!\" He was pointing a gun with a silencer at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly turned pale. \"What are you-?\" \"Shut up. I bet you got exactly the right number of holes, lady. Unless you want an extra one, be quiet. I mean-very quiet. You and I are going downstairs.\" The man was smiling, but as Kelly looked closer, she saw that a knife crease on his upper lip had pulled his mouth up into a fixed grin. He had the coldest eyes Kelly had ever seen. Let s go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! I\u0027m not going to die because of that bitch. \"Wait a minute. You have the wrong-\" She felt the gun smash so hard into her ribs that she wanted to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you to shut up! We\u0027ll walk down.\" He was holding Kelly\u0027s arm in a painful viselike grip, the gun concealed in his hand behind her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly was fighting hysteria. \"Please,\" she said softly, \"I\u0027m not the-\" The pain as he stabbed the muzzle of the gun against her back was excruciating. He was squeezing her arm so hard that she could feel the blood draining out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started down the stairs. They reached the lobby. It was crowded, and as Kelly was debating whether to call for help, the man said, \"Don\u0027t even think about it.\" And they were outside. There was an SUV waiting at the curb. Two cars ahead, a policeman was writing a parking ticket. Kelly\u0027s captor led her to the back door of the SUV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly glanced ahead at the policeman. \"All right,\" Kelly said in a loud, angry voice, \"I\u0027ll get in, but I want to tell you something. What you want me to do to you will cost an extra hundred dollars. I think it\u0027s disgusting.\" The policeman had turned to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burly man was staring at Kelly. \"What the hell are you-?\" \"If you won\u0027t pay it, then forget it, you cheap bastard.\" Kelly started rapidly walking toward the policeman. The man looked after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips were smiling, but his eyes were deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly pointed to him. \"That pervert has been bothering me.\" She glanced back to see the policeman moving toward the thug. Kelly stepped into a waiting taxi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the burly man started to get into the SUV, the policeman said, \"Just a minute, mister. It\u0027s against the law in this state to solicit prostitutes.\" \"I wasn\u0027t-\" \"Let me see some identification. What\u0027s your name?\" \"Harry Flint.\" Flint watched as Kelly\u0027s taxi sped away. That whore! I\u0027ll kill her. Slowly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-22.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
