The more that sank in the harder it became to breathe. I forced a smile and made my excuses before rushing upstairs to take a shower. Rush needed some alone time with his dad anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the tears I’d held back fall freely as I undressed and stepped into the shower. The warm water rained down over me as a sob broke free. Last year I had cooked our Thanksgiving meal and we had eaten it together in the dining room. No friends or family. Just the two of us. I’d cried that night too. Because deep down I’d known it was my last Thanksgiving with my mother. The memories of years gone by when Valerie and Dad had been there were bittersweet. My heart ached for all we’d lost. I hadn’t thought anything could hurt as badly but I knew now that I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacing the holidays without my mom was going to be hard. She loved Thanksgiving and Christmas. We would always start decorating the house for Christmas on Thanksgiving Day. Then we’d sit down and watch White Christmas together that evening while we ate leftover turkey and sweet potato casserole. It had been our tradition. Even after we lost Valerie and Dad had left us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis year everything would be different. Knowing Rush would be with me and that I was starting a new family of my own eased the ache. I just wished my mother were here to see me this happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and I spun around to see Rush walk into the bathroom. He was frowning. He stopped and he studied me a moment before pulling his shirt off and throwing it onto the marble floor. Then he unsnapped his jeans and stepped out of them and his boxer briefs. I watched as he stepped into the shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why’re you crying?” he asked, cupping my face in his hands. I knew the shower had washed away my tears but my eyes must still be red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and smiled at him. I didn’t want to worry him with my emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard you when I opened the door to the bedroom. I need to know why, Blaire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and laid my head against his chest then wrapped my arms around his waist. I had lost a lot but God had made up for that by giving me Rush. I needed to remember just how blessed I really was. “The fact this is my first Thanksgiving without my mom kind of hit me,” I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush’s arms tightened around me. “I’m sorry, baby,” he whispered into my hair as he held me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too. I wish you could have met her, I mean, now that you’re older. I wish she could’ve seen you all grown up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish I could have to. I’m sure she was as perfect as you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, I wanted to disagree. I was nowhere near as perfect as my mother. She was one of those special people that the world doesn’t see often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If my dad being here is going to be hard on you I’ll send him away. I want to make this a good memory for you. Anything I can do to help you just tell me and I’ll do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears trickled freely down my face again. Stupid pregnancy hormones made me a leaking fountain lately. “Having you with me makes it all better. Just talking about it made it sink in. Momma loved Thanksgiving. I knew last year was the last one we’d spend together. The entire day I did everything I could to make it special for her. And me. I knew I’d need that memory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush rubbed small circles on my back and held me in silence. We stood there while the water ran over us for several minutes. Finally he pulled back enough to look down at me. “Can I bathe you?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, unsure what he meant. He reached for one of the clean washcloths stacked up outside the shower and picked up one of my bottles of body wash. Then he began washing my back and shoulders. He picked up each of my arms as if I were a child and washed them thoroughly. I stood there and watched him as he concentrated on cleaning every inch of my body. He didn’t make it sexual which surprised me. Instead, it was more sweet and innocent than anything else we’d ever done. His hand didn’t linger as he washed between my legs. He only pressed his lips to my stomach once as he knelt in front of me and washed my legs and feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he was finished he stood up and began rinsing my body with his hands. Each touch seemed almost reverent. As if he were worshiping me instead of washing me. When my body was clean he moved to my hair. I closed my eyes as his hands massaged my scalp. My knees went a little weak from the pleasure of it. Rush quickly rinsed the shampoo from my hair and then did my conditioning, giving it just as much attention before running my hair under the clean water again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body was relaxed from the pampering. I was almost sluggish. Rush turned off the water and reached for two large towels. One he wrapped in my hair and the other one he wrapped around my body. Then he picked me up, carried me to the bed, and laid me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just rest. I’ll be right back,” he whispered before kissing my forehead and walking back to the bathroom. The view of his naked ass was tempting and I wanted to stay awake. Having him touch me that way had turned me on even if that hadn’t been his intention. I tried to wait on him but my eyes grew heavy and I faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuggled deeper into the warmth. It smelled of sunshine and ocean air. Sighing contentedly, I rubbed my cheek against the comforting warmth. It chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes opened and Rush’s bare chest was pressed up against my face. Smiling, I kissed it and peered up at him. The amused smirk on his lips only made me giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re like a little kitten in the mornings,” he said with a deep husky voice. He must have just woken up too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you didn’t feel so good I wouldn’t be searching you out to rub up against you in my sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush winked. “Then I’m glad I feel good because your sweet ass isn’t going to be rubbing against anyone else. I’d have to kill someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved this man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry I fell asleep so quickly last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush shook his head. “Don’t be. I love knowing I relaxed you and it was easy for you to fall asleep. I don’t like seeing you sad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved this man a whole damn lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStretching against him, I slipped both hands behind his neck and pressed my body against his. I squeezed my legs from the tingle of anticipation when his erection brushed my upper thigh. I needed him this morning. After the sweet moment last night I needed to feel completely connected now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make love to me,” I whispered tucking my head in the crook between his neck and shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My pleasure,” he murmured and slipped his hand in between my thighs. He lifted one of my legs up and rested it on his hip. I was wide open and the exposed feeling excited me. His fingers grazed the inside of my thighs, teasing me by barely brushing at my swollen needy entrance. I whimpered, hoping to hurry him up but he would not be pressured. Instead, it seemed to make him worse. His rough fingertips traced patterns from my knees up to the very top of my thigh then back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was positive that his play had caused me to get embarrassingly wet. “Rush, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please what, sweet Blaire. What do you want me to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d told him what I wanted already. Apparently, he wanted to hear more. Rush and his naughty talk always excited me. “Touch me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am touching you,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touch me higher,” I begged. He wanted me to talk dirty. I was going to tease him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his finger in in the crease of my thigh and I gripped his arms tightly and trembled. He was so close. “Here?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted so that his finger slipped closer. He started to move his hand away and stopped. “Fuck,” he moaned sliding his finger into me slowly. “So wet. I can’t tease you when you’re already so wet,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cried out as he gently ran his fingertip over my clit. He had me spread open and having his hands touching me only made me crazier. I wanted more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My sweet girl was so ready for me,” he said moving two fingers inside me and pressing against my g spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loud cry of pleasure that ripped out of me was more than he could handle. He grabbed my waist and positioned me over him before slowly sinking me down over his cock. “Damn, how’d it get tighter?” he growled, squeezing my hips and rocking against me as I sat down on him taking every inch inside me. This was what I’d wanted. To be full. Of Rush. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-too-far-too-far-3/page-4.html","bookId":1995,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM"}
