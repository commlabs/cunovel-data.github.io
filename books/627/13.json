And there were an awful lot of big mouths in that class.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Jewls,\" Jason called without raising his hand. \"Joy is chewing gum in class!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy had the biggest mouth in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. And it was filled with gum. There was hardly even room for her tongue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Joy, I\u0027m ashamed of you,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to put your name up on the board.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s okay, Mrs. Jewls,\" Jason called. \"I\u0027ll do it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e 48Jason hopped out of his seat and wrote Joy\u0027s name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\n\u003cbr\u003e While he was up, Joy took the glob of gum out of her mouth and placed it on Jason\u0027s chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rondi and Allison giggled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason walked back from the blackboard to his desk and sat down. \"Mrs. Jewls,\" he called, \"I\u0027m STUCK!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rondi and Allison giggled again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls got angry. \"Joy, you\u0027re going home on the kindergarten bus today.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, good,\" said Todd. \"I\u0027ll have some company.\" Todd went home on the kindergarten bus every day. He could never seem to make it to twelve o\u0027clock without getting into trouble three times. His name wasn\u0027t even up on the blackboard yet. But he knew that by twelve o\u0027clock it would be up, checked, and circled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Jewls, what am I going to do? I\u0027m stuck! I\u0027m going to have to stay here the rest of my life!\" said Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Joy, tell Jason you\u0027re sorry,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry, Jason,\" said Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, that\u0027s okay, Joy,\" said Jason. \"I don\u0027t mind.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Try to get up, Jason,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason tried. \"I can\u0027t, Mrs. Jewls. I\u0027m stuck.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls asked the three Erics to help. Eric Fry and Eric Ovens pulled Jason. Eric Bacon held the chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Stop,\" cried Jason. \"You\u0027ll rip my pants.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rondi and Allison giggled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Let\u0027s try ice water. That should freeze the gum and make it less sticky. I\u0027ll go get some from Miss Mush.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Mush was the lunch teacher at Wayside School. She had the remarkable ability to undercook a dish andovercook it at the same time.\n\u003cbr\u003e 49Her specialty was a nice, hot bowl of mud. She called it porridge.\n\u003cbr\u003e Jason looked at Rondi and Allison. \"No, Mrs. Jewls,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t leave me. Besides, Miss Mush\u0027s ice water is probably warm.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t be silly, Jason,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027m sure it will be at least as cold as her soups.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rondi and Allison leered at Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Mrs. Jewls, don\u0027t go!\" begged Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll be right back, Jason,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She went to Miss Mush for some ice water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As soon as Mrs. Jewls stepped out the door, Rondi and Allison jumped up from their seats and started to tickle Jason. He laughed until his hair turned purple. The girls got back to their seats just as Mrs. Jewls returned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls carried a big bucket of ice cold water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no, please don\u0027t, no!\" Jason pleaded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We have no choice,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She threw the water all over him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"try to get up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason was drenched. \"I\u0027m wet and I\u0027m cold and I\u0027m still stuck!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well, it didn\u0027t work,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"At least we tried. Now I guess we\u0027ll have to cut your pants off.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rondi and Allison giggled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Mrs. Jewls, no!\" Jason screamed. \"I don\u0027t mind being stuck here. I\u0027m really very comfortable.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t be silly, Jason,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t cut off my pants,\" said Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The three Erics can carry you to the bathroom,\"said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e 50\"I\u0027ll ask Louis to call your mother. She can bring you a new pair of pants.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e The three Erics took hold of Jason\u0027s chair and turned him upside down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Jason. \"Now I\u0027ll always have a place to sit down. I won\u0027t have to worry about finding a seat on the bus.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The three Erics began to take him away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wait,\" said Joy. \"Mrs. Jewls, if I can get Jason unstuck, do I still have to go home on the kindergarten bus?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"If you can somehow get Jason free, you don\u0027t have to go home early.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t trust her, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Jason. He was still hanging upside down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll just kiss him,\" said Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No!\" Jason screamed. \"Don\u0027t let her kiss me, Mrs. Jewls. Throw water on me. Tickle me. Cut off my pants. Hang me upside down from the ceiling.
