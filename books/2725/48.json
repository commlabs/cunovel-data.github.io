Because you still love her, right?” He didn’t wait for me to answer. “What I want to know is, if you still had feelings for her, why did you give me the go-ahead, huh? I did the right thing. I didn’t go behind your back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked you, straight up. You told me you were over her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You weren’t exactly asking for my permission when I walked in on you kissing her in your car. Yeah, I still gave you the go-ahead, because I trusted you to take care of her and treat her right. Then you go ahead and cheat on her in Cabo during spring break. So maybe I should be the one asking if you love her or not.” As soon as I got the last word out, Jere’s fist was connecting with my face, hard. It was like getting hit with a ten-foot wave—all I could hear was the ringing in my ears. I staggered backward. “Good,” I gasped. “Can we get out of here now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe punched me again. This time I fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up!” he yelled. “Don’t talk to me about who loves Belly more. I’ve always loved her. Not you. You treated her like garbage. You left her so many times, man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re a coward. Even now, you can’t admit it to my face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing hard, I spat out a mouthful of blood and said, “Fine. I love her. I admit it. Sometimes—sometimes I think she’s the only girl I could ever be with. But Jere, she picked you. You’re the one she wants to marry. Not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the envelope out of my pocket, stumbled up, and pushed it at his chest. “Read this. It’s for you, from Mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor your wedding day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing, he tore the envelope open. I watched him as he read, hoping, knowing, my mom would have the right words. She always knew what to say to Jeremiah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJere started to cry as he read, and I turned my head away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going back,” he finally said. “But not with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re not my brother anymore. You’re dead to me. I don’t want you at my wedding. I don’t want you in my life. I want you gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jere—” “I hope you said everything you needed to say to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause after this, you’re never seeing her again. Or me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s over. You and I are done.” He handed me the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is yours, not mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the bench and opened the paper up. It said, Dear Conrad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I started to cry too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifty-five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside my window, far down the beach, I could see a group of little kids with plastic pails and shovels, digging for sand crabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJere and I used to do that. There was this one time, I think I was eight, which meant Jeremiah must have been nine. We’d searched for sand crabs all afternoon, and even when Conrad and Steven came looking for him, he didn’t leave. They said, “We’re going to ride our bikes into town and rent a video game, and if you don’t come with us, you can’t play tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can go if you want,” I’d said, feeling wretched because I knew he’d choose to go. Who would choose sandy old sand crabs over a new video game?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, and then said, “I don’t care.” And then he stayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt guilty but also triumphant, because Jeremiah had chosen me. I was worthy of being chosen over someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe played outside until it got dark. We collected our sand crabs in a plastic cup, and then we set them free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watched them wriggle back into the sand. They all seemed to know exactly where they were going. Some clear destination in mind. Home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, Conrad and Steven played their new game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah watched them. He didn’t ask if he could play, and I could see how much he wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my memory he would always be golden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone knocked on the door. “Taylor, I need a minute by myself,” I said, turning around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t Taylor. It was Conrad. He looked worn down, exhausted. His white linen shirt was wrinkled. So were his shorts. When I looked closer, I saw that his eyes were bloodshot, and I could see a bruise forming on his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran over to him. “What happened? Did you guys get into a fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shouldn’t be in here,” I said, backing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jeremiah’s coming up any minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, I just need to say something to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved back to the window, turning my back on him. “You’ve said plenty. Just go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him turn the doorknob, and then I heard him close the door again. I thought he’d gone, until I heard him say, “Do you remember infinity?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, I turned around. “What about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing something toward me, he said, “Catch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached out and caught it in the air. A silver necklace. I held it up and examined it. The infinity necklace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t shine the way it used to; it looked a bit coppery now. But I recognized it. Of course I recognized it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what it is,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. “Nope, sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see that he was both hurt and angry. “Okay, then. You don’t remember it. I’ll remind you. I bought you that necklace for your birthday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to have been for my sixteenth birthday. It was the only year he ever forgot to buy me a birthday present—the last summer we’d all been together at the beach house, when Susannah was still alive. The next year, when Conrad took off and Jeremiah and I went looking for him, I found it in his desk. And I took it, because I knew it was mine. He took it back later. I never knew when he had bought it or why, I just knew it was mine. Hearing him say it now, that it was my birthday present, touched me in the last place I wanted him to touch me. My heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took his hand and put the necklace in his palm. “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad held the necklace out to me. Softly, he said, “It belongs to you, always has. I was too afraid to give it to you then. Consider it an early birthday gift. Or a belated one. You can do whatever you want with it. I just—can’t keep it anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was nodding. I took the necklace from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry for screwing everything up. I hurt you again, and for that I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I don’t want to do that anymore. So … I’m not going to stay for the wedding. I’m just going to take off now. I won’t see you again, not for a long time. Probably for the best. Being near you like this, it hurts. And Jere”—Conrad cleared his throat and stepped backward, making space between us—“he’s the one who needs you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-48.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
