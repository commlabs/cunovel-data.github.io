During a typical day of data gathering, Nate believes his mind is failing: the subject whale has \"Bite Me\" scrawled across its tail. Events become even stranger as the self-proclaimed \"action nerds,\" Nate, photographer Clay, their research assistant Amy, and Kona, a white Rasta, encounter sabotage to their data and equipment. They also observe increasingly bizarre whale behavior, including a phone call from the whale to their wealthy sponsor to ask that Nate bring it a hot pastrami and Swiss on rye, and discover both a thriving underwater city and the secret to what happened to Amelia Earhart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/fluke-or-i-know-why-the-winged-whale-sings.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/fluke-or-i-know-why-the-winged-whale-sings.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:48:23 PM"}
