Another, and he was awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up stiffly in bed. Seconds passed while he interpreted his strange surroundings. He wasn\u0027t in his own home, of course. This was out in the country. It was colder than it should be and there was green at the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slim!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call was a hoarse, urgent whisper, and the youngster bounded to she open window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim wasn\u0027t his real name, but the new friend he had met the day before had needed only one look at his slight figure to say, \"You\u0027re Slim,\" He added, \"I\u0027m Red.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed wasn\u0027t his real name, either, but its appropriateness was obvious. They were friends instantly with the quick, unquestioning friendship of young ones not yet quite in adolescence, before even the first stains of adulthood began to make their appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim cried, \"Hi, Red!\" and waved cheerfully, still blinking the sleep out of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed kept to his croaking whisper, \"Quiet! You want to wake somebody?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim noticed all at once that the sun scarcely topped the low hills in the east, that the shadows were long and soft, and that the grass was wet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim said more softly, \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed only waved for him to come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim dressed quickly, gladly confining his morning wash to the momentary sprinkle of a little lukewarm water. He let the air dry the exposed portions of his body as he ran out, while bare skin grew wet against the dewy grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed said, \"You\u0027ve got to be quiet. If Mom wakes up or Dad or your dad or even any of the hands, then it\u0027ll be \u0027Come on in or you\u0027ll catch your death of cold tramping bare in the dew.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mimicked voice and tone faithfully, so that Slim laughed and thought that there had never been so funny a fellow as Red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim said eagerly, \"Do you come out here every day like this, Red? Real early? It\u0027s like the whole world is just yours, isn\u0027t it, Red? No one else around, and all like that.\" He felt proud at being allowed entrance into this private world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed stared at him sidelong. He said carelessly, \"I\u0027ve been up for hours. Didn\u0027t you hear it last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thunder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was there a thunderstorm?\" Slim was startled. He never slept through a thunderstorm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess not. But there was thunder. I heard it, and then I went to the window and it wasn\u0027t raining. It was all stars and the sky was just getting sort of almost gray. You know what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim had never seen it so, but he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I just thought I\u0027d go out,\" said Red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked along the grassy side of the concrete road that split the panorama right down the middle all the way down to where it vanished among the hills. The road was so old that Red\u0027s father couldn\u0027t tell Red when it had been built. It didn\u0027t have a crack or a rough spot in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed said, \"Can you keep a secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Red. What kind of a secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a secret. Maybe I\u0027ll tel you and maybe I won\u0027t. I don\u0027t know yet.\" Red broke a long, supple stem from a fern they passed, methodically stripped it of its leaflets, and swung what was left whip-fashion. For a moment, he was on a wild charger, which reared and champed under his iron control. Then he got tired, tossed the whip aside, and stowed the charger away in a corner of his imagination for future use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"There\u0027ll be a circus around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim said, \"That\u0027s no secret. I knew that. My dad told me even before we came here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not the secret. Fine secret! Ever see a circus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure. You bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say, there isn\u0027t anything I like better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed was watching out of the corner of his eyes again. \"Ever think you would like to be with a circus? I mean, for good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim considered. \"I guess not. I think I\u0027ll be an astronomer like my dad. I think he wants me to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh! Astronomer!\" said Red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim felt the doors of the new, private world closing on him and astronomy became a thing of dead stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said placatingly. \"A circus would be more fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just saying that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not. I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed grew argumentative. \"Suppose you had a chance to join the circus right now. What would you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See!\" Red affected scornful laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim was stung. \"I\u0027d join up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed whirled at him, strange and intense. \"You mean that? You want to go in with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Slim stepped back a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got something that can get us into the circus. Maybe someday we can even have a circus of our own. We could be the biggest circus fellows in the world. That\u0027s if you want to go in with me. Otherwise-Well, I guess I can do it on my own. I just thought, Let\u0027s give good old Slim a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world was strange and glamorous, and Slim said, \"Sure thing, Red. I\u0027m in! What is it, huh, Red? Tell me what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figure it out. What\u0027s the most important thing in circuses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim thought desperately. He wanted to give the right answer. Finally he said, \"Acrobats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy smokes! I wouldn\u0027t go five steps to look at acrobats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Animals, that\u0027s what! What\u0027s the best side show? Where are the biggest crowds? Even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone thinks so. You ask anyone. Anyway, I found animals this morning. Two of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ve got them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. That\u0027s the secret. Are you telling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027ve got them in the barn. Do you want to see them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were almost at the barn; its huge open door black. Too black. They had been heading there all the time. Slim stopped in his tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to make his words casual. \"Are they big?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would I fool with them if they were big? They can\u0027t hurt you. They\u0027re only about so long. I\u0027ve got them in a cage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in the barn now and Slim saw the large cage suspended from a hook in the roof. It was covered with stiff canvas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed said. \"We used to have some bird there or something. Anyway, they can\u0027t get away from there. Come on, let\u0027s go up to the loft.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey clambered up the wooden stairs and Red hooked the cage toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim pointed and said, \"There\u0027s sort of a hole in the canvas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed frowned. \"How\u0027d that get there?\" He lifted the canvas, looked in, and said with relief, \"They\u0027re still there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The canvas looks burned,\" worried Slim. \"You want to look or don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim nodded slowly. He wasn\u0027t sure he wanted to, after all. They might be-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the canvas had been jerked off and there they were. Two of them, the way Red said. They were small and sort of disgusting-looking. The animals moved quickly as the canvas lifted and were on the side toward the youngsters. Red poked a cautious finger at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch out,\" said Slim in agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t hurt you,\" said Red. \"Ever see anything like them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they\u0027re too small for a circus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed looked annoyed. He let go the cage which swung back and forth pendulum-fashion. \"You\u0027re just backing out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not. It\u0027s just-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not too small, don\u0027t worry. Right now, I\u0027ve only got one worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ve got to keep them till the circus comes, don\u0027t I? I\u0027ve got to figure out what to feed them meanwhile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars, gesturing at the youngsters with queer, quick motions- almost as though they were intelligent. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-12.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
