I don\u0027t know no Mike Moretti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" Jennifer screamed. \"Don\u0027t hang up!\" She forced a calmness into her voice. \"This is urgent. I\u0027m a - a friend of his. My name is Jennifer Parker. I need to talk to him right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, lady, I said - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give him my name and this telephone number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him the number. Jennifer was beginning to stutter so badly she could hardly speak. \"T-t-tell him - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumbly, Jennifer replaced the receiver. She was back to one of her first two choices. Or both of them. There was no reason why Robert Di Silva and the FBI could not join forces to try to find Joshua. The thing that was driving her mad was that she knew how little chance they would have of finding Frank Jackson. There was no time. Read tomorrow\u0027s papers. There was a finality about his last words that made Jennifer certain he would not telephone her again, would not give anyone a chance to trace him. But she had to do something. She would try Di Silva. She reached for the telephone again. It rang as she touched it, startling her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Michael Moretti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael! Oh, Michael, help me, please! I - \" She began to sob uncontrollably. She dropped the telephone, then picked it up again quickly, terrified he had hung up. \"Michael?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here.\" His voice was calm. \"Get hold of yourself and tell me what\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I\u0027ll - \" She took in quick, deep breaths, trying to stop the trembling. \"It\u0027s my son, Joshua. He\u0027s - he\u0027s been kidnapped. They\u0027re going to - kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know who took him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Y-yes. His name is F-Frank Jackson.\" Her heart was pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what happened.\" His voice was quiet and confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer forced herself to talk slowly, recounting the sequence of events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you describe what Jackson looks like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer conjured up a picture of him in her mind. She put the picture into words, and Michael said, \"You\u0027re doing fine. Do you know where he served time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At Joliet. He told me he\u0027s going to kill - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where was the gas station he worked at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave Michael the address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know the name of the motel he was staying at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. No.\" She could not remember. She dug her fingernails into her forehead until it began to bleed, forcing herself to think. He waited patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came to her suddenly. \"It\u0027s the Travel Well Motel. It\u0027s on Tenth Avenue. But I\u0027m sure he isn\u0027t there now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want my son back alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Moretti did not reply and Jennifer understood why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we find Jackson - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer took a deep, shuddering breath. \"Kill him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay by your telephone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe connection was broken. Jennifer replaced the receiver. She felt strangely calmer, as though something had been accomplished. There was no reason to feel the confidence she did in Michael Moretti. From a logical point of view, it was a wild, insane thing to have done; but logic had nothing to do with this. Her son\u0027s life was at stake. She had deliberately sent a killer to catch a killer. If it did not work...She thought of the little girl whose body had been raped and sodomized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer went to tend to Mrs. Mackey. She took care of her cuts and bruises and put her to bed. Jennifer offered her a sedative, but Mrs. Mackey pushed it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t sleep,\" she cried. \"Oh, Mrs. Parker! He gave that baby sleeping pills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer stared at her in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Moretti sat at his desk, facing the seven men he had summoned. He had already given instructions to the first three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Thomas Colfax. \"Tom, I want you to use your connections. Go down and see Captain Notaras and have him pull the package on Frank Jackson. I want everything they\u0027ve got on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re wasting a good connection, Mike. I don\u0027t think - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t argue! Just do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColfax said stiffly, \"Very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael turned to Nick Vito. \"Check out the gas station where Jackson worked. Find out if he hung around any of the bars there, if he had any friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Salvatore Fiore and Joseph Colella: \"Get over to Jackson\u0027s motel. He\u0027s probably gone by now, but find out if he palled around with anyone. I want to know who his buddies were.\" He looked at his watch. \"It\u0027s midnight. I\u0027m giving you eight hours to find Jackson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men started out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael called after them, \"I don\u0027t want anything to happen to the kid. Keep calling in. I\u0027ll be waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Moretti watched them leave, then picked up one of the telephones on his desk and began to dial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1:00 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motel room was not large, but it was very neat. Frank Jackson liked things neat. He felt it was part of being brought up properly. The venetian blinds were rolled down and slanted so that no one could see into the room. The door was locked and chained, and he had pressed a chair against it. He walked over to the bed where Joshua lay. Frank Jackson had forced three sleeping pills down the boy\u0027s throat, and he was still sleeping soundly. Still, Jackson prided himself on being a man who took no chances, so Joshua\u0027s hands and feet were tightly bound together with the same kind of wire that had been used to tie up the old lady in the house. Jackson looked down at the sleeping boy and he was filled with a sense of sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy in God\u0027s name did people keep forcing him to do these terrible things? He was a gentle, peaceful man, but when everyone was against you, when everyone attacked you, you had to defend yourself. The trouble with everybody was that they always underestimated him. They failed to realize until too late that he was smarter than all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had known the police were coming for him half an hour before they arrived. He had been filling the tank of a Chevrolet Camaro and had seen his boss go inside the office to answer the telephone. Jackson had not been able to hear the conversation, but it was not necessary. He saw the covert looks his boss gave him as he whispered into the telephone. Frank Jackson knew immediately what was happening. The police were coming for him. The Parker bitch had double-crossed him, had told the police to lock him up. She was like all the rest of them. His boss was still talking on the telephone when Frank Jackson grabbed his jacket and disappeared. It had taken him less than three minutes to find an unlocked car on the street and hot-wire it, and moments later he was headed for Jennifer Parker\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson really had to admire his own intelligence. Who else would have thought of following her to find out where she lived? He had done that the day she had gotten him out on bail. He had parked across the street from her house and had been surprised when Jennifer had been met at the gate by a little boy. He had watched them together and sensed even then that the kid might come in handy. He was an unexpected bonus, what the poets called a hostage to fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson smiled to himself at how terrified the old bitch of a housekeeper had been. He had enjoyed twisting the wire into her wrists and ankles. No, not enjoyed, really. He was being too hard on himself. It had been necessary. The housekeeper had thought he was going to rape her. She disgusted him. All women did, except for his sainted mother. Women were dirty, unclean, even his whore of a sister. It was only the children who were pure. He thought of the last little girl he had taken. She had been beautiful, with long blond curls, but she had had to pay for her mother\u0027s sins. Her mother had had Jackson fired from his job. People tried to keep you from earning an honest living and then punished you when you broke their stupid laws. The men were bad enough, but the women were worse. Pigs who wanted to soil the temple of your body. Like the waitress, Clara, he was going to take to Canada. She was in love with him. She thought he was such a gentleman because he had never touched her. If she only knew! The idea of making love to her sickened him. But he was going to take her out of the country with him because the police would be looking for a man alone. He would shave off his beard and trim his hair, and when he crossed the border he would get rid of Clara. That would give him great pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Jackson walked over to a battered cardboard suitcase on a luggage rack, opened it and took out a tool kit. From it he removed nails and a hammer. He laid them on the bedside table next to the sleeping boy. Then he went into the bathroom and lifted a two-gallon gasoline can from the bathtub. He carried it into the bedroom and set the can on the floor. Joshua was going to go up in flames. But that would be after the crucifixion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2:00 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout New York and around the country, the word was spreading. It started in bars and flophouses. A cautious word here and there, dropped into a willing ear. It began as a trickle and spread to cheap restaurants and noisy discotheques and all-night newsstands. It was picked up by taxi drivers and truckers and girls working the midnight streets. It was like a pebble dropped into a deep, dark lake, with the ripples beginning to widen and spread. Within a couple of hours everyone on the street knew that Michael Moretti wanted some information and wanted it fast. Not many people were given a chance to do a favor for Michael Moretti. This was a golden opportunity for somebody, because Moretti was a man who knew how to show his appreciation. The word was that he was looking for a thin blond guy who looked like Jesus. People began searching their memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2:15 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua Adam Parker stirred in his sleep and Frank Jackson moved to his side. He had not yet removed the boy\u0027s pajamas. Jackson checked to make sure that the hammer and nails were in place and ready. It was important to be meticulous about these things. He was going to nail the boy\u0027s hands and feet to the floor before he set the room on fire. He could have done it while the boy was asleep, but that would have been wrong. It was important that the boy be awake to see what was happening, to know he was being punished for the sins of his mother. Frank Jackson looked at his watch. Clara was coming to the motel to pick him up at seven-thirty. Five hours and fifteen minutes left. Plenty of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Jackson sat down and studied Joshua, and once he tenderly fondled an errant lock of the small boy\u0027s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:00 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the telephone calls began coming in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two telephones on Michael Moretti\u0027s desk and it seemed that the moment he picked up one, the other started ringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a line on the guy, Mike. A couple years ago he was workin\u0027 a scam in Kansas City with Big Joe Ziegler and Mel Cohen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck what he was doing a couple of years ago. Where is he now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big Joe says he ain\u0027t heard from him in about six months. I\u0027m tryin\u0027 to get hold of Mel Cohen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next phone call was no more productive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went over to Jackson\u0027s motel room. He checked out. He was carryin\u0027 a brown suitcase and a two-gallon can that coulda had gasoline in it. The clerk has no idea where he went.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the neighborhood bars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the bartenders recognized his description, but he says he wasn\u0027t a regular. He went in two or three times after work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accordin\u0027 to the bartender, yeah. He didn\u0027t seem interested in the girls there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check out the gay bars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone rang again almost as soon as Michael had hung up. It was Salvatore Fiore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colfax talked to Captain Notaras. The police property clerk got a record of a pawn ticket in Frank Jackson\u0027s personal effects. I got the number of the ticket and the name of the pawn shop. It\u0027s owned by a Greek, Gus Stavros, who fences hot rocks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you check it out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t check it out until mornin\u0027, Mike. The place is closed. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Moretti exploded. \"We can\u0027t wait until morning! Get your ass down there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a telephone call from Joliet. It was hard for Michael to follow the conversation because his caller had had a laryngectomy and his voice sounded as if it was coming from the bottom of a box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jackson\u0027s cellmate was a man named Mickey Nicola. They were pretty tight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any idea where Nicola is now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last I heard he was back east somewhere. He\u0027s a friend of Jackson\u0027s sister. We have no address on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was Nicola sent up for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They nailed him on a jewelry heist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:30 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pawnshop was located in Spanish Harlem at Second Avenue and 124th Street. It was in an unloved two-story building, with the shop downstairs and living quarters upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Stavros was awakened by a flashlight shining in his face. He instinctively started to reach for the alarm button at the side of his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t,\" a voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flashlight moved away and Gus Stavros sat up in bed. He looked at the two men standing on either side of him and knew he had been given good advice. A giant and a midget. Stavros could feel an asthma attack coming on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go downstairs and take whatever you want,\" he wheezed. \"I won\u0027t make a move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant, Joseph Colella said, \"Get up. Slow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Stavros rose from his bed, cautious not to make any sudden movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small man, Salvatore Fiore, shoved a piece of paper under his nose. \"This is the number of a pawn ticket. We want to see the merchandise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Stavros walked downstairs, followed by the two men. Stavros had installed an elaborate alarm system only six months earlier. There were bells he could have pushed and secret places on the floor he could have stepped on and help would be on its way. He did none of those things because his instincts told him he would be dead before anyone could reach him. He knew that his only chance lay in giving the two men what they wanted. He only prayed he would not die from a goddamned asthma attack before he got rid of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on the downstairs lights and they all moved toward the front of the shop. Gus Stavros had no idea what was going on, but he knew it could have been a great deal worse. If these men had come merely to rob him, they could have cleaned out the pawn shop and been gone by now. It seemed they were only interested in one piece of merchandise. He wondered how they had circumvented the elaborate new alarms on the doors and windows, but he decided not to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move your ass,\" Joseph Colella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus looked at the pawn ticket number again and began to sort through his files. He found what he was looking for, nodded in satisfaction, and went to the large walk-in strong room and opened it, the two men close behind him. Stavros searched along a shelf until he found a small envelope. Turning to the two men, he opened the envelope and took out a large diamond ring that sparkled in the overhead lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is it,\" Gus Stavros said. \"I gave him five hundred for it.\" The ring was worth at least twenty thousand dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave five hundred to who?\" little Salvatore Fiore asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Stavros shrugged. \"A hundred customers a day come in here. The name on the envelope is John Doe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiore pulled a piece of lead pipe out of nowhere and smashed it savagely against Gus Stavros\u0027 nose. He fell to the floor screaming with pain, drowning in his own blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiore asked quietly, \"Who did you say brought it in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFighting for breath, Gus Stavros gasped, \"I don\u0027t know his name. He didn\u0027t tell me. I swear to God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood was flowing into Gus Stavros\u0027 throat so fast he could hardly speak. He was beginning to faint, but he knew if he passed out before he talked he would never wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me think,\" he pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavros tried to focus, but he was so dizzy from the pain that it was difficult. He forced himself to remember the customer walking in, taking the ring out of a box and showing it to him. It was coming back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He - he was kind of blond and skinny - \" He choked on some blood. \"Help me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSalvatore Fiore kicked him in the ribs. \"Keep talkin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had a beard, a blond beard...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us about the rock. Where did it come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in his extreme pain, Gus Stavros hesitated. If he talked, he would be a dead man later. If he did not, he would die now. He decided to postpone his death as long as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It came from the Tiffany job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was in on the job with the blond guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Stavros was finding it harder to breathe. \"Mickey Nicola.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where can we find Nicola?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. He - he shacks up with some girl in Brooklyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiore lifted a foot and nudged Stavros\u0027 nose. Gus Stavros screamed with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoseph Colella asked, \"What\u0027s the broad\u0027s name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jackson. Blanche Jackson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:30 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was set back from the street, surrounded by a small white picket fence with a carefully tended garden in front. Salvatore Fiore and Joseph Colella tramped through the flowers and made their way to the back door. It took them less than five seconds to open it. They stepped inside and moved toward the stairs. From a bedroom above they could hear the sounds of a bed creaking and the voices of a man and a woman. The two men pulled out their guns and started to move quietly up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman\u0027s voice was saying, \"Oh, Christ! You\u0027re wonderful, Mickey! Give it to me harder, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all for you, honey, every bit of it.

He sat up in bed, moving cautiously, trying to figure out the situation. The woman had pulled the sheets up over her breasts, her face a combination of anger and fright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicola carefully swung his feet over the side of the bed, sitting on the edge, ready to spring.

He raised his gun and the blood began to drain from the woman\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them what they want to know,\" Mickey Nicola cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gun moved up to press against the woman\u0027s breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t!

She hummed happily to herself as she packed her cardboard suitcase with the clothes she would need in Canada. She had taken trips with gentlemen friends before, but this was different. This was going to be her honeymoon trip. Frank Jackson was like no other man she had known. The men who came into the bar, pawing her and pinching her buttocks, were nothing but animals. Frank Jackson was different. He was a real gentleman. Clara paused in her packing to think about that word: gentle man. She had never thought of it that way before, but that was Frank Jackson. She had seen him only four times in her life, but she knew she was in love with him. She could tell he had been attracted to her from the very beginning, because he always sat at her booth. And after the second time he had walked her home when the bar had closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must still have it, Clara thought smugly, if I can get a handsome young guy like that. She stopped her packing to walk over to the closet mirror to study herself. Maybe she was a little too heavy and her hair was a couple of shades too red, but dieting would take care of the extra pounds and she would be more careful the next time she dyed her hair. All in all, she wasn\u0027t too dissatisfied with what she saw. The old broad\u0027s still pretty good-lookin\u0027, she told herself. She knew that Frank Jackson wanted to take her to bed, even though he had never touched her. He was really special. There was an almost - Clara furrowed her forehead, trying to think of the word - spiritual quality about him. Clara had been brought up a good Catholic and she knew it was sacrilegious to even think such a thought, but Frank Jackson reminded her a little bit of Jesus. She wondered what Frank would be like in bed. Well, if he was shy, she would show him a trick or two. He had talked about their getting married as soon as they got to Canada. Her dream come true. Clara looked at her watch and decided she had better hurry. She had promised to pick Frank up at his motel at seven-thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw them in the mirror as they walked into her bedroom. They had come out of nowhere. A giant and a little fellow. Clara watched as the two of them moved toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small man looked at the suitcase. \"Where you goin\u0027, Clara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of your business. Just take what you want and get out of here. If there\u0027s anything in this joint worth more than ten bucks, I\u0027ll eat it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got something you can eat,\" the big man Colella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up yours, buster,\" Clara snapped. \"If this is gonna be a rape job, I want you to know the doctor\u0027s treatin\u0027 me for gonorrhea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSalvatore Fiore said, \"We ain\u0027t gonna hurt you. We just wanna know where Frank Jackson is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could see the change that came over her. Her body suddenly stiffened and her face became a mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frank Jackson?\" There was a note of deep puzzlement in her voice. \"I don\u0027t know any Frank Jackson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSalvatore Fiore pulled a lead pipe out of his pocket and took a step toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t scare me,\" Clara said, \"I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arm lashed out across her face, and in the midst of the blinding pain she could feel her teeth crumbling inside her mouth like tiny pieces of grit. She opened her mouth to speak and blood began pouring out. The big man raised his pipe again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, please don\u0027t!\" She gagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoseph Colella said politely, \"Where can we find this Frank Jackson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frank is - is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara thought of her sweet, gentle man in the hands of these two monsters. They were going to hurt him and, instinctively, she knew that Frank would not be able to stand the pain. He was too sensitive. If she could only find a way to save him, he would be grateful to her forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSalvatore Fiore moved forward and Clara heard the sound of her leg breaking at the same instant she felt the excruciating pain. She fell to the floor, unable to scream because of all the blood in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoseph Colella stood over her and said pleasantly, \"Maybe you don\u0027t unnerstand. We ain\u0027t gonna kill you. We\u0027re just gonna keep breakin\u0027 things. When we\u0027re through with you, you\u0027ll look like a piece of garbage the cat threw away. Do you believe me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara believed him. Frank Jackson would never want to look at her again. She had lost him to these two bastards. No dream come true, no marriage. The little man was moving forward with the lead pipe again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara moaned, \"Don\u0027t. Please don\u0027t. Frank\u0027s at the - the Brookside Motel on Prospect Avenue. He - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoseph Colella walked over to the telephone and dialed a number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Moretti answered. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brookside Motel on Prospect Avenue. Want us to take him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ll meet you there. Make sure he doesn\u0027t leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t go anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:30 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was beginning to stir again. The man watched as Joshua opened his eyes. The boy looked down at the wire on his wrists and legs, and then looked up and saw Frank Jackson, and the memories came flooding back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the man who had pushed those pills down his throat and kidnapped him. Joshua knew all about kidnappings from television. The police would come and save him and put the man in jail. Joshua was determined not to show his fear, because he wanted to be able to tell his mother how brave he had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother will be here with the money,\" Joshua assured the man, \"so you don\u0027t have to hurt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Jackson walked over to the bed and smiled down at the boy. He really was a beautiful child. He wished he could take the boy to Canada instead of Clara. Reluctantly, Frank Jackson looked at his watch. It was time to get things ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy held up his bound wrists. The blood had caked dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you mind taking this off, please?\" he asked politely. \"I won\u0027t run away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Jackson liked it that the boy had said \"please.\" It showed good manners. These days, most kids had no manners at all. They ran around the streets like wild animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Jackson went into the bathroom where he had put the can of gasoline back in the tub so that it would not stain the rug in the living room. He prided himself on details like that. He carried the can into the bedroom and set it down. He moved to the boy\u0027s side, lifted up the bound figure and placed him on the floor. Then he picked up the hammer and two large nails and knelt next to the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua Parker was watching him, wide-eyed. \"What are you going to do with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something that will make you very happy. Have you ever heard of Jesus Christ?\" Joshua nodded. \"Do you know how he died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very good. You\u0027re a bright boy. We don\u0027t have a cross here, so we\u0027ll have to do the best we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy\u0027s eyes were beginning to fill with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Jackson said, \"There\u0027s nothing to be afraid of. Jesus wasn\u0027t afraid. You mustn\u0027t be afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to be Jesus,\" Joshua whispered. \"I want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to send you home,\" Frank Jackson promised. \"I\u0027m going to send you home to Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Jackson took a handkerchief out of his back pocket and moved it toward the boy\u0027s mouth. Joshua gritted his teeth together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make me angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Jackson pressed his thumb and forefinger against Joshua\u0027s cheeks and forced his mouth open. He shoved the handkerchief into Joshua\u0027s mouth and slapped a piece of tape across it to hold the handkerchief in place. Joshua was straining against the wires that bound his wrists and hands, and they began to bleed again. Frank Jackson ran his hands over the fresh cuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blood of Christ,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up one of the boy\u0027s hands, turned it over and held it down against the floor. Then he picked up a nail. Holding it against Joshua\u0027s palm with one hand, Frank Jackson picked up the hammer with his other. He drove the nail through the boy\u0027s hand into the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7:15 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Moretti\u0027s black limousine was stalled on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in early morning traffic, held up by a vegetable truck that had overturned and spilled its cargo across the road.

The boy was a disappointment. He had fainted. Jackson had wanted to wait until Joshua regained consciousness before the other nails were driven in, but it was getting late. He picked up the can of gasoline and sprinkled it across the boy\u0027s body, careful not to let it touch that beautiful face. He visualized the body under the pajamas and wished that he had time to - but, no, that would be foolish. Clara would be here any moment. He must be ready to leave when she arrived. He reached in his pockets, pulled out a box of matches, and set them neatly beside the can of gasoline, the hammer and the nails. People simply did not appreciate how important neatness was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Jackson looked at his watch again and wondered what was keeping Clara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7:50 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside Bungalow 7, the limousine skidded to a stop and Michael Moretti jumped out of the car.
