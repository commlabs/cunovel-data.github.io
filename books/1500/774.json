At the very least, in this narrow space, his mobility was restricted, his fighting strength also affected. Meanwhile, stealth and other abilities were clearly ineffective before the enemy who clearly possessed a sharp sense of smell. He was already injured twice, even though these could currently only be considered superficial wounds, not touching any important tissues, he knew that these irregular wolves’ attack power was extremely great. If he didn’t concentrate his defensive ability in the corresponding areas, the injuries he received would have been much more serious, for example, the injury below his ribs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf even more came… as soon as this thought emerged, the red robed warrior’s entire body trembled, the short blade pushing out horizontally. After entering a defensive stance, only then did he slowly turn around. At the end of the long and dark corridor behind him appeared four moss-green lights. Meanwhile, around the corridor corner ahead, he also sensed two vicious auras currently moving over.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThere were seven Herkula in total!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe red-robed warrior’s face fell, the short blade changing to a reversed grip, left hand clenching into a fist.

A faint flowing light emerged below his amber-colored skin, his entire body becoming like a sculpture carved from amber.

This time, the blade was no longer searching for a chink to wedge into, but rather displayed tremendous strength, forcibly hacking off half of one of the third Herkula’s foreclaws!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe red-robed warrior already rushed over to the wounded Herkula.

Another large depression several dozen centimeters in diameter appeared, rock fragments continuously falling. Meanwhile, at the center of the shallow depression, the red-robed warrior’s bald head was deeply embedded inside the wall!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe bald head was already completely sticking to the crude rock surface. Meanwhile, what was separating the bald head and the rock was that Herkula’s wolf head, currently already turned into a mixture of crushed bones and bodily fluids, this mixture trickling down between the cracks in the rock.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe heavy blow left even the red-robed warrior a bit dizzy.

Under the dark red lightning, the red-robed warrior and Herkula’s shadows on the walls and floor were occasionally blurry, occasionally clear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe red-robed warrior’s familiar and heavy growl sounded again.

The wolf figure at the end of the fist was sent flying, the part of its body that was struck twisting at an unnatural angle from the rest of its body. However, another Herkula immediately threw itself over, almost hanging from the warrior’s arm, blood immediately spraying all over the wall! The Herkula crushed the red-robed warrior under them again, the one that was sent flying flipping over its body, limped over to the rest of the pack. Then, after shaking a bit, it leapt out, landing on the highest point of the wolf pack.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOn the corridor walls, the shadows were changing violently. The warrior stood up again and again from the wolf pack, using either his head, fists, knees, or legs to send Herkula flying one by one. Each time he erupted with might, a new blast of bloody mist would be applied to the walls. However, those Herkula that were struck flying possessed exceptionally tenacious vitality, crawling back again and again, throwing themselves at the warrior’s body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the corridor, the red-robed warrior roared, gasps for breath mixed with sounds of flesh being struck heavily, within the noise mixed all types of endless\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eqi qi sa sa\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;sounds of teeth, claws, and bone grinding sounds. The corridor was shaking as well, the walls, ground, and even roof had new heavy fist impacts and claw marks continuously added to them.
