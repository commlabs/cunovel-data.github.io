She and Bonnie had discussed everything that was going on, from the mysterious appearance of Celia\u0027s and Meredith\u0027s names to Margaret\u0027s upcoming dance recital. But she hadn\u0027t been able to bring up what she had real y cal ed to talk about. She sighed. After a moment, she felt under her mattress and pul ed out her velvet-covered journal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Diary,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis afternoon, I talked with Caleb Smallwood on the front lawn of my house. I barely know him, yet I feel this visceral connection with him. I love Bonnie and Meredith more than life itself, but they have no idea what it\u0027s like to lose your parents, and that puts a space between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see myself in Caleb. He\u0027s so handsome and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseems so carefree. I\u0027m sure most people think his life is perfect. I know what it\u0027s like to pretend to have it together, even when you\u0027re coming apart. It can be the loneliest thing in the world. I hope he has a Bonnie or a Meredith of his own, a friend he can lean on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strangest thing happened while we were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etalking. A crow flew straight at us. It was a big crow, one of the biggest I\u0027ve ever seen, with iridescent black feathers that shone in the sun and a huge hooked beak and claws. It might have been the same one that appeared on my windowsill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyesterday morning, but I wasn\u0027t sure. Who can tell crows apart?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, both the crows reminded me of Damon, who watched me as a crow before we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s strange - ridiculous, really - is this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edawning feeling of hope I have deep inside me. What if, I keep thinking, what if somehow Damon\u0027s not dead after all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the hope collapses, because he is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edead, and I need to face that. If I want to stay strong I can\u0027t lie to myself. I can\u0027t make up pretty fairy tales where the noble vampire doesn\u0027t die, where the rules get changed because it\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomeone I care about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that hope comes sneaking up on me again: What if?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be too cruel to say anything about the crow to Stefan. His grief has changed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, when he\u0027s quiet, I catch a strange look in his leaf green eyes, like there\u0027s someone I don\u0027t know in there. And I know he\u0027s thinking of Damon, thoughts that take him somewhere I can\u0027t follow anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I could tell Bonnie about the crow. She cared about Damon, and she wouldn\u0027t laugh at me for wondering whether there were some way he might still, in some form, be alive. Not after she suggested the very same thing earlier today. At the last minute, though, I couldn\u0027t talk to her about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know why, and it\u0027s a lousy, selfish, stupid reason: I\u0027m jealous of Bonnie. Because Damon saved her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwful, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0027s the thing: For a long time, out of millions, there was one human Damon cared about. Only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone. And that one person was me. Everyone else could go to hell as far as he was concerned. He could barely remember my friends\u0027 names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something changed between Damon and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie, maybe when they were alone in the Dark Dimension together, maybe earlier. She\u0027s always had a little crush on him, when he wasn\u0027t being cruel, but then he started to take notice of his little redbird. He watched her. He was tender with her. And when she was in danger, he moved to save her without a second thought as to what it might cost him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0027m jealous. Because Damon saved\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m a terrible person. But, because I am so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eterrible, I don\u0027t want to share any more of Damon with Bonnie, not even my thoughts about the crow. I want to keep part of him just for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena reread what she had written, her lips pressed tightly together. She wasn\u0027t proud of her feelings, but she couldn\u0027t deny they existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned back on her pil ow. It had been a long, exhausting day, and now it was one o\u0027clock in the morning. She\u0027d said good night to Aunt Judith and Robert a couple of hours ago, but she didn\u0027t seem to be able to make it into bed. She\u0027d just puttered around after changing into her nightdress: brushing her hair, rearranging some of her possessions, flipping through a magazine, looking with satisfaction at the fashionable wardrobe she hadn\u0027t had access to in months. Cal ing Bonnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie had sounded odd. Distracted, maybe. Or perhaps just tired. It was late, after al .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena was tired, too, but she didn\u0027t want to go to sleep. She final y admitted it to herself: She was a little afraid to go to sleep. Damon had been so real in her dream the other night. His body had felt firm and solid as she held him; his silky black hair had been soft against her cheek. His smooth voice had sounded sarcastic, seductive, and commanding by turns, just like the living Damon\u0027s. When she had remembered, with a sickening horror, that he was gone, it had been as if he had died al over again. But she couldn\u0027t stay awake forever. She was so tired. Elena switched off the light and closed her eyes. She was sitting on the creaky old bleachers in the school gym. The air smel ed of sweaty athletic shoes and the polish they used on the wooden floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is where we met,\" said Damon, who she now realized was sitting beside her, so close the sleeve of his leather jacket brushed her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Romantic,\" Elena replied, raising one eyebrow and looking around the big empty room, the basketbal hoops hanging at each end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I try,\" Damon said, a tinge of a laugh coloring his dry voice. \"But you chose where we are. It\u0027s your dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it a dream?\" Elena asked suddenly, turning to study his face. \"It doesn\u0027t feel like one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wel ,\" he said, \"let me put it this way. We\u0027re not actual y here.\" His face was serious and intent as he gazed back at her, but then he flashed one of his sudden, bril iant smiles and his eyes slid away. \"I\u0027m glad we didn\u0027t have gymnasiums like this when I did my studies,\" he said casual y, stretching out his legs in front of him. \"It seems so undignified, with the shorts and the rubber bal s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan said that you played sports then, though,\" Elena said, distracted despite herself. Damon frowned at Stefan\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" she said hastily. \"We might not have much time. Please, Damon, please, you said you\u0027re not here, but are you anywhere? Are you al right? Even if you\u0027re dead... I mean real y dead, dead for good, are you somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her sharply. His mouth twisted a little as he said, \"Does it matter that much to you, princess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it does,\" Elena said, shocked. Her eyes were fil ing with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone was light, but his eyes, so black she couldn\u0027t tel where the iris ended and the pupil began, were watchful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone else - al your friends - this town - they\u0027re al okay, though, aren\u0027t they? You have your world back. There are such things as col ateral damages you have to expect if you\u0027re going to get what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena could tel from Damon\u0027s expression that what she said next would matter dreadful y. And, in her heart of hearts, hadn\u0027t she admitted to herself the other day that, as much as she loved Damon, things were better now, that everything could be good again with the town saved and her returned to her old life? And that she wanted it that way, even if it meant Damon was dead? That Damon was what he said: collateral damage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Damon,\" she said at last, helplessly. \"I just miss you so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon\u0027s face softened and he reached for her. \"Elena\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" Elena murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena?\" A hand was gently shaking her. \"Elena?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone stroked her hair, and Elena nuzzled sleepily into the touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damon?\" she said, stil half dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand paused in its stroking and then withdrew. She opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just me, I\u0027m afraid,\" said Stefan. He was sitting next to her on her bed, his mouth a straight, tight line, his eyes averted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Stefan,\" said Elena, sitting up and throwing her arms around him. \"I didn\u0027t mean - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s al right,\" Stefan said flatly, turning away from her. \"I know what he meant to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena pul ed him toward her and looked up into his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan. Stefan.\" His green eyes had a distant expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said pleadingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have nothing to apologize for, Elena,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan, I was dreaming about Damon,\" she confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, Damon was important to me, and I... miss him.\" A muscle twitched at the side of Stefan\u0027s face, and she stroked his jaw. \"I wil never love anyone more than I love you, Stefan. It would be impossible. Stefan,\" she said, feeling like she might cry, \"you\u0027re my true love, you know that.\" If only she could reach out and show him with her mind, make him understand what she felt for him. She\u0027d never ful y explored her other Powers, never ful y claimed them, but losing their telepathic connection felt like it might kil her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan\u0027s expression softened. \"Oh, Elena,\" he said slowly, and wrapped his arms around her. \"I miss Damon, too.\" He buried his face in her hair and his next words were muffled. \"I\u0027ve spent hundreds of years fighting with my only brother, with us hating each other. We killed each other when we were human, and I don\u0027t think either of us ever got over the guilt and the shock, the horror of that moment.\" She felt a long shudder go through his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, a soft, sad sound. \"And when we final y started to find our way back to being brothers again, it was al because of you.\" His forehead stil resting on her shoulder, Stefan took Elena\u0027s hand and held it between both of his, turning it over and stroking it as he thought. \"He died so suddenly. I guess I never expected... I never expected Damon to die before I did. He was always the strong one, the one who truly loved life. I feel...\" He smiled a little, just a sad twist of his lips. \"I feel... surprisingly lonely without him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena entwined her fingers with Stefan\u0027s and held his hand tightly. He turned his face toward hers, meeting her eyes, and she pul ed back a little so she could see him more clearly. There was pain in his eyes, and grief, but there was also a hardness she had never seen there before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed him, trying to erase that hard edge. He resisted her for half a second, and then he kissed her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Elena,\" he said thickly, and kissed her again. As the kiss deepened, Elena felt a sweet, satisfying sense of rightness sweep through her. It was always like this: If she felt distanced from Stefan, the touch of their lips could unite them. She felt a wave of love and wonder from him, and held on to it, feeding the emotion back to him, the tenderness between them growing. With her Powers gone, she needed this more than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out with her mind and emotions, past the tenderness, past the rock-solid love that was always waiting for her in Stefan\u0027s kiss, and delved deeper into his mind. There was a fierce passion there, and she returned it, their emotions twining together, as their hands held each other harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the passion, there was grief, a terrible, endless grief, and farther stil , buried in the depths of Stefan\u0027s emotions, was an aching loneliness, the loneliness of a man who had lived for centuries without companionship. And in that loneliness was the taste of something unfamiliar. Something... unyielding and cold and faintly metal ic, as if she had bitten into foil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something Stefan was holding back from her. Elena was sure of it, and she reached deeper into his mind as their kisses intensified. She needed al of him... She started to pul back her hair, to offer him her blood. That always brought them as close as they could possibly be. But before he could accept her offer, there was a sudden knock on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost immediately it opened and Aunt Judith peeked in. Elena, blinking, found herself alone, her palms stinging from the speed with which Stefan had pul ed away from her. She looked around hastily, but he\u0027d vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breakfast is on the table, Elena,\" Aunt Judith said cheerful y.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" Elena said, distracted, peering at the closet, wondering where Stefan had hidden himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you al right, dear?\" her aunt said, her forehead creased with concern. Elena had a sudden picture of how she must look: wide-eyed, flushed, and disheveled, sitting in her rumpled bed and looking wildly around the room. It had been a long time since Stefan had needed to use his vampiric speed for anything as mundane as not getting caught in her bedroom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave Aunt Judith a reassuring smile. \"Sorry, I\u0027m stil half-asleep. I\u0027l be right down,\" she said. \"I\u0027d better hurry. Stefan wil be here to pick me up soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Aunt Judith left the room, Elena final y caught sight of Stefan, waving from the lawn below her open window, and she waved back, laughing, the strange emotions at the bottom of Stefan\u0027s mind put aside for the moment. He gestured that he was going around to the front of the house and that he would see her in a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed again and jumped up to get ready for the picnic at Hot Springs. It was nice to be the kind of girl who worried about getting grounded. It felt... pleasurably normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, as Elena, now dressed in shorts and a light blue T-shirt, her hair pul ed back in a ponytail, headed down the stairs, the doorbel rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027l be Stefan,\" she cal ed as Aunt Judith appeared in the kitchen doorway. Elena grabbed her beach bag and picnic cooler from the bench in the hal .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena!\" Aunt Judith scolded. \"You have to eat something before you go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No time,\" Elena said, smiling at the familiarity of the argument. \"I\u0027l grab a muffin or something on the way.\" She and Aunt Judith had exchanged these words, or similar ones, most mornings of Elena\u0027s years in high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Elena,\" Aunt Judith said, rol ing her eyes. \"Don\u0027t move, young lady. I\u0027l be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena opened the door and smiled up into Stefan\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, hel o there, stranger,\" she said softly. He kissed her, a sweet touch of his lips on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Judith hurried back into the hal way and pressed a granola bar into Elena\u0027s hand. \"There,\" she said. \"At least you\u0027l have something in your stomach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena gave her a quick hug. \"Thank you, Aunt Judith,\" she said. \"I\u0027l see you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have fun, but please don\u0027t forget Margaret\u0027s dance recital tonight,\" Aunt Judith said. \"She\u0027s so excited about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Judith waved good-bye from the doorway as Elena and Stefan strol ed toward the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re meeting the others at the boardinghouse and caravanning to Hot Springs,\" Stefan said. \"Matt and Meredith are both bringing their cars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, good, we won\u0027t be as crowded as we were yesterday. Not that I minded sitting on your lap, but I thought I might squish Celia in the middle,\" Elena said. She turned her face up and stretched like a cat in the sunshine. A breeze tossed her ponytail, and she closed her eyes and enjoyed the sensation. \"It\u0027s a gorgeous day for a picnic,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said. The world was alive with birdsong and with the rustle of trees. A faint tracery of white clouds underscored the bright blue of the sky. \"Would it be jinxing ourselves to say it feels like the kind of day where nothing could go wrong?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it absolutely would be jinxing ourselves to say that,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan said, straight-faced, unlocking the passenger-side door for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I won\u0027t say it,\" Elena said. \"I won\u0027t even think it. But I feel good. I haven\u0027t been to Hot Springs for ages.\" She grinned with pure pleasure, and Stefan smiled back at her, but Elena was struck once again by that certain something new - something troubling - in his eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-phantom-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-11.html","bookId":2066,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:16:26 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:16:26 AM"}
