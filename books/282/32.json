JIM SCOTT.","content":"\u0026nbsp;By advice of Mr. Bradford, Paul selected the Chicago, Rock Island, Pacific route to Omaha, where he took passage on the union Pacific road as far as Cheyenne, in the southern part of Wyoming, known as the \"Magic City of the Plains.\" He was very much interested in what he saw from the car windows as he rolled over the prairies of Illinois and the fertile plains of Iowa. He gazed eagerly at the Mississippi River, of which he had heard so much, and was somewhat disappointed to find it so narrow at the point of crossing. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On again from Omaha, five hundred miles and over, till the train halted at Cheyenne, and he got out at the station.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he stood on the platform, while the train went on, he was accosted by a roughly dressed man, who might be a miner to judge from his slouch hat, his loose-fitting clothes, and his long and rather ragged-looking beard, which seemed a stranger both to razor and scissors.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 227]\"Goin\u0027 to stop here, young man?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall stop over to-night, I think,\" answered Paul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And to-morrow I reckon you go to the Hills?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is my intention,\" said Paul, guardedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know but I\u0027ll go there myself, though I did calculate to stay here, or hereabouts, for a time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you ever been to the mines?\" asked Paul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have I ever been there? Well, I should smile,\" answered the stranger, expectorating profusely. \"Why, I own a hotel in Custer City. I left my cousin in charge, while I made a run down here to learn the fashions.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This he said with a grim smile, and a glance at his rough attire\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you found them?\" asked Paul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I haven\u0027t followed \u0027em. Where might you be from, youngster?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"From Chicago.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I was there once, long ago, but I drifted on to California, and lived there up among the mountains for seven or eight years. Somehow I didn\u0027t get rich. But, one day, I heard of the Black Hills, and dusted for \u0027em.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope good luck came to you there,\" said Paul, politely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You bet it did. Why, youngster, rough as I look,[Pg 228] I consider myself worth to-day from fifty to a hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul looked at his new acquaintance with respect as a successful man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is a good deal of money,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So it is. Sometimes I wake up and forget that I\u0027m rich. Seems to me I\u0027m the same shiftless vagabond that lived for years among the California mountains, but there\u0027s a heap of satisfaction in findin\u0027 I\u0027m mistaken.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So I should think.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And what\u0027s more, I don\u0027t mean to gamble away my pile, as most miners do. I\u0027m gettin\u0027 on in life, and I can\u0027t afford it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is where you are sensible,\" said Paul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And now, youngster, if I may be so bold, what\u0027s your name?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Paul Palmer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That sounds like a story name.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But it\u0027s my real name, for all that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you expect to make your fortune out there?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know. I hope to find something to do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re pretty young to be travelin\u0027 alone.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; I am only sixteen.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you got money enough to keep you along till you get something to do?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think I can get along.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 229]\"If you get into any trouble, just call on Jim Scott—that\u0027s me—and I\u0027ll see you through.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Scott, I am very much obliged to you for such a kind offer to a stranger.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Scott? Oh, you mean me! I\u0027d rather you\u0027d call me Jim—it comes more natural.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I say, thank you, Jim,\" said Paul, offering his hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" said Mr. Scott, in a tone of satisfaction. \"Now come round to the hotel, and I\u0027ll put you up to a wrinkle or two, and we\u0027ll talk over our trip to Custer City.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you are going, too?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, if you don\u0027t mind my company.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall be glad to have the benefit of your experience.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul knew that it behooved him to avoid sudden acquaintanceships, but there was something in Mr. Scott\u0027s manner, rough as his appearance was, that inspired confidence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83103.html","bookId":282,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:53 AM"}
