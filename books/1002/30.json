She was under the blanket inthe morning when Rasheed poked his head in and said hewas going to the barber. She was still in bed when he camehome late in the afternoon, when he showed her his newhaircut, his new used suit, blue with cream pinstripes, and thewedding band he\u0027d bought her.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rasheed sat on the bed beside her, made a great show ofslowly undoing the ribbon, of opening the box and plucking outthe ring delicately. He let on that he\u0027d traded in Mariam\u0027s oldwedding ring for it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"She doesn\u0027t care. Believe me. She won\u0027t even notice.\"Laila pulled away to the far end of the bed. She could hearMariam downstairs, the hissing of her iron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"She never wore it anyway,\" Rasheed said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t want it,\" Laila said, weakly. \"Not like this. You haveto take it back.\"\"Take it back?\" An impatient look flashed across his face andwas gone. He smiled. \"I had to add some cash too-quite a lot,in fact. This is a better ring, twenty-two-karat gold. Feel howheavy? Go on, feel it. No?\" He closed the box. \"How aboutflowers? That would be nice. You like flowers? Do you have afavorite? Daisies?\n\u003cbr\u003e Tulips? Lilacs? No flowers? Good! I don\u0027t see the point myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e I just thought…Now, I know a tailor here in Deh-Mazang. Iwas thinking we could take you there tomorrow, get you fittedfor a proper dress.\"Laila shook her head.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rasheed raised his eyebrows.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027d just as soon-\" Laila began.\n\u003cbr\u003e He put a hand on her neck. Laila couldn\u0027t help wincing andrecoiling. His touch felt like wearing a prickly old wet woolsweater with no undershirt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes?\"\"I\u0027d just as soon we get it done.\"Rasheed\u0027s mouth opened, then spread in a yellow, toothy grin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Eager,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *Before Abdul Sharif\u0027s visit, Laila had decided to leave forPakistan. Even after Abdul Sharif came bearing his news, Lailathought now, she might have left. Gone somewhere far fromhere. Detached herself from this city where every street cornerwas a trap, where every alley hid a ghost that sprang at herlike a jack-in-the-box. She might have taken the risk.\n\u003cbr\u003e But, suddenly, leaving was no longer an option.\n\u003cbr\u003e Not with this daily retching.\n\u003cbr\u003e This new fullness in her breasts.\n\u003cbr\u003e And the awareness, somehow, amid all of this turmoil, thatshe had missed a cycle.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila pictured herself in a refugee camp, a stark field withthousands of sheets of plastic strung to makeshift poles flappingin the cold, stinging wind. Beneath one of these makeshift tents,she saw her baby, Tariq\u0027s baby, its temples wasted, its jawsslack, its skin mottled, bluish gray. She pictured its tiny bodywashed by strangers, wrapped in a tawny shroud, lowered intoa hole dug in a patch of windswept land under thedisappointed gaze of vultures.\n\u003cbr\u003e How could she run now?\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila took grim inventory of the people in her life. Ahmad andNoor, dead. Hasina, gone. Giti, dead. Mammy, dead. Babi, dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e Now Tariq…But, miraculously, something of her former life remained, herlast link to the person that she had been before she hadbecome so utterly alone. A part of Tariq still alive inside her,sprouting tiny arms, growing translucent hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e How could she jeopardize the only thing she had left of him,of her old life?\n\u003cbr\u003e She made her decision quickly. Six weeks had passed sinceher time with Tariq. Any longer and Rasheed would growsuspicious.\n\u003cbr\u003e She knew that what she was doing was dishonorable.\n\u003cbr\u003e Dishonorable, disingenuous, and shameful. And spectacularlyunfair to Mariam. But even though the baby inside her was nobigger than a mulberry, Laila already saw the sacrifices amother had to make. Virtue was only the first.\n\u003cbr\u003e She put a hand on her belly. Closed her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *Laila would remember the muted ceremony in bits andfragments. The cream-colored stripes of Rasheed\u0027s suit. Thesharp smell of his hair spray. The small shaving nick justabove his Adam\u0027s apple. The rough pads of his tobacco-stainedfingers when he slid the ring on her. The pen. Its not working.\n\u003cbr\u003e The search for a new pen. The contract. The signing, hissure-handed, hers quavering. The prayers. Noticing, in themirror, that Rasheed had trimmed his eyebrows.\n\u003cbr\u003e And, somewhere in the room, Mariam watching. The airchoking with her disapproval.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila could not bring herself to meet the older woman\u0027s gaze.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *Lying beneath his cold sheets that night, she watched him pullthe curtains shut. She was shaking even before his fingersworked her shirt buttons, tugged at the drawstring of hertrousers. He was agitated. His fingers fumbled endlessly with hisown shirt, with undoing his belt. Laila had a full view of hissagging breasts, his protruding belly button, the small blue veinin the center of it, the tufts of thick white hair on his chest,his shoulders, and upper arms. She felt his eyes crawling allover her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"God help me, I think I love you,\" he said-Through chatteringteeth, she asked him to turn out the lights.\n\u003cbr\u003e Later, when she was sure that he was asleep, Laila quietlyreached beneath the mattress for the knife she had hiddenthere earlier. With it, she punctured the pad of her indexfinger. Then she lifted the blanket and let her finger bleed onthe sheets where they had lain together.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838/53249.html","bookId":1002,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:36 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:36 AM"}
