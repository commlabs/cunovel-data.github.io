Retreating, Vancha cursed at his loudest and vilest, while the rest of us glanced uneasily at one another, waiting for someone to propose a plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did they sneak up without - us hearing?\" Harkat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We weren\u0027t paying attention to what was happening outside,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even so,\" Harkat insisted, \"we should have - picked up on the sirens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t use sirens,\" Steve laughed. \"They were warned to tread quietly. And, before you waste time checking, they\u0027ve got the rear of the building and roof covered as well as the front.\" As we stared at him questioningly, he said, \"I wasn\u0027t distracted.I heard them coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha bellowed madly at Steve, then made a dive for him. Mr Crepsley stepped into his path to reason with him, but Vancha shoved him aside without regard and charged towards Steve, murder in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice from outside, amplified by a megaphone, stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You in there!\" it bellowed. \"Killers!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha hesitated, fingers balled into fists, then pointed at Steve and snarled, \"Later!\" Spinning, he hurried to the window and nudged the blind aside a fraction. Light from the sun and spotlight flooded the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting the blind fall back into place, Vancha roared, \"Turn off the light!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No chance!\" the person with the megaphone laughed in reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha stood there a moment, thinking, then nodded at Mr Crepsley and Harkat. \"Check the corridors above and below. Find out if they\u0027re inside the building. Don\u0027t clash with them - if that lot outside start firing, they\u0027ll cut us to ribbons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Crepsley and Harkat obeyed without question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring that sorry excuse for a dog over here,\" Vancha said to me, and I dragged Steve to the window. Vancha wrapped a hand around Steve\u0027s throat and growled in his ear, \"Why are they here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They think you\u0027re the killers,\" Steve chuckled. \"The ones who killed all those humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You son of a mongrel!\" Vancha snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" Steve replied smugly. \"Let\u0027s not get personal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Crepsley and Harkat returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re packed tight two floors - above,\" Harkat reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same two floors below,\" Mr Crepsley said grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha cursed again, then thought quickly. \"We\u0027ll break through the floorboards,\" he decided. \"The humans will be in the halls. They won\u0027t expect us to go straight down through the apartments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes they will,\" Steve disagreed. \"They\u0027ve been warned to fill every room below, above and adjoining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha stared at Steve, looking for the slightest hint of a bluff. When he found none, his features softened and the ghostly traces of defeat welled in his eyes. Then he shook his head and put self-pity behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to talk to them,\" he said. \"Find out where we stand and maybe buy some time to think this through. Anyone want to volunteer?\" When nobody replied, he grunted. \"Guess that means I\u0027m the negotiator. Just don\u0027t blame me if it all goes wrong.\" Leaving the blind over the window, he smashed a pane of glass, then leant close and shouted at the humans below. \"Who\u0027s down there and what the hell do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, then the same voice as before spoke to us via a megaphone. \"Who am I talking to?\" the person asked. Now that I concentrated on the voice, I realized it was a woman\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of your business!\" Vancha roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause. Then, \"We know your names. Larten Crepsley, Vancha March, Darren Shan and Harkat Mulds. I just want to know which one of you I\u0027m in contact with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha\u0027s jaw dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve doubled over with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them who you are,\" Harkat whispered. \"They know too much. Best to act like we\u0027re - co-operating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha nodded, then shouted through the covered hole in the window, \"Vancha March.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he did that, I peeked through a gap at the side of the blind, looking for weak points in the defences below. I didn\u0027t find any, but I did get a fix on the woman who was speaking to us - tall and broad, with short white hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, March,\" the woman called as I stepped away from the window. \"I\u0027m Chief Inspector Alice Burgess. I\u0027m running this freak show.\" An ironic choice of words, though none of us commented on it. \"If you want to negotiate a deal, you\u0027ll be negotiating with me. One warning - I\u0027m not here to play games. I\u0027ve more than two hundred men and women out here and inside your building, just dying to put a round of bullets through your black excuse for a heart. At the first sign that you\u0027re messing with us, I\u0027ll give the order and they\u0027ll open fire. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha bared his teeth and snarled, \"I understand.\" Then he repeated it, louder, so she could hear. \"I understand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Chief Inspector Burgess responded. \"First of all - are your hostages alive and unharmed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\"Hostages\u0027?\" Vancha replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steve Leonard and Mark Ryter. We know you have them, so don\u0027t act the innocent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark Ryter must have been the vampet,\" I remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re soooooo observant,\" Steve laughed, then pushed Vancha aside and put his face up close to the window. \"This is Steve Leonard!\" he yelled, mimicking terror. \"They haven\u0027t killed me yet, but they killed Mark. They tortured him first. It was horrible. They?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped, as though we\u0027d cut him off mid-sentence, and stepped back, taking a self-indulgent bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sons of ?\" the officer cursed over the megaphone, then collected her wits and addressed us calmly and dryly. \"OK - this is how it works. Release your remaining hostage. When he\u0027s safely in our custody, come down after him, one at a time. Any sign of a weapon, or any unexpected moves, and you\u0027re history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s talk about this,\" Vancha shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No talking,\" Burgess snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not going to release him,\" Vancha roared. \"You don\u0027t know what he is, what he\u0027s done. Let me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rifle fired and a volley of bullets tore up the outside of the building. We fell to the floor, cursing and yelping, although there was no cause for concern - the marksmen were aiming deliberately high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the scream of bullets died away, the Chief Inspector addressed us again. \"That was a warning - your last. Next time we shoot to kill. No bargaining. No trade-offs. No talking. You\u0027ve terrorized this city for most of a year, but it stops here. You\u0027re through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two minutes,\" she said. \"Then we come in after you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA troubled silence descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s that,\" Harkat muttered after a handful of slow-ticking seconds. \"We\u0027re finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Vancha sighed. Then his gaze fell on Steve and he grinned. \"But we won\u0027t die alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha brought the fingers of his right hand together and held them out straight so they formed a blade of flesh and bone. He raised the hand above his head like a knife and advanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve closed his eyes and waited for death with a smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Mr Crepsley said softly, halting him. \"There is a way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha paused. \"How?\" he asked suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The window,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"We jump. They will not expect that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha considered the plan. \"The drop\u0027s no problem,\" he mused. \"Not for us, anyway. How about you, Harkat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five storeys?\" Harkat smiled. \"I could do that - in my sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what do we do once down there?\" Vancha asked. \"The place is crawling with police and soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We flit,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"I will carry Darren. You carry Harkat. It will not be easy - they might shoot us before we can work up to flitting speed - but it can be done. With luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s crazy,\" Vancha growled, then winked at us. \"I like it!\" He pointed at Steve. \"But we kill him before we leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One minute!\" Alice Burgess shouted through her megaphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve hadn\u0027t moved. His eyes were still closed. He was still smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want Vancha to kill Steve. Although he\u0027d betrayed us, he\u0027d been my friend once, and the thought of him being killed in cold blood disturbed me. Also, there was Debbie to think about - if we killed Steve, R.V. would certainly kill Debbie in retaliation. It was crazy to worry about her, considering the trouble we were in, but I couldn\u0027t helpit .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to ask Vancha to spare Steve\u0027s life - although I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d listen to me - when Mr Crepsley beat me to the punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We cannot kill him,\" he said, sounding disgusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come again?\" Vancha blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not the end of the world if we are captured,\" Mr Crepsley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty seconds!\" Burgess screamed tensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Crepsley ignored the interruption. \"If we are captured and taken alive, there may be chances to escape later. But if we kill Steve Leonard, I do not think they will spare us. These humans are ready to butcher us at the drop of a pin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha shook his head uncertainly. \"I don\u0027t like it. I\u0027d rather kill him and take our chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would too,\" Mr Crepsley agreed. \"But there is the Vampaneze Lord to consider. We must put the hunt before our personal wishes. Sparing Steve Leonard is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten seconds.\" Burgess bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha glowered over Steve a few seconds more, undecided, then cursed, twisted his hand, and whacked him over the back of the head with the flat of his palm. Steve toppled to the floor. I thought Vancha had killed him, but the Prince had only knocked him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That should shut him up for a while,\" Vancha grunted, checking his shuriken belts and wrapping his animal hides tight around him. \"If we get the chance later, we\u0027ll track him down and finish him off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time\u0027s up!\" Alice Burgess warned us. \"Come out immediately or we open fire!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\" Vancha asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready,\" Mr Crepsley said, drawing his knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready,\" Harkat said, testing the head of his axe with a large, grey finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready,\" I said, taking out my sword and holding it across my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harkat jumps with me,\" Vancha said. \"Larten and Darren - you come next. Give us a second or two to roll out of your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luck, Vancha,\" Mr Crepsley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luck,\" Vancha replied, then grinned savagely, slapped Harkat on the back, and leapt through the window, shattering the blind and glass, Harkat not far behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Crepsley and I waited the agreed seconds, then jumped through the jagged remains of the window after our friends, and dropped swiftly to the ground like a couple of wingless bats, into the hellish cauldron which awaited us below. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killers-of-the-dawn-the-saga-of-darren-shan-9/page-3.html","bookId":2445,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:45 PM"}
