Gladstone himself observed: \"There is often, in the course of this wayward and bewildered life, exterior opposition, and sincere and even violent condemnation, between persons and bodies who are nevertheless profoundly associated by ties and relations that they know not of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most famous example of this, and one well-recognized by Victorians, was the bitter rivalry between the temperance societies and the pubs. These two institutions in fact served similar ends, and ultimately were seen to adopt the same attractions: the pubs acquired organs, hymn singing, and soft drinks, and the temperance meetings had professional entertainers and a new, raucous liveliness. By the time the temperance groups began buying pubs in order to turn them dry, the intermixture of these two hostile forces became pronounced indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictorians also witnessed another rivalry, centering around a new social institution--- the organized police force. Almost immediately, the new force began to form relationships with its avowed enemy, the criminal class. These relationships were much debated in the nineteenth century, and they continue to be debated to the present day. The similarity in methods of police and criminals, as well as the fact that many policemen were former criminals--- and the reverse--- were features not overlooked by thinkers of the day. And it was also noted by Sir James Wheatstone that there was a logical problem inherent in a law-enforcement institution, \"for, should the police actually succeed in eliminating all crime, they will simultaneously succeed in eliminating themselves as a necessary adjunct to society, and no organized force or power will ever eliminate itself willingly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn London, the Metropolitan Police, founded by Sir Robert Peel in 1829, was headquartered in a district known as Scotland Yard. Scotland Yard was originally, a geographical term, denoting an area of Whitehall that contained many government buildings. These buildings included the official residence of the surveyor of works to the crown, which was occupied by Inigo Jones, and later by Sir Christopher Wren. John Milton lived in Scotland Yard when he was working for Oliver Cromwell from 1649 to 1651, and it is apparently from this association that a slang reference for police, two hundred years later, was \"miltonian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Sir Robert Peel located the new Metropolitan Police in Whitehall, the correct address, for the headquarters was No. 4 Whitehall Place, but the police station there had an entrance from Scotland Yard proper, and the press always referred to the police as Scotland Yard, until the term became synonymous with the force itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScotland Yard grew rapidly in its early years; in 1829 the total force was 1,000, but a decade later it was 3,350, and by 1850 it was more than 6,000, and would increase to 10,000 by 1870. The task of the Yard was extraordinary: it was called upon to policy crime in an area of nearly seven hundred square miles, containing a population of two and a half million people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the beginning, the Yard adopted a posture of deference and modesty in its manner of solving crimes; the official explanations always mentioned lucky breaks of one sort or another--- an anonymous informant, a jealous mistress, a surprise encounter--- to a degree that was hard to believe. In fact, the Yard employed informers and plainclothesmen, and these agents were the subject of heated debate for the now familiar reason that many in the public feared that an agent might easily provoke a crime and then arrest the participants. Entrapment was a hot political issue of the day, and the Yard was at pains to defend itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1855, the principal figure in the Yard was Richard Mayne, \"a sensible lawyer,\" who had done much to improve the public attitude toward the Metropolitan Police. Directly under him was Mr. Edward Harranby, and it was Harranby who oversaw the ticklish business of working with undercover agents and informers. Usually Mr. Harranby kept irregular hours; he avoided contact with the press, and from his office could be seen strange figures coming and going, often at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the late afternoon of May 17th, Harranby lead a conversation with his assistant, Mr. Jonathan Sharp. Mr. Harranby reconstructed the conversation in his memoirs, Days on the Force, published in 1879. The conversation must be taken with some reservations, for in that volume Harranby was attempting to explain why he did not succeed in thwarting Pierce\u0027s robbery plans before they were carried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharp said to him, \"The snakesman blew, and we have had a look at our man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What sort is he?\" Harranby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He appears a gentleman. Probably a cracksman or a swell mobsman. The snakesman says he\u0027s from Manchester, but he lives in a fine house in London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he know where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says he\u0027s been there, but he doesn\u0027t know the exact location. Somewhere in Mayfair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t go knocking on doors in Mayfair,\" Harranby said. \"Can we assist his powers of memory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharp sighed. \"Possibly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring him in. I\u0027ll have a talk with him. Do we know the intended crime?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharp shook his head. \"The snakesman says he doesn\u0027t know. He\u0027s afraid of being mizzled, you know, he\u0027s reluctant to blow all he knows. He says this fellow\u0027s planning a flash pull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarranby turned irritable. \"That is of remarkably little value to me,\" he said. \"What, exactly, is the crime? There\u0027s our question, and it begs a proper answer. Who is on this gentleman now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cramer and Benton, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re good men. Keep them on his trail, and let\u0027s have the nose in my office, and quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see to it myself, sir,\" the assistant said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarranby later wrote in his memoirs: \"There are times in any professional\u0027s life when the elements requisite for the deductive process seem almost within one\u0027s grasp, and yet they elude the touch. These are the times of greatest frustration, and such was the case of the Robbery of 1855.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 34 The Nose Is Crapped\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClean Willy, very nervous, was drinking at the Hound\u0027s Tooth pub. He left there about six and headed straight for the Holy Land. He moved swiftly through the evening crowds, then ducked into an alley; he jumped a fence, slipped into a basement, crossed it, crawled through a passage into an adjoining building, climbed up the stairs, came out onto a narrow street, walked half a block, and disappeared into another house, a reeking nethersken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere he ascended the stairs to the second floor, climbed out onto the roof, jumped to an adjacent roof, scrambled up a drainpipe to the third floor of a lodging house, crawled in through a window, and went down the stairs to the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce in the basement, he crawled through a tunnel that brought him out on the opposite side of the street, where he came up into a narrow mews. By a side door, he entered a pub house, the Golden Arms, looked around, and exited from the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the end of the street, and then turned in to the entrance of another lodging house. Immediately he knew that something was wrong; normally there were children yelling and scrambling all over the stairs, but now the entrance and stairs were deserted silent. He paused at the doorway, and was just about to turn and flee when a rope snaked out and twisted around his neck, yanking him into a dark corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClean Willy had a look at Barlow, with the white scar across his forehead, as Barlow strained on the garrotting rope. Willy coughed, and struggled, but Barlow\u0027s strength was such that the little snakesman was literally lifted off the floor, his feet kicking in the air, his hands pulling at the rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis struggle continued for the better part of a minute, and then Clean Willy\u0027s face was blue, and his tongue protruded gray, and his eyes bulged. He urinated down his pants leg, and then his body sagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarlow let him drop to the floor. He unwound the rope from his neck, removed the two five-pound notes from the snakesman\u0027s pocket, and slipped away into the street. Clean Willy\u0027s body lay huddled in a corner and did not move. Many minutes passed before the first of the children reemerged, and approached the corpse cautiously. Then the children stole the snakesman\u0027s shoes, and all his clothing, and scampered away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-25.html","bookId":2678,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:35 AM"}
