I think I mightbe hearing her voice for a long time to come.\n\u003cbr\u003e He’s at the bottom of the stairs by the time I getback to the house. He’s watching me, blinking,bleary-eyed, struggling out of sleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e “What’s going on?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Nothing,” I say, but I can hear the tremor in myvoice.\n\u003cbr\u003e “What were you doing outside?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I thought I heard someone,” I tell him. “Somethingwoke me. I couldn’t get back to sleep.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “The phone rang,” he says, rubbing his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e I clasp my hands together to stop them shaking.\n\u003cbr\u003e “What?
