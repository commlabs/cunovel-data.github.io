Right in. Slid her palms up his chest and snuggled her body into his. She tipped her head back and smiled at him. “Hey, roomie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked so good and her sexy little body felt so good against his that he bent down and touched his lips to hers. She tasted like lemons and smelled like heaven. “Hey, yourself. Fancy meeting you here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joely picked me up for a few cocktails. I was about to order coffee to sober up before the ride home. Then I saw you and thought I’d ask if you wanna give me a ride?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d like to ride you like you wouldn’t believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I wouldn’t want to tear you away from anything…pressing.” Keeping her eyes on his, she pressed her pelvis into his, adding a tiny grind of her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin instantly went hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Rielle wasn’t done. She dug her fingers into the back of his neck and pulled him closer to whisper in his ear. “Are you avoiding me after the other night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought maybe you were since I might’ve come across a teensy bit of a lousy lay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze. “What? God no, Ree, I’m the one—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But here’s the secret I tried to keep from you. Why I might’ve seemed so motionless and quiet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You made me come so hard, so fast that I forgot how to breathe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin curled his hands on the side of her face and tilted her head back. “How much have you had to drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough to give me the courage to talk to you but not enough to make me forget what I want to say,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want to say to me, Rielle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want more of you. More of us. But naked this time. I wanna feel your hands on me. I wanna feel your mouth on me. God, Gavin, I’m dying to feel every inch of your body rubbing on mine. Like at least four times tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus fucking Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you have to say to that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re leaving. Right. Now.” Gavin didn’t even finish his drink. He grabbed her hand and towed her out of the bar. He didn’t stop moving until he reached his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he pressed her against the passenger’s side door and slammed his mouth down on hers. Taking the kiss that he’d wanted for two damn days. Pouring passion into it. Licking and sucking and biting at her succulent mouth, then easing off. Stroking her tongue with his. Pulling back a fraction of an inch, feeling her stuttered breaths as he teased her with a soft, barely-there glide of his lips. “Ree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t stop kissing me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll kiss you all you want, just not here. Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. “Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But Sierra—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is staying over at Marin’s tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” She smiled. “So we have the house to ourselves?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All night.” He dropped another kiss on her mouth. “Get in the fucking car before I throw you on the hood and fuck you right now and prove to you that you’re nowhere close to a bad lay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle got in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin was giving himself a stern talk about being a man and lasting longer than one goddamn minute this time, when Rielle grabbed his right hand and shoved it between her legs. “What are you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get me off. Please.” She rubbed the side of her face on his arm and squeezed her thighs together. “I’m wet. Just from that damn kiss. Stick your hand in and see for yourself what you do to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first thought was to tell her to keep her pants on; it’d wait until they got home. His second thought was, what the fuck was wrong with him? Rielle was begging him to touch her. No woman had ever begged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was fucking hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe briefly took his focus off the road. “Take your jeans off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened. Then she released a little moan and unbuttoned and unzipped her jeans. She shimmied the denim down her legs, revealing a tiny pair of pink panties. So unexpectedly girly. So unbelievably sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Gavin glanced up, he saw he’d drifted clear into the other lane. This was too damn dangerous. He pulled onto the shoulder and cut the headlights. The lights from the instrument panel cast a golden glow over her half-naked body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gavin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unbuckled and leaned over to run his fingertip over the lace band stretching between her hips. “I want to see you. All of you. Off. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle didn’t hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis being in charge was heady stuff. “Lower the seat. Top button on the side. That’s it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer teeth were digging into her lower lip; those beautiful pale eyes didn’t venture from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin caught her scent; sweet honey. Like her hair, like her skin, like her mouth. He ran his index finger up and down her slit. “You are wet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What should I do about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touch me. Make me come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With my hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or…” He swirled just the tip of his finger over her clit, backing off when her hips bucked up. “Maybe I should make you get yourself off and I should watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could almost feel the heat from the way her body flushed. So she had no problem being naked from the waist down, but masturbation made her tense. Gavin didn’t blame her. Had the situation been reversed, his face would be cherry red if she demanded he whip out his cock and stroke it until he came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or…I could get you off with my mouth.” He brushed his lips over hers after he heard her swift intake of breath. “Put one foot on the door and one foot on the console. Spread your legs as wide as you can. That’s good. Now slide up. That’s perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer ass was a little more than halfway up the back of the seat, which put her pussy within range. He leaned across the console, biting back a wince at the painful position of his cock. He breathed her in. Flicked her clit with his tongue. Just one time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he gave her one thorough lick, getting his first complete taste of her. Goddamn, she tasted so fucking sweet. He could suck up her cream all night. He worked her with his tongue, lips and teeth. Losing his mind in the fact that he was going down on Rielle, in his Lexus, on the side of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh God.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe traced her hot folds with his tongue, top to bottom. He drew lazy circles, broad circles, stilling her hips with a firm push of his hands when she tried to grind upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gavin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm-hmm?” he answered, the sound vibrating against her blood-engorged tissues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer whole body quivered. “Please. I can’t take any more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the words, “Hold on,” rumble from his mouth in an animal-like growl. He grabbed her left ankle and swung her body around, almost clipping himself in the head with her heel as he wrapped her leg around the back of his seat. Slipping his hands under her butt, he pulled her closer and buried his mouth in her juicy sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped when he wiggled his tongue inside her opening. After a few fast flicks over her clit, Gavin enclosed that swollen flesh between his lips and sucked hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle exploded. She clamped her hands over his ears and wrapped her right leg around his shoulder, holding him in place while she came in violent waves against his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin watched pleasure overtake her. It was one of the hottest experiences of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finally went limp, he released his hold. He nipped the inside of her thigh, earning a sharp, surprised yip from her. Although his cock was smashed against his belly and constricted by his jeans, he took a second to burn the image into his brain. Beautiful, sated woman sprawled in front of him, bared to him fully, breathing hard and peering at him from beneath lowered lashes. He unhooked her leg from his seat, kissed the outside of her ankle and swiveled her around to face forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did the same. Then he smiled at her as she just sat there, unmoving, sort of stunned. “You getting dressed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Right. Although, I’m pretty sure I won’t be wearing these clothes long when we get home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’d be a sure bet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin kept hold of Rielle’s hand on the drive home. Stroking his thumb on the inside of her wrist. Moving his palm up and down to rub the tips of his fingers between the webbing of hers. Then he brought her knuckles to his mouth. Kissing and nipping, drawing the backside of her hand across his goatee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle broke their handhold and twisted in her seat, rising on her knees. Leaning over the console, she placed her lips on his ear and said, “You always smell good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you keep that up I’ll wreck the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you’d wreck if I put my hand on your crotch. You can handle this, Gavin.” She rubbed the side of her face over his. Her mouth would randomly connect with his cheek, the spot below his earlobe, the shell of his ear, his temple, above his eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sweet nuzzles and soft kisses fired his blood. It was damn hard not to close his eyes and just enjoy her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the turnoff was within view. “Rielle, honey, sit. I don’t want you to go flying when I take the corner on two wheels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a hurry?” she purred in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like you wouldn’t believe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and the soft, seductive sound burned a path through his ear canal straight to his dick. “Me too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin parked in his usual spot. They both scrambled out and met in front of the car. His mouth crashed down, her arms circled his neck and he was lost to the kiss. He’d thought passionate soul kissing was for teens and youngsters, so clearly he’d never experienced that overpowering rush of need to have her lips on his. To feel her tongue stroking and sucking, mouths open to give and receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d intended to clamp his hands on her ass and drag her closer to his body, but instead, he slipped his arm behind her knees and cradled her against his chest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14/page-23.html","bookId":2695,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:57 AM"}
