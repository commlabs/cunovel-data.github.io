It wasn\u0027t cold here, but it was cool. It wasn\u0027t dark, but it was dim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of the constant crimson sunlight from the bloated red sun in the first Dark Dimension, they were walking in a constant dusk. It was unnerving, always looking up for the sky and never seeing the moon - or moons - or the planet - that might well be up there. Rather than sky, there was nothing but tangled tree branches, clearly heavy and so intricately entwined as to take up every bit of space above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she crazy, thinking that maybe they were on that moon, the diamond bright tiny moon that you could see from the outside of the Nether World Gatehouse? Was it too tiny to have an atmosphere? Too smal for proper gravity? She had noticed that she felt lighter here and that even Bonnie\u0027s steps seemed quite long. Could she...? She tensed her legs, let go of Stefan\u0027s hand, and jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a long jump, but it hadn\u0027t taken her anywhere near the canopy of woven branches above. And she didn\u0027t land neatly on her toes, either. Her feet flew out from under her on mil ennia of leaf mold and she skidded on her rear end for maybe three feet, before she could dig her fingers and feet in and stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena! Are you All right?\"She could hear Stefan and Bonnie cal ing from behind her, and a quick, impatient: Are you crazy? from Damon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was trying to figure out where we were by testing the gravity,\"she said, standing up on her own and brushing leaves off the seat of her jeans, mortified. Damn! Those leaves had gone up the back of her T-shirt, had even gotten inside her camisole. The group had left most of their furs behind at the Gatehouse, where Sage could guard them, and Elena didn\u0027t even have spare clothes. That had been stupid, she told herself angrily now. Embarrassed, she tried to walk and shimmy at the same time, to get the crumbled leaves out of her top. Final y she had to say, \"Just a second, everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuys, could you turn around? Bonnie, could you come back here and help me?\"Bonnie was glad to help and Elena was astonished at how long it took to pick gunk away from her own flinching back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext time you want a scientific opinion, try asking, Damon\u0027s scornful telepathy commented. Aloud, he added, \"I\u0027d say it\u0027s about eighty percent Earth\u0027s gravity here and we could well be on a moon. Doesn\u0027t signify. If Sage hadn\u0027t helped us with this compass, we\u0027d never be able to find the tree\u0027s trunk - at least not in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And remember,\"Elena said, \"that the idea that the star bal is near the trunk is just a guess. We have to keep our eyes open!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what should we look for?\"Once, Bonnie would have wailed this. Now she simply asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\"Elena turned to Stefan. \"It wil look bright, won\u0027t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst this horrible half-light?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This horrible camouflage-green half-light,\"Stefan agreed. \"It should look like a slightly shifting bright light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But put it like this,\"Damon said, walking backward graceful y and flashing his old 250-kilowatt smile for a second at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we don\u0027t fol ow Sage\u0027s suggestion, we\u0027l never find the trunk. If we try to wander randomly around this world, we wil never find anything - including our way back. And then not only Fel \u0027s Church, but we wil al die, in this order. First, we two vampires wil break with al civilized behavior, as starvation - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan won\u0027t,\"cried Elena, and Bonnie said, \"You\u0027re just as bad as Shinichi, with his \u0027revelations\u0027about us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon smiled subtly. \"If I were as bad as Shinichi, little redbird, you would already be punctured like an empty juice box - or I would be sitting back with Sage, enjoying Black Magic - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, this is pointless,\"Stefan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon feigned sympathy. \"Maybe you have...problems...in the canine area, but I do not, little brother.\"He deliberately held the smile this time so everyone could see his pointed teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan wouldn\u0027t be baited. \"And it\u0027s holding us up - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong, little brother. Some of us have mastered the art of speaking and walking at the same time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damon - stop it! Just stop!\"Elena said, rubbing her hot forehead with cold fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon shrugged, Stillmoving backward. \"You only had to ask,\"he said, with just the slightest emphasis on the first word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena said nothing in return. She felt feverish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t al just straight walking. Frequently there were huge mounds of knotted roots in their way that had to be climbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes Stefan had to use the axe from his backpack to make footholds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena had come to hate the deep green demi-light more than anything. It played tricks on her eyes, just as the muffled sound of their feet on the leaf-strewn ground played tricks on her ears. Several times she stopped - and once Stefan did - to say, \"There\u0027s someone else here! Fol owing us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach time they had al stopped and listened intently. Stefan and Damon sent telepathic probes of Power as far as they could reach, seeking another mind. But either it was so well disguised as to be invisible or it didn\u0027t exist at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, after Elena felt as if she had been walking her whole life, and would keep walking until eternity ended, Damon stopped abruptly. Bonnie, just behind him, sucked in her breath. Elena and Stefan hurried forward to see what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Elena saw made her say, unsteadily, \"I think maybe we missed the trunk and...found...the edge...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ground in front of her and as far as she could see, was the star-studded darkness of space. But washing out the light of the stars was a huge planet and two huge moons, one swirled blue and white and one silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan was holding her hand, sharing the wonder with her, and tingles ran up her arm and into her suddenly weak knees, just from his feather-light touch on her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Damon said caustical y, \"Look up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena did and gasped. For just an instant her body was completely unmoored. She and Stefan automatical y wound their arms around each other. And then Elena realized what they were seeing, both above and below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s water,\"she said, staring at the pool spread out before them. \"One of those freshwater seas Sage told us about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd not a ripple on it. Not a breath of wind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it does look as if we\u0027re on that smal est moon,\"Stefan said mildly, his eyes deceptively innocent as he looked at Damon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Well, then there\u0027s something exceedingly heavy at the core of this moonlet, to al ow for eight-tenths the gravity we normal y experience, and to hang on to so much atmosphere\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- but who cares about logic? This is a world we reached through the Nether World. Why should logic apply?\"He looked at Elena with slightly narrowed, hooded eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the third one? The grave one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came from behind them - Elena thought. She was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- they al were - turning from looking at bril iant light into half-darkness. Everything shimmered and danced before her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grave Meredith; laughing Bonnie;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Elena with golden hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey whisper and then are silent...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey plot and I no longer care...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I must have Elena,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena with the Golden Hair...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re not going to have me!\"cried Elena. \"And that poem is a complete misquote, anyway. I remember it from freshman English class. And you\u0027re crazy! \"Even through her anger and fear she wondered about Fel \u0027s Church. If Shinichi was here, could he bring about the Last Midnight there? Or could Misao simply set it off with a languid wave?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I will have you, golden Elena,\"the kitsune said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Stefan and Damon had knives out. \"That\u0027s just where you\u0027re wrong, Shinichi,\"Stefan said. \"You wil never, ever touch Elena again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to try. You\u0027ve taken everything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena\u0027s heart was pounding now. If he\u0027l talk sense to any of us, he\u0027l talk to me, she thought. \"Shouldn\u0027t you be getting ready for the Last Midnight, Shinichi?\"she asked in a friendly tone, inwardly trembling in case he should say, \"It\u0027s already over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t need me. She wouldn\u0027t protect Misao. Why should I help Her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Elena couldn\u0027t speak. She? She? Other than Misao, what other She was involved in this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon had a crossbow out now, with a quarrel loaded in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Shinichi just went rambling on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Misao couldn\u0027t move anymore. She had put al her Power into her star bal , you see. She never laughed or sang any longer - never made up any plots with me. She just...sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Final y she asked me to put her into myself. She thought we\u0027d become one that way. So she dissolved and merged right into me. But it didn\u0027t help. Now...I can barely hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve come to get my star bal . I\u0027ve been using its energy to travel through the dimensions. If I put Misao into my star bal , she\u0027l recover. Then I\u0027l hide it again - but not where I left it last. I\u0027l put it farther up where no one else wil ever find it.\"He seemed to focus on his listeners. \"So I guess it\u0027s Misao and I who are talking to you right now. Except that I\u0027m so lonely - I can\u0027t feel her at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wil not touch Elena,\"Stefan said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon was looking grimly at the rest of the group at Shinichi\u0027s words, \"...I\u0027l put it farther up...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, Bonnie, keep moving,\"Stefan added. \"You too, Elena. We\u0027l fol ow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena let Bonnie go some feet ahead before saying telepathical y, We can\u0027t break up, Stefan; there\u0027s only one compass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatch out, Elena! He might hear you! came Stefan\u0027s voice, and Damon added flatly, Shut up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bother tel ing her to shut up,\"Shinichi said. \"You\u0027re mad if you think that I can\u0027t just pick your thoughts right out of your minds. I didn\u0027t think you were that stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not stupid,\"Bonnie said hotly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? Then did you figure out my riddles for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is hardly the time for that,\"Elena snapped. It was a mistake, for it caused Shinichi to focus on her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you tel them what you think about the tragedy of Camelot, Elena? No, I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d have the courage. I\u0027l tel them, then, shal I? I\u0027l read it as you put it in your diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! You can\u0027t have read my diary! Anyway - it\u0027s no longer applicable! \"Elena flared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see...these are your own words now.\"He assumed a reading voice. \u0027Dear Diary, one of Shinichi\u0027s riddles was what I thought of Camelot. You know, the legend of King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, and the knight she loved, Lancelot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here\u0027s what I thought. A lot of innocent people died and were miserable because three selfish people - a king, a queen, and a knight - couldn\u0027t behave in a civilized way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn\u0027t understand that the more you love, the more you find to love. But those three couldn\u0027t give in to love and just share - al three of them...\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\"screamed Elena. \"Shut up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God, Damon said, my life just lapped itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo did mine. Stefan sounded dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust forget about all of it, Elena told them. It\u0027s not true anymore. Stefan, I\u0027m yours forever, and I always was. And right now w e\u0027ve got to get rid of this bastard, and run for the trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Misao and I used to do that,\"Shinichi said. \"Talk alone together on a special frequency. You\u0027re certainly a good manipulator, Elena, to keep them from kil ing each other over you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it\u0027s a special frequency I cal the truth,\"Elena said. \"But I\u0027m not half as good a manipulator as Damon is. Now attack us or let us go away. We\u0027re in a hurry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attack you?\"Shinichi seemed to be thinking over the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, faster than Elena could track it, he went for Bonnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampires, who had been expecting him to try to get to Elena, were caught off guard, but Elena, who had seen the flicker of his eyes toward the weaker girl, was already diving for him. He moved back so quickly that she found herself heading for his legs, but then she realized she had a chance to throw him off balance. She deliberately went for a headbutt with his kneecap, at the same time stabbing deep into his foot with her knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgive me, Bonnie, she thought, knowing what he would do. It was the same as what he\u0027d had his puppet, Damon, do when he\u0027d held Elena and Matt hostage before - except that he didn\u0027t need a pine branch to direct the pain. Black energy erupted directly from his hands into Bonnie\u0027s smal body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was another factor he hadn\u0027t taken into account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d had Damon attack Matt and Elena he\u0027d had the sense to keep away from them while directing agony into their bodies. This time, he\u0027d seized Bonnie and wrapped his arms around her. And Bonnie was a most excel ent telepath herself, especial y at projecting. When the first wave of agony hit her, she screamed - and redirected the pain toward Shinichi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like completing a circuit. It didn\u0027t hurt Bonnie any less, but it meant that anything Shinichi did to her he felt in his own body, amplified by Bonnie\u0027s terror. That was the system that Elena slammed into as hard as she could. When her head impacted with his knee, his kneebone was the more fragile of the two, and something inside it crackled. Dazed, she concentrated on twisting the knife she\u0027d stabbed through his foot and into the soil below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wouldn\u0027t have worked if she hadn\u0027t had two extremely agile vampires right behind her. Since Shinichi didn\u0027t fal over, she would just have been putting her neck at the perfect level for him to snap cleanly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Stefan was only a split second behind her. He seized her and was out of Shinichi\u0027s reach before the kitsune could even assess the situation properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go,\"Elena gasped at Stefan. She was determined to get Bonnie. \"I left my knife,\"she added craftily, finding a more concrete reason for forcing Stefan to let her back into the fray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In his foot, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel Stefan trying not to laugh out loud. \"I think that\u0027s a good place to leave it. Take one of mine,\"he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027ve quite finished your little chat, you might get rid of his tails, came Damon\u0027s cold telepathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment Bonnie passed out, but with her own telepathic circuits Stillwide open and directed back toward Shinichi. And now Damon had gone into offensive mode, as if he cared nothing about Bonnie\u0027s well-being, as long as he could get through her to Shinichi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan, quick as a striking snake, went for one of the many tails that now waved behind Shinichi, advertising his tremendous Power. Most of them were translucent, and they surrounded his real tail - the flesh-and-blood tail that every fox had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan\u0027s knife went snick and one of the phantom tails fel to the ground and then disappeared. There was no blood, but Shinichi keened in fury and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon, meanwhile, was ruthlessly attacking from the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Stefan had distracted the kitsune from the back, Damon slashed both Shinichi\u0027s wrists - one quickly on the upstroke, the other just as fast on the down-stroke. Then he went for a body blow just at the moment that Stefan, with Elena held like a baby on his hip, snicked away another phantom tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena was struggling. She was seriously worried that Damon would kill Bonnie to get to Shinichi. And besides, she herself would not be toted around like a piece of luggage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCivilization had tumbled down al around her and she was reacting from her deepest instincts: protect Stefan, protect Bonnie, protect Fel \u0027s Church. Put the enemy down. She hardly realized that in her heightened state she had sunk her unfortunately Still-human teeth into Stefan\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced slightly, but he listened to her. All right! Try to get Bonnie, then - see if you can ease her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of her just as Shinichi whirled to deal with him, channeling the black pain that, back on Earth, had flung Matt and Elena off their feet in seizures, directly toward Stefan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena, just released, found that everyone was making a half turn, as if to oblige her, and suddenly she saw a chance. She snatched at the limp form of Bonnie, and Shinichi dropped the smal er girl into her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords were echoing in Elena\u0027s brain. Get Bonnie. See if you can ease her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she had Bonnie now. Her own sense split Stefan\u0027s two orders with another -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;get her away from Shinichi. She\u0027s the priceless hostage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena found that she could almost scream with fury even now. She had to keep Bonnie safe - but that meant leaving Stefan, gentle Stefan, at the mercy of Shinichi. She scrambled away with Bonnie - so smal and light - and at the same time threw a backward glance at Stefan. He was wearing a slight frown of concentration now, but he was not only not overwhelmed with pain, he was pressing forward the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though Shinichi\u0027s head was on fire. The bril iant crimson tips of his black hair had burst into flames, as if nothing else would express his enmity and his certainty of winning. He was crowning himself with a flaming garland, a hel ish halo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena\u0027s anger at that turned into chil s down her spine as she watched something most people never lived to analyze: two vampires attacking together, perfectly in sync. There was the elemental savagery in it of a pair of raptors or wolves, but there was also the awesome beauty of two creatures working as a single, unified body. The distance in Stefan\u0027s and Damon\u0027s expressions said that this was a fight to the death. The occasional frown from Stefan or vicious smile from Damon meant that Shinichi was sending his searing dark Power through one or the other of them. But these weren\u0027t weak humans Shinichi was playing with now. They were both vampires with bodies that healed almost instantly - and vampires who had both fed recently - from her -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena. Her extraordinary blood was feuling them now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0027m already a part of this, Elena thought. I\u0027m helping them right now. That would have to satisfy the savagery this no-holds-barred fight elicited in her. To ruin the perfect synchronicity with which the two vampires were handling Shinichi would be a crime, especial y when Bonnie was Stilllimp in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs humans, we\u0027re both liabilities, she thought. And Damon wouldn\u0027t hesitate to tel me so, even if al I wanted was to get in one single stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie, come on, Bonnie, she thought. Hold on to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re getting farther away. She picked up the smal er girl under the armpits and dragged her. She backed up into the olive dimness that stretched in al directions. When she tripped over a root and accidental y sat down, she decided that she\u0027d gone far enough, and maneuvered Bonnie into her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she cupped her hands around Bonnie\u0027s little heart-shaped face and she thought of the most soothing things she could imagine. A cool plunge at Warm Springs back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hot bath at Lady Ulma\u0027s and then a four-handed massage, lying comfortably on a drying couch with the scent of floral incense rising around her. A cuddle with Saber in Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers\u0027s informal den. The decadence of sleeping late and waking up in her own bed - with her own mother and father and sister in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Elena thought of this last, she couldn\u0027t help giving a tiny gasp, and a teardrop fel onto Bonnie\u0027s forehead. Bonnie\u0027s eyelashes fluttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, don\u0027t you be sad,\"she whispered. \"Elena?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got you, and nobody\u0027s going to hurt you again. Do you Stillfeel bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little. But I could hear you, in my mind, and it made me feel better. I want a long bath and a pizza. And to hold baby Adara. She can almost talk, you know. Elena - you\u0027re not listening to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena wasn\u0027t. She was watching the denouement of the fight between Stefan and Damon and Shinichi. The vampires had the kitsune down now and were squabbling over him like a couple of fledglings over a particularly tasty worm. Or maybe like a pair of baby dragons - Elena wasn\u0027t sure if birds hissed at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no - yuck!\"Bonnie saw what Elena was watching and col apsed, hiding her head against Elena\u0027s shoulder. Okay, Elena thought. I get it. There\u0027s no savagery at allin you, is there, Bonnie? Mischief, but nothing like bloodlust. And that\u0027s good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she thought this, Bonnie abruptly sat up straight, bumping Elena\u0027s chin, and pointing into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\"she cried. \"Do you see that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a very bright light, which flared brighter as each vampire found a place to his liking on Shinichi\u0027s body and bit simultaneously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here,\"Elena said, a little thickly, because when Bonnie had bumped her chin she\u0027d accidental y bitten her tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran back to the two vampires and knocked them as hard as she could over the heads. She had to get their attention before they got completely locked into feeding mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot surprisingly, Stefan detached first, and then helped her to pul Damon off his defeated enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon snarled and paced, never taking his eyes off Shinichi as the beaten kitsune slowly sat up. Elena noticed drops of blood scattered around. Then she saw it, tucked into Damon\u0027s belt, black and crimson-tipped and sleek: Shinichi\u0027s real tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavagery fled...fast. Elena wanted to hide her head against Stefan\u0027s shoulder but instead turned up her face for a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan obliged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Elena stepped back so that they formed a triangle around Shinichi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t even think of attacking,\"Damon said pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi gave a weak shrug. \"Attack you? Why bother? You\u0027l have nothing to go back to, even if I die. The children are pre-programmed to kil . But\" - with sudden vehemence - \"I wish we\u0027d never come to your damned little town at all - and I wish we\u0027d never fol owed Her orders. I wish I\u0027d never let Misao near Her! I wish we hadn\u0027t - \"He stopped speaking suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it was more than that, Elena thought. He froze, eyes wide open and staring. \"Oh, no,\"he whispered. \"Oh, no, I didn\u0027t mean that! I didn\u0027t mean it! I have no regrets - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena had the feeling of something coming at them at tremendous speed, so fast, in fact, that she just had time to open her mouth before it hit Shinichi. Whatever it was, it kil ed him cleanly and passed by without touching anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi fel facedown onto the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bother,\"Elena said softly, as Stefan reflexively moved toward the corpse. \"He\u0027s dead. He did it to himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how?\"Stefan and Damon demanded in chorus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not the expert,\"Elena said. \"Meredith is the expert on this. But she told me that kitsune could only be kil ed by destroying their star bal s, shooting them with a blessed bul et...or by the \u0027Sin of Regret.\u0027Meredith and I didn\u0027t know what that meant back then - it was before we had even gone into the Dark Dimension. But I think we just now saw it in action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you can\u0027t be a kitsune and regret anything you\u0027ve done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s - harsh,\"Stefan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\"Damon said crisply. \"Although, if it had operated for vampires, no doubt you would have been permanently dead when you woke up in the family vault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earlier,\"Stefan said expressionlessly. \"I regreted striking you a mortal blow, even as I was dying. You\u0027ve always said I feel too guilty, but that is one thing I would give my life to take back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence that stretched and stretched. Damon was at the front of the group now, and no one but Bonnie could see his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Elena grabbed Stefan\u0027s hand. \"We Stillhave a chance!\"she told him. \"Bonnie and I saw something bright that way! Let\u0027s run!\"He and Elena passed Damon running and he grabbed Bonnie\u0027s hand too. \"Like the wind, Bonnie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But with Shinichi dead - Well, do we real y have to find his star bal or the biggest star bal or whatever is hidden in this awful place?\"Bonnie asked. Once, she would have whined, Elena thought. Now, despite whatever pain she felt, she was running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do have to find it, I\u0027m afraid,\"Stefan said. \"Because from what he said, Shinichi wasn\u0027t at the top of the ladder after al .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and his sister were working for someone, someone female. And whoever She is, She may be attacking Fel \u0027s Church right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The odds have just shifted,\"Elena said. \"We have an unknown enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Still - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Al bets,\"Elena said, \"are off.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-midnight-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-35.html","bookId":2037,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:32:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:32:33 PM"}
