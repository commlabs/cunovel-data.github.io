{"id":93732,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Chloe?\" Matt called cautiously, sticking his head into one of the empty sheds that surrounded the burned-out stables. The sky was starting to lighten in the east, signifying the end of a long night. There were still a few firefighters and EMTs near the blocked-off stables, turning over the ashes, so he had to be quiet. He took a deep breath, trying to calm down. Chloe had to be somewhere, he reminded himself. He had seen her after the fight, weary but not seriously hurt. She had probably just retreated, overwhelmed by all the blood and by the adrenaline from the fight. She would turn up soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shed was silent and dark. Matt raised his flashlight and shone it around the empty walls of the tiny space: nowhere here for anyone to hide. As he was about to move on, a faint scratching noise caught his attention. Not completely empty, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocusing the flashlight on the ground, he caught a glimpse of bright eyes and a long tail before a mouse zipped out of sight again. Nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chloe!\" he hissed, heading for the old barn, the last outbuilding he hadn\u0027t yet searched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree werewolves, the most battered and bloody of the Pack after the battle, had stayed behind after the rest had left to hunt for Klaus and Elena. But they were gone now. They\u0027d offered to help Matt search for Chloe, but he\u0027d waved them off: at that point, he\u0027d still been sure that he\u0027d find her any minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine,\" Matt had told Spencer. \"Go take care of your injuries. I\u0027ll find her. It\u0027s probably stupid to be so worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer had always struck Matt as being more about hair gel than brains, but he\u0027d pinned him with a surprisingly shrewd look. \"Listen, man,\" he\u0027d drawled in his preppy, rich-surfer-boy accent, still managing to sound sort of laid-back despite the pain in his voice. \"I\u0027m wishing you the best here, I am, but vampires . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Matt had said, wincing. He did know; he could have written the book on reasons not to date vampires, but that was when he\u0027d been thinking of Elena, not himself, and before he had met Chloe. Now it was different. \"I\u0027ll find her,\" he had said, absurdly touched by Spencer\u0027s concern. \"Thanks, though. Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d felt wistful while he watched Spencer and his friends walk off, like he would be the last person left in the world once the werewolves were out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere could Chloe be? They had been shoulder-to-shoulder coming out of the stable after half the roof fell in. Chloe had been shaking, her pupils dilated and her hands streaked with blood, but she had been with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, sometime during the rise of panic as they realized that Elena had been under the fiery roof when it collapsed, Chloe was just gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking of Elena in Klaus\u0027s grasp gave him a pang of guilt. This was Elena, his friend and the girl who\u0027d been the sun he orbited around for so long. He wanted to be searching for her with the rest of them. But he needed to find Chloe, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barn was rickety, one of its broad double doors hanging crookedly by a single hinge. Matt approached it with caution - he wouldn\u0027t do Chloe any good if he was caught and pinned under a falling barn door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half-broken door wobbled and creaked, but did not fall as he edged his way through the gap between it and the side of the barn, shining his flashlight inside. Dust rose in the beam of light, specks floating thickly in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, something shifted, and Matt walked forward, sweeping the flashlight back and forth. Far in the back, he saw something white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he came closer, Matt realized that it was Chloe\u0027s face staring into the flashlight\u0027s beam, wild with panic. After such a long search, it took Matt a moment to process what was going on: his first reaction was a simple swell of relief - thank God he\u0027d found Chloe at last. Then he realized that Chloe was streaked with blood and that, quiet in her arms, lay Tristan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe blinked at Matt blankly for a moment, and then her face filled with dismayed realization. She pushed Tristan away from her, horrified. The werewolf let out a weak cry of distress as he hit the floor with a thump, then lay still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" Chloe said, dropping to her knees beside him. \"Oh, no. I didn\u0027t mean to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt ran toward her. \"Is he alive?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe had tried so hard, and he\u0027d been there every step of the way, helped her as much as he could. Life was unfair enough. But now Chloe\u0027s head was bent over Tristan and she was patting her hand urgently over his body, trying to wake him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt got down on the other side of Tristan and tried to check the werewolf\u0027s injuries. God, the poor guy was bleeding everywhere. He must have smelled like a banquet to Chloe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry, Tristan,\" Chloe whispered. \"Please wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tristan, can you hear me?\" Matt asked, checking his pulse. The werewolf\u0027s heart was beating slowly and steadily, and he was breathing well. The Pack was tough. But the werewolf\u0027s eyes were unfocused, and he didn\u0027t respond when Matt called his name again, shaking him gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I might have, um, calmed him down,\" Chloe said, stricken. \"Like the rabbits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should get him some help,\" Matt said brusquely, not looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer. Matt looked up and saw the horror and guilt on her face, tears running over her rounded cheeks, making tracks through the blood around her mouth. She\u0027d joked to him once that she was an ugly crier, and now she scrubbed at her running nose with the back of her sleeve. In the semidarkness, her eyes seemed like black pits of misery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" he said, more gently. \"This isn\u0027t the end of the world. We\u0027ll start over. You shouldn\u0027t have been in a battle right now. It was too hard on you to be around all that action. All that blood.\" Despite himself, his voice stumbled a little over the word blood. Matt gulped unhappily and went on, working to make his voice confident. \"Everyone slips up when they\u0027re breaking an addiction. We\u0027ll get back to the boathouse, away from everyone. It\u0027s going to be fine.\" He sounded desperate, even to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe shook her head. \"Matt . . .\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a mistake,\" Matt told her firmly. \"Tristan\u0027s going to be all right. So will you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe shook her head again, harder this time, the ringlets Matt had always found so adorable flying around her head. \"I\u0027m not,\" she said miserably. \"I\u0027m not going to be all right. I love you, Matt, I do.\" Her voice broke in a sob, and then she took a deep breath and began again. \"I love you, but I can\u0027t live like this. Stefan was right; I\u0027m not really living at all now. I\u0027m not strong enough. It\u0027s not getting better for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are strong enough,\" Matt argued. \"I\u0027ll help you.\" Dawn was breaking outside, and he could see the ash and blood streaked on Chloe\u0027s tear-blotched skin now, the deep circles beneath her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad I got to stay with you for a while,\" she said. \"You took such good care of me.\" She leaned forward, across Tristan\u0027s unconscious body, and kissed him. Her lips were soft and tasted of copper and salt. Her hand found his, and she pressed something small and hard into his palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling back from the kiss at last, she said, her voice thin, \"I hope someday you\u0027ll find someone who deserves you, Matt,\" and got to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t . . .\" Matt said, panicking, and reached out for her. \"I need you, Chloe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe looked down at him, her face calm and sure now. She even smiled a little. \"This is the right thing,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few steps, she\u0027d crossed the barn and was slipping out through the gap between the doors. The sunrise was well underway now, and her body was dark against the pink-and-golden light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was a burst of fire, and Chloe crumpled into a heap of ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt looked down at the small hard object she had pressed into his palm. It was a little pin in the shape of a V, made of blue stone. He had one, too: the Vitale badge Ethan had given all of them, back when he and Chloe and the other pledges were all human, all innocent. The lapis lazuli charm that defended Chloe from the daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his fist tightly around it, ignoring the pain as its sharp edges pressed into his palm, and gave a dry, heaving sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have to get up in a minute. Tristan needed his help. But for a moment, Matt bent his head and let the tears come. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-38.html","bookId":2123,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:14 PM"}
