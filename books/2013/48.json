The air was thin and cold at this altitude. The stars overhead were bright and sharp, the dust-shrouded crescent moon still low on the horizon to the north. Around her was whispered motion through the clumps of dead leaves and lichen-a kind of scaled mouse ruled the forest floor at night, a species she had never seen before. They seemed unusually fearless, so much so that more than one had scampered across her boots. No predators, presumably. Even so, their behaviour was odd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore her stretched a sloped clearing, sixty or more paces, ending at a rutted track. Beyond it was a level stretch of sharp, jagged stones, loose enough to be treacherous. The fort squatting in the midst of this moat of rubble was stone-walled, thick at the base and tapering sharply to twice the height of a man. The corner bastions were massive, squared and flat-topped. On those platforms were swivel-mounted ballestae. Seren could make out huddled figures positioned around the nearest one, while other soldiers were visible, shoulders and heads, walking the raised platform on the other side of the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she studied the fortification, she heard the soft clunk of armour and weapons to her left. She shrank back as a patrol appeared on the rutted track. Motionless, breath held, she watched them amble past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another twenty heartbeats, she turned about and made her way back through the stunted forest. She almost missed the entrance to the cave mouth, a mere slit of black behind high ferns beneath a craggy overhang of tilted, layered granite. Pushing through, she stumbled into Fear Sengar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sorry,’ he whispered. ‘We were beginning to worry, or, at least,’ he added, ‘I was.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gestured him back into the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good news,’ she said once they were inside. ‘We’re behind the garrison-the pass ahead should be virtually unguarded-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are K’risnan wards up the trail,’ Silchas Ruin cut in. ‘Tell me of this garrison, Acquitor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren closed her eyes. Wards? Errant take us, what game is Hannan Mosag playing here? ‘I could smell horses from the fort. Once we trip those wards they’ll be after us, and we can’t outrun mounted soldiers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The garrison,’ Silchas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. ‘The fort looks impregnable. I’d guess (here’s anywhere between a hundred and two hundred soldiers there. And with that many there’s bound to be mages, as well as a score or more Tiste Edur.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Silchas Ruin is tired of being chased,’ Udinaas said from where he lounged, back resting on a stone slab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDread filled Seren Pedac at these words. ‘Silchas, can we not go round these wards?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced across at Fear Sengar, saw suspicion and unease in the warrior’s expression, but he would not meet her eyes. What conversation did 1 just miss here? ‘You are no stranger to sorcery, Silchas Ruin. Could you put everyone in that fort to sleep or something? Or cloud their minds, make them confused?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her an odd look. ‘I know of no sorcery that can achieve that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mockra,’ she replied. ‘The warren of Mockra.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No such thing existed in my day,’ he said. ‘The K’risnan sorcery, rotted through with chaos as it is, seems recogniz-able enough to me. I have never heard of this Mockra.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Corlos, the mage with Iron Bars-the Crimson Guard mercenaries-he could reach into minds, fill them with false terrors.’ She shrugged. ‘He said the magic of Holds and Elder Warrens has, almost everywhere else, been supplanted.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I had wondered at the seeming weakness of Kurald Galain in this land. Acquitor, I cannot achieve what you ask. Although, I do intend to silence everyone in that fort And collect for us some horses.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Silchas, there are hundreds of Letherii there, not just soldiers. A fort needs support staff. Cooks, scullions, smiths, carpenters, servants-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Tiste Edur,’ Fear added, ‘will have slaves.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘None of this interests me,’ the Tiste Andii said, moving past Seren and leaving the mouth of the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas laughed softly. ‘Red Ruin stalks the land. We must heed this tale of righteous retribution gone horribly wrong. So, Fear Sengar, your epic quest twists awry-what will you tell your grandchildren now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Edur warrior said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac hesitated; she could hear Silchas Ruin walk’ ing away-a few strides crunching through leaves-then he was gone. She could hurry after him. Attempt one last time to dissuade him. Yet she did not move. In the wake or Ruin’s passage the only sound filling the forest was the scurry and rustle of the scaled mice, in their thousands it seemed, all flowing in the same direction as the Tiste Andii. Sweat prickled like ice on her skin. Look at us, Frozen like rabbits. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-48.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
