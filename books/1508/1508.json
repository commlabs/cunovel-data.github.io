She could only watch blankly on as Lin Ming struggled internally just a hundred feet away from her. There was nothing she could do at this moment as Lin Ming’s will battled that of the Essence Spirit Embryo Stone; she didn’t even dare to move his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Just what is Lin Ming planning…” Xiao Moxian felt her palms become wet with sweat. No matter how strong Lin Ming’s soul force was, how could he defeat the will of the Essence Spirit Embryo Stone that not even a World King could contend with?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTime seemed to come to a standstill.

After billions of years of being bred over time, the Essence Spirit Embryo Stone developed an intelligence of its own, even under the seal of the Asura Road Master.

It wasn’t strange for the Essence Spirit Embryo Stone to have developed its own intelligence, but the words it spoke were strange. It had been locked in this array formation since the moment it was formed and had never experienced the outside world so there was no reason for it to speak the words it did.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe phantom of demonic power saw Lin Ming’s confusion and smiled. “Through these countless years… innumerable people have died trying to enter the God Beast Tomb array formation… \u0026nbsp;they were swallowed up by the array formation and their essence energy also became my nourishment.

It seemed as if it were formed from numerous personalities. This phantom of demonic power had no personality of its own, but was instead an amalgamation of all the martial artists that it had swallowed up.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I see, so that’s how it is.

I have gathered into myself the minds of innumerable individuals… after billions of years of being formed, I have become a soul-devouring sacred spirit that surpasses the Laws. I am ever changing, ever evolving. I can swallow the will, soul, and essence energy of unlimited people, until the day I finally become the ruler of the universe! This is a situation that the man who laid down this array so many billions of years ago could never have imagined! He was far too conceited. By relying on his absolute cultivation he arranged this great array and even dared to create his own Heavenly Dao rules. He tried to arrange a destiny for his future successors, but how could he have calculated what would happen billions of years in the future? There is no foolproof plan in this world. My birth already far exceeds any plans he ever made. Now, I have already evolved into a perfect life form, able to swallow the wisdom of any being. I will create my own history, my own era! I will become a terrifying existence that all life in the 33 Heavens shall respect and fear!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You sure like to shamelessly boast.” A cold smile touched Lin Ming’s face.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe soul-swallowing sacred spirit chuckled in return. “I really don’t understand how you can smile even at the point of death.
