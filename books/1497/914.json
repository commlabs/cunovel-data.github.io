Invisible ripples swiftly spread. The remaining blood-red spiritual bodies were turned into nothingness under the ripples. Not even a little spiritual strength escaped from them…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fallen Heart Flame? Brat, I underestimated you. It is unexpected that you are able to control it to such an extent!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing this large scale massacre by the wolf-shaped fire spirit, the dark-black cloud that contained traces of dark-redness began to churn. A shocked, furious cry was transmitted from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan ignored the angry cry of Protector Xuan. He focused his mind on controlling the enormous wolf-shaped fire spirit. This was the first kind of fire spirit from the ‘Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique.’ With Xiao Yan’s current Spiritual Strength, he naturally did not need to exhaust too much strength to form it. However, the remaining fire spirits became harder and harder to train. Once he succeeded, however, the strength from the gathering of the five kinds of fire spirit would be quite frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this was merely the first kind of fire spirit, Xiao Yan was extremely satisfied with its strength after the test earlier. This ‘Five Ring Flame Expelling Technique’ was indeed worthy of being the Dou Skill that Tian Huo zun-zhe made his name with. Such a profound flame controlling technique was likely the most advanced one that Xiao Yan had seen, with the exception of Yao Lao’s abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack clouds churned in the air. A blood-red color faintly seeped down from it. At a glance it appeared to be filled with a strange gloominess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving lost the supplement from the many spirits, the pressure that was spreading from the black cloud slowly came to a stop. Screeches were repeatedly emitted from the churning black cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tsk tsk, brat, the strength of the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ has indeed exceeded the expectations of this protector. However, you should not naively think that you can break the Ten Thousand Soul Swallowing Formation in this manner!” Protector Xuan’s sinister laughter was suddenly emitted from the permeating black cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blood Spirit Poison!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blood glow suddenly soared from within the dark-black cloud after Protector Xuan’s cold laughter sounded. Sharp ear-piercing cries were emitted. There was even a faint chewing sound that caused one’s pores to open…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That fellow has got all the spirits to devour each other. If this continues, a fierce spirit will appear!” Su Qian’s expression was solemn. He could not help but speak in a deep voice as he looked at the strange black-red cloud layer. He sensed the shockingly violent emotion that was being emitted from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan knit his brows slightly. He did not give a reply as his hand seal was quickly formed. Numerous illusionary after images appeared. An instant later, his hand seal suddenly paused and his mouth cried out softly, “Go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cry had just left his mouth when a rising substance-like flame suddenly appeared in the eyes of the enormous wolf-shaped fire spirit that was above Xiao Yan’s head. A ten-foot-large invisible flame burned with a bang on its body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ao!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf-shaped fire spirit, that was emitting a shocking heat from its body, let out a long wail. Immediately, its enormous body rushed forward in an abrupt manner. Within a couple of blinks, it appeared under the black cloud. After which, the wolf-shaped fire spirit violently collided with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the approach of the wolf-shaped fire spirit, the black cloud immediately shrank, appearing as though it had suffered a shock. A brief silence also replaced the sharp cries within it…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold snort suddenly sounded within the black cloud. Immediately, a part of the black cloud fluctuated. Protector Xuan’s vague figure appeared. One could see his hand being extended before gently pressing down on the wolf-shaped fire spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the force of his palm, a majestic black-colored fog immediately surged out and intertwined with the invisible flame that lingered on the surface of the wolf-shaped fire spirit as an ear-piercing ‘chi chi’ sound erupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan, who had a mental connection with the wolf-shaped fire spirit, frowned as he stood below when the fire spirit was blocked. His hand seal changed and a powerful spiritual ripple surged in a lightning-like manner from the area between his brows. Finally, it entered into the body of the wolf-shaped fire spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving received Xiao Yan’s powerful support, the invisible flame on the body of the wolf-shaped fire spirit once again soared by over ten feet. Its enormous mouth widened and an extremely hot flame shot toward Protector Xuan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtector Xuan’s heart tightened a little as he sensed the invisible ripple contained within his heart. The Fallen Heart Flame’s special searing effect on spirits along with Xiao Yan’s profound flame controlling technique caused its strength to soar greatly. Hence, even Protector Xuan did not wish to face it head-on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black fog on Protector Xuan’s body swiftly spread out as this thought appeared in his heart. His body immediately paused and was hidden within the layers of black cloud in a ghost-like manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chi!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe invisible fire pillar did not strike Protector Xuan. Instead, it shot into the black cloud and relied on its frightening temperature to tear a seventy-to-eighty-foot-wide hole within the dark black cloud. Xiao Yan’s group narrowed their eyes as their sight penetrated the empty hole. They could only see dense spirits swallowing each other like hungry wolves within the cloud layer. That manner was just like poison worms within a box, where they mercilessly killed and ate their companion in order to enable themselves to be the last survivor…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing this endless swallowing of each other, frightening fierceness, violence, and other negative emotions surfaced. That cloud layer breed and spread. Xiao Yan and the others could vaguely sense that a fierce spirit was being swiftly formed within it…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Explode!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s face was somewhat dark and solemn. His hand was suddenly clenched and the invisible fire pillar that had shot into the cloud layer exploded with a ‘bang.’ a hot fire wave spread out. Any spirit that made contact with it was transformed into nothingness…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter this large scale destruction by the Fallen Heart Flame, the dark-redness within the black cloud seemed to have become paler. Clearly, the attack by Xiao Yan earlier had destroyed a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brat, you have destroyed nearly a thousand spirits. This protector will get you to pay this debt after this is over. However, just you alone cannot stop the fierce spirit from being created!” Protector Xuan’s dark, cold voice was slowly transmitted while the cloud layer churned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtector Xuan’s voice had just sounded when four unusually powerful spiritual ripples suddenly appeared within the cloud layer. They were like fierce tigers entering the mountains as they charged into the mess of spirits before swallowing wildly…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These four spirits are spirits that this Protector had spent great efforts during these three years to obtain. They are all experts at the peak of the Dou Huang class when they were alive. Their Spiritual Strengths are unusually strong. Originally, I could not bare to take them out. However, looking at this situation…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swallowing strength of the four powerful spirits was extremely frightening. Within less than a minute, the spirits within the cloud layer were completely swallowed. Four spirits that were filled with a violent emotion immediately began to swallow one another. While they swallowed each other, a rich, dark, cold fog surged down from the cloud layer in all directions, blocking the wolf-shaped fire spirit that had been formed by the Fallen Heart Flame…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If these four spiritual bodies were to complete the final swallowing, that fierce spirit will appear… the Little Fairy Doctor and I will interve. We cannot just sit back and wait for things to happen.” Su Qian frowned and spoke as he sensed the pressure that was emitted from the cloud layer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If the both of you were to intervene, Han Feng or Old Ying Shan would also intervene… allow me to do it.” Xiao Yan shook his head slightly. His right hand was immediately clenched and a cluster of dark-green flames appeared in his hand. His left hand grabbed toward the Fallen Heart Flame in the sky before swiftly shrinking it. Finally, it transformed into an invisible flame that lingered in front of Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne green and one invisible flame floated in front of Xiao Yan. They immediately began to merge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThreads of sparks shot out when the flames were merging. A moment later, a jade-green fire lotus appeared in Xiao Yan’s hand. With Xiao Yan’s current strength, using this kind of ‘Angry Buddha Lotus Flame,’ formed from the merger of two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flame,’ was extremely relaxing and easy…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flames were successfully merged. Xiao Yan was just about to throw it when Tian Huo zun-zhe’s voice suddenly sounded within his heart, “Wait, don’t destroy that fierce spirit…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan frowned slightly when he heard this. He spoke within his heart, “Old mister Yao, what do you mean? If that fierce spirit were to be successfully formed, the number of elite Dou Zongs on the other side will exceed ours. The current you… has not recovered your strength.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTian Huo zun-zhe laughed. His voice contained a fiery heat, “Just leave this fierce spirit to me. This great amount of Spiritual Strength that has been accumulated will be a great tonic to me. If I can swallow and refine it, my Spiritual Strength would likely be able to recover to the Dou Zong class…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s brows were slightly lifted. After which, his hand slowly descended. If Tian Huo zun-zhe were able to recover to the Dou Zong class, it would definitely be a great help to him in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Old mister Yao, do you have the confidence to do it? That fierce spirit is agglomerated from countless numbers of brutal emotions. If you were to swallow it, it would likely end up influencing your mind…” Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ke ke, that is why I need to trouble you. Once I subdue it in the future, I will need to borrow your Fallen Heart Flame.” Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan quietly sighed in relief within his heart. He smiled said, “There is naturally no problem with this. In that case, I will rely on elder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan, quick, the fierce spirit is about to be form!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSu Qian by the side saw that Xiao Yan had remained still after merging the flame. He involuntarily urged him on. If this evil spirit were to be formed, it was likely that he and everyone present would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan recovered after hearing Su Qian’s voice. He smiled to the latter before raising his head to look at the churning black clouds. He slowly said, “First Elder need not worry. That fierce spirit won’t be able to do much…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Xiao Yan’s voice slowly sounded, the churning cloud in the sky suddenly stiffened amid an incomparably sharp screech. A despotic aura slowly descended from above. The proud wild laughter of Protector Xuan resounded over the sky at this moment, reverberating in a ear-piercing manner across the entire area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan, if you obediently surrender today, this Protector will allow you to suffer less!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-913\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-915\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-914","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM"}
