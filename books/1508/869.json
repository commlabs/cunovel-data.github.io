Shibai and the other Forsaken God Clan martial artists looked a bit tense. All of them couldn’t help but think that 8000 years of life really did seem just a bit too old.

He held onto his peach walking stick, a kind and benevolent smile still hanging on his face. However, as this smile fell into the eyes of others, it appeared abstruse and profound.

It was a perfectly justified matter for a martial artist to fight with their contract beast.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Divine Emperor Haotian, you may make your move.” Old Man Good Fortune reminded him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Then this Emperor shall do as you wish!” At this time, Situ Haotian naturally wouldn’t care about modesty or humility. In this battle he had to guarantee at least a draw. If he was able to put pressure on Old Man Good Fortune, then that would be even better!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Haotian had kept a low profile for all these years and had collected a number of special trump abilities.

Situ Haotian extracted a black halberd from his spatial ring. This war halberd was 10 feet long and released bursts of fierce black light. The shaft of the halberd was etched with compact and complex patterns. This was impressively a quasi-Saint artifact!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCounting this unknown black halberd, the Asura Divine Kingdom had continually revealed two quasi-Saint artifacts and one Saint artifact.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAmong them, although the Demon God Heartguard mirror was a quasi-Saint level artifact, because it was a defensive treasure its value was in no way inferior to an offensive Saint artifact.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Situ Haotian’s thick black hair was flying in the wind.

Situ Haotian had used the strongest killing move of the ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’, a move that required the strength of the Divine Sea to use.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFacing this terrifying strike, Old Man Good Fortune still rode on his green ox. His blue clothes gently waved in the wind. With a calm expression, he lifted his hands and drew a line downwards.

However, just as his attack reached 10 feet away, it simply vanished into the void, disappearing forever. It was like an invisible endless abyss had appeared in front of Old Man Good Fortune. Any energy that came towards him simply faded away with no trace left!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of the martial artists watching from afar were dumbfounded. Situ Haotian’s horrifying attack had vanished just like that. Old Man Good Fortune still calmly rode his green ox, his blue clothes fluttering in the wind. As this scene fell into everyone’s watching eyes, they felt an inestimable feeling.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was also stricken; Old Man Good Fortune had easily divided space!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, although Old Man Good Fortune was standing still and seemed close by, the truth was that he was in a completely separate world. Between him and Situ Haotian was an invisible moat that could not be crossed. No matter what sort of monstrous supernatural strength came rushing towards him, it would all fall into this unknown space, unable to harm even a single hair of Old Man Good Fortune.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust how deep did one’s comprehension of the Space Laws have to be in order to use such a heaven-defying ability with such casual ease?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming sucked in a breath of cold air. The Concepts of Space, Thunder, and Fire were all the same in that they were divided into multiple levels. Until now, Lin Ming had only encountered a \u0026nbsp;single level, and that was to distort and shrink space. His elusive and ghostly attacks and movements all depended on this. It was the first time that he had seen Old Man Good Fortune’s method of utilizing the Concept of Space. Without a doubt, Old Man Good Fortune’s actions today had opened up a great mystical door for Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith his first attack unsuccessful, Situ Haotian was still calm without the least bit of panic. Everything had gone as he had expected. “Heaven’s Divide. Senior Good Fortune’s technique is truly astounding. Since the first move failed, here is the second!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Situ Haotian spoke to here he suddenly emitted a loud shout. His voice didn’t even seem as if it could be that of a human. In that instant, a savage dragon seemed to awaken within his body. His joints began to emit popping sounds and his muscles rose, bulging out in all directions. His body began to grow, and in just several breaths of time he actually grew a whole 10 feet taller. His muscles had become as hard as rock. His face was ferocious and ravenous, and both his eyes were a bright blood red.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter transforming his body, Situ Haotian’s aura had soared by several times, the power of his blood vitality billowing into the sky like a blazing blame. At this time, he was filled with insufferable arrogance, like a demon god that had arrived in the world, overlooking all of existence!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven if Old Man Good Fortune was able to divide the void, Situ Haotian now had sufficient strength to break it!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming saw Situ Haotian morph his body, he was startled. Situ Haotian’s body had actually become that of a Giant Demon. This was… just how had he done this? In that moment, he could clearly feel a rich and pure Giant Demon bloodline from within Situ Haotian. This bloodline was exactly the same as the Giant Demon blood essence that Lin Ming had seen when he opened the Cosmic Melting Furnace!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Cosmic Melting Furnace had contained two masses of Giant Demon blood essence. The first mass had been absorbed by the Magic Cube and the second mass was given to Demonshine.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Demonshine, what’s going on here? Could Situ Haotian come from the Giant Demon race’s bloodline?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming asked with a true essence sound transmission. Ever since Lin Ming had decided to attack Life Destruction, Demonshine had temporarily left Lin Ming’s body. Whether it was crossing Life Destruction or his life or death struggle with Situ Yaoyue, Lin Ming had a chance of dying. Thus, Demonshine had chosen to leave Lin Ming’s spiritual sea for the moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He doesn’t. It’s just that this Situ Haotian must have obtained some Ancient Giant Demon blood essence from somewhere and then transplanted it into his body, thus he gained the ability to transform his body. This sort of bloodline is far inferior to your own Ancient Phoenix bloodline.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Ancient Giant Demons that once existed on the Holy Demon Continent were different from the currently existing Giant Demons. Those Ancient Giant Demons had a bloodline that contained a powerful strength. Of course, this couldn’t even be compared to the bloodline of a God Beast like a True Phoenix or True Dragon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, what Situ Haotian used was the blood essence of the Ancient Giant Demons and what Lin Ming had was only the most ordinary blood of the Ancient Phoenix, and the quantity was far less too. Thus, the disparity in their bloodlines wasn’t too great at this moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was engaged in these thoughts, he suddenly heard a martial artist near him cry out in alarm. “A divine body! Battle Demon Emperor Body, that is also another kind of divine body!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The Asura Divine Emperor has a Battle Demon Emperor Body? I’ve never even heard of that before!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“When the Asura Divine Emperor was born, he didn’t have a divine body. He only relied on his own extraordinary talent to reach where he is today. It’s likely he obtained this current divine body from some lucky chance somewhere.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“In just a single day I’ve seen two divine bodies as well as the Extreme Violet Dantian.

So this was what they thought the so-called divine body was. It appeared that everyone who possessed a physique different from that of the average man and was able to display a stronger combat strength was referred to as having a divine body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-865\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-867\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-866","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:19 AM"}
