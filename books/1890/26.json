Have you seen Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back around, \"No. Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"He followed me last night.\" I pointed to the room, \"Please, come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked in and sat on the couch in the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat across from him on the chair and pulled my legs up and wrapped my arms around them, \"He followed me to the Trevi Fountain. He told me he wants to break up with Daniela and be with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinched, \"What? Is that something you want, after everything that’s happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost said yes, but I froze. My mouth hung open. I didn’t have an answer. I had my mother\u0027s smile and nod. I had the fake answer of least resistance. But with Luce I didn’t feel like I had to say it. I could be conflicted. He expected nothing, either way. I shook my head, \"I don’t know what I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I think you need to think about that, Jacqueline. You are young, crazy, vivacious, and fun. You need to embrace that and be the person you want to be. I got the impression from Mike, that you sort of mold yourself to be the person you need to be to match the man you\u0027re with. That is a mistake. My mother has done that and I have watched her die inside every day, just a little more. My father is a respected investment banker; his wife is expected to be a dutiful wife. He shouldn’t have married a white woman, but he did. My father isn’t even Islamic and my mother wears the garb. She is a strong woman, always has been. You would never know it if you met her.\" His green eyes were dark and beautiful under his thick black lashes, \"I like that about you. You seem like you are full of passion. To listen to you talk about wine, is like listening to you pour your soul out. I think if you were smart, you would take this as an opportunity to find yourself. You\u0027re already in Europe. Go see the art and architecture and the vineyards. Go and live this and see where you end up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"How are you so smart for twenty-four?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled back, but it was filled with something I didn’t know him well enough to read, \"I almost lost the thing I loved the most in my life, hockey. I didn’t care if I walked or made love or ran or drove again. But I cared that I might not skate again. My father was so excited to be free of the hockey, the burden of it, and the influence of the West in my life. I had no support. I know what you have been through. I found the best doctors, I made the arrangements, and I got better because I wanted it.\" He stood up, \"I am going to California for Christmas and then Boston to work. I hope I see again. The real you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left me there, dumbfounded and alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next knock on the door was also surprising. I wanted it to be him, but it was Mike. He looked exhausted and sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed his hands, \"Tell me fast, what did you love about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, answer the question as quick as you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked stunned, \"Silky brown hair, smoking hot, funny, kinda subservient, but spicy when I needed it. I don’t know. Why? Why are we doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a challenge for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, \"Jack, I\u0027m beat. This has been the most tiring six months of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I know, me too. We are both single right now. We are both completely available. I want that to last for six months. Go to Boston alone and love the game again. No one-night stands and no random-pick fucks. Just you and your team and your love of the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pinched the bridge of his nose, \"Baby, I just broke off an engagement with an Italian model for you. Whatever this stupid challenge is—I passed—trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped towards me, but I stepped back holding my hands in between us. \"Mike, me and you need a chance to be me and you before we are a we. I need this. Can you grant me that? The freedom to find myself? You were right last night in one respect, I always find a way to fit the man I\u0027m with. I think I\u0027m me with you but I need to be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed me, scooping me up and laid me down on the bed and spooned me. \"Fine, but I want to sleep, nap like before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and let him hold me until he was asleep. When I was sure he was snoring, I climbed from the bed and packed my things. I had to pack it tighter with the new clothes and makeup. My sister had sent me twenty thousand dollars. It would have to be enough to get me through Europe. I called from the bathroom and changed my return date on my flight to May 7th.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote him a letter and left it there next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at it once more, tearing up as I reread it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"France,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not letting you go. I am not giving up on you and me. I am putting me first in the least selfish way I can. You need to go to Boston and establish yourself without anyone else there to define you. I need to find out what, besides wine and little blue pills, defines me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have always been the person in my life that I could count on. I am counting on you now to trust me and let me trust you. I don’t want to regret following you on your dream and never experiencing mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack, your Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed my bag and slipped from the room, not waking or kissing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomeo was in the lobby as I was leaving. He beamed, \"You leaving early?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and placed my bag next to the counter. I wrapped my arms around him, even if he was a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"I saw Ms. Ribissi leaving today. She seemed upset but that husky Texan went after her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Maybe you won\u0027t be rid of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me back, \"But you will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"She seemed nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffed, \"Not to anyone who was lower status. Women like her are like a vase, they are pretty to look at but that is all. They serve no real purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"I hope you have a merry Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too, Ms. Croix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"J.D.\" I stepped on my tiptoes in my boots and kissed his cheek. I grabbed my bags and left the hotel. The air was fresh and crisp and amazing. I had no rules and no expectations. I was free, truly free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday Morning – a few months later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wedding day\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fumbled with my dress and hat. Italians always wore hats to weddings. I still smelled like the bar from the night before. We had been soaked in wine by the end of the night. Greeks were crazy like that. I could see there was still a bit of tannin on my knuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked once more at myself and nodded. It was as good as I was going to get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi gave me a cockeyed look, \"That really is the best you could do? It\u0027s a March wedding. You need something springish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, \"Bran, I\u0027m here as the ex-girlfriend of the guy she almost married. I was stunned when France brought you the invite for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, \"He said Tex wanted you here. Now let\u0027s roll.\" Her New York accent was more noticeable. Probably because I’d been speaking Italian and Greek for months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked out of the flat I had rented for the week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you for money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, \"Still about ten thousand and two months left; I\u0027ll probably be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded back at the apartment, \"I stuck another forty in the bureau for you. It\u0027s in a sock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted, \"Wow. So I take it things are going well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, \"Beyond being five-months pregnant, yeah. You have to come and see the new house. It\u0027s amazing. Shawn loves working for Muriel. She is kicking ass in Boston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at her, \"How are Mom and Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, \"Mom has snuck over to see me a few times. Dad isn’t speaking to me. He blames me for you and blah, blah, blah. Whatever. Let him think what he wants. He gets no part of my babies and my future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged her, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, \"Screw him. He\u0027s a mean old goat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how\u0027s the traveling going? Any hotties on the roster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudged her, \"No. You know I made that pact with Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, \"You know he\u0027s gonna be here tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Temptation to the extreme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one is going to judge you, if you give up two months early on this fucking pilgrimage of working at wineries around Europe. What kind of pilgrim are you anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"I know but I want it. I\u0027ve learned a ton. I know what I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a sideways glance, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My own label at my own house. I want the vineyard more than ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Boston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, \"I don’t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muriel will do whatever you want. She thinks the sun rises and sets in your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"Crazy old woman. I am not taking a dime from her unless she wants to be an investor and make money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked to the car she had hired for the week. The drive to the villa was incredible. Grassy hills, beautiful old houses and structures, and the sea. It was amazing. I couldn’t believe it was my life. There were no pressing matters, or charities, or creepy men groping me. There was nothing but wine, vineyards, and friends who were like family, even after only a few days. The villa was an old castle with vines growing up it and faded stone fences. There were fragrant trees and flowers blooming, even on the Ides of March. The castle was a giant building with arched windows and a huge circular driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance was waiting outside with Will when we pulled up. He looked sexy, fucking sexy. His white dress shirt and black dress pants were tailored to perfection. Will looked the same but in a grey suit. France\u0027s sleeves were rolled up and I could see new ink on his forearms. When the car parked in the courtyard, I jumped out. His face lit up when he saw me, \"Jack!\" he pointed at me, \"You really here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and attacked him. He held me, taking in a deep inhale of me. \"My Jack!\" he mumbled into my nape. I sighed, melting into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"Me too, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled back and ran my fingers through his scruffy face, \"Already?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-26.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
