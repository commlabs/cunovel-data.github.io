So was the luggage. So, to Rincewind\u0027s annoyance, was the parrot. It was perching in mid-air, looking speculatively at the cosmic panorama below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Disc might almost have been designed to be seen from space; it hadn\u0027t, Rincewind was damn sure, been designed to be lived on. But he had to admit that it was impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was about to rise on the far rim and made a line of fire that glittered around half the circumference. A long slow dawn was just beginning its sweep across the dark, massive landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow, harshly lit in the arid vacuum of space, Great A\u0027Tuin the world turtle toiled under the weight of Creation. On his - or her, the matter had never really been resolved -carapace the four giant elephants strained to support the Disc itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere might have been more efficient ways to build a world. You might start with a ball of molten iron and then coat it with successive layers of rock, like an old-fashioned gobstopper. And you\u0027d have a very efficient planet, but it wouldn\u0027t look so nice. Besides, things would drop off the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty good,” said the parrot. “Polly want a continent.” “It\u0027s so big,” breathed Eric. “Yes,” said Rincewind flatly. He felt that something more was expected of him. “Don\u0027t break it,” he added. He had a nagging doubt about all this. If he was for the sake of argument a demon, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso many things had happened to him recently he was prepared to concede that he might have died and not noticed it in the confusion*, then he still didn\u0027t quite see how the world was his to give away. (*Rincewind had been told that death was just like going into another room. The difference is, when you shout, “Where\u0027s my clean socks?”, no-one answers.) He was pretty sure that it had owners who felt the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, he was sure that a demon had to get something in writing. “I think that you have to sign for it,” he said. “In blood.” “Whose?” said Eric. “Yours, I think,” said Rincewind. “Or bird blood will do, at a pinch.” He glared\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emeaningfully at the parrot, which growled at him. “Aren\u0027t I allowed to try it out first?” “What?” “Well suppose it doesn\u0027t work? I\u0027m not signing for it until I\u0027ve seen it work.” Rincewind stared at the boy. Then he looked down at the broad panorama of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekingdoms of the world. I wonder if I was like him at his age? he thought. I wonder how I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esurvived? “It\u0027s the world,” he said patiently. “Of course it will bloody well work. I mean, look at it. Hurricanes, continental drift, rainfall cycle - it\u0027s all there. All ticking over like a bloody watch. It\u0027ll last you a lifetime, a world like that. Used carefully.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric gave the world a critical examination. He wore the expression of someone who knows that all the best gifts in life seem to require the psychic equivalent of two U2 batteries and the shops won\u0027t be open until after the holidays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s got to be tribute,” he said flatly. “You what?” “The kings of the world,” said Eric. “They\u0027ve got to pay me tribute.” “You\u0027ve really been studying this, haven\u0027t you,” said Rincewind sarcastically. \"Just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etribute? You don\u0027t fancy the moon while we\u0027re up here? This week\u0027s special offer, one free satellite with every world dominated?“ ”Are there any useful minerals?“ ”What?“ Eric gave a sigh of long-suffering patience. ”Minerals,“ he said. ”Ores. You know.“ Rincewind coloured. ”I don\u0027t think a lad your age should be thinking of -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean metal and things. It\u0027s no use to me if it\u0027s just a load of rock.” Rincewind looked down. The Discworld\u0027s tiny moonlet was just rising over the far edge, and shed a pale radiance across the jigsaw pattern of land and sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I don\u0027t know. It looks quite nice,” he volunteered. “Look, it\u0027s dark now. Perhaps everyone can pay you tribute in the morning?” “I want some tribute now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you might.” Rincewind gave his fingers a careful examination. It wasn\u0027t as if he\u0027d ever been particularly good at snapping them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave it another try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he opened his eyes again he was standing up to his ankles in mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePre-eminent amongst Rincewind\u0027s talents was his skill in running away, which over the years he had elevated to the status of a genuinely pure science; it didn\u0027t matter if you were fleeing from or to, so long as you were fleeing. It was flight alone that counted. I run, therefore I am; more correctly, I run, therefore with any luck I\u0027ll still be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was also skilled in languages and in practical geography. He could shout `help!` in fourteen languages and scream for mercy in a further twelve. He had passed through many of the countries on the Disc, some of them at high speed, and during the long, lovely, boring hours when he\u0027d worked in the Library he\u0027d whiled away the time by reading up on all the exotic and faraway places he\u0027d never visited. He remembered that at the time he\u0027d sighed with relief that he\u0027d never have to visit them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, now, here he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJungle surrounded him. It wasn\u0027t nice, interesting, open jungle, such as leopard-skin-clad heroes might swing through, but serious, real jungle, jungle that towered up like solid slabs of greenness, thorned and barbed, jungle in which every representative of the vegetable kingdom had really rolled up its bark and got down to the strenuous business of outgrowing all competitors. The soil was hardly soil at all, but dead plants on the way to composthood; water dripped from leaf to leaf, insects whined in the humid, spore-laden air, and there was the terrible breathless silence made by the motors of photosynthesis running flat out. Any yodeling hero who tried to swing through that lot might just as well take his chances with a bean-slicer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you do that?” said Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s probably a knack,” said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric subjected the wonders of Nature to a cursory and disdainful glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This doesn\u0027t look like a kingdom,” he complained. “You said we could go to a kingdom. Do you call this a kingdom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is probably the rain forests of Klatch,” said Rincewind. “They\u0027re stuffed full of lost kingdoms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean mysterious ancient races of Amazonian princesses who subject all male prisoners to strange and exhausting progenitative rites?” said Eric, his glasses beginning to fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha,” said Rincewind stonily. “What an imagination the child has.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wossname, wossname, wossname!” shrieked the parrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve read about them,” said Eric, peering into the greenery. “Of course, I own those kingdoms as well.” He stared at some private inner vision. “Gosh,” he said, hungrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should concentrate on the tribute if I was you,” said Rincewind, setting off down what was possibly a path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brightly-coloured blooms on a tree nearby turned to watch him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the jungles of central Klatch there are, indeed, lost kingdoms of mysterious Amazonian princesses who capture male explorers for specifically masculine duties. These are indeed rigorous and exhausting and the luckless victims do not last long*. (*This is because wiring plugs, putting up shelves, sorting out the funny noise in attics and mowing lawns can eventually reduce even the strongest constitution.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also hidden plateaux where the reptilian monsters of a bygone epoch romp and play, as well as elephants\u0027 graveyards, lost diamond mines, and strange ruins decorated with hieroglyphs the very sight of which can freeze the most valiant heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn any reasonable map there\u0027s barely room for the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe few explorers who have passed on a number of handy hints to those who follow after, such as: 1) avoid if possible any hanging-down creepers with beady eyes and a forked tongue at one end; 2) don\u0027t pick up any orange-and-black-stripped creepers that are apparently lying across the path, twitching, because there is often a tiger on the other end; and 3) don\u0027t go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0027m a demon, Rincewind thought hazily, why is everything stinging me and trying to trip me up? I mean, surely I can only be harmed by a wooden dagger through my heart? Or do I mean garlic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually the jungle opened out into a very wide, cleared area that stretched all the way to a distant blue range of volcanoes. The land fell away below them to a patchwork of lakes and swampy fields, here and there punctured by great stepped pyramids, each one crowned with a thin plume of smoke curling into the dawn air. The jungle track opened out into a narrow, but paved, road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where\u0027s this demon?” said Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looks like one of the Tezuman kingdoms,” said Rincewind. “They\u0027re ruled over by the Great Muzuma, I think.” “She\u0027s an Amazonian princess, is she?” \"Strangely enough, no. You\u0027d be astonished how many kingdoms aren\u0027t ruled by\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazonian princesses, Eric.“ ”It looks pretty primitive, anyway. A bit Stone Age.“ ”The Tezuman priests have a sophisticated calendar and an advanced horology,\" quoted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind. “Ah,” said Eric, “Good.” “No,” said Rincewind patiently. “It means time measurement.” “Oh.” “You\u0027d approve of them. They\u0027re superb mathematicians, apparently.” “Huh,” said Eric, blinking solemnly. \"Shouldn\u0027t think they\u0027ve got a lot to count in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebackward civilisation like this.“ Rincewind eyed the chariots that were heading rapidly towards them. ”I think they usually count victims,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tezuman Empire in the jungle valleys of central Klatch is known for its organic market gardens, its exquisite craftsmanship in obsidian, feathers and jade, and its mass human sacrifices in honour of Quezovercoatl, the Feathered Boa, god of mass human sacrifices. As they said, you always knew where you stood with Quezovercoatl. It was generally with a lot of people on top of a great stepped pyramid with someone in an elegant feathered head-dress chipping an exquisite obsidian knife for your very own personal use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tezumen are renowned on the continent for being the most suicidally gloomy, irritable and pessimistic people you could ever hope to meet, for reasons that may soon be made clear. It was true about the time measurement as well. The Tezumen had realised long ago that everything was getting worse and, having a terrible literalmindedness, had developed a complex system to keep track of how much worse each succeeding day was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContrary to general belief, the Tezumen did invent the wheel. They just had radically different ideas about what you used it for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first chariot that Rincewind had ever seen that was pulled by llamas. That wasn\u0027t what was odd about it. What was odd about it was that it was being carried by people, two holding each side of the axle and running after the animals, their sandalled feet flapping on the flagstones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think it\u0027s got the tribute in it?” said Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the leading chariot seemed to contain, apart from the driver, was a squat, basically cube-shaped man wearing a puma-skin outfit and a feather head-dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe runners panted to a halt, and Rincewind saw that each man wore what would probably be described as a primitive sword, made by affixing shards of obsidian into a wooden club. They looked to him no less deadly than sophisticated, extremely civilised swords. In fact they looked worse. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eric-discworld-9/page-5.html","bookId":1628,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM"}
