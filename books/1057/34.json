The Colonel lay snoring on a satinsofa, a cold chicken on the table at his elbow. He wore his spurs. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jean shook him roughly by the shoulder and asked him where theportrait came from, declaring that he, Jean, had not the smallestwish to keep it. The Colonel woke, but his speech was thick andhis memory confused. His mind was full of his underground passages.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was commander of them all and could not find one. There wassomething in this fact that offended his sense of justice.
