Anyhow, it was when I was on the Utamamula Canal Headworks, and I was chumming with a man called Stovey. You\u0027ve never met him because he belongs to the Bombay side, and if he isn\u0027t really dead by this he ought to be somewhere there now. He was a pukka sweep, and I hated him.

It was really unsafe to speak to him, and he always seemed anxious to murder a coolie or two. With me, of course, he restrained himself a little, but he sulked like a bear for days and days together. As he was the only European society within sixty miles, you can imagine how nice it was for me. He\u0027d sit at table and sulk and stare at the opposite wall by the hour—instead of doing his work. When I pointed out that the Government didn\u0027t send us into these cheerful places to twiddle our thumbs, he glared like a beast. Oh, he was a thorough hog!

Next morning I asked him[Pg 130] if he\u0027d been taken worse. \u0027I\u0027ve been engaged in prayer,\u0027 he said, looking as black as thunder. \u0027A man\u0027s spiritual concerns are his own property.\u0027 One night—he\u0027d kept up these spiritual exercises for about ten days, growing queerer and queerer every day—he said \u0027Good-night\u0027 after dinner, and got up and shook hands with me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Bad sign, that,\" said Revel, sucking industriously at his cheroot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"At first I couldn\u0027t make out what the man wanted. No fellow shakes hands with a fellow he\u0027s living with—least of all such a beast as Stovey.

If it had been any other man I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 simply thrown the lamp at his head. He was calling me all the mean names under the sun, accusing me of misusing my authority and goodness only knows what all. When he had talked himself down one stretch, I had only to say a few words to start him off again, as fresh as a daisy. On my word, this jabbering went on for nearly three hours.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why didn\u0027t you get coolies and have him tied up, if you thought he was mad?\" asked Revel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not a safe business, believe me.

I thought the brute had had a fit at first, but there he was, with his head hanging a little on one side and his mouth open. I knocked up his bearer and told him to take the man to bed. We carried him off and shoved him on his charpoy. He was still asleep, and I didn\u0027t think it worth while to undress him. The fit, whatever it was, had worked itself out, and he was limp and used up. But as I was going to leave the room, and went to turn the lamp down, I looked in the glass and saw that he was watching me between his eyelids. When I spun round he seemed asleep. \u0027That\u0027s your game, is it?\u0027 I thought, and I stood over him long enough to see that he was shamming. Then I cast an eye round the room and saw his Martini in the corner. We were all bullumteers on the Canal works. I couldn\u0027t find the cartridges, so to make all serene I knocked the breech-pin out with the cleaning-rod and went to my own room. I didn\u0027t go to sleep for some time. About one o\u0027clock—our rooms were only divided by a[Pg 133] door of sorts, and my bed was close to it—I heard my friend open a chest of drawers. Then he went for the Martini. Of course, the breech-block came out with a rattle. Then he went back to bed again, and I nearly laughed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Next morning he was doing the genial, hail-fellow-well-met trick. Said he was afraid he\u0027d lost his temper overnight, and apologised for it. About half way through breakfast—he was talking thickly about everything and anything—he said he\u0027d come to the conclusion that a beard was a beastly nuisance and made one stuffy. He was going to shave his. Would I lend him my razors? \u0027Oh, you\u0027re a crafty beast, you are,\u0027 I said to myself. I told him that I was of the other opinion, and finding my razors nearly worn out had chucked them into the Canal only the night before. He gave me one look under his eyebrows and went on with his breakfast. I was in a stew lest the man should cut his throat with one of the breakfast knives, so I kept one eye on him most of the time.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Before I left the bungalow I caught old[Pg 134] Jeewun Singh, one of the mistries on the gates, and gave him strict orders that he was to keep in sight of the Sahib wherever he went and whatever he did; and if he did or tried to do anything foolish, such as jumping down the well, Jeewun Singh was to stop him. The old man tumbled at once, and I was easier in my mind when I saw how he was shadowing Stovey up and down the works. Then I sat down and wrote a letter to old Baggs, the Civil Surgeon at Chemanghath, about sixty miles off, telling him how we stood. The runner left about three o\u0027clock. Jeewun Singh turned up at the end of the day and gave a full, true and particular account of Stovey\u0027s doings.

There were only two letters in the bag, both of which I\u0027d written. I was pretty average angry, but I lay low. At dinner he said he\u0027d got a touch of dysentery and wanted some chlorodyne.[Pg 135] For a man anxious to depart this life he was about as badly equipped as you could wish. Hadn\u0027t even a medicine-chest to play with. He was no more suffering from dysentery than I, but I said I\u0027d give him the chlorodyne, and so I did—fifteen drops, mixed in a wine-glass, and when he asked for the bottle I said that I hadn\u0027t any more.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That night he began praying again, and I just lay in bed and shuddered. He was invoking the most blasphemous curses on my head—all in a whisper, for fear of waking me up—for frustrating what he called his \u0027great and holy purpose.\u0027 You never heard anything like it. But as long as he was praying I knew he was alive, and he ran his praying half through the night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, for the next ten days he was apparently quite rational; but I watched him and told Jeewun Singh to watch him like a cat. I suppose he wanted to throw me off my guard, but I wasn\u0027t to be thrown. I grew thin watching him. Baggs wrote in to say he had gone on tour and couldn\u0027t be found[Pg 136] anywhere in particular for another six weeks. It was a ghastly time.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"One day old Jeewun Singh turned up with a bit of paper that Stovey had given to one of the lohars as a naksha. I thought it was mean work spying into another man\u0027s very plans, but when I saw what was on the paper I gave old Jeewun Singh a rupee. It was a be-auti-ful little breech-pin. The one-idead idiot had gone back to Martini! I never dreamt of such persistence. \u0027Tell me when the lohar gives it to the Sahib,\u0027 I said, and I felt more comfy for a few days. Even if Jeewun Singh hadn\u0027t split I should have known when the new breech-pin was made. The brute came in to dinner with a dashed confident, triumphant air, as if he\u0027d done me in the eye at last; and all through dinner he was fiddling in his waistcoat pocket. He went to bed early. I went, too, and I put my head against the door and listened like a woman. I must have been shivering in my pyjamas for about two hours before my friend went for the dismantled Martini. He could not get the breech-pin to[Pg 137] fit at first. He rummaged about, and then I heard a file go. That seemed to make too much noise to suit his fancy, so he opened the door and went out into the compound, and I heard him, about fifty yards off, filing in the dark at that breech-pin as if he had been possessed. Well, he was, you know. Then he came back to the light, cursing me for keeping him out of his rest and the peace of Abraham\u0027s bosom. As soon as I heard him taking up the Martini, I ran round to his door and tried to enter gaily, as the stage directions say. \u0027Lend me your gun, old man, if you\u0027re awake,\u0027 I said. \u0027There\u0027s a howling big brute of a pariah in my room, and I want to get a shot at it.\u0027 I pretended not to notice that he was standing over the gun, but just pranced up and caught hold of it.
