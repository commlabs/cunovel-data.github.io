There! How’s that, then? It all tastes of blood!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are they spilling it or drinking it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious Thimble stared at Faint as if she’d gone mad. Gods, maybe I have, asking a question like that . ‘Which way will kill us quickest?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep, shuddering breath. ‘East. That army – they’re all going to die.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of what?’ Faint demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know – thirst, maybe. Yes, thirst.’ Her eyes widened. ‘There’s no water, no water at all – I see ground, glittering ground, blinding, sharp as daggers. And bones – endless fields of bones. I see men and women driven mad by the heat. I see children – oh gods – they come walking up like nightmares, like proof of all the crimes we have ever committed.’ Abruptly, horrifyingly, she howled, her hands to her face, and then staggered back and would have fallen if not for Amby, who stepped close to take her weight. She twisted round and buried herself in his embrace. Over her head, he stared at Faint, and gave her a jarring smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadness? Too late, Precious Thimble – and thank the gods you can’t see what we’re seeing . Shivering, Faint turned to the southeast. ‘That way, then.’ Children. Don’t remind me. Some crimes cut close to the bone, too close. No, don’t remind me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her mind she saw Sweetest Sufferance, a face splitting into a smile. ‘ Finally ,’ she muttered, ‘ a decision. Get on with it, Faint .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint nodded for Amby to follow with the sorceress, and then she set out with her hobbling, wincing gait. If they’ve gone too far, we won’t make it. If we get much worse … blood. We’ll either spill it or drink it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered at the armies ahead. Who in Hood’s name were they, and why go this deep into the Wastelands just to fight a stupid battle? And why then split up? And you poor fools marching east. Just a glimpse of where you’re headed tears at her sanity. I pray you turn back before you leave too many lying lifeless on the ground .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWherever you’re going, it can’t be worth it. Nothing in this world is worth it, and you’d be hard pressed to convince me otherwise .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a grunt and glanced back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmby was carrying Precious Thimble in his arms, the smile on his face stretched into a rictus travesty of satisfaction, as if in finding his heart’s desire he was forcing himself to take its fullest pleasure. Precious Thimble’s head lolled against his upper arm, her eyes closed, her mouth half open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s wrong with her?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmby said, ‘Fainted … Faint.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, sod off, you lump of lard.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen thousand furred backs, black, silver and grey, the bodies lean and long. Like iron swords, ten thousand iron swords. They seethed before Setoc’s eyes, they blurred like the honed edges of waves on an angry sea. She was carried along, driven to rearing cliffs, to up-thrust fangs of rotted rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind roared in her ears, roared in and through her, trembling like thunder through every bone of her being. She felt the beasts crashing ashore, felt their fury assailing insensate stone and all the brutal laws that held it in place. They bared teeth at the sky, they bit and chewed shafts of sunlight as if speared through. They howled against the coming of night and in the hunt they stalked their own senseless savagery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are what we are, and facing this enemy what we are is helpless .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho will fight for us? Who will peel lips back to reveal swords of sharp iron?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cliffs ahead reverberated to the onslaught – she drew ever closer. Wolves of Winter, do you see me? Blessed Lord, Proud Lady, is this your summons? Does there await a cave in that ravaged wall? And inside, a Hold of Thrones?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a smell to the wild, a smell that makes the hairs stand on end, that rushes like ice through human veins. There are trails crossing the path, secret passages beneath the canopy. Mice dance on the beaten floor in the instant before we arrive, and we are blind to it all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all the spaces carved out by our fires and our weapons and our axes and our ploughs, we must then fill with that sweating, bitter flood that is pride. In the wastelands of our making we will ourselves to stand as would one exalted and triumphant .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrones of the Wild, thrones of bones and hides and lifeless eyes. Tall as mountains, these Beast Thrones . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-126.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
