It\u0027s the Fremont 5\u0027s territory, a rival of the Latino Blood. Your friend Troy is one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? When I suggested we come here, I never thought about territory or gang affiliation. I just wanted to dance. \"Oh, God. Alex, I put you in danger. Let\u0027s get out of here!\" I say frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex pulls me close and whispers in my ear, \"You only live once, isn\u0027t that what you said? Dance with me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cuts me off with a kiss so powerful I forgot what I was supposed to be upset about. And as soon as I come to my senses, we\u0027re back on the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe beat the odds and dance dangerously close to the sharks, but come out without a scratch. The danger lurking around ends up heightening our awareness of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the girls\u0027 restroom, Darlene is fixing her makeup in the mirror. I see her. She sees me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarlene walks past me without a word. It\u0027s a taste of what it\u0027s like to be a north sider outcast, but I don\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the night, as Alex is walking me to my car, I take his hand in mine and look up at the stars. \"If you could wish on a star right now, what would you wish for?\" I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For time to stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. \" \u0027Cause I could live forever at this moment. What would you wish for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That we\u0027d go to college together. While you want to stop the future from happening, I look forward to it. Wouldn\u0027t it be great if we went to the same school? I mean it, Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls away from me. \"For someone who wanted to take things slow, you sure are plannin\u0027 far in advance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t help it. I applied early decision to the University of Colorado to be close to my sister. That place my parents are sending her is a few miles away from the campus. It wouldn\u0027t hurt to apply, would it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezes my hand. \"Anything to make you smile like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 46 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need an update on the Brittany situation,\" Lucky says while I\u0027m hanging outside the warehouse. \"Guys are makin\u0027 side bets, and most of them are bettin\u0027 on you. They know somethin\u0027 I don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, then look over at Julio, shiny from my wash earlier. If my motorcycle could talk, he\u0027d beg me to save him from Lucky. But I\u0027m not about to spill any info about Brittany. Not yet, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector walks up to us and waves Lucky away. \"We need to talk, Fuentes,\" Hector says in a tone that means business, \"about that favor we were talking about. On Halloween night, you\u0027ll take a rental car, drive it to the drop-off, and exchange the goods for the green. Think you can handle that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother is right. I do have my papa\u0027s blood running through my veins. By doing the drug deal, I\u0027ll secure my future in the Blood, which is my birthright. Other kids inherit money or a family business from their parents. I inherited the Latino Blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothin\u0027 I can\u0027t handle,\" I tell Hector, even as I feel the pit of my stomach lurch. I knowingly lied to Brittany. Her face lit up when she talked about possibly going to college together. I couldn\u0027t tell her the truth, that not only am I staying in the Latino Blood, I\u0027m about to exchange goods for the green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector pats me on the back. \"That\u0027s my loyal brother. I knew the Blood would come before your fear. Somos hermanos, c\u0027no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"!Seguro!\" I answer so he knows I\u0027m loyal to him and the Blood. It isn\u0027t the drug deal I fear. It\u0027s that the drug deal signifies the end of any dreams I had. By doing it, I\u0027ll cross over the line. Like my papa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco is standing a few feet away. I hadn\u0027t even noticed Hector left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wha\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need your help, compa,\" Paco says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me that I-am-Paco-and-I-am-exasperated look. \"Just take a ride with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree minutes later I\u0027m in the passenger seat of a borrowed red Camaro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh. \"You gonna tell me what you want help with or are you keepin\u0027 me in suspense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I\u0027m gonna keep you in suspense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read the WELCOME TO sign on the side of the road. \"Winnetka?\" What does Paco want in this wealthy suburban town?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust,\" Paco says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best friends need to trust each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean back, totally aware I\u0027m brooding like one of those guys in a bad Western movie. I agreed to do a drug deal and now I\u0027m heading into upper-class suburbia for apparently no reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, here it is,\" Paco says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at the sign. \"You\u0027ve got to be kiddin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re plannin\u0027 to rob the place, I\u0027ll stay in the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco rolls his eyes. \"We\u0027re not here to rob a bunch of golfers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why drag me all the way out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My golf swing. Come on, get off your ass and help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fifty-five degrees outside and the middle of October, Paco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all a matter of priority and perception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in the car, contemplating how to get home. Walking will take too long. I don\u0027t know where the closest bus stop is and . . . and . . . and I\u0027m going to kick Paco\u0027s ass for bringing me to a fuckin\u0027 golf range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stalk over to where Paco is setting down a basket of balls. Man, there are probably a hundred of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get that club?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco swings it in the air like a propeller. \"From the guy who rents the balls. You want one so you can hit a few?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco points the end of the golf club at a green wooden bench situated behind him. \"Then sit over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I sit, my gaze wanders to the other guys hitting balls in their little sections, warily eyeing us out of the corners of their eyes. I\u0027m all too aware Paco and I look and dress drastically different from the rest of the guys at the range. Jeans, T-shirts, tattoos, and bandannas on our heads make us stick out while most of the golfers are wearing long-sleeve golf shirts, Dockers, and no distinguishing marks on their skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t normally care, but after the talk with Hector, I want to go home, not be a spectacle. I rest my elbows on my knees, watching Paco make a complete fool of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco takes a little white golf ball and places it on top of a rubber circle inserted into the fake grass. When he swings the golf club, I wince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe club misses the ball and connects with the fake grass instead. Paco swears. The guy next to Paco takes one look at him and moves to another section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco tries again. This time the club connects, but his ball only rolls along the grass in front of him. He keeps trying, but each time Paco swings, he makes a complete ass out of himself. Does he think he\u0027s hitting a hockey puck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You done?\" I ask once he\u0027s gone through half the basket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex,\" Paco says, leaning on the golf club like it\u0027s a cane. \"Do ya think I was meant to play golf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking Paco straight in the eye, I answer, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you talkin\u0027 to Hector. I don\u0027t think you were meant to deal, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why we\u0027re here? You\u0027re tryin\u0027 to make a point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear me out,\" Paco insists. \"I\u0027ve got the keys to the car in my pocket and I\u0027m not goin\u0027 nowhere until I finish hittin\u0027 all of these balls, so you might as well listen. I\u0027m not smart like you. I don\u0027t have choices in life, but you, you\u0027re smart enough to go to college and be a doctor or computer geek or somethin\u0027 like that. Just like I wasn\u0027t meant to hit golf balls, you weren\u0027t meant to deal drugs. Let me do the drop for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way, man. I appreciate you makin\u0027 an ass out of yourself to prove a point, but I know what I need to do,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco sets up a new ball, swings, and yet again the ball rolls away from him. \"That Brittany sure is hot. She goin\u0027 to college?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what Paco is doing; unfortunately my best friend is nothing less than obvious. \"Yep. In Colorado.\" To be close to her sister, the person she cares for more than herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco whistles. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll meet a lot of guys in Colorado. You know, real guys with cowboy hats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy muscles tense. I don\u0027t want to think about it. I ignore Paco until we\u0027re back in the car. \"When are you going to stop stickin\u0027 your ass into my business?\" I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles. \"Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I guess you won\u0027t mind me bargin\u0027 into yours. What happened between you and Isa, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We fooled around. It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might think it\u0027s over, but I don\u0027t think she does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, that\u0027s her problem.\" Paco turns the radio on and blasts the music loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s never dated anyone because he\u0027s scared of getting close to someone. Even Isa isn\u0027t aware of all the abuses he\u0027s endured at home. Believe me, I understand the reasons behind his keeping a distance from a girl he cares about. Because the truth is, sometimes getting close to the fire does actually burn you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 47 Brittany\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paco, what are you doing here?\" The last person I expected to see at my house is Alex\u0027s best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kinda need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure it\u0027s okay?\" he asks nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Well, it probably isn\u0027t okay with my parents, but it is to me. It\u0027s not like my parents will suddenly decide not to send Shelley away. I\u0027m tired of pretending, of being afraid of my mom\u0027s wrath. This guy is Alex\u0027s best friend, and he accepts me. I\u0027m sure it wasn\u0027t easy for him to come here. Opening the door wide, I let Paco in. If he asks me about Isabel, what do I say? She swore me to secrecy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s at the door, Brit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Paco,\" I explain to my mom. \"He\u0027s a friend of mine from school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinner\u0027s on the table,\" my mother hints not too subtly. \"Tell your friend it\u0027s not polite to visit during dinner hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to Paco. \"Want to eat over?\" I\u0027m being rebellious and it feels good. Cathartic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear my mom\u0027s footsteps stomping to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, no thanks,\" Paco says, stifling a laugh. \"I thought maybe we could talk, you know, about Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know if I\u0027m relieved he\u0027s not asking what I know about Isabel, or nervous because if Paco came here it\u0027s serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lead Paco through the house. We pass Shelley in the family room looking at some magazine. \"Shelley, this is Paco. He\u0027s Alex\u0027s friend. Paco, this is my sister, Shelley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mention of Alex\u0027s name, Shelley gives a happy squeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Shelley,\" Paco says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelley smiles wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shell-bell, I need you to do me a favor.\" Shelley bobs her head in response as I whisper, \"I need you to keep Mom occupied while I talk to Paco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelley grins, and I know my sister will come through for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother pops into the room, ignoring me and Paco as she wheels Shelley into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Paco warily as I lead him outside so we can have privacy from eavesdropping mothers. \"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex needs help. He won\u0027t listen to me. A big drug deal is goin\u0027 down and Alex is the elmero mero, the key guy runnin\u0027 the show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex wouldn\u0027t do a drug deal. He promised me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-36.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
