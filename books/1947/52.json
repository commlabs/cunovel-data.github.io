More and more she doubted she’d ever have the opportunity. This conversation might be her only chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now, Warren had started to squirm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Warren,” she said, looking straight at him, “you should know that the new evidence points directly to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe issued a harsh laugh. “This is a joke, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish it was.” She meant that. “The reason I asked to meet you is so I could find out why you’d do such a thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened and he scooted back his chair as if about to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I could only ask you one question,” Justine whispered, “it would be this.” She paused, determined not to lose her composure. “Why, Warren? Why would you want to destroy the restaurant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d gone completely pale. He lowered his gaze and seemed to struggle to find the words. “Seeing you with Seth was…hard, knowing you’d chosen him over me. You were the only woman who ever understood me, the only woman who didn’t hold my sexual inadequacies over my head.” The bitterness in his voice was frightening. “I knew I had to find a way to get you back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Warren.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then that day six or seven months ago when I came in for lunch, I managed to convince you to have a glass of wine with me…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine searched her memory. It’d been the day David Rhodes had come by to have lunch with her grandmother. He’d tried to weasel money out of Charlotte. Justine had been outraged and badly shaken by the events of that afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seemed so tired, so drained.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was,” she agreed but didn’t explain why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seth showed up and when he saw you with me he was—” Warren just shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine remembered that, too. There’d been tension between her and Seth, and they’d had an argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wore that smug look that told me no matter how much I loved and needed you, you were his and always would be his. Nothing,” he said, “absolutely nothing I did would bring you back to me. At that moment, I knew I had to do something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But burn down the restaurant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to hurt Seth, not you,” he said, pleading with her like a repentant child. “I could never hurt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you did, Warren, you hurt us both.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung his head. “I see that now. But I thought of a way to make it up to you. I’d build you another restaurant, bigger and better than the first one. I’d give you the restaurant of your dreams and then you’d see how much I loved you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Warren, you don’t prove your love by hurting other people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his eyes lowered and nodded sadly. “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth and Sheriff Davis walked across the room and stood next to the table. Warren looked up and sighed deeply. “You talked to the dishwasher, didn’t you?” he asked without showing any signs of distress. “He was there that night. He tried to put out the fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I understand.” Sheriff Davis removed his handcuffs from his belt. “Warren Saget, you have the right to remain silent….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, I know,” he snapped irritably. He stood then and held out his hands. Glaring at Seth, he said, “You could never love her the way I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine stood, too, and Seth slipped his arm around her waist. “No one could possibly love my wife more than I do, Warren. I’m sorry it’s come to this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll deny everything,” he sneered. “I have a good attorney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, but we’ve got a confession right here on tape,” Justine said, raising her shirt to reveal the wire taped to her midriff. “We have your confession, Warren, and you made these statements in a public place, in which you couldn’t anticipate privacy. All the bases are covered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheriff Davis clipped on the handcuffs and with everyone in the restaurant looking on, took Warren away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s over,” Seth said as he led Justine from the room. The relief in his voice was unmistakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the end, I nearly couldn’t do it,” she said. “Even knowing what he’d done, I had trouble deceiving him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth turned to face her. “You still got what we needed, and that was a confession. It didn’t matter how you went about it—all that matters is the end result.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t that she loved Warren, but she pitied him and perhaps she always had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t help feeling sorry for him,” she said as Seth opened the car door for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both silent during the drive home. “It’s sad, you know,” she said once they arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell me you actually pity that slimeball.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a way I do,” she admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth didn’t say anything for a long moment. “In a way I do, too.” He smiled at her and together they walked into the house. “We have the whole afternoon to ourselves, don’t we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had expected Warren’s arrest to go this smoothly. “Yes,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve got another two hours before we have to collect Leif.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine threw her arms around her husband’s neck. “Any ideas for what we could do with that time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth chuckled. “Give me a minute and I might have a suggestion.” Then, without warning, he swept her into his arms and carried her into the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why, Seth Gunderson,” she said in an exaggerated Southern accent. “Just what do you have in mind?” She fluttered her eyelashes at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thinking,” her husband said, a moment before his lips claimed hers, “that this would be the perfect opportunity to work on expanding the family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine agreed that was a fine suggestion, indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby Polgar studied the note in his hand. He wasn’t a man who understood fear, but he felt it now. Teri’s life was being threatened. His wife and James had been confronted by ruthless men. The message was clear. These men could kidnap Teri at any time and he could do nothing to protect her. The note told him he was to return to 74 Seaside Avenue and wait for further instructions. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/6-rainier-drive-cedar-cove-6/page-52.html","bookId":1947,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:35 AM"}
