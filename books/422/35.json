How they cast forth the Dead","content":"\u0026nbsp;Then sat them down the warriors to rest them toil-forspent. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But forth of the feast-hall doorway Volker and Hagen went;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And leaning upon their bucklers, as in scorn of foes without,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake they together, casting at the Hunfolk gibe and flout.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then cried the Prince Burgundian, Giselher the thane:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We may not, O friends belovèd, resting longer remain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We must needs first hale the corpses forth of the palace-hall;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For our foes, I say of a surety, again upon us will fall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nowise it befitteth that longer clogging our feet they lie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ere the foe in the storm of battle from us wrest victory,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Deep wounds will we hew full many, and sweet is the thought unto me;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, my heart is set on the war-feast,” said Giselher, “steadfastly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Glad am I that such a war-lord I have!” cried Hagen the grim.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This counsel well beseemeth no meaner knight than him,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But such an one as the young Prince hath proved him to-day in your sight:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for this, O thanes Burgundian, blithe be your hearts and light!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then did they after his counsel, and out through the door they drew\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seven thousand slain men’s corpses, and forth of the palace threw.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Afront of the steps they hurled them adown to the court below.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then wailed from the friends of the slaughtered lamentation and mourning and woe.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was many a man among them whose hurts were not so sore,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But that soon, had he gentle tendance, he were whole again as before,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who yet found death all swiftly, hurled from that cruel height.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Loudly their kin lamented who saw that pitiful sight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then shouted the viol-minstrel, the champion dauntless-souled:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now well do I see how truly the tale unto me was told\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 276}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That this is a land of cravens: like women they wail, these Huns,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They who should now be tending the battle-stricken ones!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then it seemed to a lord of the marches that he spake not in scoffing mood;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And that same lord had a kinsman there fallen in his blood;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he thought from the carnage to bear him, and his arms around him he threw;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the minstrel with a javelin hurled at him, and slew.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then back from the stairway fled they who in hope had been drawing near,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cursing the viol-minstrel in the impotent fury of fear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then caught up Volker a javelin, stubborn-shafted and keen:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shot by one of the Hunfolk against himself had it been.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Across the court he sped it, putting his might to the cast,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That it flew o’er their heads fierce-singing; and Etzel’s men were aghast,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he warned them to safer standing, from the hall-door far away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At his matchless might all people were thrilled with sore dismay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before that hall with Etzel in thousands the Hunfolk stood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now did Volker and Hagen in scornful-reckless mood\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Set them to gall the Hun-king, and with bitter taunts to defy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ere long grim retribution on the heroes came thereby.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It were well,” cried Hagen, “to hearten the folk in the evil day,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the lords of the land should battle in the forefront of the fray,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even as this day battle those true men, even my lords:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They hew the helmets asunder, blood flieth to meet their swords.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No battle-blencher was Etzel: he grasped in wrath and pride\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His shield—“Risk not at their bidding thine own life!” Kriemhild cried.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nay, offer thy shield gold-brimming for a champion of thy war-band.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If thou close with yonder Hagen, death standeth at thy right hand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet the King was a knight so fearless that he would not refrain from the strife—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sooth, now such mighty princes more dearly tender their life!—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Their lord from the fray by his shield-band his servants needs must hale.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then with grim laughter Hagen again at the King ’gan rail:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 277}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good sooth, ’tis a far-away kinship,” he cried with bitter jeer,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That hath drawn this Etzel and Siegfried each unto other so near!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He wantoned with yonder Kriemhild or ever she looked on thee!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What ho, King Etzel the craven, what grudge hast thou against me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the ears of the great Queen tingled the scoffer’s every word:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Black grew the heart of Kriemhild at the thought that his taunt was heard\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of all those vassals of Etzel, when he dared to make her a jest;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And she set her once more to enkindle her champions against that guest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She cried: “Whosoever will smite me yon Hagen of Troneg dead,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And bring for a trophy hither and cast at my feet his head,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For him the shield of Etzel will I fill with gold to the brim,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea also, castles for guerdon and land will I give unto him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wot not why these falter,” the viol-minstrel said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Never have I seen heroes stand so sorely adread,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When offered in all men’s hearing is all that wealth of gold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of a truth, never more will Etzel unto these be gracious-souled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n These things of shame and scorning, on the bread of the King they feed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And behold, they now forsake him in the stress of his sorest need!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of such I behold full many: utterly cowed are they—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they name them heroes!—branded are they with contempt for aye!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) The heart of Etzel the mighty was shaken with grief and groan:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For his kin and his perished liegemen did he make bitter moan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From many a land around him stood knights on every side,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And wept with the King for the sorrow of that heavy festal tide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Once more the aweless Volker set him to gibe and jeer:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Warriors I see full many with false tears weeping here;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But little do they for the helping of their king in his evil case.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They eat the bread of their master to their shame and confusion of face!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) And their best in their hearts acknowledged, “That Volker saith is truth.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And of all that throng was no man more stung with shame and ruth\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Than Iring, Lord of the Marches, a knight from the land of the Dane;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in sooth in no long season he proved it in battle-strain.\n\u003c/div\u003e
