I had no idea what we were going to find when we got there. I hadn\u0027t planned alternate entry strategies, exit strategies, or strategies for keeping my ponytail from blowing in my face. All I knew for certain was that Zach\u0027s hand was gripping mine (despite verifiable research that people are way stealthier when holding on to nothing), and that Bex\u0027s voice was the only familiar thing I could hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chameleon, what did he say again?\" she asked through the comms unit in my ear as Zach and I covered the open ground beyond the ridge at a full run. \"Because we\u0027re searching the database for \u0027tombs,\u0027 but -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not in the database,\" Zach cut in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it some kind of cemetery? We can\u0027t find an entrance on the -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are no recorded entrances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or references to it anywhere,\" Bex finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach looked at me. \"It\u0027s not the kind of place that gets referenced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cameras passing in three, two, drop!\" Liz commanded from her watch post, and Zach and I fell to the ground like stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roll,\" Liz said, and I propelled myself down a steep incline and landed in a muddy ditch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard voices coming from above us, footsteps as the Blackthorne Boys ran past in perfect unison, while Zach and I continued crawling through the mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, it\u0027s not an actual tomb, is it?\" Macey asked. It seemed like an excellent question, but Zach was silent, still crawling away from the buildings and the guards, and toward the mountain that formed the backdrop of the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are the tombs, Zach?\" I asked again when we reached the base of the first hill and climbed out of the ditch and into the shelter of the trees. The ground was rough and steep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked along a path that was overgrown with weeds and brush - as if the wilderness were trying to reclaim it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys, you\u0027re clear now,\" Liz said from two miles away, but I\u0027d already sensed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marching boys were gone. No cameras could possibly reach us through the dense canopy of trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a single ray of moonlight sliced through the limbs. I remember that now - how I could so plainly see the features of Zach\u0027s face, the look in his eyes as he started pushing aside the moss-covered rocks that sat on the steep mountainside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There should be an entrance around here somewhere.\" He kicked at the dead leaves and fallen brush that covered the forest floor. \"It\u0027ll be hidden - made to blend in. but there should be a switch, or maybe . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lever?\" I asked, walking three feet to a tree that grew from the steep mountainside at an angle unlike any of the others. I reached for the only limb in the entire forest that didn\u0027t have a single new leave. \"You mean like this one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caves?\" I heard my own voice echo, even though the word had been barely louder than a whisper. \"The tombs are caves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch your step,\" was Zach\u0027s answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could still hear my roommates chattering in my ear, but the sound dissolved deeper into static with every step behind the hidden door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone walls around us were close and damp, lit by bare, dim bulbs that hung at regular intervals. I had a feeling that we weren\u0027t going underground. It was more like we were going straight through the mountains that were the Blackthorne Institute\u0027s first and perhaps best line of defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Native Americans indigenous to this area used to bury their dead in caves like this,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach offered out of the blue. \"That\u0027s why they call them the tombs. The army used this whole area for weapons testing and training in World War Two. After the war, they found another use for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was strange hearing Zach offer up anything about his past. I wanted to asked for more, but stayed quiet, remembering summers on the ranch and how the baby calves would creep close sometimes, curious and timid, uncertain whom to trust. I knew if I moved too fast I might scare him away, so I just waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t really . . .\" He looked at me. \"We don\u0027t really use them anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How far do they go?\" I asked, mesmerized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many branches and offshoots are there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to tell me why you were so desperate to keep me out of here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped suddenly, and I ran into his chest. It was almost as hard as the stone walls around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll see for yourself soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked for what felt like hours, disabling booby traps and dodging surveillance cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should split up,\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay with me,\" Zach said, like it wasn\u0027t really up for debate The passageway was taller than the ones at the Gallagher Academy. The concrete walls felt more modern. It was a next-generation tunnel, to be sure, but it wasn\u0027t new or nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing about it was anything but functional, and the dank smell and thick cobwebs told me that it hadn\u0027t really functioned in a very long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch your step,\" Zach warned when we reached a sloping portion of the tunnel where water congealed in thick black pools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I bet you say that to all the girls you bring down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach stopped. When he turned, he didn\u0027t even look like the boy I knew. \" No one comes down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive feet ahead, the stone passageway widened. The ceilings rose taller. I could hear the steady drip, drip, drip of water seeping through the cracks in the stone above us and falling into puddles on a concrete floor. But there were no soft edges there, no bright lights. Stepping inside, I realized that we have our fair share of secret underground chambers at the Gallagher Academy, but I had never been anyplace like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChains dangled from the tall ceilings along one wall. A collection of dummies with crude red circles painted on their chests lined another. Stainless-steel tables stood in the middle of the room while cobweb-covered trays with syringes and pliers sat waiting, as if someone might walk in at any moment, brush aside the dust, and continued with some terrible experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t use it anymore,\" Zach said, his voice soft despite the fact that there wasn\u0027t a soul who could have overheard us. Shame seeped into his words as he looked at the damp concrete floor. \"We really don\u0027t use it anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half dozen other passageways opened into this room, and yet I felt the mountain pressing down on me as if there were no way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach . . .\" My voice caught in my throat. \"What is this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really don\u0027t know what kind of school this is, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a spy school,\" I snapped, blood pounding in my veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head slowly. Even in the dim light I saw his eyes go wide. \"Not spies. Not always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Gallagher Girl - a school in the middle of nowhere for troubled boys with no other place to go? You know what this place is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the room around us, thought about the rifle ranges and marching boys, about the hours my roommates and I had spent last spring searching for any clues about Blackthorne and finding nothing but secrets and lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"Mr. Solomon went here. He -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was starting to change things,\" Zach finished. He stepped closer. \"You know what we are, Gallagher Girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I shook my head. \"You can\u0027t be . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of terms for what Zach was trying to say. Killers. Wet work artists. But all I could do was look at the boy who stood beside me - the boy I barely knew - and whisper, \" Assassins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you this place was made to prepare for war - World War Two, the Cold War, and all the wars that could have happened but didn\u0027t. Or haven\u0027t yet.\" He stared at me, almost pleading as he whispered, \"We don\u0027t use it anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this why they don\u0027t trust you? The Baxters . . . Aunt Abby -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are smart people with good instincts.\" He looked away, then back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that doesn\u0027t make any sense, Zach. You didn\u0027t build this place. What could you have possibly done that is so terrible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Standing there, hundreds of feet into the mountain, there was no way to know how far the shout reverberated through the maze of stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really. You can tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I really can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon leaning the original purpose of the Blackthorne Institute for Boys, The operative thought she might more easily understand the Asset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(But it turns out, potential future assassin-slash-spy boys are the most confusing boys of all.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took another hour to reach it. Twice we found the tunnels blocked by a cave-in, a hundred tons of stone standing in our way. Once, Zach admitted we were on the wrong path, and we had to backtrack a hundred yards. We passed three more rooms like the first we\u0027d seen - a dozen locked doorways and concrete bunkers so dark I couldn\u0027t see a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been this deep,\" he admitted. Somehow, I knew exactly how he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to sound ungrateful or anything, but do you know where we\u0027re going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled for what felt like the first time in hours. \"Not exactly.\" He reached for my hand, bent to ease beneath a low-hanging arch. \"Joe told me where he left it, just in case . . . in case of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where\u0027s that?\" I asked, but Zach stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed. \"In there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was large - two stories tall with a t least a half dozen tunnels spiraling off of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, just standing there, I knew we\u0027d finally reached the center of the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zach and I stepped onto a small metal landing on the second story, I looked down on the room below us. It was crude and basic. Metal stairs ran down to the lower floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelves and filings cabinets lined the walls. And on every inch of surface there were files and boxes and relics of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s . . .\" Zach started slowly. \"It\u0027s sort of like Blackthorne\u0027s version of Sublevel Two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him down the stairs and watched him go to the far side of the room and squat down beside a rusty shelf. I held my breath as he reached, stretching as far as he could, then pulled out a spiral notebook wrapped tightly in plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" I asked. It looked so plain - like a million other notebooks carried by a million other kids. Finally, I truly understood the fact I\u0027d known for months: Joe Solomon had been sixteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach tucked the journal into his belt and under his jacket, then took my hand. Wordlessly, we climbed the metal stairs and started back down the tunnel from which we\u0027d come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed so easy. Our mission was over. We\u0027d won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was when we heard the voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first thought was that the Blackthorne security team had found us - that we\u0027d missed a motion sensor or tripped a silent alarm - and I started preparing my excuses . . . Zach was my boyfriend. I was there on a dare. Breaking into Blackthorne was the best extra credit project ever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Zach and I dropped to our stomachs and crawled back to the metal landing that overlooked the massive storage space below, and . . . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/only-the-good-spy-young-gallagher-girls-4/page-24.html","bookId":2749,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM"}
