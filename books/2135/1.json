I nearly ignored it. Nearly. I mean, she was so very close to having this guy in tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept I knew this was a client at the door. And clients paid the bills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reluctantly clicked off the show, set aside the Windex bottle and rag I had forgotten I was holding, and headed for the front door. As I did so, I instinctively reached up for the pair of Oakley wraparound sunglasses that were no longer there. My next conditioned movement was to check my arms and face and hands for sunscreen - which wasn\u0027t there, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn\u0027t there, and wasn\u0027t needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is, not since I\u0027d donned the emerald medallion two weeks ago. A medallion that had literally changed my life. A medallion that, curiously, no longer existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo weeks ago, shortly after watching my first sunrise in seven years, I had reached down for the medallion, only to discover it was missing. Left behind had been a disc-shaped burn in my skin and the empty leather strap that had been holding the medallion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang had thought my body absorbed the medallion. I had thought that sounded crazy as hell. Fang had reminded me that a skin-absorbing medallion was actually one of the least-craziest things to happen to me in seven years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, two weeks later, there still remained a faint outline of the medallion on my upper chest, seared into my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m such a weirdo, I thought, and settled for reaching up and checking on my hair. Since mirrors were still out of the question, I had become a master at feeling my way through a good hair day. At least, I hoped they were good hair days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stood before the front door, a lingering trepidation remained. After all, sunlight had been my enemy for so many years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can do this, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I did. I opened the front door wide as sunlight splashed in. Brilliant sunlight. Splashing over me, but my skin felt...nothing. I felt nothing, and that was the greatest feeling of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo searing pain. No gasping sounds. No stumbling around and covering my eyes. No shrinking like a monster from the light of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a weirdo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe. But now, not so weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, I was wearing torn jeans and a cute blouse, a sleeveless blouse, no less. Most importantly, I wasn\u0027t wearing multiple layers of clothing or one of my epic sunhats. Or satellite dishes, as a client had once called them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just me. And that felt good. Damned good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man standing in the doorway was smaller than I expected. He was wearing a Chicago Bulls tank top and basketball shorts and high-top sneakers. He looked like he might have just stepped off the courts or raided a Foot Locker. The detailed tattoos that ran up and down his arms - and even along his neck - seemed to tell a story about something, although I couldn\u0027t puzzle it out at first blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Russell?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s me,\" he said softly. \"You must be Ms. Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dipped his head in a way that I found adorable. The dip was part greeting, part submission, and partly to let me know that he came in peace. We shook hands and I led him to my office in the back of my house, passing Anthony\u0027s empty room along the way. Well, not entirely empty. A pair of his white briefs sat in the middle of the floor, briefs that had seen better - and whiter - days. I reached in and quickly shut the door before my client got a good look at the mother of all skid marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuperman had Lex Luthor. Batman had the Joker. I had Anthony\u0027s skid marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce safe in my office, I showed Russell to one of my client chairs and took a seat behind my cluttered desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what can I do for you, Russell?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacky says you might be able to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacky, the boxing trainer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacky say anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only that you are a freak of nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned. \"He\u0027s always thought highly of me. What kind of help do you need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me. Straight in the eye. He held my gaze for a heartbeat or two, then said, \"Somebody died accidentally...except I don\u0027t think it was an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and did a quick psychic scan of the young man sitting before me. I sensed a heavy heart. Pain. Confusion. I sensed a lot of things. Most important, I did not sense that he was a killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about it,\" I said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-1.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
