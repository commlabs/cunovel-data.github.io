Arya was supposed to join them, but she was late coming back from her dancinglesson.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “His leg?” Jeyne said uncertainly. She was a pretty, dark-haired girl of Sansa’s own age. “Did SerLoras hurt his leg?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not his leg,” Sansa said, nibbling delicately at a chicken leg. “Father’s leg, silly. It hurts himever so much, it makes him cross. Otherwise I’m certain he would have sent Ser Loras.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her father’s decision still bewildered her. When the Knight of Flowers had spoken up, she’d beensure she was about to see one of Old Nan’s stories come to life. Ser Gregor was the monster and SerLoras the true hero who would slay him. He even looked a true hero, so slim and beautiful, withgolden roses around his slender waist and his rich brown hair tumbling down into his eyes. And thenFather had refused him! It had upset her more than she could tell. She had said as much to SeptaMordane as they descended the stairs from the gallery, but the septa had only told her it was not herplace to question her lord father’s decisions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was when Lord Baelish had said, “Oh, I don’t know, Septa. Some of her lord father’sdecisions could do with a bit of questioning. The young lady is as wise as she is lovely.” He made asweeping bow to Sansa, so deep she was not quite sure if she was being complimented or mocked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Septa Mordane had been very upset to realize that Lord Baelish had overheard them. “The girl wasjust talking, my lord,” she’d said. “Foolish chatter. She meant nothing by the comment.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lord Baelish stroked his little pointed beard and said, “Nothing? Tell me, child, why would youhave sent Ser Loras?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa had no choice but to explain about heroes and monsters. The king’s councillor smiled. “Well,those are not the reasons I’d have given, but …” He had touched her cheek, his thumb lightly tracingthe line of a cheekbone. “Life is not a song, sweetling. You may learn that one day to your sorrow.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa did not feel like telling all that to Jeyne, however; it made her uneasy just to think back on it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ser Ilyn’s the King’s Justice, not Ser Loras,” Jeyne said. “Lord Eddard should have sent him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa shuddered. Every time she looked at Ser Ilyn Payne, she shivered. He made her feel asthough something dead were slithering over her naked skin. “Ser Ilyn’s almost like a second monster.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I’m glad Father didn’t pick him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Lord Beric is as much a hero as Ser Loras. He’s ever so brave and gallant.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I suppose,” Sansa said doubtfully. Beric Dondarrion was handsome enough, but he was awfullyold, almost twenty-two; the Knight of Flowers would have been much better. Of course, Jeyne hadbeen in love with Lord Beric ever since she had first glimpsed him in the lists. Sansa thought she wasbeing silly; Jeyne was only a steward’s daughter, after all, and no matter how much she mooned afterhim, Lord Beric would never look at someone so far beneath him, even if she hadn’t been half hisage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It would have been unkind to say so, however, so Sansa took a sip of milk and changed the subject.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I had a dream that Joffrey would be the one to take the white hart,” she said. It had been more of a wish, actually, but it sounded better to call it a dream. Everyone knew that dreams were prophetic.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e White harts were supposed to be very rare and magical, and in her heart she knew her gallant princewas worthier than his drunken father.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A dream? Truly? Did Prince Joffrey just go up to it and touch it with his bare hand and do it noharm?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” Sansa said. “He shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for me.” In the songs, theknights never killed magical beasts, they just went up to them and touched them and did them noharm, but she knew Joffrey liked hunting, especially the killing part. Only animals, though. Sansa wascertain her prince had no part in murdering Jory and those other poor men; that had been his wickeduncle, the Kingslayer. She knew her father was still angry about that, but it wasn’t fair to blame Joff.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That would be like blaming her for something that Arya had done.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I saw your sister this afternoon,” Jeyne blurted out, as if she’d been reading Sansa’s thoughts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “She was walking through the stables on her hands. Why would she do a thing like that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m sure I don’t know why Arya does anything.” Sansa hated stables, smelly places full ofmanure and flies. Even when she went riding, she liked the boy to saddle the horse and bring it to herin the yard. “Do you want to hear about the court or not?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I do,” Jeyne said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There was a black brother,” Sansa said, “begging men for the Wall, only he was kind of old andsmelly.” She hadn’t liked that at all. She had always imagined the Night’s Watch to be men likeUncle Benjen. In the songs, they were called the black knights of the Wall. But this man had beencrookbacked and hideous, and he looked as though he might have lice. If this was what the Night’sWatch was truly like, she felt sorry for her bastard half brother, Jon. “Father asked if there were anyknights in the hall who would do honor to their houses by taking the black, but no one came forward,so he gave this Yoren his pick of the king’s dungeons and sent him on his way. And later these twobrothers came before him, freeriders from the Dornish Marches, and pledged their swords to theservice of the king. Father accepted their oaths …”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jeyne yawned. “Are there any lemon cakes?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa did not like being interrupted, but she had to admit, lemon cakes sounded more interestingthan most of what had gone on in the throne room. “Let’s see,” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The kitchen yielded no lemon cakes, but they did find half of a cold strawberry pie, and that wasalmost as good. They ate it on the tower steps, giggling and gossiping and sharing secrets, and Sansawent to bed that night feeling almost as wicked as Arya.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next morning she woke before first light and crept sleepily to her window to watch Lord Bericform up his men. They rode out as dawn was breaking over the city, with three banners going beforethem; the crowned stag of the king flew from the high staff, the direwolf of Stark and Lord Beric’sown forked lightning standard from shorter poles. It was all so exciting, a song come to life; theclatter of swords, the flicker of torchlight, banners dancing in the wind, horses snorting andwhinnying, the golden glow of sunrise slanting through the bars of the portcullis as it jerked upward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Winterfell men looked especially fine in their silvery mail and long grey cloaks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alyn carried the Stark banner. When she saw him rein in beside Lord Beric to exchange words, itmade Sansa feel ever so proud. Alyn was handsomer than Jory had been; he was going to be a knightone day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Tower of the Hand seemed so empty after they left that Sansa was even pleased to see Aryawhen she went down to break her fast. “Where is everyone?” her sister wanted to know as she rippedthe skin from a blood orange. “Did Father send them to hunt down Jaime Lannister?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa sighed. “They rode with Lord Beric, to behead Ser Gregor Clegane.” She turned to SeptaMordane, who was eating porridge with a wooden spoon. “Septa, will Lord Beric spike Ser Gregor’shead on his own gate or bring it back here for the king?” She and Jeyne Poole had been arguing overthat last night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The septa was horror-struck. “A lady does not discuss such things over her porridge. Where areyour courtesies, Sansa? I swear, of late you’ve been near as bad as your sister.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What did Gregor do?” Arya asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people, women and children too.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Arya screwed up her face in a scowl. “Jaime Lannister murdered Jory and Heward and Wyl, andthe Hound murdered Mycah. Somebody should have beheaded them.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s not the same,” Sansa said. “The Hound is Joffrey’s sworn shield. Your butcher’s boyattacked the prince.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e r’s boyattacked the prince.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Liar,” Arya said. Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed between herfingers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Go ahead, call me all the names you want,” Sansa said airily. “You won’t dare when I’m marriedto Joffrey. You’ll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace.” She shrieked as Arya flung the orangeacross the table. It caught her in the middle of the forehead with a wet squish and plopped down intoher lap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You have juice on your face, Your Grace,” Arya said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was running down her nose and stinging her eyes. Sansa wiped it away with a napkin. When shesaw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress, she shrieked again. “You’rehorrible,” she screamed at her sister. “They should have killed you instead of Lady!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Septa Mordane came lurching to her feet. “Your lord father will hear of this! Go to your chambers,at once. At once!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Me too?” Tears welled in Sansa’s eyes. “That’s not fair.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The matter is not subject to discussion. Go!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa stalked away with her head up. She was to be a queen, and queens did not cry. At least notwhere people could see. When she reached her bedchamber, she barred the door and took off herdress. The blood orange had left a blotchy red stain on the silk. “I hate her!” she screamed. She balledup the dress and flung it into the cold hearth, on top of the ashes of last night’s fire. When she sawthat the stain had bled through onto her underskirt, she began to sob despite herself. She ripped off therest of her clothes wildly, threw herself into bed, and cried herself back to sleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was midday when Septa Mordane knocked upon her door. “Sansa. Your lord father will see younow.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa sat up. “Lady,” she whispered. For a moment it was as if the direwolf was there in the room,looking at her with those golden eyes, sad and knowing. She had been dreaming, she realized. Ladywas with her, and they were running together, and … and … trying to remember was like trying tocatch the rain with her fingers. The dream faded, and Lady was dead again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sansa.” The rap came again, sharply. “Do you hear me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, Septa,” she called out. “Might I have a moment to dress, please?” Her eyes were red fromcrying, but she did her best to make herself beautiful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lord Eddard was bent over a huge leather-bound book when Septa Mordane marched her into thesolar, his plaster-wrapped leg stiff beneath the table. “Come here, Sansa,” he said, not unkindly, whenthe septa had gone for her sister. “Sit beside me.” He closed the book.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Septa Mordane returned with Arya squirming in her grasp. Sansa had put on a lovely pale greendamask gown and a look of remorse, but her sister was still wearing the ratty leathers and roughspunshe’d worn at breakfast. “Here is the other one,” the septa announced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My thanks, Septa Mordane. I would talk to my daughters alone, if you would be so kind.” Thesepta bowed and left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Arya started it,” Sansa said quickly, anxious to have the first word. “She called me a liar andthrew an orange at me and spoiled my dress, the ivory silk, the one Queen Cersei gave me when I wasbetrothed to Prince Joffrey. She hates that I’m going to marry the prince. She tries to spoil everything,Father, she can’t stand for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Enough, Sansa.” Lord Eddard’s voice was sharp with impatience.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Arya raised her eyes. “I’m sorry, Father. I was wrong and I beg my sweet sister’s forgiveness.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa was so startled that for a moment she was speechless. Finally she found her voice. “Whatabout my dress?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Maybe … I could wash it,” Arya said doubtfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Washing won’t do any good,” Sansa said. “Not if you scrubbed all day and all night. The silk isruined.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then I’ll … make you a new one,” Arya said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa threw back her head in disdain. “You? You couldn’t sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their father sighed. “I did not call you here to talk of dresses. I’m sending you both back toWinterfell.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the second time Sansa found herself too stunned for words. She felt her eyes grow moist again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You can’t,” Arya said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Please, Father,” Sansa managed at last. “Please don’t.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eddard Stark favored his daughters with a tired smile. “At last we’ve found something you agreeon.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I didn’t do anything wrong,” Sansa pleaded with him. “I don’t want to go back.” She lovedKing’s Landing; the pagaentry of the court, the high lords and ladies in their velvets and silks andgemstones, the great city with all its people. The tournament had been the most magical time of herwhole life, and there was so much she had not seen yet, harvest feasts and masked balls and mummershows. She could not bear the thought of losing it all. “Send Arya away, she started it, Father, I swearit. I’ll be good, you’ll see, just let me stay and I promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as thequeen.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Father’s mouth twitched strangely. “Sansa, I’m not sending you away for fighting, though the godsknow I’m sick of you two squabbling. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety. Three of mymen were cut down like dogs not a league from where we sit, and what does Robert do? He goeshunting.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Arya was chewing at her lip in that disgusting way she had. “Can we take Syrio back with us?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who cares about your stupid dancing master?” Sansa flared. “Father, I only just nowremembered, I can’t go away, I’m to marry Prince Joffrey.” She tried to smile bravely for him. “I lovehim, Father, I truly truly do, I love him as much as Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon theDragonknight, as much as Jonquil loved Ser Florian. I want to be his queen and have his babies.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sweet one,” her father said gently, “listen to me. When you’re old enough, I will make you amatch with a high lord who’s worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong. This match withJoffrey was a terrible mistake. That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He is!” Sansa insisted. “I don’t want someone brave and gentle, I want him. We’ll be ever sohappy, just like in the songs, you’ll see. I’ll give him a son with golden hair, and one day he’ll be theking of all the realm, the greatest king that ever was, as brave as the wolf and as proud as the lion.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Arya made a face. “Not if Joffrey’s his father,” she said. “He’s a liar and a craven and anyhow he’sa stag, not a lion.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa felt tears in her eyes. “He is not! He’s not the least bit like that old drunken king,” shescreamed at her sister, forgetting herself in her grief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Father looked at her strangely. “Gods,” he swore softly, “out of the mouth of babes …” He shoutedfor Septa Mordane. To the girls he said, “I am looking for a fast trading galley to take you home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These days, the sea is safer than the kingsroad. You will sail as soon as I can find a proper ship, withSepta Mordane and a complement of guards … and yes, with Syrio Forel, if he agrees to enter myservice. But say nothing of this. It’s better if no one knows of our plans. We’ll talk again tomorrow.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sansa cried as Septa Mordane marched them down the steps. They were going to take it all away;the tournaments and the court and her prince, everything, they were going to send her back to thebleak grey walls of Winterfell and lock her up forever. Her life was over before it had begun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Stop that weeping, child,” Septa Mordane said sternly. “I am certain your lord father knows whatis best for you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It won’t be so bad, Sansa,” Arya said. “We’re going to sail on a galley. It will be an adventure,and then we’ll be with Bran and Robb again, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest.” She touched heron the arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hodor!” Sansa yelled. “You ought to marry Hodor, you’re just like him, stupid and hairy andugly!” She wrenched away from her sister’s hand, stormed into her bedchamber, and barred the doorbehind her.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1029/30960.html","bookId":217,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:09:12 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:09:12 AM"}
