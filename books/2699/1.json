Well, not exactly invisible. A lot of us have hair dyed in four colors, or wear five-inch platform sneakers, or carry enough metal in our skin that it\u0027s a hassle getting on an airplane. Quite visible, actually, come to think of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we don\u0027t wear signs saying what we are. After all, if you knew what we were up to, we couldn\u0027t work our magic. We have to observe carefully and push and prompt you in ways you don\u0027t notice. Like good teachers, we let you think you\u0027ve discovered the truth on your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you need us. Someone has to guide you, to mold you, to make sure that today turns into yesterday on schedule. Because frankly, without us to monitor the situation, who knows what would get crammed down your throats?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not like you can just start making your own decisions, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, if we\u0027re supposed to be secret, why am I writing this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that\u0027s a long story. That\u0027s this story, the one you\u0027re holding in your hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s about how I met Jen. She isn\u0027t one of us or one of you, either. She\u0027s on top of the whole pyramid, quietly making her contribution. Trust me, you need her. We all do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s also about the Jammers, who I\u0027m pretty sure really do exist. Probably. If they\u0027re real, then they\u0027re crazy smart, and they\u0027ve got big plans. They\u0027re the bad guys, the ones trying to bring the system down. They want to make people like me redundant, unnecessary, ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey want to set you free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the funny thing is, I think I\u0027m on their side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. Is that enough previews for you? Can you pay attention long enough for me to do this in order? Is it time for the feature presentation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s get started, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CAN I TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR SHOE?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoelaces, actually. The way you tied them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Yeah, sure, I guess. Pretty skate, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. That week skate meant \"cool,\" like dope or rod once did. And this girl\u0027s laces were cool. Fuzzy and red, they looped through the middle eyelet repeatedly on one side, spreading out in a fan on the other. Kind of like the old rising-sun Japanese flag, but sideways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about seventeen, the same as me. Gray sweatshirt over camo pants, hair dyed so black that it turned blue when the sun hit it through the trees. The shoes were off-brand black runners, the logo markings erased with a black laundry pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefinitely an Innovator, I thought. They tend to specialize, looking like Logo Exiles until you get close, until you see that one flourish. All their energies focused on a single element.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike shoelaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out my phone and pointed it at her foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened and she gave the Nod. My phone for that month, made by a certain company in Finland, was getting a lot of the Nod, the slight incline of the head that means, I saw that in a magazine and I already want it. Of course, at another level the Nod also means, Now that I\u0027ve seen an actual person with that phone, I really, really have to get one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, that\u0027s what the certain Finnish company was hoping when they mailed it to me. So there I was, doing two jobs at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone took its picture, signaling success by playing a sample of a certain dysfunctional father saying, \"Sweet, sweet chocolate.\" The sample did not get the Nod, and 1 made a mental note to change it. Homer was out; Lisa was in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the image on the phone\u0027s little screen, which looked clear enough to copy the lacework back at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\" An edge of suspicion in her voice now. Exactly why was I taking a picture of her laces?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment of awkward silence, the kind that sometimes follows after taking a picture of a stranger\u0027s shoe. You think by now I\u0027d be used to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away to look at the river. I\u0027d run into my shoelace Innovator in the East River Park, a strip of grass and promenade between the FDR Drive and the water. It\u0027s one of the few places where you can tell that Manhattan is an island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was carrying a basketball, probably had been shooting hoops on the weedy courts under Manhattan Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was here working, like I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA big container ship eased by on the water, as slow as a minute hand. Across the river was Brooklyn, looking industrial, the Domino Sugar factory waiting patiently to be turned into an art gallery or housing for millionaires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to smile once more and keep on walking, but she spoke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else does it do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My phone?\" The list of features was on my tongue, but this was the part of the job I didn\u0027t like (which is why you will read no product placement in these pages, if I can possibly help it). I shrugged, trying not to sound like a salesman. \"MP3 player, date book, texting. And the camera can shoot like ten seconds of video.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip, gave another Nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very crappy video,\" I admitted. It was not my job to lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you call people on it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, it - \" Then I realized she had to be kidding. \"Yes, you can actually call people on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was even better than her shoelaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he imagined everybody in the country having one big party line. We\u0027d all listen to concerts on the phone, or maybe everyone would pick up and sing the national anthem together. Of course, a somewhat more popular use of the telephone turned out to be one person talking to one other person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first computers were designed for naval gunnery and code breaking. And when the Internet was created, it was supposed to be for controlling the country after a nuclear war. But guess what? Most people use them for e-mailing and IM-ing. One person communicating with one other person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the pattern?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Hunter,\" I said, returning her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Jennifer was the most popular girl\u0027s name in the 1970s and number two in the 1980s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sorry.\" Sometimes the facts in my head get bored and decide to take a walk in my mouth. Frequently this is a bad thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No, I know what you mean. There\u0027s Jens all over the place these days. I was thinking of changing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jennifer did drop to fourteenth place in the 1990s. Possibly from overexposure.\" I winced when I realized I\u0027d said this out loud. \"But I think it\u0027s a nice name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat save, huh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too, but I get bored, you know? Same name all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rebranding,\" I said, nodding. \"Everyone\u0027s doing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, and I found that we\u0027d started walking together. On a Thursday the park was pretty empty, mostly joggers, dog walkers, and a couple of old guys trying to catch something in the river. We ducked under their fishing lines, which flickered from invisible to brilliant in the summer sun. Behind the metal guardrail the river sloshed against concrete, agitated by a small boat motoring past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, how\u0027s Hunter doing?\" she asked. \"The name, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really want to know?\" I checked her smile for signs of derision. Not everyone appreciates the pleasures of socialsecurity.gov\u0027s name-ranking database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s no Jennifer, but it\u0027s moving up. Hunter was barely in the top four hundred when I was born, but it\u0027s a solid number thirty-two these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. So you were way ahead of the crowd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I guess.\" I took a sidelong glance at her, wondering if she\u0027d figured me out already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJen bounced the basketball once and let it rise into the air in front of her, ringing like a bell, before catching it with long fingers. She studied its longitude lines for a moment, spinning it before her green eyes like a globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, you wouldn\u0027t want your name to get too popular, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would suck,\" I agreed. \"Witness the Britney epidemic of the mid-1990s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered, and my phone rang. The theme from The Twilight Zone, right on cue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" I said, holding it up for Jen. \"It\u0027s doing its phone thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe display veadshugrrl, which meant work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Mandy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hunter? Are you doing anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you do a tasting? It\u0027s kind of an emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. The client wants to put an advertisement on the air over the weekend, but they\u0027re not sure about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandy Wilkins always called her employers \"the client,\" even though she\u0027d worked for them for two years. They were a certain athletic shoe company named after a certain Greek god. Maybe she didn\u0027t like using four-letter words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to get together whoever I can,\" Mandy said. \"The client needs to make a decision in a couple of hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much does it pay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Officially, just a pair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got way too many pairs,\" I said. A trunk full of shoes, not counting the ones I\u0027d given away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about fifty bucks? Out of my own pocket. I need you, Hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Mandy, whatever.\" I looked at Jen, who was scrolling absently through numbers, politely not listening, maybe a little saddened by how old and decrepit her own phone was (at least six months). I made a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I bring someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, sure. We need more bodies. But are they... you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJen glanced at me, her eyes narrowing, beginning to realize that I was talking about her. The sun was catching more blue in her hair. I could see that she\u0027d dyed a few slender strands bright purple, hidden underneath the black outer layers, letting glimpses of color through when the wind stirred her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what tasting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cool tasting,\" I repeated. \"But that\u0027s just what Mandy and I call them. Officially it\u0027s a \u0027focus group. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Focusing on what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her the name of the client, which did not get the Nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. \"But you get a free pair and fifty bucks.\" Once the words had left my mouth, I wondered if Mandy would cough up money for Jen as well as me. Well, if she didn\u0027t, Jen could always have my fifty. It was random money anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wondered why I had invited her. Usually people in my profession don\u0027t like competition. It\u0027s one of those jobs, like politician, where there\u0027s already too many and everyone who\u0027s never tried it thinks they could do it better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds kind of weird,\" Jen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"It\u0027s just a job. You get paid for your opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We look at shoes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We watch an ad. Thirty seconds of TV, fifty bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked into the currents of the river, having a two-second debate inside her head. I knew what she was thinking. Am I being exploited? Am I selling out? Am I pulling a scam? Is this a trick? Who do I think I\u0027m fooling? Who cares what I think, anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve thought all those things myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Hey. Fifty bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let my breath out, just then realizing I\u0027d been holding it. \"My thoughts exactly.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/so-yesterday/page-1.html","bookId":2699,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:56 AM"}
