The earth was stained with blood and bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside headquarters, two behemoths roared ferociously in their entanglement. Every strike sent tremors through the land, as if forming an unending earthquake. This sort of remarkable battle was uncommon even in the central continent, and deserved to be recorded as a legendary one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intense confrontation had lasted a full day, yet not the creatures, nor the Magi nor the Warlocks showed traces of backing down. The Magi could bear the intensity of the battle, and the two giant creatures could do it even more easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, Faisal wore a displeased look from within the command room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The East Zone is 37% damaged, the city walls 55%. The energy consumed by the Duo Serpent Annihilator is too large, 67% of our combined storage is already depleted. We can’t keep going much longer…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could there not be a price be paid for them to maintain a Morning Star realm combat strength?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kyasha Beast depended on a frightening amount of food as sustenance. On the other hand, the Warlocks of the Ouroboros Clan could only use the stored energy from the multiple Magus Towers to power the Duo Serpent Annihilator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaisal understood that a puppet would always remain a puppet. Once the energy supply was terminated, the Duo Serpent Annihilator would revert back to its original form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining energy was insufficient for them to continue holding the fort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this went on, with the exhaustion of their trump card, the Ouroboros Clan looked to be set for extermination…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mentor! Please come back as soon as you can!” It didn’t matter what Faisal thought previously. His pleas now were extremely sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the Family! For the bloodline! For the glory of our Warlocks!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the battlefield at the West Zone, Freya was covered in blood from head to toe, multiple cuts all across her body. Yet, she fought on through sheer force of will and obstinance, directly blocking the Demon Magus ahead of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Admit your defeat! You no longer have the protection of your Morning Star Magi, you are destined to fall…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demon Magus chief’ was out of breath, as he spoke sentimentally, ”There are few Magi who can sustain battle with me for over 30 hours…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…” Looking around at the messy battlefield filled with corpses of bloodline Warlocks, Freya shut her eyes for a moment. When she opened them again, they glowed with ferocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I vow not to yield! The glory of the bloodline Warlocks cannot perish in my hands!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a foolish decision!“ the chief chided, ”If it is so, I will not show any mercy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if a seal had been unlocked, the iron chain on his right hand cracked apart, snapping off and dropping down in segments. Dark black flames rose continuously from the arm, and Freya’s previous sense of danger had increased tenfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This Demon’s Arm is a precious treasure that I acquired after braving countless dangers…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA terrifying arm, completely coated with scales and tipped with sharp claws, was revealed as the chain broke. Compared to the transformation of the other members of the Demon Magus Army, the horror that this arm exuded was far more terrifying. This could be considered a true Demon’s Arm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Crystal Phase Magi that have fallen to this arm number seven. Today, you shall be the eighth!” The chief roared, swinging his arm towards the front. A frightening black blaze erupted, barricading the whole area like a cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the allied army winning, a loud humph sounded, audible to the entire region. A Magus appeared in the middle of the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith eyes of silver and brows as sharp as swords and a Magus robe, decorated with the images of tortured demons, draped over his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he just stood silently in empty space, his presence generated a strong domain that had the whole Ouroboros Clan headquarters engulfed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn but a moment, the chaos of the battlefield had died down, giving birth to a deathly silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the Kyasha Beast and Duo Serpent Annihilator had stopped in the middle of their intense battle. They felt a huge, imminent threat from this tiny human body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Demon Hunter Cyril! Why did he show himself in advance?” the red-haired female Magus asked in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cyril, it’s said that you’re a person who doesn’t bother with reputation!” the green haired Magus looked unimpressed, ”Seeing the positive circumstances on our side, you must have rushed here to forcibly take credit for it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s an exalted Morning Star Magus, why would he snatch anything from you?” The female Magus covered her mouth and sniggered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe… Cyril’s reputation amongst Morning Star Magi… You will find out soon enough…” the male Magus smiled bitterly. In the world of Morning Star Magi, everyone knew that Demon Hunter Cyril lacked all form of chivalry. He was overbearing and shameless, seizing the resources and treasures of lower-ranked Magi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you not going to act anymore?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me? How can I interfere?” The male Magus spread out his hand and gestured, “Everyone clearly has made some deals with the Demon Hunter. In front of a Morning Star Magus, I am but a slightly bigger ant, no more than that…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThereafter, he laughed at himself and continued, ”No matter what, with the addition of the Demon Hunter, this battle will end soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the battlefield, the Warlocks who had yet to reach the Hydro Phase were confined by the enormous pressure, and even moving seemed to be difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven rank 3 Crystal Phase nobles were helpless as they realised that their ability to gather elemental particles had been halved. Even activating their spiritual force proved to be extremely difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the effect of the domain of a Morning Star Magus, all lower-ranked Magi were like ants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s over! It’s all over!” Faisal slid to the ground, witnessing the ruthless massacre of the Warlocks. His expression turned deathly pale as he felt the life draining out from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the support of the domain of the Demon Hunter, the allied military immediately stomped out many regions of defence, even as the last bit of the defensive barrier was destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the centre of it all, Cyril sneered in mid-air. A projection of huge sharp claws appeared and it reached out and attacked the source of energy at the city center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Po!* A colourful barrier appeared, blocking the sharp claws. Then, both the barrier and the claw in an instant before turning into ashes, disappearing into the emptiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A rather good item! Pity that it could only block one attack at the Morning Star realm!” Cyril laughed heartily, his body’s radiance growing brighter. Horrifying amounts of elemental particles coagulated once again, as if a tsunami had crashed into the bright barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe membrane cracked, and the energy source was extinguished!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge defensive spell formation supporting the whole city had been under the attack of the army for an entire day. The combined Magus Towers, as well as the various spell formations, collapsed loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a screen of water being dispersed, the membrane disappeared, and the entirety of the Ouroboros Clan headquarters grew visible to the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Two rolls of tears streaked down Lucian’s face as he cried out. An enormous carnivorous flower that was almost ten meters high devoured him completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he’d suppressed the other party with all his might, after being weakened by the Morning Star domain he could only await his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this it?” Freya’s jaws were clenched hard. She knew she wasn’t a match for her opponent. Under the attacks of the Demon’s Arm, she now cut an extremely sorry figure, collapsing on the ground after sustaining heavy injuries from the domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the sharp claw advancing towards her and the cold, ruthless eyes of the Demon Magus who owned it, Freya was dazzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, time seemed to slow to a crawl. Her life flashed in front of her eyes as if she was reading a picture book, flipping page to page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, her thoughts drifted to a young, black-robed Warlock. He smiled warmly at her, the passion in his eyes enough to sent the hearts of all female Warlocks fluttering. They would be attracted to him like a moth to the flame… Regardless of the danger of the blaze… Regardless, that attraction would end up fatal…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goodbye… Leylin…” A single sparkling tear slipped out of the corner of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sharp, scaly claw with its dark flames and terrifying energy brought with an intensely violent wind as it aimed at her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demon Magus across her was very confident in his abilities. He could handle a Crystal Phase Magus that was armed to the teeth easily, forget a Warlock who was seriously injured and suppressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was even imagining the death of this female Warlock in front of him, the blood and internal organs spilling everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, nothing was set in stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, The chief felt like his hand had been trapped in an iron hoop, rendering him unable to take another step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up and was stunned. A Warlock wearing a black Magus robe stood in front of him. He had long black hair, an extremely handsome face and had traces of a demonic charm on him that could attract the attentions of all female Warlocks\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to have appeared in a flash. His right hand gripped the Demon’s Arm, and the other radiated a black serpent-shaped airflow which held Freya in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreya’s shut eyes popped open, and she saw Leylin. Unable to contain herself, she blurted out, “Ley… Sir Leylin! Am I dreaming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You’re not dreaming. You’ve exhausted yourself. Take a rest while I handle everything else!” Leylin’s bright smile was soothing and it put Freya’s heart to rest. Drowsy, she fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” The chief was shocked beyond words. For someone to be able to remain calm under the Morning Star domain and even cause the chief himself to be helpless, this person must not be easy to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, he couldn’t even see through the opposing party’s energy. The feeling was as if…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demon Magus shook his head, forcing his mind to abandon such thoughts as he didn’t want to frighten himself. He was afraid he might lose all confidence, kneeling and asking for mercy if his train of thoughts was to develop further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-500\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-502\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-501","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
