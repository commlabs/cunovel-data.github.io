Leaving the Heavenly Snow Mountain during this time of transformation, it’s just too dangerous! His Majesty just has one daughter, how can we go back like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man on the right said with a bitter smile: “What can we do then, Big Bro? Will His Majesty get angry with us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man on the left gave a cold humph: “Stop talking nonsense! His Majesty is a great Heavenly Snow King, and he is wise and foresighted, how could he vent his anger on us. Let’s go, we should head back and report to His Majesty and get instructions. As he said that, he waved his hands and a white flash of light enveloped them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the bright light disappeared, the two shadowy figures disappeared, and the direwolf corpses turned into blocks of ice, and in the next instant, they all shattered into dust, leaving no trace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing washed his body clean, giving a lazy stretch butt naked in his tent, and he looked at a side and said exasperatedly: “Hmph, you’ve taken all the advantage, I haven’t even kissed Bing’er’s face! Hmph! Time to sleep.” [1. I’m not sure who he’s talking to; himself? the little tiger? both make a little sense, but are also a little weird \u003dp Feel free to enlighten me if anyone has a better theory.] After the long night of excitement, although he had broken through and completed the first portion of the Immortal Deity Technique and replenished his Heavenly Energy, but he was still extremely exhausted, especially in spirit. As such, he jumped straight into bed right then in his birthday suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You little thing, why are you covering your eyes huh? This young master has such a perfect body and figure, and you dare to ignore it?” As Zhou Weiqing jumped under the covers, he noticed the little white tiger lying beside the pillow with its little paws covering its eyes and was a little exasperated and incensed. Although he had somewhat reined in his rascally nature with Shangguan Bing’er, but in his own tent, he was unfettered alone in his own tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling back the little white tiger’s paws, he threw the little fellow onto the bed and lay down upon it, pressing it down below him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wuu wuu, wuu, wuu.” The little white tiger cried angrily, struggling as it tried to squeeze out from under him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing moved around, rubbing against the little tiger as he said: “So soft and comfortable, stop squirming around. Being under this big brother of yours is your honour! When you are bigger, you can be my steed, riding a white tiger, that should be very awe inspiring heh heh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he closed his eyes, and soon fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, the little white tiger finally managed to struggle its way out, shaking its cute little head angrily, its deep blue eyes filled with fury. It bared its teeth at Zhou Weiqing, but did not do anything, instead going back to that rascal’s arms and snuggling up, before closing its eyes as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Shangguan Bing’er, this half resigned Battalion Commander’s Personal Aide, Zhou Weiqing was left undisturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Xiao Ru Se, she had taken over the duties of Battalion Commander, added to the fact that all the new recruits had arrived, so she was extremely busy for the whole day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only until the evening when Zhou Weiqing was awoken by hunger. As soon as he woke up, the little white tiger awoke as well, and as Zhou Weiqing dressed himself, it ran over to him and pawed at his pants with its little claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You little thing, you’re hungry as well right? Come, this big bro will bring you for some good food.” As he said that, he grabbed the little white tiger and shoved it into his Squad Leader uniform before heading out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless there were any urgent circumstances, there was usually plenty of food in the army camp, and Zhou Weiqing went to the mess and ate his fill with a huge meal. However, to his surprise, no matter what he tried to give the little white tiger hiding in his bosom, it refused to eat. Looking at its expression, it seemed to disdain the food he offered, even when Zhou Weiqing took a lot of trouble to get some meat soup for it, it still ignored it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm, I didn’t expect that such a little thing like you would be so proud. Hmph! If you don’t want to eat it, then you can starve to death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he returned back to his tent, Zhou Weiqing was about to throw the little white tiger onto the bed, but the little fellow absolutely refused to go, biting hard on his sleeve and insisting to stay in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You little thing, you have the potential to become a warmer [2. 暖炉 is literally a stove or braiser, so I’m assuming he is using it to warm himself]! Oh right, since you’re following me now, let me give you a name. Hmmm… let’s see, you’re so small, you don’t look like a tiger, more like a little cat, plus you’re so nice and round and meaty… I got it! Your name will be ‘Fat Cat’ from now on! [3. Awww, poor kitty \u003d(]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wuu wuu, wuu, wuu.” The little white tiger cried out in anger and unwillingness, its little claws scratching a white line onto Zhou Weiqing’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Resistance is futile. If you scratch me again, I’ll spank your little bottom.” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing vulgarly pinched its little butt, saying smugly: “Fat Cat!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little white tiger turned its head around, ignoring him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bro is calling you, how can you not answer! If you don’t answer… heh heh, then I’ll help examine your body! Heh!” As he said that, he flipped it around and pulled its little legs apart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wuu wuu, wuu, wuu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said with an evil grin on his face: “Bro will give you another chance, Fat Cat!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wuu…” The little white tiger was extremely aggrieved, and gave a sad cry in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s more like it, this will be your name from now on! I’m going to cultivate now, don’t disturb me! You go ahead and sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, Zhou Weiqing flipped open his Immortal Deity Technique Manual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had already completed the first portion of the Immortal Deity Technique which consisted of breaking through the first five Death Acupuncture Points, and naturally needed to continue on cultivating this technique. As such, he flipped to the last page of the first portion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ehh, what is this?” Zhou Weiqing exclaimed as he examined the last page once again, discovering a small line of words right at the bottom. Previously, he had mostly skimmed through the later pages and had not noticed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words on the small line said: “If you are able to complete this first portion and break through your first five Death Acupuncture Points, place your palm on the page, and slowly bring forth your Heavenly Energy from your Taiyuan Acupuncture Point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat was that all about? \u003c/i\u003eAlthough Zhou Weiqing had doubts in his heart, but he still followed the instructions written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Taiyuan Acupuncture Point was between the wrist and palm, and Zhou Weiqing slowly sent forth the Heavenly Energy into the page made of goat leather. At first, he didn’t feel anything happening, but soon he felt as if the goat leather page was moving under his hands, and he quickly moved his hands away. With a glance, he saw that the single page had actually separated into two pages! That was to say, in between the first and second portions of the Immortal Deity Technique,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zhou Weiqing quickly focused on reading the page, he found several paragraphs were written on it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Death Acupuncture Points on the limbs are broken through, your five Acupuncture Points will be linked to the world, and you can communicate with the essence of heaven and earth, evolving your body. Once your body is remade, the five energy whirlpools will spread throughout your body and form a natural shield, protecting you from external forces, hidden under your skin. The name of the shield is the ‘Immortal Deity Shield’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-24-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-24-04\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-24-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
