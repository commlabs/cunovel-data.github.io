{"id":79127,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\u003cp\u003eMr. Crepsley checked us out of the hotel as soon as we got back, in case the staff noticed Evra\u0027s disappearance, or the vampaneze forced him to reveal our location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if he escapes?\" I asked. \"How will he know where to find us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not believe he will escape,\" Mr. Crepsley said regretfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe checked into a new hotel not far from the old one. If the man behind the desk was surprised to find a solemn-looking man with a scar and a distraught young boy in a pirate costume checking in at such a strange hour, he kept his suspicions to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI begged Mr. Crepsley to tell me more about the vampaneze. He said they never drank from vampires - our blood was poisonous to other vampires and vampaneze. They lived slightly longer than vampires, though the difference was minimal. They ate very little food, preferring to keep going on blood. They only drank from animals as a last resort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened closely. It was easier not to think about Evra if I had something else to focus on. But when dawn came and Mr. Crepsley headed for bed, I was left alone to think about what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the sunrise. I was tired, but I couldn\u0027t sleep. How could I face the nightmares that must be waiting for me? I fixed a huge breakfast, but my appetite was gone after one small mouthful and I ended up tossing it. I turned on the TV and flicked between channels, barely noticing what was on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery so often I\u0027d think it must have been a dream. Evra couldn\u0027t be dead. I must have fallen asleep on the roof while watching Mr. Crepsley and dreamt it all. Any minute now, Evra would shake me awake. I\u0027d tell him about my dream and we\u0027d both laugh. \"You won\u0027t get rid of me that easily,\" he\u0027d say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t a dream. I had come face to face with the vampaneze. He had abducted Evra. He had either killed him or was preparing to. These were facts and had to be faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble was, I didn\u0027t dare face them. I was afraid I might go crazy if I did. So, rather than accept the truth and deal with it, I buried it deep, where it couldn\u0027t bother me - then went to see Debbie. Maybe she could cheer me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie was playing in the square when I arrived. It had snowed heavily during the night and she was building a snowman with some of the local kids. She was surprised but happy to see me so early. She introduced me to her friends, who looked at me inquisitively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to come for a walk?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can it wait till I finish the snowman?\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"I\u0027m restless. I need to walk. I can come back later if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right. I\u0027ll come.\" She looked at me weirdly. \"Are you okay? Your face is as white as a sheet, and your eyes... have you been crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was peeling onions earlier,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie turned to her friends. \"See you later,\" she said, and took my arm. \"Anywhere special you want to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" I said. \"You lead. I\u0027ll tag along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t say much while we were walking, until Debbie tugged my arm and said, \"I\u0027ve got some good news. I asked Mom and Dad if you could come over on Christmas Eve to help put up the decorations and they said you could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" I said, forcing a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve invited you for dinner, too,\" she said. \"They were going to ask you over for Christmas Day, but I know you\u0027ve made plans to spend it in the hotel. Besides, I don\u0027t think your dad would want to come, would he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Christmas Eve\u0027s okay, isn\u0027t it?\" she asked. \"Evra can come, too. We\u0027ll be eating early, at about two or three in the afternoon, so there\u0027ll be plenty of time for decorating the trees. You can -?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evra won\u0027t be able to come,\" I said shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself struggling to think up a good lie. Finally, I said, \"He\u0027s got the flu. He\u0027s in bed and can\u0027t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seemed fine yesterday.\" Debbie frowned. \"I saw the two of you going out last night. He looked -?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you see us?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Through the window,\" she said. \"It\u0027s not the first time I\u0027ve noticed you going out after dark. I never said anything about it before, because I thought you would have told me what you were up to if you\u0027d wanted me to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not nice to spy on people,\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t spying!\" Debbie looked hurt by my accusation and tone. \"I just happened to see you. And if that\u0027s going to be your attitude, you can forget Christmas Eve.\" She turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I said, catching her arm (careful not to grab too hard). \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m in a really bad mood. I don\u0027t feel so good. Maybe I\u0027ve picked up something from Evra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do look under the weather,\" she agreed, her face softening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for where we go at night, it\u0027s just to meet our dad,\" I said. \"We join him after work and go out for something to eat, or to see a movie. I would have invited you along, but you know how things stand with my dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should introduce us,\" Debbie said. \"I bet I\u0027d be able to get him to like me, if I only had the chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started walking again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, how about Christmas Eve?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. Sitting down to dinner with Debbie and her parents was the last thing I wanted to think about. \"I\u0027ll have to get back to you on that one.\" I said. \"I\u0027m not sure if we\u0027ll be here. We might be moving on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Christmas Eve is tomorrow!\" Debbie exclaimed. \"Your dad must have told you his plans by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s strange,\" I said. \"He likes to leave things till the very last minute. I could arrive back after this walk and find him packed and ready to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t leave if Evra\u0027s sick,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can and will, if he wants,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie frowned and stopped walking. There was a street vent a foot or so away, and warm air was blowing out of it. She moved closer and stood on the bars. \"You won\u0027t leave without telling me, will you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d hate it if you disappeared into thin air without a word,\" she said, and I could see tears gathering in the corners of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise,\" I said. \"When I know I\u0027m leaving, you\u0027ll know, too. Word of honor.\" I crossed my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here,\" she said, and pulled close and gave me a big hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that for?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does there have to be a reason?\" she smiled, then pointed ahead. \"Let\u0027s turn at the next corner. That\u0027ll lead us back to the square.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took Debbie\u0027s arm, meaning to walk her back, then remembered I\u0027d changed hotels. If I returned to the square, she\u0027d expect me to go in the hotel. She might get suspicious if she spotted me sneaking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep walking,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll call tonight or in the morning to let you know whether I can come over or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If your dad wants to leave, try twisting his arm to get him to stay,\" she suggested. \"I\u0027d really love to have you over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try,\" I vowed, and watched through sad eyes as she walked to the corner and turned out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that I heard a soft chuckling noise beneath my feet. Glancing down through the bars of the vent I saw nobody and thought I must have been hearing things. But then a voice came up out of the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your girlfriend, Darren Shan,\" it said with a giggle, and I knew instantly who was down there. \"A very tasty dish. Good enough to eat, wouldn\u0027t you say? Much tastier-looking than your other friend. Much tastier than Evra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Murlough- the mad vampaneze! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-17.html","bookId":2439,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:06 PM"}
