Out of the Stone House","content":"\u0026nbsp;As the night wore on, the clamour dulled; the roisterers were surely drunken or wearied; few seemed astir. \u0026nbsp;I heard the mumble of voices still from the room below me; occasionally the shred of a chanty from the kitchen; at times, the clatter of shoes over the cobbles of the yard, and the outcry of the hound. \u0026nbsp;But ever the wind blew through the night, seeming to cry to me concerning great waters storm-tossed, whereon I should be sailing after this night to the port of no return. \u0026nbsp;Night drew toward the hour before dawn; the moon was long since lost in massing clouds packed high against the heaven by the wind. \u0026nbsp;Lord, how the wind battered at the house, making new clamour when the clamour died below; always it cried to me of storm-tossed waters,—I had this sense upon me, even when my overwrought mind growing dull, I fell asleep upon the bed, and I had the sense still in my dreams. \u0026nbsp;But suddenly I woke with a start and a cry, to understand that pebbles were pattering through the bars and falling into the room, and that a p. 106voice was muttering below the window, “Young Craike,—hey, young Craike!” \u0026nbsp;I snatched the sacking back, and in the grey dawn saw a dark figure perched upon a ladder, his head a foot or so below the sill. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Galt!” I whispered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hist! \u0026nbsp;They may have heard the stones. \u0026nbsp;Lord, how you slept! \u0026nbsp;D’ye hear them stirring?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No! \u0026nbsp;No! \u0026nbsp;Help me!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can you slip through the bars?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, they’re set too close and firm.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He muttered, “Bart’s sleepin’ on the stair and Martin’s in the hall. \u0026nbsp;The woman’s got the key. \u0026nbsp;Can you reach the roof by the chimney?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Blocked with brick!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No other way?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A manhole in the ceiling. \u0026nbsp;If I could only reach it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you can only break out of that room, I’ll take you out of this. \u0026nbsp;My horse is saddled, waiting. \u0026nbsp;I forgot those bars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I pressed my face down against the bars and whispered, “If you could raise the ladder, we could pass it through the bars. \u0026nbsp;It’d get me to the trap-door. \u0026nbsp;There’s sure a way out through the old roof. \u0026nbsp;And a coil of rope, if there’s one at hand. \u0026nbsp;Tie that to the ladder.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n p. 107Grunting he descended; presently I saw him setting a barrel below the window, and fixing a coil of rope to a rung of the ladder. \u0026nbsp;He climbed on to the barrel, gripped the ladder, and raised its head towards the window. \u0026nbsp;I caught the ladder, tilted it, and presently, rejoicing, had it in the room, with no more sound than the wind should hide from the drunken rogues below. \u0026nbsp;Setting the ladder against the wall, and hitching the coil of rope about my arm, I climbed, and to my joy reached easily the trap-door above me. \u0026nbsp;Exerting all my strength, I strove to force the trap-door upwards. \u0026nbsp;Lord, the shower of dust that descended, as the door lifted, blinded me; broken slate or brick fell with the dust, and the crash on the floor seemed fit to wake the dead. \u0026nbsp;But, blindly struggling upwards, and gripping a rafter, I pulled myself from the ladder, and squeezed under the half-opened trap into the loft above my room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n An instant I lay in the dust and litter, exhausted,—the rats went scurrying all about me; I heard the flapping of birds under the roof. \u0026nbsp;Struggling to my shaking knees, I forced the trap back into its place, and without pausing to listen whether the fall of rubbish into the room had roused the house, I groped forward through the blackness, my hope being that I should find a trap p. 108opening on the roof itself, or that, with the rottenness of the slates and the timbers I might break through, and coiling my rope about a chimney, lower myself sufficiently to drop to the ground. \u0026nbsp;But as yet all was dark about me; a thick litter of dust and feathers lay under my feet; groping still, I touched the slanting roof, but thrusting with my hand found it yet set firmly for all the decay of the years; I believed that I heard hoarse voices without the house, or the growling of the wind upon the roofs. \u0026nbsp;Creeping forward still, I rejoiced to feel a cold draught of air blow upon me, and to see pale light through many chinks. \u0026nbsp;Loose slates, rotten wood, surely a decaying patch in the roof, I dared to stand erect then, though fearing that the mouldering, worm-eaten rafters would give way beneath me, and I should crash into one of the upper rooms of the Stone House.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And as I lurched up, with a crash and splintering of slates, I broke through the rotten roof; I was nigh the chimney stack; I could see the leaden gutters below me,—birds flew out in a whirl. \u0026nbsp;I could see Roger Galt standing by his horse away from the house; I could hear the outcry of the hound,—none of the folks save Roger seemed astir. \u0026nbsp;I wriggled out from the hole in the roof, though at first the slates cracked p. 109like thin ice beneath me; and I began slowly to creep towards the chimney stack, finding my hold in the breaks of the slates and the thick growths of moss stuck closely to them. \u0026nbsp;The roof held me; but, ere I reached the chimney, the light was strong; had anyone come out of the Stone House I must have been clear to view, though the sound of the wind hid the rasping of my body over the slates. \u0026nbsp;And slowly, with the wind beating upon me as if to cast me down, I brought the rope about the chimney, and, securing it, let myself slide down gradually to the gutter; gripping rope and gutter, I lowered myself over the edge. \u0026nbsp;On the instant, the hound broke into furious clamour; a cry sounded below me; Martin was roaring, “Bart! \u0026nbsp;Blunt! \u0026nbsp;Come here! \u0026nbsp;Damn you—here!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I was swinging now down the rope; at the end of the length I was little below the gutter. \u0026nbsp;At the alarm I lost my grip, and fell—by some chance into a pile of bales of smuggled stuffs that they had left lying under the wall; though the breath was knocked out of my body, and I lay there gasping an instant, I was unhurt. \u0026nbsp;I started up; dropped from the bales on to the cobbles, and was staggering off; but, coming in a rush from the house, the rogues were upon me. \u0026nbsp;Martin and Bart had gripped me; struggling wildly, I was p. 110borne backwards; on the instant came Roger Galt, riding thunderously upon them. \u0026nbsp;His riding-whip cracked upon Bart’s head; his horse nigh trod Martin down; Roger’s great hand gripped my collar, and swung me up before him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Martin was screeching, “Galt! \u0026nbsp;You’ll hang for this! \u0026nbsp;Galt! \u0026nbsp;Damn you! \u0026nbsp;Stop!” \u0026nbsp;His pistol cracked after us, as Roger, turning his horse, set him at full speed from the house. \u0026nbsp;After us they came pell-mell,—Martin and Blunt and his crew; I heard shots and their roaring voices. \u0026nbsp;The gate was barred against us; swinging back under the wall, Roger Galt suddenly put his horse to it, and with a shock that almost drove my senses from me, the horse brought us safely over.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We were away then at a gallop, and the clamour from the Stone House was dying on the wind.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2790/77228.html","bookId":1293,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 2:38:10 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 2:38:10 AM"}
