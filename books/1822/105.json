It pains me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why the heck is she smiling through her tears?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scratched my head, nonplussed. This love thing was obviously more complicated than I had thought. Oh, I was so glad I didn’t have anything to do with it myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will ask you one final time, Ella.’ Slowly, Edmund rose to his feet. Her hand slid into his, and he held it firmly. ‘Will you elope with me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You refuse to go against your aunt’s wishes in the matter of Sir Philip?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I beg you, Edmund, understand. I cannot!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shh. Don’t be anguished, dearest. I understand. I understand, my love. You cannot go against your gentle nature.’ He sighed. ‘Then there remains only one thing for me to do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Y-you will do as I ask? You will move on?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of the fact that she was trying to affect a cheerful manner, I could see the fear in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing her hand again, Edmund shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. I shall go out and buy myself a pistol. In the morning I shall call at Sir Philip’s residence and challenge him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny feathers available with which to knock me over? For the second time this night, I was completely taken by surprise. This tradesman’s boy was turning out to be a regular Casanova! Had I heard correctly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘W-what?’ Ella stuttered. ‘What do you mean, challenge him?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, she hadn’t yet understood what he meant. Or she would not let herself understand, maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I mean, challenge him to a duel,’ Edmund replied calmly. ‘To the death.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took an involuntary step towards him. Or maybe it was voluntary. You could never tell with these love-struck people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Edmund, you must not jest about such things,’ she whispered, her hands clasping the iron poles of the fence tightly. ‘You must not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who says that I am jesting?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Please, Edmund, stop. You worry me sick.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am sorry for that. But it cannot be helped. You say you will not refuse Sir Philip, nor stand up to your aunt, so I have no choice.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No choice but to contemplate violence?’ Letting go of the poles, she threw her hands up in the air. ‘What mad demon possesses you, Edmund? I beg you, relinquish this mad scheme!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is not mad. Indeed it is highly logical. You will not rid yourself of Sir Philip, very well, then I shall do it for you. I shall acquire a pistol, go to his house and challenge him. Do you think I should explain the situation to him? How things stand between us?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla almost fainted right then and there. Only Edmund’s quick hands, which shot through the gaps in the fence and caught her around the waist, prevented her from falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait just a minute!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on the point of charging in. Now he definitely was touching areas he wasn’t supposed to be touching on a lady, and I had to look after my little sister, after all. But then, he had only prevented her from falling. I decided to not kill him for his insolence just this once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tell him?’ Ella whispered, obviously in no hurry to get out of his arms. ‘Are you mad?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her. It was a boyish, excited kind of smile that looked new on his face, which I had seen so often anxious and sad, yet it suited him well. He looked like a different person, and for the first time I began to understand what Ella saw in him, just a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s the second time you’ve accused me of insanity tonight, my love. Don’t let it become a habit.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Be serious, Edmund!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m absolutely serious. I don\u0027t want you to suspect me of a mental disorder.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You know what I mean!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, I do. And I’m serious about that, too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But telling Sir Philip? After all the hundreds and hundreds of times I have begged you to keep our love a secret?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmund’s smile became a trifle wistful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, but what is there to keep secret anymore? If I go to him tomorrow and vanquish him, then it will not matter whether or not I have told him, will it? I need to explain it to him, Ella. I cannot simply march up to him and insult him to make him fight me. I would smudge the honour of my family, which, as you so diligently pointed out, is a bad thing to do. No, I need to go to him and say: “Sir Philip, I love the girl you have set your sights on, and she loves me. I will fight for her with my last breath.” He is a gentleman. He will understand and allow me the opportunity to fight for you. Once I have put a bullet through his heart, the way will once again be free. So you see, Ella, I am not mad. I have thought this through very carefully.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded approvingly. For once, it seemed, somebody had been using their brains instead of their heart. The plan was indeed highly logical - except for one point. With unusual quickness, Ella realized it too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And what,’ she whispered, trembling in Edmund’s arms, ‘if it is he who kills you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few moments of silence. Well, almost-silence, anyway. In the distance, a dog barked with total disregard for the romantic drama unfolding in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I wouldn’t worry about that, love,’ he said, dismissively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not worry?’ she exclaimed, and suddenly it wasn’t just his arms around her - she was clasping him now, too. That was more like it! Finally, she was taking some action of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Edmund, he is a gentleman! You’re a tradesman’s son. He’s been raised to shoot with guns, hunts every year and knows what he’s doing. Have you ever handled a pistol before in your life?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m a quick learner.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Edmund, tell me! Have you ever handled a pistol?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not actually, no,’ he admitted. ‘But I’ve seen other people do it,’ he added as an afterthought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe groan that originated from Ella indicated that she thought about as much of this excuse as I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Edmund, please don\u0027t, I’m begging you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I would give you almost anything you want, love, but in this I must deny you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But why?’ Reaching up, she clutched his shirt and, through a gap in the fence, buried her face in his chest. ‘Do you want to die? Are you truly mad?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncircling her with his arms, he drew her even closer towards himself. I was debating again whether or not to intervene - but somehow I couldn’t bring myself to interrupt them. And there was still an iron fence between them, so things couldn’t really get very intimate. ‘I have no wish to die, Ella.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-105.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM"}
