{"id":79003,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\u003cp\u003eI stayed inside my tent most of the day and didn\u0027t even go out to say hi to Sam when he came around. I was so sad. I didn\u0027t feel like I belonged anywhere anymore. I couldn\u0027t be a human and wouldn\u0027t be a vampire. I was somewhere in between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got a lot of sleep that night, and the next day I felt better. The sun was shining, and although I knew my problems hadn\u0027t gone away, I was able to overlook them for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra\u0027s snake was sick. She\u0027d picked up a virus, and Evra had to stay in to look after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Sam showed up, we decided to visit that old deserted railroad station of his. Evra didn\u0027t mind being left behind. He\u0027d come with us another time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe railroad station was cool. There was a huge circular yard paved with cracked stones, a three-story house that had served as the guard\u0027s house, a couple of old sheds, and several abandoned train cars. There were also railroad tracks running everywhere you looked, overgrown with weeds and grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam and I walked along some of the tracks and pretended we were on tightropes way above the ground. Every time one of us slipped, he had to scream and pretend to fall fatally to earth. I was much better at the game than Sam, because my vampire powers meant my sense of balance was better than any human\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe explored a few of the old cars. A couple were run down, but most were okay. Pretty dusty and dirty, but otherwise in good condition. I couldn\u0027t understand why they\u0027d been left there to rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climbed onto the roof of one of the cars and stretched out to sit in the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what we should do?\"Sam said after a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Become blood brothers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI propped myself up on an elbow and stared. \"Blood brothers?\"I asked. \"What for? And how\u0027s it done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027d be fun,\"he said. \"We each make a small cut on one of our hands, then join them together and swear an oath to be best friends forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds all right,\"I agreed. \"Do you have a knife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can use some glass,\"Sam said. He slid over to the edge of the roof, reached down, and snapped a piece of glass out of one of the train-car windows. When he came back, he made a small cut in the fleshy part of his palm, then handed me the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to cut my palm when I remembered the vampire blood in my veins. I didn\u0027t think a small amount could do Sam any harm, but then again...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered the glass and shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"I said. \"I don\u0027t want to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\"Sam urged. \"Don\u0027t be afraid. You only have to make a small cut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"I said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coward!\"he yelled. \"You\u0027re afraid! Chicken! Coward!\"He began to sing: \"Fraidy cat, fraidy cat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027m a coward.\"I laughed. It was easier to lie than tell the truth. \"Everybody\u0027s afraid of something. I didn\u0027t see you rushing to wash the wolf-man the other day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam made a face. \"That\u0027s different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Horses for courses,\"I said smugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure,\"I admitted. \"It\u0027s something my dad used to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe joked around some more, then hopped down and crossed the yard to the guard\u0027s house. The doors had rotted off years ago, and most of the glass in the windows had fallen out. We walked through a couple of small rooms, then into a larger one, which had been the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a huge hole in the middle of the floor, which we carefully avoided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look up,\"Sam told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did and discovered I was gazing directly at the roof. The floors in between had fallen in over the years, and all that was left of them were jagged edges around the sides. I could see sunlight shining through a couple of holes in the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow me,\"Sam said, and he led me to a staircase at the side of the room. He started up. I followed slowly, not sure if it was the smartest thing to do - the steps were creaky and looked as though they might collapse - but not wanting to be called a chicken twice in the same day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped at the third floor, where the stairs stopped. You could touch the roof from there, and we did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we get out on the roof?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\"Sam said, \"but it\u0027s too dangerous. The shingles are loose. You could slide off. Anyway, there\u0027s something better up here than the roof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked along the side of the uppermost room of the house. The ledge was about two feet wide most of the way, but I kept my back to the wall, not wanting to take any chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This section of floor won\u0027t collapse, will it?\"I asked nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It never has before,\"Sam replied. \"But there\u0027s a first time for everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for putting my mind at ease,\"I grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam stopped a little farther on. I craned my neck so I could see past him and realized we had come to a set of rafters. There were six or seven of them, long pieces of wood stretching from one side of the room to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This used to be the attic,\"Sam explained. \"I guessed that,\"I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at me and grinned. \"But can you guess what we\u0027re going to do next?\"he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, then down at the rafters. \"You don\u0027t mean... You aren\u0027t going to... You\u0027re going to walk across, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\"he said, and set his left foot on the rafter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam, this isn\u0027t a good idea,\"I said. \"You looked unsteady on the railroad tracks. If you stumble up here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\"he said. \"I was only fooling down there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set his other foot on the wooden rafter and began walking. He went slowly, his arms stretched out on either side. My heart was in my throat. I was certain he\u0027d fall. I looked down and knew he wouldn\u0027t survive if he fell. There were four stories if you included the basement. It was a long drop. A deadly one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sam made it across safely to the other side, where he turned and took a bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crazy!\"I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"he said, \"just brave. How about you ? Dare to chance it? It\u0027d be easier for you than it was for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chickens have wings!\"he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did it! I\u0027d show him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, I went across, moving quicker than Sam had, making full use of my vampire abilities. I didn\u0027t look down and tried not to think about what I was doing and in a couple of seconds I was across and standing beside Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow!\"He was impressed. \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d do it. Certainly not so quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t travel with the Cirque without picking up a few tricks,\"I said, pleased with myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think I could go that fast?\"Sam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t try it,\"I advised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet you can\u0027t do it again,\"he dared me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just watch,\"I said, and darted back across, even faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent a fun few minutes crossing over and back, taking each of the rafters in turn. Then we crossed at the same time, on different rafters, yelling and laughing at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam stopped in the middle of his rafter and turned to face me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\"he shouted. \"Let\u0027s play mirrors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do something and you have to copy me.\"He shook his left hand above his head. \"Like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\"I said, and shook my hand. \"Okay. As long as you don\u0027t jump to your death. That\u0027s the one thing I won\u0027t copy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, then made a face. I made one, too. Then he slowly stood on one leg. I did the same. Next he bent and touched his toes. I followed his example. I couldn\u0027t wait until it was my turn. I\u0027d do a few things - like jump from one rafter to the next - that there was no way he could copy. For once, I was glad for my vampire blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, that was the moment when it went and let me down...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no warning. One second I was beginning to stand, having bent to touch my toes. The next my head was spinning, my arms were flapping, and my legs were shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t my first dizzy spell - I\u0027d had several recently - but I hadn\u0027t taken much notice before - I\u0027d just sat down and waited for the dizziness to pass. This time was different. I was four stories up. There was nowhere to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried lowering myself, thinking I could cling to the rafter and crawl to safety. But before I could get low enough, my feet slipped out from under me... and I fell! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-20.html","bookId":2438,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM"}
