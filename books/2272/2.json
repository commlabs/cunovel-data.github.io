He tried to struggle up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take it easy. Don’t move until we’re sure you haven’t broken something, sir,” the med tech said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s nothing broken. I’m good,” Joe told him. “The guy who helped me—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s being taken care of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The man in the car—I think he was hurt pretty bad,” Joe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We, uh, we got it,” the med tech told him. “And,” he added gently, “the girl is fine. Everyone’s already talking about how you saved her life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great, good,” Joe said. “But the man needs—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, I’m sorry to tell you, but he’s dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought he had a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe med tech was silent for a minute. “You did a good thing,” he said very softly. “But that man…he died on impact, sir. Broken neck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No—he talked to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think maybe you hit your head, sir. That man couldn’t have spoken to you. I’m sure his family is going to be grateful you got the body out, but he’s been dead since the first impact. Honest to God. It was a broken neck. He never suffered.” As he spoke, the med tech got a stethoscope out; apparently he wasn’t taking Joe’s word that he was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe had his breath back. He pushed the stethoscope aside and sat up, staring at the med tech. What did the kid know? He wasn’t the coroner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was alive. He spoke to me. I wouldn’t even have seen the girl if he hadn’t told me she was in the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe knew damned well when he was being humored. “I’m telling you, I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew the EMT was all good intentions, but he was just fine—except for this kid trying to tell him that the man had died on impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, let me help you,” the med tech said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to help me? Get me the hell out of here,” Joe told him. “Fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just let me get a stretcher.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” Joe said, figuring anything that would get the guy out of the way was fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the med tech went off for a stretcher, Joe took a deep breath and made it to his feet. Damn, it hurt. Well, he’d been pretty much sandblasted when he skidded down on the roadway, and he wasn’t exactly eighteen anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw that there was no way in hell he would be leaving the scene in his own car. But it wasn’t blocking anyone, so the thing was just to start walking, to get away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did. It was easier than he’d imagined, but then, he was walking away from a scene of chaos, and everyone’s attention was on the wreck, not on one lone pedestrian. He could hear voices—most alarmed and concerned, some merely excited—surrounding him as he escaped the scene. More and more cop cars and ambulances passed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed south along the shoulder, and at last he followed an entrance ramp down to the street, where he hailed a taxi. The driver didn’t even blink at his appearance. Hey, this was New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suggested a route to Brooklyn that didn’t involve the FDR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got home eventually, where he showered and changed, then went out into his living room and turned on the television, looking for the local news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe accident was center stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twelve were injured and are being given care in various area hospitals,” the attractive newscaster was saying. Her face was grave. “There was one fatality. Adam Brookfield was killed when his car flipped over the median. The medical examiner reports that Mr. Brookfield died instantly, though a heroic onlooker, who fled the scene, carried the man’s body from the automobile just instants before the car exploded. That same man rescued Mr. Brookfield’s six-year-old niece, Patricia, who is doing well at St. Vincent’s Hospital, where her parents are with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman shifted in her chair to look into a different camera. The somber expression left her face. She smiled. “This weekend, we welcome the All American Chorale Union to Kennedy Center, and for those of you with tickets, remember that tonight’s the night for the special showing of ancient Egyptian artifacts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. All those pricey meal tickets will pay for more archeological research right here in New York. And now…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe no longer heard her. He was irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat man, Adam Brookfield, had been alive; he had spoken to Joe. It was bull about him dying on impact. He couldn’t have spoken if he’d been dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe glanced at his watch. It would be hours before he could reasonably go for his car, which meant it would probably be towed anyway. Screw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been on his way to attend tonight’s fund-raiser at the Met when he’d gotten sidelined by the accident, but now he decided he no longer cared. He was heading to Manhattan and a bar that had become one of his favorites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulations, she’s just beautiful, Senator,” Genevieve O’Brien said to Senator James McCray and his wife. They had been showing her pictures of their new grandson, Jacob. She had done the right thing, “oohing” and “aahing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankly, the baby looked like a pinhead at the moment. As bald as a buzzard. Squinched up and…newborn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the senator was a supporter of the Historical Society, and had a paid great deal for his meal and a walk through the museum. Naturally she was going to say all the right things about his grandchild. Of course, if she’d met him on the street, she still would have said the same things, she realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe damned digital cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe senator had not had just one picture but at least a hundred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to get married and have children yourself, young lady,” James McCray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wife elbowed him. She’d suddenly gone pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve sighed and tried not to show her feelings in her expression, but she was so weary of this. Anything that so much as hinted of sex was considered taboo around her. She’d been the victim of a maniac who’d been stalking New York’s streets and targeting prostitutes, the same prostitutes Gen worked with. Everyone knew what she’d been through and that it was a miracle she was alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had stayed alive because she had realized quickly that her attacker was actually incapable of sex. She had played on his own psychological makeup, providing the bolstering and ego boosts that he needed, and though she had been a prisoner and abused, she wasn’t suffering as shatteringly from the experience as the world seemed to think she should be. If she faced an inward agony, it was knowing that someone incredible, her friend Leslie MacIntyre, had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would love to have children one day, Senator, Mrs. McCray,” she said cheerfully. “When the right person to be a dad comes along. You enjoy that beautiful baby. But now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to see to a few things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she needed to see to an escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked quickly into a side hall, opened only for the convenience of the Historical Society, which was hosting the event. There was a bench, and she sat on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t shown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a sigh, wondering why she had even thought Joe would show up. He was a fascinating guy, intrigued by almost everything in the world. He hadn’t come from money, but if anyone out there knew that money really wasn’t everything, it was her. Joe was one of those people who lived life, and he’d done well enough for himself. He could look like a million dollars in a suit. Definitely a striking guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd her friend, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he wasn’t avoiding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled to herself. If she was in trouble, if she needed rescuing, he would be right there. Thing was, she didn’t need rescuing. And she didn’t want to need rescuing, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smiled faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did want help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had hoped he would show tonight because she wanted to ask him about the current worry dogging her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe media had dubbed it the Poe Killing, because the victim, Thorne Bigelow, had been president of the New York Poe Society, a readers and writers group whose members studied the works and life of Edgar Allan Poe, and called themselves the Ravens, and the killer had left a note referring to the famous author.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around the room. Most of the members were involved with things that were considered either literary or important educationally in the city of New York. There were several of the Ravens here tonight; like her own mother, they also supported various groups interested in history and archeology. Among them she noticed newspaper reporter Larry Levine, who had come to cover the event. Then there was Lila Hawkins—brassy and outspoken and very, very rich. Quite frankly, she was obnoxious, but she did do a lot of good things for the arts in the city. Just a few minutes ago, Gen had seen Lila with Barbara Hirshorn, another Raven and the complete opposite of Lila; Barbara was so timid, she had difficulty speaking to more than one person at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had noted that even Jared Bigelow had made a brief appearance with Mary Vincenzo, his aunt, on his arm. He was gone now, and she hadn’t had a chance to speak to him. He had shown up just to support the cause tonight; he was still in mourning for his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom her seat on the bench she could hear the booming voice of Don Tracy, the one Raven who’d taken Poe to the masses. He was an actor, a good one, even if he’d never become a household name. He loved the stage and had performed Poe’s works on numerous occasions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them seemed to be frightened by the note that had been found with Thorne’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne Bigelow had been a very wealthy man. A well-known man. And though murder happened all too often, it was the sad truth that a murder with a hook—like a victim who was regularly in the headlines and a mysterious note making reference to a long-dead storyteller and poet—intrigued the media more than most deaths did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only happenstance that Thorne Bigelow had been a very rich Raven. The Ravens didn’t demand that a member be wealthy, published on the topic of Poe’s life and works or world-renowned, though sometimes they were. Thorne Bigelow had written a book on Poe that was considered to be the definitive work on the man. Bigelow was honored far and wide for his knowledge. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-death-dealer-harrison-investigation-6/page-2.html","bookId":2272,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:03 PM"}
