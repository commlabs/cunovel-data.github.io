He’s propped up on one arm, his muscles bulging. His sexy black hair is fully standing and he wears the lazy, sensual smile of a man who’s been satisfied to a near-coma, and he looks so sexy in bed I want to eat him with a spoon. I make a purring noise as I roll to my side to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to leave this bed,” I whisper, sliding a fingertip along one of his Celtic tattoos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strokes a hand down my arm, and the feathery tenderness in the caress is almost unbearable. He kisses the hollow of my ear. “Who do you belong to?” he asks softly. Again, his eyes tell me I’m his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out, he squeezes me so hard against him, I gasp. “That’s right!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn odd little laugh leaves me, and it kind of sounded like a giggle. “You will never stop asking me that, will you? Oh, I hate you! Did you hear that? You made me giggle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, he rolls me underneath his big body, and I hit his chest with one fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You fucking made me giggle, and you didn’t even say anything funny!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I fucking loved it. Giggle again now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never!” I laugh, and it sounds like a goddamn giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate giggling, but the genuine delight in his dancing blue eyes fills me with so much happiness, my chest feels like a detonated grenade as he laughs, and I continue to freaking giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he’s sober, he surveys my face, feature by feature, and as the air shifts between us, our smiles fade. His body is crushing mine. His pecs smashing my breasts. His weight trapping me. I love it so much, even when it hurts to take a full breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes turn liquid with love as he leans over and presses his lips over mine for three delicious heartbeats. We use no tongues, only the pressure of soft, dry lips, so full of love I could almost levitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands roam up the muscular planes of his back. “When do you leave?” I breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As late as possible and still be on time for the next match.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hurt and disappointment seem to show on my face, for he tightens his hold on me as he eases to his side and brings me with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you happy here? Are you treated well?” He nuzzles my temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nobody treats me or understands me like you. Except Mel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And your parents?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They love me” is all I say. I’m about to say they may not be too thrilled about our circumstances right now, but then I look into this man’s eyes and realize he doesn’t have parents who support and care about him, and I realize how very lucky I am. “Did you feel unloved when your parents didn’t come back?” I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not unloved. Misunderstood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe speaks casually, like it’s truly nothing to him but a bland fact. A fact that breaks my heart every time I think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Remy. I’m so sorry. I hate them for doing this to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gets up and grabs his lounge pants and I know he’s going to want to go eat—of course. “Why? I didn’t hurt. Why are you sorry? I’m still going to be a good father.” He winks at me. “It’s because they were so shitty that I will be a good father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes are brilliant, and I want to cry as we both stare down at my abdomen. We are really happy about this baby even though we didn’t plan it. Maybe we are young and stupid, young and in love, but we are just so hopeful about having a family together. About just being together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA banging on the suite door makes me frown. He scowls too, then points a finger at me. “Stay.” He goes to open the door and I bury my face in his pillow, loathing that today he leaves me again. I talked to my doctor and she insists that I not travel until the first trimester ends, so there are at least two and a half weeks to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I hear voices, I grab his robe, wrap the sash around my waist, and walk outside. Remington spots me in his boxing robe, and he reacts like he always does: I almost feel him tackling me in his head and fucking me like we haven’t been able to fuck since I got pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete looks like he hasn’t slept in days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemington is still eye-fucking me, his lips curled in the pure male satisfaction he gets when I’m wearing his things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crooks a finger and slowly beckons me forward. My heart melts and I come over, aware of him watching me as he extends his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretch out mine, and he seizes my fingers and brings me to his side, where I impulsively start to rub his bare muscles while he talks to Pete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m so engrossed, pushing into the hard muscle, that it takes me a couple of seconds to notice the silence. A silence so absolute, you could hear a pin drop in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” I stop what I’m doing while my gaze ping-pongs between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete restlessly loosens the knot on his tie. “I’ve got some bad news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA kernel of fear settles deep in my gut. “What bad news?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at the floor and drags his hand through his hair, and I become aware of Remy staring at my profile, his blue eyes watching me with such intensity, the little kernel of fear in my stomach turns to a full-fledged knot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Scorpion,” Pete says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne word and my heart is a jackhammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Scorpion?” The creepy crawly sensation on my skin surfaces with a vengeance. I hate thinking about him. Talking about him. I hate his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Remington is here. Safe. He’s safe. Isn’t he? His eyes are boring into me. They look . . . worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m cold. Paralyzed. Frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nora spent the night with him,” Pete adds, his voice surreally cold, almost like a robot’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words bother me in such a deep, frightening way, it’s a miracle that I seem to still have enough brain cells to register what he’s telling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They spent all this time at a nearby hotel. She came out with him, another woman, and his three goons. On their way to the airport; apparently there’s a ticket in her name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s leaving with him?” I stumble backward, that’s how hard the blow is. “She can’t leave with him, that . . . that . . . that ungrateful little shit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Firecracker . . .” Remington says, but I’m too wired up to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ohmigod. She’s a pea-headed, unthinking, inconsiderate little fool ! I can’t believe . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m freaking out, while Remington is calm and thoughtful. Arms crossed until those tattoos on his arms seem stretched by his muscles to the limit, feet braced apart in battle-stance, eyes glimmering in concentration. How can he, the fighter, be thinking, when I want to hit something? He did everything for Nora, on behalf of me. Everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Pete! Pete is in love with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes burn with hot tears of frustration and my mind spins around, replaying every moment of these past weeks in my head, replaying my conversation when she opened up about Scorpion and I was too concerned about Remington and my baby to pay attention. I’ve been so wrapped up in my head. I missed the signs. But what signs? This can’t be real!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go grab my cell phone and power it on, searching all my applications for a message. I have only messages from Mel, Kyle, and Pandora, but none from Nora. I dial her cell phone while Pete paces around, and Remington quietly watches me, his arms crossed, his eyebrows pulled low over his eyes as though he’s trying to figure it all out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like this, Rem,” Pete says as he restlessly circles around, shaking his head. He looks as disheveled as if he’d just had a tussle with a crocodile. “If Nora tells him anything about Brooke being pregnant, and here, on bed rest, she’ll be as vulnerable here as she will be on tour—except you won’t be here to protect her. He could hurt you man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I go to voice mail,” I interrupt, almost to myself. Then I hang up, and dial again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, what is wrong with her? He’s the sort of man who sent me a box full of scorpions! He has no scruples; wants nothing but to fuck Remington again. And he’s going to use my sister again—does she not even realize this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I shove my phone into the pocket of my robe, I find Remy watching me with a fierce frown. I know he likes this even less than I do, and I know he’s figuring the connection too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora returning to Scorpion at this opportune moment can be no coincidence. Scorpion lured her somehow. He wants to use her again. And I’m not letting my guy get hurt for anything in the world. Anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to go on tour with you,” I blurt out. Suddenly I don’t feel so safe. I’m pregnant, we’re apart . . . Remington has that fierce protective gleam in his eyes. I don’t know what he’ll do, but my protective instincts for both him, our baby, and myself, rage full force in me. “I want to go on tour with you,” I repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come here,” he says softly, stretching out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn three steps, I’m in his embrace. Not even bears hug this way. I feel enveloped by everything that he is as he whispers, “When can you come with me?” His hands are warm and steady as he tips my face back to his. “Brooke, when?” he softly insists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eighteen days.” An eon. A lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flash possessively and he nods deliberately. “I’m here. At ten a.m. on that eighteenth day. Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can I even reply? He’s leaving today, and everything is a fucking mess. My eyes sting a little, and I drop my face so he won’t notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn angry growl tears out of him as he steps away from me. “FUUUUCK ME WITH THIS!” He grabs fistfuls of his hair and whirls around to Pete. “We back off the season. He’ll let her go once he knows I’m not fighting anymore. And I’m sticking where I’m needed. Call it off until my daughter is born.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I realize what he’s doing, I grab him by the thick arms until he looks down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remington Tate!” His jaw is set at a determined angle, and I’m overwhelmed with panic. “I promise you by all that I am and all that I feel for you, I won’t let anything, anything, happen to me or this baby. Anything.” I cup his face and run my thumb over the dark stubble of his jaw. “We’re not going to hold you back. I couldn’t live with myself. You. Go out there. And fight. And win. Trust me. I choose you. I love my sister, but I love you more. We will help her when we can, but not at your expense! Not anymore. I’m not going to choose her this time. I choose you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fists his hand in my loose hair and looks directly at me. “I’m not going to make you choose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes burn again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crushes my mouth in a hard kiss, then stares determinedly into my eyes with a look that blazes through me. “I’ll save her as many times as she needs saving. For you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steely glint in his gaze swamps me with unease. “No,” I moan. “No, we don’t even know what’s happening anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clutches me tight. “I’m going to need your mettle out, little firecracker. I need to know you’re safe every second of the day. You don’t go anywhere alone. Don’t answer calls from any numbers but ours and Melanie’s. Don’t receive any packages. Don’t believe anything you read or hear about me. No contact with your sister without my knowledge.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-real-2/page-29.html","bookId":2737,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM"}
