{"id":110842,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003eI DIDN\u0027T TAKE THE GUY\u0027S advice and tear off out of there, though I didn\u0027t exactly sit on the front step either. I lingered nearby in a cluster of cherry trees, figuring it would only be a matter of time before the assembly ended and people spilled out the doors. After several minutes passed and nothing happened, I flipped into Lissa\u0027s mind and discovered things were still in full force. Despite Tatiana declaring twice now that the session was over, people were still standing around and arguing in groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTasha was standing in one such group with Lissa and Adrian, making one of the impassioned speeches she was so good at. Tasha might not be as coldly calculating as Tatiana was when it came to political moves, but Tasha did have a keen sense of ripples in the system and recognized opportunities when they came. She was against the age-lowering decree. She was for teaching Moroi to fight. Neither of those was getting her very far, so she jumped on the next best thing: Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are we arguing among ourselves about how best to kill Strigoi when we can save them?\" Tasha put one arm around Lissa and one around Adrian, drawing them both forward. Lissa still wore her serenely confident look, but Adrian looked ready to bolt if given half a chance. \"Vasilisa--who, by the way, is indeed being denied her fair voice here, thanks to an archaic law--has shown that Strigoi can be brought back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That hasn\u0027t been proven,\" exclaimed one man in the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\" asked a woman beside him. \"My sister was with the group that brought him back. She says he\u0027s definitely a dhampir. He was even out in the sun!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTasha nodded in approval at the woman. \"I was there as well. And now we have two spirit users capable of doing this for other Strigoi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as I respected Tasha, I wasn\u0027t entirely with her on this. The amount of power--not to mention effort involved in the staking--that Lissa had required with Dimitri had been staggering. It had even temporarily hurt the bond. That didn\u0027t mean she couldn\u0027t do it again. Nor did it mean she wouldn\u0027t want to again. She was just naively compassionate enough to throw herself into the line of fire to help others. But I knew the more power a spirit user wielded, the quicker they\u0027d travel down the road to insanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Adrian... well, he was almost a nonissue here. Even if he wanted to go staking Strigoi, he didn\u0027t have the kind of healing power it would take to restore one--at least not now. It\u0027s wasn\u0027t uncommon for Moroi to use their elements in different ways. Some fire users, like Christian, had skilled control of flame itself. Others could only use their magic to, say, warm the air in a room. Likewise, Lissa and Adrian had their strengths with spirit. His greatest healing triumph was mending a fracture, and she still couldn\u0027t walk dreams, no matter how much she practiced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, really, Tasha had one spirit user capable of saving Strigoi, and that one could hardly transform legions of those monsters. Tasha did seem to recognize this a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Council shouldn\u0027t be wasting time with age laws,\" she continued. \"We need to sink our resources into finding more spirit users and recruiting them to help save Strigoi.\" She fixed her gaze on someone in the crowd. \"Martin, didn\u0027t your brother get turned against his will? With enough work, we could bring him back to you. Alive. Just like you knew him. Otherwise, he\u0027s just going to get staked when guardians find him--and of course he\u0027ll be slaughtering innocents along the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, Tasha was good. She could paint a good image and nearly brought that Martin guy to tears. She didn\u0027t really mention people who\u0027d turned Strigoi willingly. Lissa, still standing with her, wasn\u0027t sure how she felt about the idea of a Strigoi-saving spirit army, but she did recognize how this was all part of several other plans Tasha had--including one to get Lissa voting rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTasha played up Lissa\u0027s abilities and character, scoffing at what was clearly an outdated law from an era that never could have foreseen this situation. Tasha further pointed out that a full Council of twelve families would send a message to Strigoi everywhere about Moroi unity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to hear any more. I\u0027d let Tasha wield her political magic and talk more to Lissa later. I was still so agitated about what had happened when I\u0027d yelled at the Council that I couldn\u0027t stand to see that room anymore. I left her mind and returned to my own, yelping when I saw a face right in front of mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ambrose!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the best-looking dhampirs on the planet--after Dimitri, of course--flashed me a gleaming, movie-star smile. \"You were so still, I thought maybe you were trying to be a dryad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"A what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured to the cherry trees. \"Nature spirits. Beautiful women who become one with trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure if that was a compliment or not,\" I said. \"But it\u0027s good to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmbrose was a true oddity in our culture: a male dhampir who had neither taken guardian vows nor run off to hide among humans. Female dhampirs often chose not to join the guardians in order to focus on raising families. That\u0027s why we were so rare. But men? They had no excuse, as far as most people were concerned. Rather than skulk off in disgrace, however, Ambrose had chosen to stay and simply work for the Moroi another way. He was essentially a servant--a high-class one who served drinks at elite parties and gave massages to royal women. He also, if rumors were true, served Tatiana in physical ways. That was so creepy, though, I promptly put it out of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too,\" he told me. \"But if you aren\u0027t communing with nature, what are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story. I kind of got thrown out of a Council meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked impressed. \"Literally thrown out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dragged, I guess. I\u0027m surprised I haven\u0027t seen you around,\" I mused. \"Of course, I\u0027ve kind of been, um, distracted this last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve heard,\" he said, giving me a sympathetic look. \"Although, I actually have been away. Just got back last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just in time for the fun,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guileless look on his face told me hadn\u0027t heard about the decree yet. \"What are you doing now?\" he asked. \"This doesn\u0027t look like punishment. Did you finish your sentence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that. I\u0027m kind of waiting for someone now. Was just going to hang out in my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you\u0027re killing time, why don\u0027t you come see Aunt Rhonda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rhonda?\" I scowled. \"No offense, but your aunt didn\u0027t really impress me with her abilities last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None taken,\" he said cheerfully. \"But she\u0027s been wondering about you. And Vasilisa. So, if you\u0027re just hanging around...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. He was right that I had nothing better to do right now. I was stuck on options with both Dimitri and the Council\u0027s idiotic resolutions. Yet Rhonda--his fortune-telling Moroi aunt--wasn\u0027t someone I really wanted to see again. Despite my glib words, the truth was that in retrospect, some of Rhonda\u0027s predictions had come true. I just didn\u0027t like what they\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said, trying to look bored. \"Make it fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled again, like he could see through my ruse, and led me off to a building I\u0027d been to once before. It housed a luxurious salon and spa frequented by royal Moroi. Lissa and I had had our nails done there, and as Ambrose and I wound our way through it to Rhonda\u0027s lair, I felt a strange pang within me. Manicures and pedicures... they seemed like the most trivial things in the world. But on that day, they\u0027d been wonderful. Lissa and I had laughed and grown closer... just before the school was attacked and everything fell apart....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhonda told fortunes in a back room that was far from the busy spa. Despite the seedy feel of it, she did a pretty brisk business and even had her own receptionist. Or, well, she used to. This time, the desk was empty, and Ambrose led me straight through to Rhonda\u0027s room. It looked exactly the same as before, like being inside a heart. Everything was red: the wallpaper, the decorations, and the cushions covering the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhonda herself sat on the floor, eating a cup of yogurt, which seemed terribly ordinary for someone who allegedly wielded mystical powers. Curly black hair cascaded around her shoulders, making the large gold hoops in her ears gleam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose Hathaway,\" she said happily, setting the yogurt aside. \"What a nice surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t you have seen me coming?\" I asked dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips twitched with amusement. \"That\u0027s not my power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry to interrupt your dinner,\" Ambrose said, gracefully folding his muscled body as he sat down. \"But Rose isn\u0027t easy to catch hold of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine not,\" she said. \"I\u0027m impressed you got her to come at all. What can I do for you today, Rose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged and sank down beside Ambrose. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m only here because Ambrose talked me into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t think your last reading was very good,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" I shot him a chastising look. \"That\u0027s not exactly what I said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast time, Lissa and Dimitri had been with me. Rhonda\u0027s tarot cards had shown Lissa crowned with power and light--no surprise. Rhonda had said Dimitri would lose what he valued most, and he had: his soul. And me? Rhonda had bluntly told me that I\u0027d kill the undead. I\u0027d scoffed at that, knowing I had a lifetime of Strigoi-killing ahead of me. Now I wondered if \"undead\" meant the Strigoi part of Dimitri. Even if I hadn\u0027t driven the stake, I\u0027d certainly played a major role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe another reading would help the other one make more sense?\" she offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind was putting together another fraud psychic joke, which was why it was so astonishing when my mouth said, \"That\u0027s the problem. The other one did make sense. I\u0027m afraid... I\u0027m afraid of what else the cards will show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cards don\u0027t make the future,\" she said gently. \"If something\u0027s meant to be, it\u0027ll be, regardless of whether you see it here. And even then... well, the future is always changing. If we had no choices, there\u0027d be no point in living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See now,\" I said flippantly, \"that\u0027s the kind of vague gypsy response I was hoping for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roma,\" she corrected. \"Not gypsy.\" Despite my snark, she still seemed to be in a good mood. Easygoing attitudes must have run in their family. \"Do you want the cards or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I? She was right about one thing--the future would unfold with or without me seeing it in the cards. And even if the cards showed it, I probably wouldn\u0027t understand it until afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"Just for fun. I mean, last time was probably a lucky guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhonda rolled her eyes but said nothing as she began shuffling her tarot deck. She did it with such precision that the cards seemed to move themselves. When she finally stopped, she handed the deck to me to cut. I did, and she put it back together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did three cards before,\" she said. \"We\u0027ve got time to do more if you\u0027d like. Five, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The more there are, the more likely it is that anything can get explained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t believe in them, then it shouldn\u0027t be an issue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then. Five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grew serious as she flipped out the cards, her eyes carefully studying them. Two of the cards had come out upside down. I didn\u0027t take that as a good sign. Last time, I\u0027d learned that it made seemingly happy cards... well, not so happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one was one the Two of Cups, showing a man and a woman together in a grassy, flower-filled field while the sun shone above them. Naturally, it was upside down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cups are tied to emotions,\" Rhonda explained. \"The Two of Cups shows a union, a perfect love and blossoming of joyous emotions. But since it\u0027s inverted--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what?\" I interrupted. \"I think I\u0027m getting the hang of this. You can skip that one. I have a good idea what it means.\" It might as well have been Dimitri and me on that card, the cup empty and full of heartache.... I really didn\u0027t want to hear Rhonda analyze what was already tearing my heart up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she went on to the next one: the Queen of Swords, also upside down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cards like this refer to specific people,\" Rhonda told me. The Queen of Swords looked very imperious, with auburn hair and silver robes. \"The Queen of Swords is clever. She thrives on knowledge, can outwit her enemies, and is ambitious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"But upside down...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Upside down,\" said Rhonda, \"all of those traits get twisted. She\u0027s still smart, still trying to get her way... but she\u0027s doing it through insincere ways. There\u0027s a lot of hostility and deception here. I\u0027d say you have an enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said, eyeing the crown. \"I think I can guess who. I just called her a sanctimonious bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhonda didn\u0027t comment and moved on to the next one. It was facing the right way, but I kind of wished it wasn\u0027t. It had a whole bunch of swords stuck in the ground and a woman tied and blindfolded to one. Eight of Swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" I exclaimed. \"What is it with me and swords? You gave me one this depressing last time.\" It had shown a woman weeping in front of a wall of swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was the Nine of Swords,\" she agreed. \"It could always be worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a hard time believing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the rest of the deck and scanned through it, finally pulling out one card. The Ten of Swords. \"You could have drawn this.\" It showed a dead guy lying on the ground with a bunch of swords driven through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Point taken,\" I said. Ambrose chuckled beside me. \"What\u0027s the nine mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The nine is being trapped. Unable to get out of a situation. It can also mean slander or accusation. Summoning courage to escape something.\" I glanced back at the queen, thinking of the things I\u0027d said in the Council room. Those would definitely count as accusations. And being trapped? Well, there was always the possibility of a lifetime of paperwork...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Okay, what\u0027s the next one?\" It was the best-looking one in the bunch, the Six of Swords. It had a bunch of people in a boat, rowing off over moonlit water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A journey,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just on a journey. A few of them.\" I eyed her suspiciously. \"Man, this isn\u0027t, like, some kind of a spiritual journey is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmbrose laughed again. \"Rose, I wish you\u0027d get tarot readings every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhonda ignored him. \"If it were in cups, maybe. But swords are tangible. Action. A true, out-and-about journey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere on earth would I go? Did it mean I was traveling to the Academy like Tatiana had suggested? Or was it possible that, in spite of all my rule breaking and calling her royal highness names, I might actually get an assignment after all? One away from Court?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could be looking for something. It may be a physical journey combined with a spiritual journey,\" she said, which sounded like a total way to cover her ass. \"This last one...\" Her eyebrows knitted into a frown at the fifth card. \"This is hidden from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered at it. \"The Page of Cups. Seems pretty obvious. It\u0027s a page with, um, cups.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usually I have a clear vision.... The cards speak to me in how they connect. This one\u0027s not clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only thing that\u0027s not clear is whether it\u0027s a girl or a boy.\" The person on the card looked young but had hair and an androgynous face that made the gender impossible to determine. The blue tights and tunic didn\u0027t help, though the sunny field in the background seemed promising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can be either,\" Rhonda said. \"It\u0027s the lowest in rank of the cards that represent people in each suit: King, Queen, Knight, and then Page. Whoever the page is, it\u0027s someone trustworthy and creative. Optimistic. It could mean someone who goes on the journey with you--or maybe the reason for your journey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever optimism or truth I\u0027d had in the cards pretty much disappeared with that. Given that she\u0027d just said about a hundred things it could be, I didn\u0027t really consider it authoritative. Usually, she noticed my skepticism, but her attention was still on the card as she frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I just can\u0027t tell.... There\u0027s a cloud around it. Why? It doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about her confusion sent a chill down my spine. I always told myself this was fake, but if she\u0027d been making it all up... well, wouldn\u0027t she have made something up about the Page of Cups? She wasn\u0027t putting on a very convincing act if this last card was making her question herself. The thought that maybe there was some mystical force out there blocking her sobered up my cynical attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, she looked up at last. \"Sorry that\u0027s all I can tell you. Did the rest help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scanned the cards. Heartache. An enemy. Accusations. Entrapment. Travel. \"Some of it tells me things I already know. The rest leaves me with more questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled knowingly. \"That\u0027s how it usually is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thanked her for the reading, secretly glad I didn\u0027t have to pay for it. Ambrose walked me out, and I tried to shake off the mood Rhonda\u0027s fortune had left me in. I had enough problems in my life without letting a bunch of stupid cards bother me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going to be okay?\" he asked when we finally emerged. The sun was climbing higher. The Royal Court would be going to bed soon, ending what had been a turbulent day. \"I... I wouldn\u0027t have brought you if I\u0027d known how much it would upset you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not the cards. Not exactly. There\u0027s a bunch of other things going on... one you should probably know about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t wanted to bring up the decree when we\u0027d first run into each other, but as a dhampir, he had a right to hear about what had happened. His face was perfectly still as I spoke, save for his dark brown eyes, which grew wider while the story progressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s some mistake,\" he said at last. \"They wouldn\u0027t do that. They wouldn\u0027t do that to sixteen-year-olds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, I didn\u0027t think so either, but they were apparently serious enough about it to throw me out when I, um, questioned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can just imagine your \u0027questioning.\u0027 All this\u0027ll do is make more dhampirs drop out of the guardians... unless, of course, being that young makes them more open for brainwashing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of a sensitive area for you, huh?\" I asked. After all, he too was a guardian drop-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Staying in this society was nearly impossible for me. If any of those kids do decide to drop out, they won\u0027t have the powerful friends I did. They\u0027ll be outcasts. That\u0027s all this\u0027ll do. Either kill off teens or cut them off from their own people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered what powerful friends he\u0027d had, but this was hardly the time to learn his life history. \"Well, that royal bitch doesn\u0027t seem to care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thoughtful, distracted look in his eyes suddenly sharpened. \"Don\u0027t call her that,\" he warned with a glare. \"This isn\u0027t her fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa. Cue surprise. I\u0027d almost never seen sexy, charismatic Ambrose be anything but friendly. \"Of course it\u0027s her fault! She\u0027s the supreme ruler of the Moroi, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis scowl deepened. \"The Council voted too. Not her alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but she voted in support of this decree. She swayed the vote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must have been a reason. You don\u0027t know her like I do. She wouldn\u0027t want this kind of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to ask if he was out of his mind but paused when I remembered his relationship with the queen. Those romantic rumors made me queasy, but if they were true, I supposed he might have legitimate concern for her. I also decided it was probably best that I didn\u0027t know her the way he did. The bite marks on his neck certainly indicated some sort of intimate activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever\u0027s going on between you is your business,\" I told him calmly, \"but she\u0027s used it to trick you into thinking she\u0027s someone she isn\u0027t. She did it to me too, and I fell for it. It\u0027s all a scam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it,\" he said, still stone-faced. \"As queen, she\u0027s put into all sorts of tough situations. There must be more to it--she\u0027ll change the decree, I\u0027m certain of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As queen,\" I said, imitating his tone, \"she should have the ability to--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words fell off as a voice spoke in my head. Lissa\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose, you\u0027re going to want to see this. But you have to promise not to cause any trouble. Lissa flashed a location to me, along with a sense of urgency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmbrose\u0027s hard look shifted to one of concern. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I--yeah. Lissa needs me.\" I sighed. \"Look, I don\u0027t want us to fight, okay? Obviously we\u0027ve each got different views of the situation... but I think we both agree on the same key point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That kids shouldn\u0027t be sent off to die? Yeah, we can agree on that.\" We smiled tentatively at each other, and the anger between us diffused. \"I\u0027ll talk to her, Rose. I\u0027ll find out the real story and let you know, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" I had a hard time believing anyone could really have a heart-to-heart with Tatiana, but again, there might be more to their relationship than I realized. \"Thanks. It was good seeing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too. Now go--go to Lissa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed no further urging. Along with the sense of urgency, Lissa had passed one other message through the bond that sent my feet flying: It\u0027s about Dimitri. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/spirit-bound-vampire-academy-5/page-22.html","bookId":2064,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:11:49 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:11:49 AM"}
