One dark incident changed him forever. He\u0027s a hardened actor now, famous in the eyes of the world, but tortured in his own. He doesn\u0027t care about much of anything, except for losing himself in the roles that he plays. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e23-year old Jacey Vincent doesn\u0027t realize how much her father\u0027s indifference has affected her. She is proof that sometimes it isn\u0027t one specific moment that wrecks a person, but rather it\u0027s an absence of moments. She\u0027s like a bird with a broken wing-strong yet fragile, as she tries to float through life, finding acceptance in the arms of random guys, one after the other... to fill the void that her father left in her. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eUntil she meets Dominic. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAfter jaded Dominic and strong-willed Jacey are thrown together, his secret and her issues create a dark and damaged energy that will soon turn their attraction to each other into an explosive storm. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eEven though when the clouds have cleared and the dust has settled, both of them are almost obliterated... they\u0027ve learned a priceless lesson. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSometimes, before we fall... we fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/before-we-fall-beautifully-broken-3.jpg","author":"Courtney Cole","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/before-we-fall-beautifully-broken-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:04:05 PM"}
