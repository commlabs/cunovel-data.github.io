But by the relentless blood exchange, Merrick was immensely enhanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so we formed a new coven, lively, and delighted in each other\u0027s company, and excusing each other all past sins. With every passing hour, Lestat became more the old creature of action and impulse which I had loved for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I believe that Merrick brought me to herself with a spell? I do not. I do not believe that my reason is so susceptible, but what am I to make of Oncle Vervain\u0027s designs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite deliberately, I put the matter away from my thoughts, and I embraced Merrick as truly as I ever had, even though I had to endure the sight of her fascination for Louis, and the fascination which he held for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had Lestat again, did I not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was two nights later¡ªnights of no remarkable events or achievements, except for Merrick\u0027s ever increasing experience¡ªthat I put the question to him that had so troubled me about his long sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in the beautifully appointed front parlor in the Rue Royale, looking quite wonderful in his sleekly cut black velvet, what with cameo buttons, no less, and his handsome yellow hair shimmering as it ought to do in the familiar light of his numerous lamps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your long slumber frightened me,\" I confessed. \"There were times when I could have sworn you were no longer in the body. Of course I talk again of a form of hearing denied to me as your pupil. But I speak of a human instinct in me which is quite strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went on telling him how it had so completely unnerved me to see him thus, to be unable to rouse him, and to fear that his soul had taken to wandering and might not return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for some moments, and I thought for a split second that I saw a shadow fall over his face. Then he gave me a warm smile and gestured for me to worry no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe some night I\u0027ll tell you about it,\" he said. \"For now let me say that there was some truth in your conjecture. I wasn\u0027t always there.\" He broke off, thinking, even whispering something which I couldn\u0027t hear. Then he went on. \"As for where I was, I can\u0027t now explain it. But again, maybe some night, to you, above all others, I will try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy curiosity was dreadfully aroused and for a moment I was maddened by him, but when he began to laugh at me, I remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t go back to my slumber,\" he said finally. He became quite sober and convincing. \"I want you all to be assured of it. Years have passed since Memnoch came to me. You might say it took all my reserve to weather that terrible ordeal. As for the time when I was waked before by Sybelle\u0027s music, I was more nearly close to all of you than I came to be some time later on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tease me with hints that something happened to you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps it did,\" he answered, his vacillations and his playful tone infuriating me. \"Perhaps it did not. David, how am I to know? Be patient. We have each other now again, and Louis has ceased to be the emblem of our discontent. Believe me, I\u0027m happy for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and I nodded, but the mere thought of Louis brought to mind the gruesome sight of his burnt remains in the casket. It had been the living proof that the quiet omnipotent glory of the daily sun would never shine upon me again. It had been the living proof that we can perish so very easily, that all the mortal world is a lethal enemy during those hours between dawn and dusk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve lost so much time,\" Lestat remarked in his habitual energetic fashion, eyes moving about the room. \"There are so many books I mean to read, and things I mean to see. The world\u0027s around me again. I\u0027m where I belong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose we might have spent a quiet evening after that, both of us reading, both of us enjoying the comfort of those lushly domestic Impressionist paintings, if Merrick and Louis had not come so suddenly up the iron stairs and down the corridor to the front room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerrick had not given up her penchant for shirtwaisted dresses and she looked splendid in her dark\u001egreen silk. She led the way, the more reticent Louis coming behind her. They both sat upon the brocade sofa opposite, and straightaway Lestat asked:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Talamasca,\" said Merrick. \"I think it\u0027s wise to leave New Orleans. I think we should do it at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s sheer nonsense,\" said Lestat immediately. \"I won\u0027t hear of it.\" At once his face was flushed with expression. \"I\u0027ve never been afraid of mortals in my life. I have no fear of the Talamasca.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you should have,\" said Louis. \"You must listen to the letter which Merrick has received.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, \u0027received?\u0027\" asked Lestat crossly. \"Merrick, you didn\u0027t go back to the Motherhouse! Surely you knew such a thing couldn\u0027t be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I didn\u0027t, and my loyalty to the rest of you is total, don\u0027t question it,\" she fired back. \"But this letter was left at my old house here in New Orleans. I found it this evening, and I don\u0027t like it, and I think it\u0027s time that we reconsider everything, though you may lay it down as my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t reconsider anything,\" said Lestat. \"Read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she drew it out of her canvas bag, I saw it was a handdelivered missive from the Elders. It was written on a true parchment meant to stand the test of centuries, though a machine had no doubt printed it for when did the Elders ever put their own hands to what they wrote?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merrick,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have learnt with great dismay about your recent experiments in the old house in which you were born. We order you to leave New Orleans as soon as you possibly can. Have no further discourse with your fellow members in the Talamasca, or with that select and dangerous company which has so obviously seduced you, and come to us in Amsterdam directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour room is already prepared for you in the Motherhouse, and we expect these instructions to be obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease understand that we want, as always, to learn with you from your recent and ill\u001eadvised experiences, but there can be no miscalculation as to our admonitions. You are to break off your relations with those who can never have our sanction and you are to come to us at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laid it down in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It bears the seal of the Elders,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see this wax stamp plainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are we to care that it bears their seal,\" demanded Lestat, \"or the seal of anyone else? They can\u0027t force you to come to Amsterdam. Why do you even entertain such an idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be patient with me,\" she spoke up immediately. \"I\u0027m not entertaining any such idea. What I\u0027m saying is that we\u0027ve been carefully watched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat shook his head. \"We\u0027ve always been carefully watched. I\u0027ve masqueraded as one of my own fictions for over a decade. What do I care if I\u0027m carefully watched? I defy anyone to harm me. I always have in my fashion. I\u0027ve rarely ... rarely ... been wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Lestat,\" said Louis, leaning forward and looking him directly in the eyes. \"This means the Talamasca has made what they believe to be a sighting of us¡ªDavid and me¡ªon Merrick\u0027s premises. And that\u0027s dangerous, dangerous because it can make enemies for us among those who truly believe in what we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t believe it,\" declared Lestat. \"No one believes it. That\u0027s what always protects us. No one believes in what we are but us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" said Merrick before I could speak up. \"They do believe in you¡ª.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so \u0027they watch and they are always here,\u0027\" said Lestat, mocking the old motto of the Order, the very motto printed on the calling cards I once carried when I walked the earth as a regular man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nevertheless,\" I said quickly, \"we should leave for now. We cannot go back to Merrick\u0027s house, any of us. As for here in the Rue Royale, we cannot remain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t give in to them,\" said Lestat. \"They won\u0027t order me about in this city which belongs to me. By day we sleep in hiding¡ªat least the three of you choose to sleep in hiding¡ªbut the night and the city belong to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so does the city belong to us?\" asked Louis with near touching innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat cut him off with a contemptuous gesture. \"For two hundred years I\u0027ve lived here,\" he said in a passionate low voice. \"I won\u0027t leave because of an Order of scholars. How many years ago was it, David, that I came to visit you in the Motherhouse in London? I was never afraid of you. I challenged you with my questions. I demanded you make a separate file for me among your voluminous records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lestat, but I think now things might be different.\" I was looking intently at Merrick. \"Have you told us everything, darling?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said, staring before her as if at the workings of the very problem. \"I\u0027ve told you everything, but you see, this was written some days ago. And now everything\u0027s changed.\" She looked up at me, finally. \"If we\u0027re being watched, as I suspect we are, then they know just how much everything has changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat rose to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t fear the Talamasca,\" he declared with heavy emphasis. \"I don\u0027t fear anyone. If the Talamasca had wanted me it might have come for me during all the years I\u0027ve slept in the dust at St. Elizabeth\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you see, that\u0027s just it,\" said Merrick. \"They didn\u0027t want you. They wanted to watch you. They wanted to be close, as always, privy to knowledge which no one else possessed, but they didn\u0027t want to touch you. They didn\u0027t want to turn your considerable power against themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, that\u0027s well put,\" he said. \"I like that. My considerable power. They\u0027d do well to think on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, I beg you,\" I said, \"don\u0027t threaten the Talamasca.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why not threaten them?\" he asked of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t think of actually doing harm to members of the Talamasca,\" I said, speaking a bit too sharply, in my concern. \"You can\u0027t do this out of respect for Merrick and for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re being threatened, aren\u0027t you?\" asked Lestat. \"We\u0027re all being threatened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t understand,\" said Merrick. \"It\u0027s too dangerous for you to do anything to the Talamasca. They are a large organization, an ancient organization¡ª.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care,\" Lestat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"¡ªand they do know what you are,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lestat, sit down again, please,\" said Louis. \"Don\u0027t you see the point? It isn\u0027t merely their considerable age and power. It isn\u0027t merely their resources. It\u0027s who they truly are. They know of us, they can resolve to interfere with us. They can resolve to cause us great harm wherever we might go, anywhere in this world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re dreaming, handsome friend,\" Lestat said. \"Think on the blood I\u0027ve shared with you. Think on it, Merrick. And think on the Talamasca and its stodgy ways. What did it do when Jesse Reeves was lost to the Order? There were no threats then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do think of their ways, Lestat,\" Merrick said forcefully. \"I think we should leave here. We should take with us all evidence that would feed their investigation. We should go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat glared at each and every one of us, and then stormed out of the flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that long night, we didn\u0027t know where he was. We knew his feelings, yes, and we understood them and we respected them, and in some unspoken fashion we resolved that we would do what he said. If we had a leader, it was Lestat. As dawn approached we took great care in going to our hiding places. We shared the common sentiment that we were no longer concealed by the human crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter sunset the following evening, Lestat returned to the flat in the Rue Royale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerrick had gone down to receive another letter from a special courier, a letter of which I was in dread, and Lestat appeared in the front parlor of the flat just before her return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat was windblown and flushed and angry, and he walked about with noisy strides, a bit like an archangel looking for a lost sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please get yourself in hand,\" I said to him adamantly. He glared at me, but then took a chair, and, looking furiously from me to Louis, he waited for Merrick to come into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last Merrick appeared with the opened envelope and the parchment paper in her hand. I can only describe the expression on her face as one of astonishment, and she looked to me before she glanced at the others, and then she looked to me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatiently, gesturing to Lestat to be still, I watched her take her place on the damask sofa, at Louis\u0027s side. I couldn\u0027t help but notice that he made no attempt to read the letter over her shoulder. He merely waited, but he was as anxious as I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s so very extraordinary,\" she said in a halting manner. \"I\u0027ve never known the Elders to take such a stand. I\u0027ve never known anyone in our Order to be so very explicit. I\u0027ve known scholarship, I\u0027ve known observation, I\u0027ve known endless reports of ghosts, witchcraft, vampires, yes, even vampires. But I\u0027ve never seen anything quite like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the single page and with a dazed expression read it aloud:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know what you have done to Merrick Mayfair. We advise you now that Merrick Mayfair must return to us. We will accept no explanations, no excuses, no apologies. We do not mean to traffic in words with regard to this matter. Merrick Mayfair must return and we will settle for nothing else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat laughed softly. \"What do they think you are, cherie,\" he said, \"that they tell us to give you over to them? Do they think you\u0027re a precious jewel? My, but these mossbacked scholars are misogynist. I\u0027ve never been such a perfect brute myself \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What more does it say?\" I asked quickly. \"You haven\u0027t read it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed to wake from her daze, and then to look down again at the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are prepared to abandon our passive posture of centuries with regard to your existence. We are prepared to declare you an enemy which must be exterminated at all costs. We are prepared to use our considerable power and resources to see that you are destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComply with our request and we will tolerate your presence in New Orleans and its environs. We will return to our harmless observations. But if Merrick Mayfair does not return at once to the Motherhouse called Oak Haven, we will take steps to make of you a quarry in any part of the world to which you might go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly now did Lestat\u0027s face lose its stamp of anger and contempt. Only now did he become quiet and thoughtful, which I did not interpret altogether as a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s quite interesting actually,\" he said, raising his eyebrows. \"Quite interesting indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long silence gripped Merrick, during which time I think Louis asked some question about the age of the Elders, their identity, hitting upon things of which I knew nothing, and about which I had grave doubts. I think I managed to convey to him that no one within the Order knew who the Elders were. There were times when their very communications had been corrupted, but in the main they ruled the Order. It was authoritarian and always had been since its cloudy origins, of which we knew so little, even those of us who had spent our lives within the Order\u0027s walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Merrick spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you see what\u0027s happened?\" she said. \"In all my selfish plotting I\u0027ve thrown down a gauntlet to the Elders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not you alone, darling,\" I was quick to add.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not,\" she said, her expression still one of shock, \"but only insomuch as I was responsible for the spells. But we\u0027ve gone so far in these last few nights that they can no longer ignore us. Long ago it was Jesse. Then it was David, and now it\u0027s Merrick. Don\u0027t you see? Their long scholarly flirtation with the vampires has led to disaster, and now they\u0027re challenged to do something that¡ªas far as we know¡ªthey\u0027ve never done before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing will come of this,\" said Lestat. \"You mark my words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what of the other vampires?\" said Merrick softly, looking at him as she spoke. \"What will your own elders say when they learn of what\u0027s been done here? Novels with fancy covers, vampire films, eerie music¡ªthese things don\u0027t rouse a human enemy. In fact, they make a comforting and flexible disguise. But what we\u0027ve done has now roused the Talamasca, and it doesn\u0027t declare war on us alone, it declares war on our species, and that means others, don\u0027t you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat looked both stymied and infuriated. I could all but see the little wheels turning in his brain. There crept into his expression something utterly hostile and mischievous which I had certainly seen in years past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, if I go to them,\" said Merrick, \"if I give myself over to them¡ª.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s unthinkable,\" said Louis. \"Even they must know that themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the worst thing you could do,\" I interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put yourself in their hands?\" asked Lestat sarcastically, \"in this era of a technology that could probably reproduce your cells within your own blood in a laboratory? No. Unthinkable. Good word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to be in their hands,\" said Merrick. \"I don\u0027t want to be surrounded by those who share a life I\u0027ve lost completely. That was never, never my plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you won\u0027t be,\" said Louis. \"You\u0027ll be with us, and we\u0027re leaving here. We should be making preparations, destroying any evidence with which they can back their designs for the rank and file.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will the old ones understand why I didn\u0027t go to them,\" she asked, \"when they find their peace and solitude invaded by a new type of scholar? Don\u0027t you see what\u0027s involved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You underestimate us all,\" I said calmly. \"But I think we are spending our last night in this flat; and to all these various objects which have been such a solace, I\u0027m saying my farewell, as should we all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked to Lestat, each of us, studying his knotted angry face. Finally, he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do realize, don\u0027t you?\" he asked me directly, \"that I can easily wipe out the very members who made the observations that are threatening us now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once Merrick protested, and so did I. It was all a matter of desperate gestures, and then I gave in to a rapid plea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do this thing, Lestat,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s leave here. Let\u0027s kill their faith, not them. Like a small retreating army, we\u0027ll burn all evidence which might have become their trophies. I cannot endure the thought of turning against the Talamasca. I cannot. What more can I say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerrick nodded, though she remained quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Lestat spoke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right then,\" he said with vengeful finality. \"I give in to you all because I love you. We\u0027ll go. We\u0027ll leave this house which has been my home for so many years; we\u0027ll leave this city which we all love; we\u0027ll leave all this, and we\u0027ll find someplace where no one can pick us out of the multitudes. We\u0027ll do it, but I tell you, I don\u0027t like it, and for me the members of the Order have lost by these very communications any special protective shield they might have once possessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was settled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went to work, swiftly, silently, making certain that nothing remained which contained the potent blood which the Talamasca would seek to examine as soon as it could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flat was soon clean of all that might have been claimed as evidence, and then the four of us went over to Merrick\u0027s house and carried out the same thorough cleansing, burning the white silk dress of the terrible seance, and destroying her altars as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had then to visit my erstwhile study at St. Elizabeth\u0027s and burn the contents of my many journals and essays, a task for which I had no taste at all. It was tiresome, it was defeating, it was demoralizing. But it was done. And so, on the very next night, we came to leave New Orleans. And well before morning, the three¡ªLouis and Merrick and Lestat¡ªwent ahead. I remained behind in the Rue Royale, at the desk in the back parlor, to write a letter to those whom I had once trusted so very much, those I had once so dearly loved. In my own hand I wrote it, so that they might recognize that the writing was of special significance to me, if to no one else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my beloved Elders, whoever you might truly be,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was unwise of you to send to us such caustic and combative letters, and I fear that some night you might¡ªsome of you have to pay dearly for what you\u0027ve done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease understand, this is no challenge. I am leaving, and by the time you claim this letter by means of your questionable procedures, I will be well beyond your reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut know this. Your threats have greatly roused the tender pride of the strongest among us, one who had for some time now regarded you as quite beyond his eager reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy your ill\u001echosen words and threats you have forfeited the formidable sanctuary which enshrined you. You are now as exquisitely vulnerable to those whom you thought to frighten as any other mortal woman or man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, you have made another rather grievous error, and I advise you to think on it long and well before plotting any further action in regard to the secrets we both share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have made yourselves an interesting adversary to one who loves challenges, and it will require all of my considerable influence to protect you individually and collectively from the avid lust which you have so foolishly aroused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had read this over carefully, and was in the act of affixing my signature when I felt Lestat\u0027s cold hand on my shoulder, pressing firmly on my flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe repeated the words \"an interesting adversary,\" and there came from him a sly laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t hurt them, please,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, David,\" he said confidently, \"it\u0027s time for us to leave here. Come. Prompt me to tell you about my ethereal wanderings, or perhaps give you some other tale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bent over the paper, completing my signature carefully, and it occurred to me that I had no count of the many documents I had written for, and in, the Talamasca, and that once more, to one such document, a document which would go into their files, I had put my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, old friend, I\u0027m ready,\" I said. \"But give me your word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked down the long corridor to the back of the flat together, his hand heavy but welcome on my shoulder, his clothes and hair smelling of the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are tales to be written, David,\" he said. \"You won\u0027t keep us all from that, will you? Surely we can go on with our confessions and maintain our new hiding place as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" I answered. \"That we can do. The written word belongs to us, Lestat. Isn\u0027t that enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what, old boy,\" he said, stopping on the rear balcony and throwing a passing glance over the flat which he had so loved. \"Let\u0027s leave it up to the Talamasca, shall we? I\u0027ll become the very saint of patience for you, I promise, unless they raise the stakes. Is that not fair enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough,\" I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I close this account of how Merrick Mayfair came to be one of us. So I close the account of how we left New Orleans and went to lose ourselves in the great world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for you, my brothers and sisters in the Talamasca, as well as for a multitude of others, I have penned this tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:30 p.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 25, 1999 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/merrick-the-vampire-chronicles-7/page-26.html","bookId":2215,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:55 PM"}
