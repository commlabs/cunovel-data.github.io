I have his credit card, too, for spending money. Ms. Rothschild loaned me her tiny umbrella and her portable cell phone charger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaddy gives me a sidelong look and a sigh. “It’s all happening so fast now. First your senior trip, then prom, then graduation. Only a matter of time before you’re out of the house too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll still have Kitty,” I say. “Though it’s true that she isn’t exactly the ray of sunshine that I am.” He laughs. “If I get into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUVA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, I’ll be around all the time, so don’t you worry about a thing.” I sing it the way he does, like Stevie Wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the bus I sit next to Peter; Chris sits with Lucas. I thought it might be a tough sell to get Chris to come on the senior trip, and it would have been, if Disney World had won out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she’s never been to New York before either, so it ended up being easy peasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re on the road for an hour before Peter engages everybody in a game of Never Have I Ever, which I pretend to be asleep for, because I have not done much of anything, drugs-wise or sex-wise, and that’s all anybody cares about. Mercifully, the game dies down pretty fast, I suppose because it’s a lot less exciting when there are no red Solo cups involved. Just as I’m opening my eyes and stretching my arms and “waking up,” Gabe suggests Truth or Dare, and my stomach takes a nosedive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since Peter’s and my hot tub video scandal last year, I’ve felt self-conscious about what people might be thinking about what we do or don’t do. Sex-wise, I mean. And Truth or Dare is miles worse than Never Have I Ever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many people have you had sex with? Have you ever been in a threeway? How many times a day do you jerk off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are the kinds of questions people ask each other, and if anybody ever asked them of me, I would have to say that I’m a virgin, and in some ways, that’s even more subversive than any other answer. Usually, I slip away to the kitchen or another room when this game gets started at other parties. But there’s nowhere for me to slip away to today, for we are on a bus, and I am well and truly trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter gives me an amused look. He knows what I’m thinking. He says he doesn’t care what people think, but I know that’s not true. Historically, Peter cares very much what other people think of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truth or dare,” Gabe says to Lucas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas takes a swig of his Vitaminwater. “Truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you ever had sex with a dude?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy whole body goes tight. Lucas is gay, and he’s out, but he isn’t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout. He doesn’t want to deal with having to explain himself to people all the time, and why should he have to? It’s not like it’s anybody else’s business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a quick beat before Lucas says, “No. Is that an offer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody laughs, and Lucas has a slight smile on his face as he takes another swig of Vitaminwater, but I can see the tension in his neck, his shoulders. It must take a toll, having to be on guard for these kinds of questions, ready to deflect, to smile, to laugh it off. My virginity question is tiny in comparison. But I still don’t want to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pray that Lucas picks me next, because I know he’ll go easy on me. But Lucas must not notice the pleading glances I am throwing his way, because instead of picking me, he chooses Genevieve, who is sitting a few rows back, looking at her phone. She’s been dating a guy from her church and he goes to a different school, so no one sees her around as much. I heard from Chris that her parents got divorced, and that her dad moved into a new condo with his girlfriend. Chris said Genevieve’s mom had a breakdown and had to be hospitalized for a few days, but things are better now, which I’m glad for. Peter sent daffodils to her mom when she came back home, and we labored over what the card should say—we finally decided on just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe well, Wendy. Love, Peter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flowers were my idea, and I chipped in, but of course I didn’t put my name on the card. I’ve just always liked Wendy; she’s been nice to me since I was little. I still get that nervous dip in my stomach when I see Genevieve, but not as bad as it used to be. I know we’ll never be friends again, and I’ve made my peace with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truth or dare, Gen,” Lucas calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up. Automatically she says, “Dare.” Of course Genevieve picks dare; she’s a lot of things, but she’s no coward. I’d rather do anything than answer a sex question, so I’ll likely be picking dare too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas dares Genevieve to go sit next to Mr. Jain and put her head on his shoulder. “Make it believable,” Lucas says. Everyone howls with laughter. I can tell she really doesn’t want to do it, but again, she’s not a coward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all watch as she makes her way up the aisle and then stops at Mr. Jain’s row. Mr. Jain is new this year; he teaches biology. He’s on the younger side, handsome; he wears skinny jeans with button-downs to school. Genevieve slides into the seat next to him, and all I can see is the back of her head as she talks. He’s smiling. Then she snuggles closer to him and drops her head on his shoulder, and he jumps like a scared cat. Everyone is laughing, and Mr. Jain turns around and shakes his head at us, looking relieved it was a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve returns to us, triumphant. She takes her seat and looks around the group; our eyes meet for a moment, and my stomach dips. Then she looks away. “Truth or dare, Chrissy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This game is so lame,” Chris says. Gen just stares at her,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyebrows raised in challenge, and Chris finally rolls her eyes and says, “Whatever. Truth.” When they go head-to-head like this, it’s impossible not to notice that they are related—first cousins, on their moms’ side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve takes her time thinking up her question. Then she lands the whammy. “Did you or did you not play doctor with our cousin Alex when we were in third grade? And don’t lie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone is whooping and hollering, and Chris’s face has gone bright red. I give her a sympathetic look. I know the answer to this one. “True,” she mutters, and everyone howls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily for me, this is about when Mr. Jain gets up and puts a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDVD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDVD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplayer, so the game dissolves and my turn never comes. Chris turns around and says to me in a low voice, “You got off so easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t I know it,” I whisper back, and Peter chuckles. He can chuckle all he wants, but I’m sure he’s a little relieved too. Not that he’s ever said so, but it’s not like he’d want the whole senior class to know that he and his girlfriend of a year—longer, if you count our fake relationship—have never had sex before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardly anybody in our class has been to New York City, so we’re all just a little wide-eyed about it. I don’t think I’ve ever been in a place so alive. It’s a city that has its own heartbeat. I just can’t believe how many people there are, how crowded it is, how sophisticated everyone looks. They all look like—like city people. Except for the tourists like us, of course. Chris tries to act bored and unfazed by it all, but when we get on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe subway to go to the Empire State Building, she doesn’t hold on to the pole and nearly falls over when we come to a sudden stop. “It’s different than in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e,” she mutters. That’s for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eis the closest big city to Charlottesville, but it’s still a sleepy little town compared to New York. There’s so much to see, so many stores I wish we could stop in. Everyone is in a hurry; they all have plans and places to be. Peter gets screamed at by an old lady for walking and looking at his cell phone, which makes everyone laugh, and for once, Peter is embarrassed. It’s all so overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we get to the Empire State Building, I make Peter take a selfie with me at the elevators. At the top, I feel light-headed, we’re so high up. Ms. Davenport tells me to sit with my head between my knees for a minute, which helps. When the nausea passes, I get up and go looking for Peter, who has disappeared during my time of need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I turn the corner, I hear Peter calling out, “Wait! Wait! Sir!” He’s following a security guard who is approaching a red backpack on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security guard bends down and picks it up. “Is this yours?” he demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, yeah—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you leave it on the ground?” He unzips the backpack and pulls out a teddy bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter’s eyes dart around. “Can you put that back inside? It’s for a promposal for my girlfriend. It’s supposed to be a surprise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security guard is shaking his head. He mutters to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehimself and starts looking in the backpack again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, please just squeeze the bear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not squeezing the bear,” the security guard tells him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter reaches out and squeezes the teddy bear and the bear squeaks out, “Will you go to prom with me, Lara Jean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clap my hands to my mouth in delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSternly the security guard says, “You’re in New York City, kid. You can’t just leave a backpack on the ground for your proposal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s actually called a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epromposal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e,” Peter corrects, and the security guard gives him a look. “Sorry. Can I just have the bear back?” He spots me then. “Tell him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleepless in Seattle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eis your favorite movie, Lara Jean!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rush over. “Sir, it’s my favorite movie. Please don’t kick him out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security guard is trying not to smile. “I wasn’t going to kick him out,” he says to me. To Peter he says, “Just be more aware next time. In New York, we’re vigilant. If we see something, we say something, do you feel me? This is not whatever little country town you guys are from. This is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew York City\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. We do not play around here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Peter and I nod, and the security guard walks away. As soon as he’s gone, Peter and I look at each other and break out into giddy laughter. “Somebody reported my book bag!” he says. “My promposal got fucked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the teddy bear out of his bag and hug it to my chest. I’m so happy I don’t even tell him not to cuss. “I love it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were going to turn the corner, and see the book bag\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eright here by the telescopes. Then you were going to pick up the bear, and squeeze it, and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How was I going to know to squeeze it?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter pulls a crumpled piece of paper out of the bag. It says,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSqueeze Me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. “It fell off when the security guard was manhandling it. See? I thought of everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything except the ramifications of leaving an unattended bag in a public place in New York City, but still! It’s the thought that counts, and the thought is the sweetest. I squeeze the bear, and again he says, “Will you go to prom with me, Lara Jean?” “Yes, I will, Howard.” Howard is, of course, the name of the bear from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleepless in Seattle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you saying yes to him and not to me?” Peter demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he asked.” I raise my eyebrows at him and wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling his eyes, Peter mumbles, “Lara Jean, will you go to prom with me? God, you really do ask for a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold the bear out to him. “I will, but first kiss Howard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Covey. No. Hell, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please!” I give him a pleading look. “It’s in the movie, Peter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd grumbling, he does it, in front of everybody, which is how I know he is utterly and completely mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the bus to our hotel in New Jersey, Peter whispers to me, “What do you think—should we sneak out after bed checks and come back to the city?” He’s mostly joking. He knows I’m not the type to sneak out on a school trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes go wide when I say, “How would we even get to the city? Do taxis go from New Jersey to New York?” I can’t even believe I am considering it. It’s so unlike me. Hastily I say, “No, no, never mind. We can’t. We’d get lost, or mugged, and then we’d get sent home, and then I’d be so mad we missed out on Central Park and everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter gives me a skeptical look. “Do you really think Jain and Davenport would send us home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe not, but they might make us stay at the hotel all day long as punishment, which is even worse. Let’s not risk it.” Then: “What would we do?” I’m playing pretend now, not really planning, but Peter plays along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could go hear some live music, or go to a comedy show. Sometimes famous comedians do surprise sets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish we could see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHamilton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.” When we drove through Times Square, Lucas and I craned our heads to see if we could get a glimpse of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHamilton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emarquee, but no such luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow I want to get a New York bagel and see how it stacks up against Bodo’s.” Bodo’s Bagels are legendary in Charlottesville; we’re very proud of those bagels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting my head on his shoulder, I yawn and say, “I wish we could go to Levain Bakery so I could try their cookie. It’s supposed to be like no chocolate chip cookie you’ve had before. I want to go to Jacques Torres’s chocolate shop too. His chocolate chip cookie is the definitive chocolate chip cookie, you know. It’s truly legendary. . . .” My eyes drift closed, and Peter pats my hair. I’m starting to fall asleep when I realize he’s unraveling the milkmaid braids Kitty pinned on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe crown of my head. My eyes fly back open. “Peter!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh, go back to sleep. I want to practice something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll never get it back to how she had it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just let me try,” he says, collecting bobby pins in the palm of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we get to the hotel in New Jersey, despite his best efforts, my braids are lumpy and loose and won’t stay pinned. “I’m sending a picture of this to Kitty so she’ll see what a bad student you are,” I say as I gather up my things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, don’t,” Peter quickly says, which makes me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day is surprisingly springlike for March. The sun is shining and flowers are just beginning to bud. It feels like I’m in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve Got Mail\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, when Kathleen Kelly goes to meet Joe Fox in Riverside Park. I would love to see the exact garden where they kiss at the end of the movie, but our tour guide brings us to Central Park instead. Chris and I are taking pictures of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emosaic in Strawberry Fields when I realize Peter is nowhere in sight. I ask Gabe and Darrell, but no one’s seen him. I text him, but he doesn’t reply. We’re about to move on to Sheep Meadow for a picnic, and I’m starting to panic, because what if Mr. Jain or Ms. Davenport notices he’s not here? He comes jogging up just as we’re about to go. He’s not even out of breath or the least bit concerned he almost got left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where were you?” I demand. “We almost left!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriumphantly he holds up a brown paper bag. “Open it and see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab the bag from him and look inside. It’s a Levain chocolate chip cookie, still warm. “Oh my God, Peter! You’re so thoughtful.” I get on my tiptoes and hug him, and then turn to Chris. “Isn’t he so thoughtful, Chris?” Peter’s sweet, but he’s never this sweet. This is two romantic things in a row, so I figure I should praise him accordingly, because the boy responds well to positive reinforcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s already got her hand inside the bag, and she stuffs a piece of cookie in her mouth. “Very thoughtful.” She reaches for another piece, but Peter snatches the bag away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn, Chris! Let Covey have a bite before you eat the whole thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, why’d you only get one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because it’s huge! And it cost, like, five bucks for one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you ran and got this for me,” I say. “You weren’t nervous you’d get lost?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah,” he says, all proud. “I just looked at Google Maps and ran for it. I got a little turned around when I got back in the park, but somebody gave me directions. New Yorkers are really friendly. All that stuff about them being rude must be bullshit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s true. Everyone we’ve met has been really nice. Except for that old lady who screamed at you for walking and looking at your phone,” Chris says, snickering at Peter, who scowls at her. I take a big bite of the cookie. The Levain cookie is more like a scone, really dense and doughy. Heavy, too. It really is like no chocolate chip cookie I’ve ever tasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?” Peter asks me. “What’s the verdict?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s unique. It’s in a class of its own.” I’m taking another bite when Ms. Davenport comes up and hustles us along, eyeing the cookie in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur tour guide has a pointer that looks like the Statue of Liberty’s torch, and he holds it up in the air to shepherd us through the park. It’s actually pretty embarrassing, and I wish we could just go off by ourselves and explore the city, but no. He has a ponytail and he wears a khaki vest, and I think he’s kind of corny, but Ms. Davenport seems to be into him. After Central Park we take the subway downtown and get off to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. While everyone else is in line for ice cream at Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, Peter and I run over to Jacques Torres’s chocolate shop. It’s Peter’s idea. Of course I ask Ms. Davenport for permission first. She’s busy talking to the tour guide, so she waves us off. I feel so grown up, walking through the streets of New York without any adults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we get to the store, I’m so excited, I’m shaking. Finally I get to try Jacques’s famous chocolate chip cookie. I bite into it. This cookie is flat, chewy, dense. Chocolate has pooled on top and hardened! The butter and sugar taste almost caramelized. It’s heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yours are better,” Peter says, his mouth rudely full, and I shush him, looking around to make sure the girl at the register didn’t hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop lying,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is. “I just don’t know why mine aren’t like his,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It must be the industrial ovens.” It seems I’ll just have to accept my not-quite-perfect chocolate chip cookie and be content with good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we step out the door, I notice a bakery across the street called Almondine and another one on the opposite corner called One Girl Cookies. New York is truly a city of baked goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter and I walk back to the ice cream shop holding hands. Everyone is out on the pier, sitting on benches, eating their ice cream, and taking selfies with the Manhattan skyline behind them. New York keeps surprising me with how pretty it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter must be thinking the same thing, because he squeezes my hand and says, “This city is awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It really is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m sound asleep when there is a knock at the door. I wake up with a start. It’s still dark outside. In the bed across the room, Chris doesn’t stir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I hear Peter’s voice on the other side of the door. “Covey, it’s me. Want to go watch the sunrise on the roof?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get out of bed and open the door, and there is Peter, in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUVA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehoodie, holding a Styrofoam cup of coffee and a cup with a tea bag hanging out the side. “What time is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five thirty. Hurry, go get your coat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, give me two minutes,” I whisper. I run to our bathroom and brush my teeth and then I fumble around in the darkness for my jacket. “I can’t find my jacket!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can wear my hoodie,” Peter offers from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom under her blanket Chris growls, “If you guys don’t shut up, I swear to God.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” I whisper. “Do you want to watch the sunrise with us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter shoots me a pouty look, but Chris’s head is still under her blanket, so she doesn’t see. “No. Just leave!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, sorry,” I say, and I scurry out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe take the elevator to the top, and it’s still dark outside, but it’s beginning to get light. The city is just waking up. Right away Peter shrugs out of his hoodie, and I put my arms up and he slips it over my head. It’s warm and smells like the detergent his mother uses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter leans over the edge, looking across the water to the city. “Can’t you picture us living here after college? We could live in a skyscraper. With a doorman. And a gym.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to live in a skyscraper. I want to live in a brownstone in the West Village. Near a bookstore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll figure it out,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean over the edge too. I never would have pictured myself living in New York City. Before I came here, it seemed like such an intimidating place, for tough people who aren’t afraid to get into a fight with someone on the subway, or men in suits who work on Wall Street, or artists who live in SoHo lofts. But now that I’m here, it’s not so scary, not with Peter by my side. I steal a look at him. Is this how it goes? You fall in love, and nothing seems truly scary anymore, and life is one big possibility? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/always-and-forever-lara-jean-to-all-the-boys-i-ve-loved-before-3/page-6.html","bookId":1775,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
