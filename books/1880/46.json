And there\u0027s a huge difference between the two. \"Yes. I can move past this because of how much I love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just because you\u0027ve decided to get over it doesn\u0027t mean you have to let him know he\u0027s off the hook yet. Let him simmer on the back burner a few days and sweat it out so it\u0027s a lesson he doesn\u0027t forget any time soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think so. \"It better be a lesson he never forgets!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then all the better to let him worry a few days. We\u0027ll hang out and do wedding stuff while he\u0027s at Avalon pacing the floor. Although I took his side, I do think he deserves that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little worry and pacing won\u0027t hurt him a bit. \"I agree. I can\u0027t let him out of the penalty box after only one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He needs to be in there at least three days so you don\u0027t look like a pushover. Don\u0027t ever forget that it\u0027s your job to teach him how to treat you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s day three of Jack Henry being in the penalty box. We\u0027ve not spoken since the morning he left, and I miss him terribly. For every time I don\u0027t call him, I almost do. I think I would have if Addison hadn\u0027t been with me, but she\u0027s kept me strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve spent the last two days with the McLachlan women invading every bridal shop in Sydney. The more time I spend with them, the more I adore them. It\u0027s like having a normal, loving mom and sisters. And it\u0027s wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Henry wouldn\u0027t be the only one I\u0027d miss if we parted ways, so it\u0027s a good thing we\u0027re not. But he still doesn\u0027t know that. I realize it\u0027s a little on the cruel side to keep him in the dark. I\u0027m beginning to feel a little guilty about that, but I\u0027m glad to be going home so we can put this behind us and move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait for him to pick up as the phone rings. He doesn\u0027t say hello when he answers, and my heart skips a beat at the sound of his voice saying my name. \"L.\" I love his new nickname for me. It\u0027s so much more intimate than calling me Laurie like everyone else does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was calling to see if you\u0027d send Daniel to get Addison. She\u0027s ready to get back to Zac.\" And I\u0027m ready to get back to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could he be here by lunch tomorrow?\" I already know he can. Jack Henry would send him now if it\u0027s what I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely. Tell her to expect him at twelve.\" I know Daniel well enough to know it will be straight up twelve o\u0027clock when he pulls into the drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll let her know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a pregnant pause before he asks, \"How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m weak and ready to break down. I want to say that I\u0027m coming home because I\u0027ve missed him so much, but I don\u0027t. I hold it together. \"I\u0027m okay. You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not okay at all. I miss you and I\u0027m going crazy because you\u0027re not here with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I have this talk with him, I\u0027m a goner. \"I don\u0027t want to have this conversation over the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then come home so we can have it face to face. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll think about it.\" And that isn\u0027t a lie because I will be doing a lot of thinking about what I\u0027m going to say to him once I\u0027m home. I fear I\u0027ll say too much if I continue talking, so I end our conversation without giving him any clue that I\u0027ll be home with him the following night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s after five when I come into the house, so I know Mrs. Porcelli has left for the evening. Dinner is on the stove but hasn\u0027t been touched. All the lights are off in the house with the exception of a dim light from the living room. I follow the dull glow because I\u0027m certain that must be where Jack Henry is—if he\u0027s home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then worrisome thoughts begin to cross my mind. Maybe he isn\u0027t here. He could be out prowling for another woman because he thinks I\u0027m leaving him. Or worse, I could find him with someone. He doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m coming home, so he could be up to anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit! This is my fear speaking. Jack Henry isn\u0027t like that. He loves me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand in the doorway of the living room and see him sitting in his chair. He\u0027s alone. I breathe a sigh of relief. He\u0027s holding a drink in his hand as he stares at the black screen of the television. He turns up the last of it and then places the glass on the end table next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s wearing jeans and a khaki button-down work shirt. His Indiana Jones hat is sitting on the table next to him, and I assume he\u0027s just come home since he\u0027s still wearing work attire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s oblivious to me standing there watching him, and I take advantage of the rare opportunity to admire his masculine beauty. I wish I could see his crystal blue eyes. I love the contrast of them next to his nearly black hair. His hair and eye color combination have always been my favorite, and I hope our children inherit that from him. In fact, I want them to look just like their father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must sense me watching because he turns to see me standing there looking at him. It\u0027s impossible to not see the surprise in his eyes. And the fear—at least that\u0027s what I think it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t get out of his chair to come to me. I\u0027m nervous that I may have pushed him too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"L, why didn\u0027t you tell me you were coming home?\" I\u0027m not about to tell him I wanted him to be worried an extra day, but he saves me from replying. \"I wish you\u0027d called. I wouldn\u0027t have drunk this whiskey if I\u0027d known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay. We can still talk. A little bit of whiskey won\u0027t stop us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if the amount of whiskey I\u0027ve consumed would qualify as a little bit—except maybe to an alco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe may have slurred a little. \"Are you hammered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible, but in my defense, I didn\u0027t have a reason not to be. I\u0027m sorry, L. Now probably isn\u0027t the best time to talk this out—if that\u0027s what you\u0027re here for. If you came to say that you\u0027re leaving me, then I\u0027m glad to have a head start on that bottle of Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I considered leaving you, but Addison made me see things I hadn\u0027t considered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did you come up with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk across the living room until I\u0027m standing in front of him. \"This is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI barely have the words out when he moves to the edge of his seat and reaches for me. He puts his arms around my body and pulls me forward. He squeezes me tightly. \"Please, don\u0027t say that we\u0027re over. I will beg you from my knees if it\u0027s what you want, but please, don\u0027t end us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t let me finish.\" He looks up at me. \"You explained what happened with that woman. Yes, it was painful to hear, but no, you technically didn\u0027t wrong me because we agreed to never see one another again. I can\u0027t hold it against you, so it\u0027s over. There\u0027s no reason to discuss it further.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank fuck! I\u0027ve been going crazy these past few days.\" He stands and takes my face in his hands. \"How many times do I have to almost lose you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" I hold up my left hand. \"You better hurry up and put the other part of that ring on my finger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s forget planning this wedding and do it tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe may be drunk but I think he\u0027s serious. \"We can\u0027t do that to Margaret. She\u0027d be so disappointed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d get over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as I want to, I won\u0027t hurt Margaret that way. \"It\u0027s less than three weeks away. We can wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls me close. \"You\u0027re positive I can\u0027t talk you into it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027ll wait until the fourteenth to make you my wife, but I\u0027m not waiting until then to have you under me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs my hand to lead me toward the bedroom and I swipe his hat from where it\u0027s sitting on the end table. \"Why did you grab my hat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I want you to wear it while you fuck me,\" I laugh. \"You\u0027re drunk so I figure I can talk you into doing anything right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I don\u0027t have to be drunk for you to talk me into doing something you want. I\u0027ll always give you anything you ask for.\" He stops to kiss me before we\u0027re in the bedroom. \"You don\u0027t mind that I\u0027m a little hammered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027ll make it interesting. I like the things I can get out of you when you\u0027ve been drinking. Plus, I love when you taste like whiskey. It turns me on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had a lot,\" he admits. \"You might get drunk just kissing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caveman, you don\u0027t have to drink whiskey to intoxicate me. All I have to do is look at you and I\u0027m love drunk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sleeping in the guesthouse tonight because Margaret McLachlan insists. She says I can\u0027t sleep with L. because I\u0027m not supposed to see her the day of the wedding, but it\u0027s eleven o\u0027clock so technically it\u0027s not the day of the wedding yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe McLachlan women are in the house patrolling all entrances to prevent me from getting to my bride, but they didn\u0027t count on my persistence or my cleverness in removing the screen on the window to our bedroom earlier in the day when they weren\u0027t looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneak to the window and try to look inside but can\u0027t see a thing behind the blinds except for the dim glow of the bedside lamp. I listen for voices but all I can hear is L.\u0027s guitar and soft voice. What is she doing singing and playing this late—the night before our wedding?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lightly tap on the window and wait in vain for a response. Finally, I knock and then hear the sound of her music stop. A moment later, L. pulls up one of the blind\u0027s slats and then raises it. She unlocks the window and lifts it up. \"What are you doing out there? Being a peeping Tom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. That\u0027s what peeping Toms do.\" She lifts her brows at me. \"You know your mom would have a fit if she knew you were outside this window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s exactly why she needs to hurry up and let me in. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m sneaking in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sneaking in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thinks I\u0027m kidding. \"Yeah. I haven\u0027t been with you in days because they\u0027ve kept you so busy. I\u0027m in withdrawals.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-46.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
