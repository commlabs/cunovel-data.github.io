{"id":8435,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. ROBERT RUDD LEAVES THE CIRCUS.","content":"\u0026nbsp;AWEEK passed, and Robert Rudd was still the guest of Dr. Grey. The circus had left town, and so the boy-rider was separated from his professional companions. Though he was not as much attached to circus life as some, it was his means of making a livelihood, and had been for some years, and yielded him a considerably larger income than a boy of his age was likely to earn in any other way. Now, it imparts a pleasant feeling of independence to earn one\u0027s living, and the pleasure is heightened when not only a living is earned, but there is a chance to lay up money besides. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Robert was apprised of the approaching departure of the circus he went to Dr. Grey.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dr. Grey,\" he said, \"don\u0027t you think it will be safe for me to go back to the circus?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; it will be safe to go back to it, but not to ride.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 181\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How soon can I ride, do you think?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your ankle will be weak for some time to come; not too weak for ordinary exercise, but not strong enough for bareback riding.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In that case,\" said Robert, with some feeling of disappointment, \"there would be no advantage in going back this season. I suppose I could ride next season.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Undoubtedly, if you desire it,\" said the doctor, pointedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you intend to travel with the circus when you are a man?\" asked Sidney.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not if I can find some other employment at which I can make a fair living,\" answered Robert. \"I don t care much for it, but at present it pays me better than anything else.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is not the most important consideration, my lad,\" said the doctor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; but at present I cannot afford to leave it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why can\u0027t you stay with me all winter?\" asked Sidney, eagerly. \"I should like your company very much.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, Sidney; you are a true friend.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I second my boy\u0027s invitation,\" said the doctor, cordially.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 182\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, also,\" said Robert, gratefully. \"I feel your kindness the more because I have no claims upon you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you will stay?\" said Sidney, eagerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What would Ronald Percy say if you adopted me as a companion?\" asked Robert, with a smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t care what. I would ten times rather have you for a friend than he.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, Sidney. You are not prejudiced against me because I am a circus boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why should I be? If you were rough and coarse, I shouldn\u0027t fancy you, whether you were a circus boy or not, but I consider you much more of a gentleman than Ronald Percy,\" said Sidney, warmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I appreciate your good opinion, Sidney, but as to remaining here all winter, though I should enjoy it on many accounts, I would not like to be dependent even upon so good friends while I am able to earn my own living. If there were anything your father had for me to do it would make a difference.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I must see if I can think of anything,\" said Dr. Grey. \"I am afraid I couldn\u0027t delegate any of my medical duties to you. I fear my patients183 would not repose confidence in so young a doctor.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the circus kept on its way, and Robert remained for a time at the house of the physician. Those who know the characteristics of society in a country village will not be surprised to learn that the introduction of a circus boy into his family led many to wonder at and criticise Dr. Grey. Prominent among the critics was Ronald Percy and his family.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Really,\" said Mrs. Percy, a shallow woman, who made large pretensions to fashion and position, \"I can\u0027t understand what Dr. Grey can be thinking of, to admit a low circus boy into his house. We don\u0027t know what associates the boy has had in the past, but he must be coarse and ill-bred, and surely he is not a fit companion for Sidney Grey. I hope my Ronald won\u0027t get intimate with him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You may be sure I won\u0027t, ma,\" said Ronald. \"I wouldn\u0027t demean myself by taking notice of him. When Sidney wanted to invite him to join in our games I opposed it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You, Ronald, can always be relied upon to feel like a gentleman,\" said his mother, complacently.184 \"Thank heaven! he hasn\u0027t any liking for low company.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am told the boy is very gentlemanly,\" said Mrs. Frost, a woman very different from Mrs. Percy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Percy shrugged her shoulders.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is absurd, of course,\" she answered. \"Gentlemanly behavior isn\u0027t picked up in circuses. I told the doctor so, but he is very eccentric, and he wouldn\u0027t listen to anything against his new favorite.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That must be rather awkward for you, as Ronald and Sidney are so much together.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have requested Ronald not to go to the doctor\u0027s so much while that boy is staying there. I feel that it is due to our position not to allow him to form such intimacies.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nevertheless, when Sidney Grey got up a little party in honor of his guest, and invited Ronald among others, the young aristocrat did not decline, but presented himself promptly, notwithstanding his mother\u0027s objection to the company of the young circus rider.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Among the twenty boys and girls who assembled in the drawing-room of Dr. Grey there was not185 one more quiet in manner or gentlemanly in bearing than Robert Rudd.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wonder where the boy has picked up his high-bred manner?\" thought the doctor. \"It must be natural to him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was the case. Robert had not been placed in circumstances favorable to the formation of a polished manner, but it was innate and instinctive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At a pause during the evening Sidney said, \"Robert, can\u0027t you do something to entertain the company?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Would you like to see a little juggling?\" asked Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes!\" cried several. Even Ronald Percy looked interested. Still he could not help sneering a little.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you do that at the circus?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" answered Robert, quietly. \"I am not a professional magician, but we had a professor of magic with us at one time, who took the trouble to show me a few simple tricks, and these I am ready to perform at the request of Sidney.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You couldn\u0027t please me or the company better,\" said Sidney, eagerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 186\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall have to ask you for a few articles,\" said Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Anything in the house is at your service, Rob.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So for half an hour Robert amused the company with a few tricks, which he did exceedingly well, for it was a characteristic of our young hero to be thorough in all he did. It is unnecessary to enumerate his tricks, or to describe the interest which the young company manifested. It is enough to say that when he had finished he had established himself in the good graces of every one present except Ronald, who, though as much interested as the rest, was unwilling to admit it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We are very much obliged to you, Robert,\" said Sidney, warmly. \"You are a capital magician.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would advise you to go into that business,\" said Ronald, with his usual sneer. \"I am told it pays very well, and it isn\u0027t as low as the circus.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall confine myself to performing for the gratification of my friends,\" said Robert, coolly, ignoring the impertinence of Ronald.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Can\u0027t you do anything more for us, Robert?\" asked Sidney. \"Do you sing?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 187\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A little,\" was the unexpected reply; \"that is, I can sing some of the popular melodies.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Pray do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If any one will play the accompaniment.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A young girl was found to do this, and Robert sang in a clear, musical voice several popular favorites, which appeared to please no less than his magical efforts.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Really, Robert,\" said Mrs. Grey, \"you are remarkably well fitted to please a company of young people. We are very much obliged to you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am glad to have it in my power to do something in return for your kindness, Mrs. Grey.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The boy may belong to the circus,\" thought Mrs. Grey, \"but I should be glad if my son were as accomplished, while I could not desire him to be any more refined.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronald was secretly surprised, and not over well pleased at Robert\u0027s popularity. He found himself in a minority of one in his sneering attempts to decry him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the end of a week, when Robert was beginning to consider seriously what employment he should follow in place of the one he had been compelled to abandon, he received a letter through the mail which equally surprised and pleased him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83310.html","bookId":277,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:43 AM"}
