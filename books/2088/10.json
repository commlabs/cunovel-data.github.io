He\u0027d scared me, not only by appearing out of nowhere, but by almost getting himself knocked out in my yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now, or in general?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I come from Minnesota originally. I just came out of those woods right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The woods?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know those trees all bunched together?\" He jerked a thumb over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA comedian, exactly what I didn\u0027t need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t be out alone at night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I can handle myself.\" He lifted the can of soda to his mouth and drained the rest in one long gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself overly fascinated with the muscles flexing and releasing in his throat. The way he\u0027d snatched that soda can out of thin air had been amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you do that?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crushed the can in one hand. My heart went pitter-pat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flicked a finger at the can. \"Your reflexes seem downright superhuman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a lot about me that\u0027s superhuman.\" He .smirked. \"Wanna see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man flirted as easily as he breathed. But why was he flirting with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks. What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got your message.\" He reached into the pocket of his jeans and held up something between his thumb and forefinger. The moon had come out from behind the clouds, and I could see his face but not much else. Still. from the space between his fingers, I deduced he\u0027d brought me the totem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on up,\" I offered. \"I\u0027ve got one cola left. We can share.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Share? You read my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, Slick, I\u0027m talking soda here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spoilsport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back into the apartment smiling, but I forced myself to stop. It wouldn\u0027t do either one of us any good if I encouraged him. He\u0027d end up disappointed; I\u0027d end up hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was handsome, sexy, intelligent. I was average, socially inept, and... average. I\u0027d made it through school; he was nearly a doctor. The professor and the cop -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it sounded like a bad romance novel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose differences aside, I wasn\u0027t even going to address the white/red issue, which didn\u0027t bother me but might bother him -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or at least his family. There were very few pure Ojibwe left. If he was even one of them, I doubted his parents would appreciate him diluting the gene pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted and leaned down to snag the last soda from the refrigerator. We hadn\u0027t even progressed to first names and I had us diluting the gene pool. I\u0027d better put on some brakes before I went headlong off the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShutting the door, I turned, and an involuntary yelp escaped me. Cadotte stood in my living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\" I glanced at the window, which was still open. The breeze ruffled the curtains. \"I mean, what\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned against the wall and crossed his arms. Muscles flexed beneath smooth cinnamon skin. \"You told me to come up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever think of using the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, when the window is so much closer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get up here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rock face. It wasn\u0027t hard.\" He shoved away from the wall. \"For anyone who\u0027s done any climbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou keep this locked, right?\" He ran a fingertip along the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d climbed up the side of the building like Spider-man? I found that hard to believe, yet here he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistracted, I handed him the can and stepped onto the porch. I leaned out over the railing, measured the distance to the ground -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;too much -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;then moved over to the wall and peered closely. The apartment building was made of stone. There were footholds of a sort, but you couldn\u0027t talk me into climbing the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course my rock-climbing experience was limited to county fairs and a single day at the academy during training. There aren\u0027t a heck of a lot of mountains to climb in Wisconsin. Hell, there aren\u0027t any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we like to call hills are a joke if you\u0027ve ever been to Colorado, Montana, or even Tennessee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte followed me outside. Suddenly the night was no longer cool and the balcony no longer big enough. He stood between me and the door. The only way out was down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough tall, he was lithe. Not muscle-bound, but muscular. Could I take him if I had to? I wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe not knowing made my breath come harder and faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inched closer to the door, into his personal space. If he was polite, he\u0027d move away. He stayed right where he was. So did I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you to call me.\" I offered my hand, palm up. \"I\u0027d have picked up the totem. You didn\u0027t need to come out of your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at my hand but made no move to put the totem into it. Where had the thing gone, anyway? My gaze lowered to his pockets. The totem was too small to make much of a bulge. I didn\u0027t see it. But there were other, more interesting bulges in the vicinity. I stiffened and yanked my eyes up to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was smiling. Damn. He\u0027d noticed. He seemed to notice everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved closer. I stepped back and cursed myself for the weakness. But I couldn\u0027t help it. His skin gave off an intense heat. I could smell him despite the pines and the flowers and the fresh plastic aroma of my chairs. That wild scent I\u0027d noticed last night -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not unappealing, but rather arousing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit the railing. I couldn\u0027t go any farther. Thankfully Cadotte stopped, still too close, but at least he wasn\u0027t touching me. I wasn\u0027t sure what I\u0027d do if he put those long-fingered, clever hands on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027d let you come to get the totem, then I\u0027d never have seen your place. I doubt you\u0027d have invited me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned as a thought I should have had earlier, if I hadn\u0027t been thinking about sex, shot through my brain. \"How did you know where I live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not hard to find out in a town like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides.\" He reached out and brushed one of those enticing fingers back and forth over the short ends of my hair. \"I wanted to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shudder that rippled through me at his touch halted immediately at his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his arm. I figured he\u0027d step back, finally let me pass, then tell me he had unpaid parking tickets or a bogus warrant hanging over his head -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;they were always bogus -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or some other legal problem that made him want to see me. You know, the usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was preparing my standard \"sorry, can\u0027t help you\" speech when his descending hand cupped my hip. I had no time to say anything, because he yanked my body flush with his -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he was a helluva lot stronger than he looked -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince my mouth had been half-open, ready to speak, his tongue slid right in. He didn\u0027t waste time on niceties but went straight for the good stuff. I liked that in a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tip of his tongue did a hard slide up the center of mine, then teased at the end. He pulled me tighter against him, center to center, then rocked his hips forward. I nearly came right then. Deprivation will do that to a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoaning, I tried to pull back, but not very hard. Especially when he did some fancy move with his other hand and my starched sheriff shirt popped open past my bra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly his mouth left mine and he lowered his head to my breasts. That clever tongue dipped into their center, in and out, as he echoed the motion with his hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body was on fire. My mind a complete mess. It wouldn\u0027t take much to convince me to do it right here on the Formica table. I didn\u0027t think we\u0027d make it inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy arms rose of their own accord, fingers tangling in his hair, so soft, so sleek. I ran my palm over his head, petting him, then urging him on. His mouth closed over my nipple, through the bra, and lightly he bit the tip. I arched, pressing my entire body into his, and that one small movement shoved me over the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom far, far away drifted a low, mournful howl. In the middle of the first orgasm I\u0027d had in several years, the sound confused me. Coyote? Wolf? Human?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte tensed, lifted his head, and stared past my shoulder into the night. The chill wind brushed my bare skin, iced the moisture left by his mouth. His body was still pressed to mine, but I no longer felt warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his gaze from the trees with obvious effort. His face gentled and he buttoned my blouse up to my throat. I certainly wasn\u0027t capable of doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his forehead to mine and whispered, \"That.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical me, grace under fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked why I wanted to see you.\" He kissed my eyebrow. Heat flooded through me, chasing away the chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince when had my eyebrow become an erogenous zone? Apparently today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to see me for that?\" I repeated, not sure what that was. A kiss, a dry hump, a thwarted fuck on the balcony?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You have a problem with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment I couldn\u0027t find a single problem with the world, but I would. Such was my nature. I shook my head, unable to articulate much of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ve got to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released me and headed for the front door. I must still have been dazed, or I\u0027d have made a smart comment about jumping from the balcony. As it was, I followed him like a puppy, and when he pressed the totem into my hand, then folded my fingers around it, I merely held on tight and watched him leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never thought to ask him what he\u0027d discovered about the markings. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-10.html","bookId":2088,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM"}
