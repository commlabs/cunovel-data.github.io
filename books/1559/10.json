Maybe they had them at Harcourt, who knows?” (They did have copies at Harcourt; can you buy that? I’ll get to why in the next pages, probably.) “Gimme the kid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” he said a second later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, Jason,” I told him. “We thought about giving you a bike for your birthday but we decided against it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boy, are you wrong, I got one already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason has inherited his mother’s total lack of humor. I don’t know; maybe he’s funny and I’m not. We just don’t laugh much together is all I can say for sure. My son Jason is this incredible-looking kid—paint him yellow, he’d mop up for the school sumo team. A blimp. All the time stuffing his face. I watch my weight and old Helen is only visible full front plus on top of which she is this leading child shrink in Manhattan and our kid can roll faster than he can walk. “He’s expressing himself through food,” Helen always says. “His anxieties. When he feels ready to cope, he’ll slim down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Jason? Mom tells me this book arrived today. The Princess thing? I’d sure like it if maybe you’d give it a read while I’m gone. I loved it when I was a kid and I’m kind of interested in your reaction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I have to love it too?” He was his mother’s son all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jason, no. Just the truth, exactly what you think. I miss you, big shot. And I’ll talk to you on your birthday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boy, are you wrong. Today is my birthday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe bantered a bit more, long past when there was much to say. Then I did the same with my spouse, and hung up, promising a return by the end of one week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConferences dragged, producers got inspirations that had to carefully get shot down, directors needed their egos soothed. Anyway, I was longer than anticipated in sunny Cal. Finally, though, I was allowed to return to the care and safety of the family, so I quick buzzed to L.A. airport before anybody’s mind changed. I got there early, which I always do when I come back, because I had to load up my pockets with doodads and such for Jason. Every time I get home from a trip he runs (waddles) to me hollering, “Lemmesee, lemmesee the pockets” and then he goes through all my pockets taking out his graft, and once the loot is totaled, he gives me a nice hug. Isn’t it awful what we’ll do in this world to feel wanted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lemmesee the pockets,” Jason shouted, moving to me across the foyer. It was a suppertime Thursday and, while he went through his ritual, Helen emerged from the library and kissed my cheek, going “what a dashing-looking fellow I have,” which is also ritual, and, laden with gifts, Jason kind of hugged me and belted off (waddled off) to his room. “Angelica’s just getting dinner on,” Helen said; “you couldn’t have timed it better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angelica?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen put her finger to her lips and whispered, “It’s her third day on but I think she may be a treasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whispered back, “What was wrong with the treasure we had when I left? She’d only been with us a week then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She proved a disappointment,” Helen said. That was all. (Helen is this brilliant lady—junior Phi Bete in college, every academic honor conceivable, really an intellect of startling breadth and accomplishment—only she can’t keep a maid. First, I guess she feels guilty having anybody, since most of the anybody’s available nowadays are black or Spanish and Helen is ultra-super liberal. Second, she’s so efficient, she scares them. She can do everything better than they can and she knows it and she knows they know it. Third, once she’s got them panicked, she tries to explain, being an analyst, why they shouldn’t be frightened, and after a good solid half-hour ego search with Helen, they’re really frightened. Anyway, we have had an average of four “treasures” a year for the last few years.) \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-10.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
