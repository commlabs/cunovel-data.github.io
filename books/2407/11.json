Anyway, the public is tired of serial killers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anchorman looked incredulous. \"The public is tired of serial killers? Now, where\u0027d you get that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can read it yourself in the focus groups, Jim. Serial killers are overexposed. Our audience is worried about the economy. They don\u0027t want any more serial killers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our audience is worried about the economy so we lead off with Nakamoto and Paris fashions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, Jim,\" Bob Arthur said. \"In hard times, you do star parties. That\u0027s what people want to see: fashion and fantasy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anchor looked sullen. \"I\u0027m a journalist, I\u0027m here to do hard news, not fashion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, Jim,\" the producer said. \"That\u0027s why Liz did the intros tonight. We want to keep your image hard news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Teddy Roosevelt led this country out of the Great Depression, he didn\u0027t do it with fashion and fantasy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Franklin Roosevelt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. You know what I\u0027m saying. If people are worried, let\u0027s do the economy. Let\u0027s do the balance of payments or whatever it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, Jim. But this is the eleven o\u0027clock news in the local market, and people don\u0027t want to hear - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s what\u0027s wrong with America,\" the anchorman pronounced, stabbing the air with his finger. \"People don\u0027t want to hear the real news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, Jim. You\u0027re absolutely right.\" He put his arm over the anchorman\u0027s shoulder. \"Get some rest, okay? We\u0027ll talk tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed to be a signal of some kind, because the anchorwoman finished with her notes and strode off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a journalist,\" the anchor said. \"I just want to do the job I was trained for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, Jim. More tomorrow. Have a good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid dickhead,\" Bob Arthur said, leading us down a corridor. \"Teddy Roosevelt. Jesus. They\u0027re not journalists. They\u0027re actors. And they count their lines, like all actors.\" He sighed, and took another drink of scotch. \"Now tell me again, what do you guys want to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tape from the Nakamoto opening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the air tapes? The story we ran tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we want to see the original footage from the camera.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The field tapes. Jeez. I hope we still have them. They may have been bulked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bulked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bulk degaussed. Erased. We shoot forty cassettes a day here. Most of them get erased right away. We used to save field tapes for a week, but we\u0027re cutting costs, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one side of the newsroom were shelves of stacked Betamax cartridges. Bob ran his finger along the boxes. \"Nakamoto... Nakamoto... No, I don\u0027t see them.\" A woman went past. \"Cindy, is Rick still here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s gone home. You need something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Nakamoto field tapes. They aren\u0027t on the shelf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check Don\u0027s room. He cut it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Bob led us across the newsroom to the editing bays on the far side. He opened a door, and we entered a small, messy room with two monitors, several tape decks, and an editing console. Tapes in boxes were scattered around the floor. Bob rummaged through them. \"Okay, you guys are in luck. Camera originals. There\u0027s a lot of it. I\u0027ll get Jenny to run you through them. She\u0027s our best spotter. She knows everybody.\" He stuck his head out the door. \"Jenny? Jenny!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, let\u0027s see,\" Jenny Gonzales said, a few minutes later. She was a bespectacled, heavyset woman in her forties. She scanned the editor\u0027s notes and frowned. \"It doesn\u0027t matter how many times I tell them, they just will not put things in proper... Finally. Here we are. Four tapes. Two limo driveups. Two roving inside, at the party. What do you want to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"Start with the driveups.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Is there any way to do this fast? We\u0027re in a hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fast as you want. I\u0027m used to it. Let\u0027s see it at high speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hit a button. At high speed, we saw the limousines pulling up, the doors jumping open, the people getting out, jerkily walking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking for anyone in particular? Because I see somebody marked footages for celebrities during the edit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not looking for a celebrity,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad. It\u0027s probably all we shot.\" We watched the tape. Jenny said, \"There\u0027s Senator Kennedy. He\u0027s lost some weight, hasn\u0027t he. Oops, gone. And Senator Morton. Looking very fit. No surprise. That creepy assistant of his. He makes my teeth shiver. Senator Rowe, without his wife, as usual. There\u0027s Tom Hanks. I don\u0027t know this Japanese guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"Hiroshi Masukawa, vice-president of Mitsui.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go. Senator Chalmers, hair transplant looking good. Congressman Levine. Congressman Daniels. Sober for a change. You know, I\u0027m surprised Nakamoto got so many of these Washington people to attend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when you get down to it, it\u0027s just the opening of some new building. An ordinary corporate bash. It\u0027s on the West Coast. And Nakamoto is pretty controversial right at the moment. Barbra Streisand. I don\u0027t know who the guy is with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nakamoto is controversial? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of the MicroCon sale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"What\u0027s MicroCon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MicroCon is an American company that makes computer equipment. A Japanese company named Akai Ceramics is trying to buy it. There\u0027s opposition to the sale in Congress, because of worries about America losing technology to Japan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"And what does this have to do with Nakamoto?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nakamoto\u0027s the parent company of Akai.\" The first tape finished, and popped out. \"Nothing there you wanted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Let\u0027s go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" She slid the second tape in. \"Anyway, I\u0027m surprised how many of these senators and congressmen felt it was acceptable to show up here tonight. Okay, here we go. More driveups. Roger Hillerman, under secretary of state for Pacific affairs. That\u0027s his assistant with him. Kenichi Aikou, consul general of Japan, here in L.A. Richard Meier, architect. Works for Getty. Don\u0027t know her. Some Japanese...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"Hisashi Koyama, vice-president of Honda U.S.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah,\" Jenny said. \"He\u0027s been here about three years now. Probably going home soon. That\u0027s Edna Morris, she heads the U.S. delegation to the GATT talks. You know, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I can\u0027t believe she showed up here, it\u0027s an obvious conflict of interest. But there she is, all smiling and relaxed. Chuck Norris. Eddie Sakamura. Sort of a local playboy. Don\u0027t know the girl with him. Tom Cruise, with his Australian wife. And Madonna, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the accelerated tape, the strobes flashed almost continuously as Madonna stepped from her limousine and preened. \"Want to slow it down? You interested in this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"Not tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we probably have a lot on her,\" Jenny said. She pushed the very high-speed fast-forward and the image streaked gray. When she punched back, Madonna was wiggling toward the elevator, leaning on the arm of a slender Hispanic boy with a mustache. The image blurred as the camera swung back toward the street. Then it stabilized again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s Daniel Okimoto. Expert on Japanese industrial policy. That\u0027s Arnold, with Maria. And behind them is Steve Martin, with Arata Isozaki, the architect who designed the Museum - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe punched the console button. The picture froze. Jenny seemed surprised. \"You\u0027re interested in Isozaki?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Back up, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tape ran backward, the frames flicking and blurring as the camera panned off Steve Martin, and went back to record the next arrival from the limousines. But for a moment in the pan, the camera swung past a group of people who had already gotten out of their limousines, and were walking up the carpeted sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"There.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image froze. Slightly blurred, I saw a tall blonde in a black cocktail dress walking forward alongside a handsome man in a dark suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh,\" Jenny said. \"You interested in him, or her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me think,\" Jenny said, frowning. \"I\u0027ve seen her at parties with the Washington types for about nine months now. She\u0027s this year\u0027s Kelly Emberg. The athletic modelly kind. But sophisticated, sort of a Tatiana look-alike. Her name is... Austin. Cindy Austin, Carrie Austin... Cheryl Austin. That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You know anything else about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny shook her head. \"Listen, I think getting a name is pretty good. These girls show up all the time. You see a new one everywhere for six months, a year, and then they\u0027re gone. God knows where they go. Who can keep track of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the man with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Richard Levitt. Plastic surgeon. Does a lot of big stars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"He\u0027s around. Like a lot of these guys, he\u0027s a companion to the stars in their time of need. If his patients are getting divorced or whatever, he escorts the woman. When he\u0027s not taking out clients, he takes out models like her. They certainly look good together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the monitor, Cheryl and her escort walked toward us in intermittent jerks: one frame every thirty seconds. Stepping slow. I noticed they never looked at each other. She seemed tense, expectant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny Gonzales said, \"So. Plastic surgeon and a model. Can I ask what\u0027s the big deal about these two? Because at an evening like this, they\u0027re just, you know, party favors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"She was killed tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, she\u0027s the one? Interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You\u0027ve heard about the murder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it on the news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, didn\u0027t make the eleven o\u0027clock,\" Jenny said. \"And it probably won\u0027t be on tomorrow. I can\u0027t see it myself. It\u0027s not really a story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\" I asked, glancing at Connor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what\u0027s the peg?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t follow you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nakamoto would say, it\u0027s only news because it happened at their opening. They\u0027d take the position that any reporting of it is a smear on them. But in a way they\u0027re right. I mean, if this girl got killed on the freeway, it wouldn\u0027t make the news. If she got killed in a convenience store robbery, it wouldn\u0027t make the news. We have two or three of those every night. So the fact that she gets killed at a party... who cares? It\u0027s still not news. She\u0027s young and pretty, but she\u0027s not special. It\u0027s not as if she has a series or anything.\" .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor glanced at his watch. \"Shall we look at the other tapes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The footage from the party? Sure. You looking for this particular girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, here we go.\" Jenny put in the third tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe saw scenes from the party on the forty-fifth floor: the swing band, people dancing beneath the hanging decorations. We strained for a glimpse of the girl in the crowd. Jenny said, \"In Japan, we wouldn\u0027t have to do this by eye. The Japanese have pretty sophisticated video-recognition software now. They have a program where you identify an image, say a face, and it\u0027ll automatically search tape for you, and find every instance of that face. Find it in a crowd, or wherever it appears. Has the ability to see a single view of a three-dimensional object, and then to recognize the same object in other views. It\u0027s supposed to be pretty nifty. But slow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised the station hasn\u0027t got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s not for sale here. The most advanced Japanese video equipment isn\u0027t available in this country. They keep us three to five years behind. Which is their privilege. It\u0027s their technology, they can do what they want. But it\u0027d sure be useful in a case like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe party images were streaming past, a frenetic blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, she locked the image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There. Background camera left. Your Austin girl\u0027s talking to Eddie Sakamura. Of course he\u0027d know her. Sakamura knows all the models. Normal speed here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" Connor said, staring at the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera made a slow pan around the room. Cheryl Austin remained in view for most of the shot. Laughing with Eddie Sakamura, throwing her head back, resting her hand on his arm, happy to be with him. Eddie clowned for her, his face mobile. He seemed to enjoy making her laugh. But from time to time, her eyes flicked away, glancing around the room. As if she was waiting for something to happen. Or for someone to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point, Sakamura became aware he did not have her full attention. He grabbed her arm and pulled her roughly toward him. She turned her face away from him. He leaned close to her and said something angrily. Then a bald man stepped forward, very close to the camera. The light flared on his face, washing out his features, and his head blocked our view of Eddie and the girl. Then the camera panned left, and we lost them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again?\" Jenny backed it up, and we ran it once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Eddie\u0027s obviously not happy with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor frowned. \"It\u0027s so difficult to know what we are seeing. Do you have sound for this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny said, \"Sure, but it\u0027s probably walla.\" She punched buttons and ran it again. The track was continuous cocktail party din. Only for brief moments did we hear an isolated phrase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point, Cheryl Austin looked at Eddie Sakamura and said, \"...can\u0027t help if it\u0027s important to you I get...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis reply to her was garbled, but later, he said clearly to her, \"Don\u0027t understand... all about the Saturday meeting...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the last few seconds of the pan, when he pulled her to him, he snarled a phrase like \"...be a fool... no cheapie...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Did he say \u0027No cheapie\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny said, \"Want to run it again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Connor said. \"There\u0027s nothing more to be learned here. Go forward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image accelerated, the party-goers becoming frenetic, laughing and raising glasses for quick sips. And then I said, \"Wait.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-11.html","bookId":2407,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM"}
