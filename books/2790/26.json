A req form for a centrifuge stuck to his back. \"You\u0027rewhat ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In addition to having your heart broken, did someone rupture your eardrums? I said I\u0027m moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheldon blinked. He was used to Crane being a little on the weird side, but this? \"To Alaska?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. My fiancee lives there, and she\u0027s even now using her contacts to secure a job for me. First chair,\" he added smugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re just—you\u0027re just going? Who\u0027s your fiancee?\" he asked dumbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny,\" the Grange twins said in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny?Jenny Jenny? Alex\u0027s Jenny? Who you only met, like, sixteen hours ago?That Jenny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been longer than that,\" Crane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they haven\u0027t even done it!\" Teal said gleefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wh—but—why—\" Shel brushed the paper off and tottered to his feet. \"But you live in Boston! You\u0027ve got the nicest apartment I\u0027ve ever seen! You put down roots! You\u0027ve got pussy thrown at you from cars!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop shouting, I\u0027m right here. And ugh, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just picking up and going? Turning your back on your whole life? To live with someone you barely know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you saying things out loud? Everyone in the room already has this information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has everybody gonecrazy ?\" Shel yelled at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I tried to talk him out of it,\" Teal said, kicking over an overturned file cabinet just to hear the noise. \"Okay, I didn\u0027t. What do I give a shit if he lives in Boston or Juneau? He\u0027d be annoying if he lived in Moscow. And by the way, I amnot helping you clean this shit up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that?\" Shel mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no point in waiting,\" Crane said, \"or letting some other gentleman realize what a fine woman she is. I\u0027m not getting any younger, certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re twenty-nine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell,\" Teal said, \"by all the grotesque wrinkles on the jackass\u0027s face.\" He turned to his brother. \"By the way, you owe me huge. Not only did I introduce you to your wife, I didn\u0027t bone her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thank-you note is already in the mail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe this!\" Sheldon said, raking his fingers through his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d invite you to the wedding,\" Crane went on with his trademark maddening calm, \"but you\u0027ll likely be too busy sulking in this opium den to attend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s just great! She got in a plane and took off. I told her I loved her and she was all \u0027oh, that\u0027s just the hormones talking, gotta go, my jet\u0027s waiting.\u0027 What the hell was I supposed to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop being a dick,\" Teal said at the same moment that Crane said, \"Go after her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? She didn\u0027t even tell me she loves me. And sheleft .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not unlike another beloved family member.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, cram it up your ass, Crane! This isn\u0027t about my father. It\u0027s about us and how we\u0027d never work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027ve, like, tried super hard to make it work, instead of just showing up at her hotel room to bone her,\" Teal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can cram it up your ass, too. You don\u0027t know anything about what we—just shut up, both of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s it? You\u0027re just gonna let the most eligible babe on the planet, who lets you do pretty much whatever you want to her, who thinks you\u0027re the swellest guy around, at least according to theNational Enquirer —\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swellest?\" Crane asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—you\u0027re just gonna let her go back to her palace and—what? You\u0027re gonna find someone else? Who\u0027s gonna be better than her? Because, pal, if she was out there, you prob\u0027ly would have found her by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get it through your head,\" Shel snapped, \"both of you. She left me. She wouldn\u0027t even stay the day, and it was her day off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, she\u0027s so stubborn, you guys have nothing in common.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A disguised miracle,\" Crane agreed, \"that she left town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShel blew out a breath. The twins were aggravating beyond belief, as usual, but their logic was starting to penetrate. He\u0027d already endured three hours knowing Alex was gone forever; he didn\u0027t relish picturing what the rest of his life was going to be like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, why should I go after her? Why can\u0027t she come back and just admit that we have something? Why do I have to be the one to make it easy for her? I mean, she\u0027s got everything. Money, and power, and her dad\u0027s a king, for God\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in return, all she has to put up with is someone occasionally trying to kill a family member, and giving up mostof her privacy—she can\u0027t go to the movies, grocery shopping, or the park.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems like a decent trade to me,\" Teal agreed. \"You don\u0027t have to worry about the rent, just the occasional assassination attempt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, she has it very easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Totally,\" Teal agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So—what? You\u0027re saying I should go after her and, you know, tell her we can work it out? Give up my job, my home? Move again? Be the goddamned Prince of Alaska?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assuming she\u0027ll have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big assumption,\" Teal added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying I should take a chance? That maybe it\u0027ll work out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Crane said. \"You\u0027resaying.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Either way, I must be going. Jenny and I have a date tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I can\u0027t just hop a plane to Alaska and barge into the palace. For one thing, I\u0027ll probably get shot, or stabbed. The place is lousy with guards. For another, if they don\u0027t get me, Alex will. We, uh, didn\u0027t exactly part on good terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet you impliedshe was the coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, of course, you\u0027re a dick,\" Teal said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddammit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s having an epiphany,\" Crane told his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had that once. But the doctor gave me a shot and it went away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You—enjoy your date. You—drive me to my apartment. I\u0027ve got to have my goddamned passport to get on the goddamned plane to goddamned Alaska.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw,\" Teal said. \"That\u0027s so fuckin\u0027 romantic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 46\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really really really appreciate this,\" Shel told Jenny for the hundredth time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my great pleasure, Dr. Rivers. And I hope, after the princess terminates me, you\u0027ll help me find work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d never do that,\" Shel said. \"You\u0027re like family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Jenny seemed pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always nice to hear the truth out loud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not always,\" Shel murmured, turning to look out the window. North Dakota was falling away from them and he closed his eyes and tried not to picture flaming fuselage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait to see your home, my dear. I\u0027ve never been to Alaska.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crane, you\u0027ll love it. It\u0027s the most beautiful place in the entire world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As beautiful as your eyes, my little ballerina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill me now,\" Shel muttered, glaring into the postcard-beautiful sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny had arranged everything. Crane, that sly dog, had called her while Shel was frantically searching for his passport. By the time they\u0027d gotten to the airport, she\u0027d arranged seats for them and fixed everything with customs, the pilot, and Alaskan Air Control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a stroke of luck you were still in the country,\" Crane was babbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well… Her Highness left too quickly, I had a few things to arrange before I could follow her. And I didn\u0027t want to miss our date,\" she said shyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never! I\u0027d sooner miss the opening of Rachmininoff\u0027s Piano Concerto number two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny giggled. \"Do you know, when I was younger—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A doddering nineteen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—I would be so uplifted by his music that I mistook the feeling for—for—you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall have to play it for you when we\u0027re alone,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really,\" Shel whispered to the window. \"Kill me right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be working on your apology,\" Crane informed him, cutting himself off in mid-smooch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" he yelped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, knowing you, you said some perfectly atrocious things and now you\u0027re expecting her to apologize for your bad behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Jenny added. \"You should be ashamed, Dr. Rivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m throwing you both off the plane if you don\u0027t get off my case right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t sound very contrite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it doesn\u0027t,\" Jenny sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, if it were you, turtledove, I would be on bended knee,\" Crane cooed, staring into Jenny\u0027s eyes with the rapt expression of a George Romero zombie. \"I would ask the gods for your so-kind forgiveness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Crane, really?\" she breathed. \"I would give it. In a heartbeat, I would give it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" Shel said, looking back out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 47\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome back, Jenny,\" Marin said warmly. \"The palace isn\u0027t the same without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a lie, Marin. And thank you. Please log me in as of twenty-three-hundred hours. I\u0027m also bringing these gentlemen up with me. This is Mr. Grange, and this is Dr. Rivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I can do this,\" Shel said, looking around the grandeur of the castle\u0027s west foyer. It was bigger than his apartment, times five. \"This is not my thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t take the coward\u0027s way out now,\" Crane said. Bastard. He\u0027d played in concert halls around the world, and for the Queen of England. He was used to this fancy shit. \"You\u0027ve come all this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Rivers… Dr. Rivers…\" Marin, the receptionist/guard/whatever was squinting at him. \"You look familiar, Doctor.
