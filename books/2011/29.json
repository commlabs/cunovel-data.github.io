If I belong to anyone, it\u0027s him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marty didn\u0027t claim you. Vlad has. Earlier today, he rescinded his offer to let me court you, as if I hadn\u0027t figured out for myself that you were his now.\" Maximus gazed at me almost pityingly. \"And if you care for your friend, you will never tell Vlad you think you belong to Marty. He\u0027ll kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was too much. I closed my eyes, drawing in a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he? I need to talk to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaximus\u0027s face closed off into polite stoniness. \"He\u0027s detained at present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy teeth ground. \"Please stop the formal talk, and tell Vlad that he needs to undetain himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"That\u0027s not how it works. No one gives Vlad orders. When he\u0027s available, he\u0027ll see you. Having a fit in the interim won\u0027t change anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not having a fit.\" I would, that was for sure, but I\u0027d save it for the vampire who\u0027d declared me his without asking my opinion on the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then would you like to eat here, or the main room?\" Maximus asked, returning to his original query.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too mad to have an appetite, but refusing to eat would only be churlish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad continued to be \"regrettably detained\" the next morning and afternoon, too. I was torn between being madder than hell and worried. I didn\u0027t know if he was here and refusing to see me-Maximus wouldn\u0027t say, and neither would any other vampire I asked-or if he was out somewhere. It was ridiculous to worry about Vlad considering his age and power, but people were out to kill him. That was how I\u0027d been thrust into his life in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy evening, when someone other than Maximus came to tell me that Vlad was still \"regrettably detained,\" I\u0027d had enough. He might not want to see me, but I wouldn\u0027t sit here stewing any longer. I changed clothes and then almost ran out of my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went down to the level where Ben and the others lived. I hadn\u0027t gone far past the chapel when I heard voices. I followed the sounds to a kitchen where several people were gathered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leila,\" Ben said in surprise when he saw me poised by the open door. \"Hey, come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Ben a big, almost desperate smile. \"You know that club you mentioned? Are you guys going tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came over, scratching a hand through his curls. \"Yeah, but I thought you couldn\u0027t go because of, you know. Your condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t dance,\" I said with a short laugh. \"But I can drain my excess energy into something safe, keep my right hand holstered, and drink with whoever else is knocking \u0027em back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll work,\" Damon said, his mouth still full of whatever he\u0027d been eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, sure.\" Ben smiled. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re feeling better. What was wrong, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy abilities are killing me and vampire blood is the only cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Low iron? I\u0027m okay now. No bleeding or fainting, promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, we\u0027ll be ready in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a depressing realization suddenly filled me. \"Wait. I don\u0027t have any money, and I\u0027m not about to hit up one of Vlad\u0027s staff for some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money?\" Ben laughed. So did everyone else there. \"You don\u0027t need money,\" Ben went on. \"Vlad owns the town and we\u0027re his special plasma kabobs. Everything is free for us, and as his guest, same goes with you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes bugged. \"He owns the whole town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The counties surrounding it, too. Romania has communes, and while most people don\u0027t own the ones they oversee . . . Vlad has his own way of doing things, doesn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe does indeed, I thought, remembering how he hadn\u0027t told me the implications behind drinking his blood. Then I forced that thought back and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m ready whenever you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight of us piled into a different limousine than the one Vlad and I had arrived in. Due to the freezing temperature, I wore a long, thick coat over my dress. It also acted as a protective barrier for my right hand, which I kept tucked inside it. Once we were all in the vehicle, however, it didn\u0027t move though the driver sat at the wheel with the engine running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the hold up, Hunter?\" Ben asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting authorization,\" Hunter replied, and then rolled up the privacy glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Authorization? Since when?\" Ben muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince me, I thought, tensing in anger. If Vlad was available to forbid me from leaving, he\u0027d damn well better be available for me to speak with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom their glances, everyone began to figure out that I was the reason for the delay, but they chatted as though nothing was amiss. After about ten minutes, the privacy glass came down. Maximus now sat in the passenger seat, glaring at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you really think you could sneak away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought the conversation to a halt. I stared back at him, my temper flaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sneaking anywhere. I\u0027m going out with the other residents of this house. I notice they didn\u0027t have to check in with anyone before leaving, so why should I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you belong to Vlad,\" Maximus said at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fists clenched. Not this again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen caught my frustrated clenching. \"Hey, it\u0027s cool. We all belong to Vlad,\" he said, patting my knee in a comforting way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaximus\u0027s gaze went from gray to bright green in an instant. \"Not like she does, so remove your hand or I will remove it from your body. No one touches her except Vlad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen\u0027s hand flew off my knee as if I\u0027d channeled lightning into him. Maximus\u0027s meaning could not have been clearer. I was torn between wanting to sink into the seat in embarrassment-or leaping forward and electrocuting him. The latter was more appealing, but then it would ruin my plans for the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that you\u0027ve marked your master\u0027s territory for him, can we leave?\" I asked, icicles hanging off every syllable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at the driver, and the car took off. Sandra nudged Joe and hissed, \"Raise the glass.\" He pressed the button, and the front seat was once more blocked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as it was up-as if that would keep Maximus from overhearing us-Sandra grinned at me. \"Leila,\" she said in an admiring voice, \"you must tell us everything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting drunk. Rip-roaring, stinking, worshipping-at-the-porcelain-altar drunk. Damn Maximus for his big mouth, and damn Vlad for his incomprehensible arrogance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like that,\" I muttered, looking out the window rather than at the seven sets of eyes fixed on me. \"Nothing\u0027s happened between us.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-29.html","bookId":2011,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM"}
