When the excitement produced by the fatal shot was at its height, it had flashed upon Harry like an inspiration that then, if ever, was the time to escape. He knew that it would be at the risk of their lives, and but for one consideration it is doubtful if he would have been willing to incur the peril of the attempt. But he felt that to stay was to run a risk as great that of being compelled to join the ranks of the bushrangers, and of that he had a great dread. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The boys never stopped running till they had set half a mile between them and the camp of the bushrangers.

When the excitement has subsided a little, I am afraid they will look for us.

The way had become difficult with the scrub bushes that filled up the distance between the trees. The latter were no longer the same which they had hitherto encountered, the tall and stately eucalyptus, but were smaller and wider branched.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We can\u0027t make our way here, Harry,\" said Jack despondently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes, we can. Besides, don\u0027t you see, the rougher and more difficult the way, the less are we likely to be followed.

They surmounted the hill, and found a clearer country. Finally, turning to the right they came upon an open tract. By this time it was growing dark, and the boys were feeling both fatigued and hungry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think we can rest now, Jack,\" said Harry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With a sigh of relief Jack threw himself on the ground.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This is worse than any work I did on shipboard,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harry smiled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think it is likely to cure you of your love for the sea, Jack,\" he said. \"Though I haven\u0027t your fondness for sea life, I confess I would rather be on the deck of a good stanch ship than here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Harry,\" said Jack anxiously, \"when do you think we shall find something to eat?
