I was surprised to see that the years had touched him so lightly. Indeed, he appeared but little older than at the time I had thrown the glass tumbler at his head. And this set me to a study of all the faces about me. How slowly they had aged while Young Master and I had grown so fast! The doctor was dressed beyond any former mood of neatness, blue broad-cloth coat and ruffled shirt; and Miss May was beautiful in a long, beflowered gown. There had been a heavy frost, and a low, cheer-giving roar came from the logs in the great fire-place. Outside the negroes were singing and dancing in the crisp air. The looms and the spinning wheels were hushed; it was a time for music, for feasting, for jollification—a whole week of \"colored freedom.\" The talk at the table was full of jest, for in the midst of the company was a great bowl of egg-nog. And even the steely eyes of my old mistress snapped with pleasant mischief. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 67]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Doctor,\" she said, \"Dan has become quite a student, and he writes Latin love-letters for black Steve.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In Latin to show that Steve is dead in love!\" the doctor roared, shaking his ruffled shirt with his mirth. \"But I should think,\" he added, \"that a woman who could love him must be color-blind.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Or still worse, blind to all sentiment,\" suggested Young Master.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Or left alone by all lovers,\" Miss May declared.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But,\" said Old Master, \"being so ill-favored he may be faithful.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The ugly are not truer than the beautiful,\" Miss May spoke up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The doctor bowed to her. \"I am glad that you assert your own fidelity,\" he said, and Young Master looked up at me. Miss May blushed, and Old Mistress said: \"Daughter, that was a charming compliment, quite worthy of a Southern gentleman.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And accepted by a Southern lady—with blushes,\" spoke my young master, and I felt a strong impulse to grasp his hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah, Bob,\" said the doctor, \"you are improving.

Old Master had begun to laugh at everything, for up to the great yellow bowl in the center of the table his cup had been passed many times. His face glowed with good humor and he joked with the doctor. \"Really glad to see you back again, George,\" the old man said, blinking a newly-felt welcome. \"We never know how much we think of a fellow until he\u0027s gone.

He got[Pg 70] up quickly, overturning his chair, and without stopping to right it, strode slowly up and down the room. He walked for some time, with his eyes cast down, half theatrical, treading the forum, for his reading had a deep influence upon him; and then he halted and turned to me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you see that chair?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why don\u0027t you take it up?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I replied (at times we were stiffly formal) and then I placed the chair back against the wall. He resumed his walk muttering something, and suddenly his stiff forensic bearing became lithely natural. \"Dan,\" he said, \"do you know what I believe?\" and before I had time to reply, he continued: \"I believe that wolf is trying to marry my sister. And I want to say this, to go no farther, that if he wins her, I\u0027ll cut his throat. Mean it?\" he cried, his eyes aflame, \"I mean it just as sure as there is a God in Heaven. I have always hated that man. I never told you my first recollection of him. I was playing alone in the yard, sitting under a tree. I was very young, I know, but I remember it well. He came along with a bone which he threw to his dog, and then he bent over me and wiped his greasy hands on my head. I howled in[Pg 71] anger, and someone came; my words were so few that I could not set forth my resentment.\" He strode to the door and then hastily came back. \"He is a snake, and May is a bird, and he perhaps can charm her, but if he does, I\u0027ll let the blood out of his throat.

He mused for a long time, and then he said, without looking at me. \"I have been reading an old man\u0027s book, and it impresses upon me the glorious appreciation of youth.
