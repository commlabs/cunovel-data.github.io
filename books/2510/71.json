Pay no attention to anything I say, but that I love you, have always loved you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must end this before I become maudlin. It would not do for me to attend the reception for the King of Aragon in a distraught humor. It is times like these when I wish I had not lost the ability to weep, for tears might cleanse me. But red and swollen eyes will not become me, so I will tell myself that I was fortunate when the change deprived me of weeping, and my soul will mourn. Doubtless someone will provide me a distraction, and, who knowsâ€”I may find someone who will want to share my pleasures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you, my dearest, have you found someone to share your pleasures, or are you still alone? If there were anything I might do to give you that which you seek, though it ended my life, I would do it. Empty words, with you so far away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have sent for my servant and have given orders for my palinquin, so I must bid you farewell for a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom my own hand on the Feast of Saint Matthew, in the 1214th year of Our Lord, in Roma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crusader-s-torch-atta-olivia-clemens-2/page-71.html","bookId":2510,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:05 PM"}
