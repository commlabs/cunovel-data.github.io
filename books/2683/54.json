The new issue of Vanity Fair sits by an Hermes lamp, along with various glossy Japanese magazines, CDs, a PowerBook, a bottle of Dom Perignon 1983 in an ice bucket, two half-empty flutes, a dozen roses, which Lauren will not carry out of this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus f**king Christ,\" Damien snaps.
