But sometimes, well, it depends on the Fist.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And the captain,’ added Throatslitter, nudging Widdershins with a sharp elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now there’s a point,’ Balm mused. ‘Kinda sticky, like a hand under a blanket.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter’s second laugh sent them scurrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Those soldiers looked flush,’ Widdershins muttered once they’d retreated into the gloom. ‘At first, well, the poor fools were just following orders, so I thought you was being unkind, Sergeant – but now I got some suspicions.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s an executable offence,’ said Deadsmell. ‘What you’re suggesting there, Wid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s going to happen soon if it hasn’t already,’ Widdershins said, grimacing. ‘We all know it. Why d’you think Fid nailed us to these wagons?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter added, ‘Heard we was getting our heavies for this, but then we weren’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nervous, Throaty?’ Widdershins asked. ‘Only the four of us, after all. The scariest thing about us is your awful laugh.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Worked though, didn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They went to moan at their captain or whoever,’ Balm said. ‘They’ll be back with reinforcements, is my guess.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiddershins jabbed Throatslitter with his elbow, avenging that earlier prod. ‘Scared, Throaty?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Only of your breath, Wid – get away from me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Got another squad on the other side of these wagons,’ Balm pointed out. ‘Anyone see which one?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked over, but the three lines of wretched haulers mostly blocked their view. Throatslitter grunted. ‘Could be Whiskeyjack himself. If we get in trouble they won’t be able to get through—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s your problem?’ Balm demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter bared his teeth. ‘This is thirst we’re dealing with here, Sergeant – no, all of you! Where I came from, droughts hit often, and the worst was when the city was besieged – and with Li Heng, well, during the scraps with the Seti that was pretty much every summer. So I know about thirst, all right? Once the fever strikes, there’s no stopping it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well isn’t that cheery? You can stop talking now, Throatslitter, and that’s an order.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think it’s Badan Gruk’s squad,’ said Deadsmell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalm snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiddershins frowned. ‘That’s a problem, Sergeant? They’re Dal Honese just like you, aren’t they?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t be an idiot. They’re from the southern jungles.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So are you, aren’t you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Even if I was, and I’m not saying I wasn’t, or was, that’d make no difference, you understand me, Wid?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. Tayschrenn himself couldn’t have worked out what you just said, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s complicated, that’s all. But … Badan Gruk. Well, could be worse, I suppose. Though like Throaty said, we’d both have trouble supporting the other. I wish Fid ain’t pulled the heavies from us. What d’you think he’s done with ’em?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeadsmell said, ‘It was Faradan Sort who come up after Kindly, to talk to the captain. And I wasn’t deliberately eavesdropping or nothing. I just happened to be standing close. So I didn’t catch it all, but I think there might be some trouble with the food haulers on the back end. I’m thinking that’s where the heavies went.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What, to lighten the loads?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter yelped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLap Twirl scratched at the end of his nose where the tip had once been. ‘Kind’ve insulting,’ he muttered, ‘them calling themselves Bridgeburners.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurnt Rope glanced over at the company marching on his left. Squinted at the three oxen plodding the way oxen plodded the world over. It’s how it looks when y’get someone doing something nobody wants t’do. Draught animals. Of course, it’s all down to stupidity, isn’t it? Do the work, get food, do more work to get more food. Over and over again. Not like us at all . ‘I don’t care what they call themselves, Lap. They’re marching just like us. In the same mess, and when we’re all bleached bones, well, who could tell the difference between any of us?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I could,’ Lap Twirl said. ‘Easy. Just by looking at the skulls. I can tell if it’s a woman or a man, young or old. I can tell if it’s a city-born fool or a country one. Where I apprenticed, back in Falar, my master had shelves and shelves of skulls. Was doing a study – he could tell a Napan from a Quon, a Genabackan from a Kartoolian—’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-215.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
