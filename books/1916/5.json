{"id":88661,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eAddison\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m lost. In him. In his tongue and his teeth, his mouth and his breath, and the way he whispers my name between every kiss as we practically stumble out of the airport and over to where he\u0027s parked his bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know we\u0027ve got to separate at some point to get out of here, get home, but my entire body\u0027s on fire, screaming at me to find a dark corner and just unzip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel cool metal against my hand as Rush rips his mouth from mine. We must be here. In the parking garage. And hey, there are lots of dark corners. But before I can suggest it, Rush lifts me up with a growl and places me on the black leather seat. Breathing heavy, my lips already deliciously swollen, I watch as he straps my bag onto the back of the bike. Every inch of my skin is vibrating and I\u0027m squeezing the black leather with my inner thighs. I\u0027ve never felt so manic. Like if I don\u0027t get my hands on him soon, feel his hot, hard, inked skin against mine, I\u0027ll lose my sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for my plan to keep it cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop looking at me like that, Addison,\" Rush warns, grabbing his helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile innocently. \"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis green eyes liquid fire, he leans in, close to my ear. \"I can\u0027t fuck you here. Too many people. Too many cameras.\" He licks the shell of my ear and I shiver deliciously. \"And no one sees you come but me. So, sit tight, baby. I\u0027m taking you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slips the helmet over my head, then climbs on in front of me. For just a second, I take him in. My badass boy with the combat boots, ripped jeans, faded black t-shirt, oh-so sexy disheveled hair and plentiful ink. That beautiful ink I dream about every night. That ink wrapped around my body. I shiver again. All the way down to my toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arms around me, baby,\" Rush calls, starting the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me less than a few seconds to do as he says before ripping away from the space and hauling ass out of the parking structure. He\u0027s such a skilled maniac, the way he takes every curve and slides in and out of lanes. I love it. I get off on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re just merging onto the freeway when my insides calm down enough to enjoy the ride and the desert wind on my skin. Shit, could I move here? Live in Las Vegas, in the desert, with him? Yes, I could. I know that. I want that. But does he? Does he understand that if we did that, things would be crazy for awhile? That I\u0027d be job searching for weeks, maybe months while I worked temp jobs to pay for an apartment? Because I\u0027d be paying for my own shit. Or...would he fight me on that? Like he fights me on the plane tickets? And if I gave in, would that screw with our dynamic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes inside my helmet. I\u0027m getting way ahead of myself here. He hasn\u0027t asked. He hasn\u0027t even mentioned it. Maybe he\u0027s content with this...seeing each other when we have time. Flying in and out, weekends when it\u0027s cool. Maybe I need to just stop this head trip I\u0027m on and enjoy my time with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush takes a hand off the handlebars and places it over mine, which are tightly wrapped around his waist. The move, the contact of his skin on mine, completely unravels me again. And as Rush exits the freeway and hits the two lane road that leads to his house, I inch closer, press my breasts against his back and squeeze my thighs around his hips. I feel him inhale sharply. Around us, the pink sun is going down, and without thinking, my right hand abandons his waist and starts to descend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Addison.\" I hear the warning-laced call on the wind, but I\u0027m barely registering it. I want him so badly I can\u0027t see straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groans as my fingers brush lightly over the top of his burgeoning erection. I want it. I want to slip my hand inside his jeans and make him as hard as the red rocks around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I\u0027m going to crash,\" he hollers back, his voice strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know. I hear him, and I know what he\u0027s saying is true. Shit, I know what I\u0027m doing is totally freaking dangerous. But I don\u0027t care. I swear to god, I want him so bad I don\u0027t care if we crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is wrong with me? And how can I make it stop?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a hard jerk to the right and a squeal of tires, Rush pulls off the road. I curl into him, holding on tight as he speeds into the desert, hauling ass until he spots a large palo verde tree about quarter mile out. He guns for it, and once there, jerks the bike to the right, then brings it to an abrupt, dust-clouded stop before killing the engine. He\u0027s off the thing in two seconds. Has me on my feet in one. And rips off my helmet with a curse and look so fierce, I shiver and erupt into flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t very smart, Ads,\" he says, unbuttoning the top of his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath catches in my throat. \"I know. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twitches, but the humor doesn\u0027t reach his eyes. He sends his zipper down a few inches. \"No you\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, I\u0027m not,\" I say as he moves closer until his body is flush against mine. \"I want you. I\u0027m not going to apologize for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans down, kisses my top lip super gently, then bites it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hiss and my belly clenches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not making it home, Ads. Not like this.\" He reaches for me. Quick and easy, he unbuttons and unzips my jeans, his fingers moving downward. \"I\u0027m hard and you\u0027re...\" He fiercely cups me through my jeans. \"Wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groan and push against his hand. Hell yeah, I\u0027m wet. I need him so badly, need him to touch me, put me out of my misery so I can think clearly again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to have to fuck you right here, Ads.\" His eyes meet mine. \"Is that what you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can barely breathe. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne eyebrow lifts. \"Anyone could see us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, lick my dry lips. \"I don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins. \"Shit, baby. We could get arrested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin back, my heart slamming against my ribs so hard it\u0027s painful. \"Then you\u0027d better hurry up and get inside me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s a great answer.\" In one effortless move, he flips me around to face the bike, then hooks his thumbs inside of the waistband of my jeans and sends them to my ankles. \"Perfect answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cool desert breeze blows across the skin of my legs and ass as he bends me over the leather seat of his bike and kicks my feet apart as far as the denim will allow. I\u0027m dying. Fucking dying to have him inside me. I hold my breath, every inch of me so sensitive that when he does touch me, when he slides my thong aside, when I feel his hand moving down the seam of my ass, then slowly-oh-so erotically slowly-entering me with one long, thick finger, I convulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush lets out a groan and holds me steady with his free hand. \"Oh, baby, you\u0027re so wet.\" He inserts a second finger and drives it up all the way up to the knuckles. \"How long have you been like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing heavy, nipples beading, fingers digging into the leather seat, I manage to utter one word. \"Hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pumps me slowly. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever felt you this wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to take care of it on the plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" he demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel his cock against my ass. It\u0027s hard and warm and ready. \"The bathroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush stills, then spreads his fingers wide inside of me, stretching me. It\u0027s delicious, and I moan. \"Did you touch yourself, Addison?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slips his fingers out of me and finds my clit. When he brushes over it with his thumb, I gasp and clench. \"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I\u0027m going to die. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you stroke yourself? Pinch yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy nails dig into the leather seat as he does both with his clever fingers. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. I can\u0027t breathe or focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" The head of his cock is right against my opening now. I arch my back, silently begging him to fill me. \"You won\u0027t do that again. Got it, Addison? I make you come. Only me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout waiting for a response, he pushes inside me. Not all the way, just an inch or two. \"Unless I\u0027m watching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes fill with tears. I\u0027ve never wanted anything so bad in my life. \"Rush, please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact.\" He slips in another inch, then two. \"When we get home, you\u0027re going straight to my room.\" He pulls out, and I cry and let my head drop forward. \"You\u0027re going to get naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes, please Rush, I can\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to get on my bed.\" He slams into me, so hard and so deep I gasp for air, grip the bike to hold myself steady. \"You\u0027re going to spread your legs so wide I can see every inch of you. Then you\u0027re going to fuck yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands clamp around my hips and he thrusts inside me with deep, wonderfully punishing strokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But right now, baby, I\u0027m fucking you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain is a blank screen, and my throat is only allowing moans and sighs and cries to escape. Under the slowly darkening sky, with the sounds of the wind, and the traffic in the distance, Rush works me over, his hands splayed on my ass now, his thumbs opening my cheeks wide, so he can get inside me even deeper. It\u0027s heaven, and I never want it to end. But my body is betraying me. The build started the second I saw him with that sign above his head at the airport, and the cocky grin on his face when he saw me. So when leans over me, gets close to my ear and whispers, \"I love you awful, baby,\" I break. My walls contract around him, my legs shake and I cry out into the night-blooming desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush curses and squeezes my hips. He stays by my ear as he pounds into me. He whispers my name over and over as he too lets go. It\u0027s been so long since we\u0027ve been together. For a week, our skin, our tongues, our insides have been running on memory and withdrawal. We needed this. Quick and hard and wherever we could find the space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush doesn\u0027t linger inside of me. Night\u0027s coming on fast now and I\u0027m getting cold. With gentle hands, he pulls my jeans back up, even zips and buttons me, then handles himself before straddling his bike and gesturing for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get on, Addison. We need to go home.\" His sexy, jade-green eyes heavy with lust, he revs the engine at me. \"That only made me want your ass more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t need to hear anything more. I\u0027m his. Whatever he wants, and whenever he wants it. I yank on my helmet, then settle in behind him, my arms wrapping around his waist. He takes off back toward the road, kicking up desert dust, and I realize that for the first time in a week, I can finally breathe right. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-2/page-5.html","bookId":1916,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:23 PM"}
