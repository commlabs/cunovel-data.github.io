I knew it was a crazy question, forget it,\" I say, trying to smile, shaking my head. \"So who\u0027s been sleeping in your bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m enjoying the art of being semi-single,\" she sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m seeing your face in a new light,\" I say, resting my chin in the palm of my hand, staring straight at her. \"And you\u0027re lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\" she asks hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About being single.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because girls who look like you are never single,\" I say faux-confidently. \"Plus I know you, Jamie. You like guys too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stares at me, mouth open, and then starts laughing hysterically and doesn\u0027t stop cracking up until I ask, \"Did you have cheekbones like that back at Camden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes a couple of deep breaths, reaches over to finish my martini and, flushed, panting, asks, \"Victor, what do you expect me to say to that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dropped a bomb on me, baby,\" I murmur, staring at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, pretending not to be, she asks, \"I did what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dropped a bomb on me,\" I say. \"You, like, affected me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did this happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we first met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now I\u0027m in the same state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, get over it,\" she says. \"Get over yourself as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re thinking something, though,\" I say, refusing to break eye contact, not even blinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am,\" she says finally, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking, Jamie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a pause and looking directly back at me, she says, \"I\u0027m thinking you\u0027re a potentially interesting person who I might want to get reacquainted with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve always been one of the fifty most inspiring women in the world to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to get reacquainted, Victor?\" she asks, daring me, lowering her eyes, then raising them back up, widening them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the way she says this and the look on her face-total sex-flusters me, and with my face burning, I try to complete a sentence but only \"I, um, don\u0027t know...\" comes out.

When I ask Jamie about the identity of the industrial billionaire she tells me he funds certain wars and is also a \"friendly\" alcoholic and then we bump into Patsy Palmer and Martine McCutcheson and we all end up telling Nellie Hooper how much we adore the new Massive remix as Damon Albarn kisses Jamie on both cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside: most of the vast empty spaces in the warehouse look like restaurant kitchens with giant windows steamed over and it\u0027s freezing because of all the mammoth ice sculptures on display and bands are playing on different floors (the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion\u0027s in the basement) and everyone\u0027s doing Gucci poses while drinking Tsingtao beer but it\u0027s also a kind of Gap-T-shirt-and-Prada-penny-loafers night, no pitfalls, camcorders everywhere, Carmen Electra in a purple Alaia dress dancing with one of the ice sculptures, and sometimes the party\u0027s in black-and-white and sometimes it\u0027s in glaring color like in the new Quicksilver ads and the mood is all basically very antistyle and we\u0027re shivering like we\u0027re lodged in an iceberg somewhere that\u0027s floating off the coast of Norway or a place equally cold. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-125.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
