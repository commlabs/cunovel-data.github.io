Herr Mack pressed my hand, and said encouragingly that it would be nice weather, pleasant weather; he would not mind making the trip himself in such weather. The Doctor came walking down. Edwarda was with him; I felt my knees beginning to tremble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Came to see you safely off,” said the Doctor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I thanked him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Edwarda looked me straight in the face and said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I must thank you for your dog.” She pressed her lips together; they were quite white. Again she had called me “Eder.” [Footnote: The most formal mode of address.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “When does the boat go?” the Doctor asked a man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “In half an hour.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I said nothing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Edwarda was turning restlessly this way and that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Doctor, don’t you think we may as well go home again?” she said. “I have done what I came for to do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You have done what you came to do,” said the Doctor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She laughed, humiliated by his everlasting correction, and answered:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Wasn’t that almost what I said?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” he answered shortly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I looked at him. The little man stood there cold and firm; he had made a plan, and he carried it out to the last. And if he lost after all? In any case, he would never show it; his face never betrayed him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was getting dusk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, good-bye,” I said. “And thanks for — everything.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Edwarda looked at me dumbly. Then she turned her head and stood looking out at the ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I got into the boat. Edwarda was still standing on the quay. When I got on board, the Doctor called out “Good-bye!” I looked over to the shore. Edwarda turned at the same time and walked hurriedly away from the quay, the Doctor far behind. That was the last I saw of her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A wave of sadness went through my heart . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The vessel began to move; I could still see Herr Mack’s sign: “Salt and Barrels.” But soon it disappeared. The moon and the stars came out; the hills towered round about, and I saw the endless woods. There is the mill; there, there stood my hut, that was burned; the big grey stone stands there all alone on the site of the fire.
