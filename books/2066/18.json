He gripped her tightly with his other hand, holding her stil , his fingers digging into her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena struggled fiercely, flailing her arms and landing a firm blow in Caleb\u0027s stomach. She bit down hard on the hand he had over her mouth. Caleb jerked backward, quickly letting go of her and pul ing his bitten hand to his chest. As soon as her mouth was uncovered, Elena screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb stepped away from her, holding his hands up in surrender. \"Elena!\" he said. \"Elena, I\u0027m so sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to scare you. I just didn\u0027t want you to scream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena eyed him warily, breathing hard. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked. \"Why were you sneaking up behind me if you didn\u0027t want to scare me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb shrugged and looked a little embarrassed. \"I was worried about you,\" he confessed, stuffing his hands in his pockets and hanging his head. \"I was hiking up by Hot Springs earlier and I saw you and your friends. They were pul ing you out of the water, and it looked like you weren\u0027t breathing.\" He peeked up at her through his long golden lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were so worried about me you decided to grab me and cover my mouth to keep me from screaming?\" Elena asked. Caleb ducked his head further and scrubbed at the back of his neck in an embarrassed way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t thinking.\" Caleb nodded solemnly. \"You looked so pale,\" he said. \"But you opened your eyes and sat up. I was going to come down and see if you were okay, but your friend saw me and started running up the path toward me like he was going to jump me, and I guess I just freaked out.\" He grinned suddenly. \"I\u0027m not usual y such a wuss,\" he said. \"But he looked mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena found herself feeling unexpectedly disarmed. Her shoulder stil ached where Caleb had grabbed her. But he seemed so sincere, and so apologetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" Caleb continued, gazing at her out of candid light blue eyes, \"I was driving back to my aunt and uncle\u0027s place, and I recognized your car in the cemetery parking lot. I just came in because I wanted to talk to you and make sure you were okay. And then, when I got close to you, you were sitting down and talking, and I guess I was embarrassed. I didn\u0027t want to interrupt you, and I didn\u0027t want to barge in on something personal, so I just waited.\" He ducked his head sheepishly again. \"And instead I ended up assaulting you and scaring you to death, which sure wasn\u0027t the better way to go. I\u0027m real y sorry, Elena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena\u0027s heartbeat was returning to normal. Whatever Caleb\u0027s intentions, he obviously wasn\u0027t going to attack her again now. \"It\u0027s al right,\" she said. \"I hit my head on an underwater rock. I\u0027m fine now, though. It must have looked pretty weird to see me just sitting here and muttering. Sometimes I come here to talk to my parents, that\u0027s al . This is where they\u0027re buried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not weird,\" he said quietly. \"I find myself talking to my parents sometimes, too. When something happens and I wish they were with me, I start tel ing them about it and it makes me feel like they\u0027re there.\" He swal owed hard. \"It\u0027s been a few years, but you never stop missing them, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last bits of anger and fear drained out of Elena when she saw the sadness in Caleb\u0027s face. \"Oh, Caleb,\" she said, reaching out to touch his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught a sudden motion out of the corner of her eye and then, seemingly out of nowhere, Stefan appeared, running incredibly fast, straight toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb,\" he growled, grabbing him by the shirt and throwing him to the ground. Caleb let out a grunt of surprise and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan, no!\" shouted Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan spun to look at her. His eyes were hard and his fangs were ful y extended. \"He\u0027s not what he says he is, Elena,\" he said in an eerily calm voice. \"He\u0027s dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb slowly pul ed himself to his feet, using a gravestone as a support. He was staring at Stefan\u0027s fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" he asked. \"What are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan turned toward him and, almost casual y, slapped him back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan, stop it!\" Elena yel ed, unable to contain the note of hysteria in her voice. She reached out for his arm, but missed. \"You\u0027re going to hurt him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants you, Elena,\" Stefan growled. \"Do you understand that? You can\u0027t trust him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan,\" Elena pleaded. \"Listen to me. He wasn\u0027t doing anything wrong. You know that. He\u0027s a human.\" She could feel hot tears gathering in her eyes and she blinked them away. Now was not the time to weep and wail. Now was the time to be cool and rational and to keep Stefan from losing control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb staggered to his feet, grimacing with pain, and this time charged clumsily at Stefan, his face flushed. He got one arm around Stefan\u0027s neck and yanked him to the side, but then Stefan, with an easy strength, tossed Caleb to the ground once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan loomed over him threateningly as he stared up at him from the grass. \"You can\u0027t fight me,\" Stefan growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m stronger than you. I can drive you out of this town, or kil you just as easily. And I wil do either if you make me think it\u0027s necessary. I won\u0027t hesitate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena grabbed Stefan\u0027s arm. \"Stop it! Stop it!\" she shouted. She pul ed him toward her, trying to turn him so she could look into his eyes, so she could get through to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathe, she thought desperately. She had to calm things down here, and she tried to steady her voice, to sound logical. \"Stefan, I don\u0027t know what you think is going on with Caleb, but just stop for a minute and think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena, look at me,\" Stefan said. His eyes were dark with emotion. \"I know, I\u0027m absolutely sure, that Caleb is evil. He\u0027s dangerous to us. We have to get rid of him before he gets a chance to destroy us. We can\u0027t give him the opportunity to get the better of us by waiting for him to make his move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan...\" Elena said. Her voice was shaking, and an oddly rational, detached part of her noted that this must be what it felt like when the person you loved most lost his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what she was going to say next, but before she could even open her mouth, Caleb had risen again. There was a long scratch down the side of his face, and his blond hair was tangled and ful of dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back off,\" Caleb said grimly, coming toward Stefan. He was limping a little bit, and clutched a fist-size rock in his right hand. \"You can\u0027t just...\" He raised the rock threateningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it, both of you,\" Elena yel ed, trying for a fierce general\u0027s voice that would command their attention. But Caleb just hoisted the rock and threw it straight at Stefan\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan dodged the rock, moving almost too quickly for Elena to see, grabbed Caleb by the waist, and, in one graceful motion, flung him into the air. For a moment, Caleb was suspended, seemingly as light and boneless as a scarecrow tossed from the back of a pickup truck, and then he hit the side of the marble Civil War monument with a sickening crunch. With a thud, he fel to the ground at the foot of the statue and was stil .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb!\" Elena screamed in horror. She ran toward him, shoving her way between the bushes and clumps of grass that encircled the monument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were closed and his face was pale. Elena could see the light blue veins in his eyelids. There was a spreading pool of blood on the ground beneath his head. A streak of dirt ran across his face, and that dirt and the long red scratch on his cheek suddenly seemed like some of the most heartbreaking things she had ever seen. He wasn\u0027t moving. She couldn\u0027t tel whether he was breathing. Elena dropped to her knees and felt for Caleb\u0027s pulse, fumbling at his neck. As she found the steady thrum of a heartbeat beneath her fingers, she gasped in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena.\" Stefan had fol owed her to Caleb\u0027s side. He put his hand on her shoulder. \"Please, Elena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena shook her head, refusing to look at him, and shrugged his hand away. She felt in her pocket for her phone. \"My god, Stefan,\" she said, her words clipped and tight, \"you could have kil ed him. You have to get out of here. I can tel the police I found him like this, but if they see you, they\u0027re going to know you two were fighting.\" She swal owed hard as she realized the streak of dirt staining Caleb\u0027s shirt was Stefan\u0027s handprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena,\" Stefan pleaded. At the anguish in his tone, she final y turned toward him. \"Elena, you don\u0027t understand. I had to stop him. He was a threat to you.\" Stefan\u0027s leaf green eyes beseeched her, and Elena had to steel herself to keep from crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to leave,\" she said. \"Go home. I\u0027l talk to you later.\" Don\u0027t hurt anyone else, she thought, and bit her lip. Stefan stared at her for a long moment, then final y backed away. \"I love you, Elena.\" He turned and disappeared into the trees, through the older and wilder part of the cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena took a steadying breath, wiped her eyes, and dialed 911. \"There\u0027s been an accident,\" she said, her voice panicky, when the operator picked up. \"I\u0027m in the Fel \u0027s Church Cemetery off Route Twenty-three, over by the Civil War monument near the edge of the newer section. I\u0027ve found someone... It looks like he was knocked unconscious somehow...\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-phantom-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-18.html","bookId":2066,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:16:26 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:16:26 AM"}
