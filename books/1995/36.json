I’m married to Blaire. I’m the luckiest bastard on the planet,” I replied, not taking his bait. He wanted to get me fired up because Grant thought me getting angry was funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blaire is smoking hot. Even nine months pregnant,” he drawled, leaning back and propping his legs up on the dash of the cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you are wanting a fucking broken nose then keep it up, bro,” I snarled, glaring back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began laughing and I knew he’d gotten what he wanted. I rolled my eyes. My phone started vibrating and ringing in my pocket. That was Blaire’s ring. I dropped my club and reached into my pocket to get the phone. She didn’t call me randomly. If she was calling then she needed me. I started walking to the cart waiting on her to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” I said the moment she answered. She took a deep breath and I threw the cart in reverse and started speeding toward the clubhouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My water just broke,” she said trying to sound calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m on my way. Stay right there. Don’t move. Don’t drive. Just wait on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m in the clubhouse parking lot. I was coming to find you when it happened,” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m almost there, baby, hang on. Less than a minute, I swear,” I assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a grunting noise then took a few deep breaths. “Okay,” she replied then hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” I growled and wished to God the stupid cart went faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m gathering that she’s in labor,” Grant replied from the seat beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I snapped. Not wanting to talk. I just needed to get to her faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess that means you don’t care that you just left your putter back there,” Grant replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck no, I don’t care about the damn putter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant crossed his arms over his chest. “Okay, just checking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you to take my phone. Get Abe’s number out of it and call him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant grabbed my phone and did as I asked while I slammed the cart into park and took off running across the grass to the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaire was standing beside the Mercedes I’d bought her with one hand on the car and one hand on her stomach. She looked more relaxed than I imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was quick.” She smiled at me when her eyes met mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” I asked, wrapping my arm around her and walking her over to the passenger side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m okay now. The cramping has eased up. But Rush, I shouldn’t get in this car. It’s brand new and I have... well... I’m wet,” she said, stumbling over her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t give a rat’s ass about this car. Get in. I’m taking you to the hospital.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let me help her in the car although I could see the reluctance on her face. She didn’t want to mess up her new car. I pressed a kiss to her forehead. “I swear I’ll have it completely detailed inside before you get out of the hospital,” I assured her before closing the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran around the front of the car and Grant was standing there with a nervous expression. “She okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s in labor,” I stated the obvious and jerked the driver’s door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called Abe. What else can I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call Dean. He’ll want to know,” I told him before closing the car door. I didn’t let myself think about the fact I wouldn’t be calling my mom or sister. There was no point. I couldn’t trust them around Blaire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think maybe you should call your mom? Or do you think she would rather not know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over at her as I pulled out onto the road and sped to Destin where the nearest hospital was located. “I don’t want them being a part of this. They don’t deserve it,” I replied, then reached over and squeezed her hand. “This is our family now. Mine and yours. We decide who we let in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaire nodded and laid her head back on the headrest. I could tell she was having some pain from the scrunched look on her face even though she was keeping quiet about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can I help?” I asked, anxious to do something to make this stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drive,” she replied with a tight smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed my hand and let out a deep sigh of relief. “That one’s over. They aren’t very long or close together so we are good on time,” she sounded breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed down on my hand again. “Rush!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost swerved off the road. “What baby? Are you okay?” My heart was slamming against my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I forgot about Della. You have to call Woods. He needs to know that the cops came and got Della.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho the fuck was Della? Was she hallucinating? “Baby, I don’t know a Della,” I replied carefully in case this hallucinating thing could make her crazy. I hadn’t read about this in any of those books she’d kept by the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Della is who Woods is dating. Jimmy thinks they’re boinking. She was really sweet and I liked her. She looked so scared. Woods needs to help her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been at the club to visit Jimmy. That’s why she was there. Not because she had been in labor. This was making sense now. “Grant has my phone. Where’s yours?” If this didn’t mean so much to her I wouldn’t be worried about Woods’ love life and his so-called girlfriend being hauled in by the cops. Because that shit didn’t sound promising and I didn’t want Blaire around someone dangerous. But she didn’t need anymore stress so I’d do whatever I could to make her feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He isn’t answering his phone. It goes straight to voicemail. Who else can we call?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for her phone and dialed Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called Dean and he’s grabbing the next flight out,” was Grant’s greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. Listen, Woods isn’t answering his phone. Call his dad. Tell him that Della,” I paused and looked at Blaire who nodded that I’d gotten the name right, “Della was arrested and she needs help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“FUCK! When was Della arrested? What the hell happened?” Grant roared in my ear. Guess he knew who Della was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. My wife is in labor. Just call his dad. He can find him. I gotta go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll tell him,” Grant replied and I hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Woods’ Dad will know how to reach him,” I assured Blaire. She was frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know about that but maybe I misunderstood.” She stopped talking and squeezed my hand again. Another contraction. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-too-far-too-far-3/page-36.html","bookId":1995,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM"}
