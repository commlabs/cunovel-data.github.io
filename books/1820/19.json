I lightly nipped at her bottom lip as she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur kiss turned passionate as we continued moving to the music. I slowly unbuttoned her blouse and pushed it back off her shoulders until it fell to the floor. I moved my hands along the curves of her beautiful body until I needed to feel more. I took my hand and ran it along the inside of her upper thigh as I pushed up her short black skirt. A moan escaped her as I touched the lace around her thong. She unbuttoned my pants and moved her hand down them, taking my entire length in her hand. God, she felt so warm. I undid her black lace bra and threw it on the floor, and then she took my shirt over my head. I held her tight, feeling her soft, nak*d br**sts pushing against my bare chest. I gently laid her on the floor in front of the fireplace. I pulled her skirt from her waist while kissing her stomach and making my way down her body. I softly kissed and licked the inside of each thigh, stopping at her sensitive spot. I looked up at her with a smile as I grabbed the sides of her panties and forcefully tore them off her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promised you panty ripping,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You certainly keep your promises,” she seductively smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brought my mouth back to her inner thigh, running my tongue in circles as she ran her fingers through my hair. She was already wet and wanting me. I softly kissed my way to her cl*t as she moaned and arched her back the minute my tongue touched her. She had me so aroused that I was about to come right then and there. I felt around her, taking in her wetness and desire for me. I inserted my fingers and leisurely moved them in and out of her as my mouth engulfed her swollen parts until she came. Her body tensed as her hands tightened their grip around my head. I moved on top of her, kissing her and letting her taste what I do. I couldn’t wait anymore; I needed to be inside her as bad as she wanted me to be. I took my throbbing c*ck and pushed inside her. She smiled and yelled out at the pleasure she felt. The warmth of the fire was heating every inch of our bodies as we made passionate love for over an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter our passionate love making, I wrapped us in a blanket as we stared into each other’s eyes. I ran my finger up her jaw line and behind her ear. I wanted to tell her that I loved her, but I was too nervous and scared. I’ve never said those words to anyone except my family, but they didn’t count. So instead, I asked her if she was hungry as I kissed her bare shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’m hungry for you,” she smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a sharp breath as I began to get aroused again. I stroked her cheek with my fingers, “I’m always hungry for you, but we’ll eventually have to eat real food. I hate to break it to you, baby, but we can’t survive on sex alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pouted, and I started to tickle her. She giggled and grabbed my hands to try and get me to stop. I loved watching her laugh like that. I finally stopped when she said ouch because her cut started to hurt. I softly kissed her stitches and got up to order room service. I went to the bedroom and put on a pair of black pajama bottoms while Ellery put on a robe. It wasn’t too long before our room service was delivered, and we were enjoying a nice dinner. I was a little concerned as I looked at her, and she seemed a little pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you feeling alright, Elle? You look a little pale.” I asked with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told me she was fine. She said she was a little tired, and she winked at me as she said I was to blame for that. She did have a long and emotional day, so I can understand her being exhausted. I was just ready to suggest we go to bed for the night and relax when she looked at me seductively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you care to join me for a hot bath, Mr. Black?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would love to, just not too hot; I don’t want you passing out,” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathtub was large enough for four people. I started the water and took off my pajama bottoms, got in, and laid back against the tub, making room for Ellery. We’ve showered together, but this is our first bath together and the thought of her wet, nak*d body lying against mine was highly arousing. I watched her as she twisted up her hair and put it in clip so it didn’t get wet. I loved her hair up. It showed off her elongated sexy neck that I love to kiss so much. She removed her robe and let it drop to the floor as she walked to the tub. She was so damn sexy, and I wanted to spend every minute letting her know how sexy she is. She slid into the tub and laid her head against my chest. I put my arms around her and took in the softness of her damp skin. I couldn’t help myself as I started to gently kiss her neck; it was inviting and alluring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love it when you wear your hair up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that so?” She smiled as I continued to plant small, delicate kisses down her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea how bad I wanted you that night of the charity event. I did everything I could to restrain myself and not take you in the bathroom to have my way with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish you would have,” she said as she continuously moved her finger up and down my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you don’t. I would have been too rough, and I might have scared you off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can never scare me off,” she said as she turned her head to face me. She placed her hand on the side of my face. “Infinity is forever, and that’s what you are to me. You are my forever, Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard because she was bringing tears to my eyes. I was so moved by her words. I traced the outline of her lips before I kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s no limit to what I wouldn\u0027t do for you. Just ask, and it will be done, no matter the sacrifice,” I said while looking into her blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes began to swell with tears as she traced my lips with her finger. “Those are the most beautiful words that anyone has ever said to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re true, every last word,” I whispered as our lips met one last time, and we made love before heading off to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorning had come, and I opened my eyes as the sun peeked through the sheer curtains that hung perfectly on the windows. Ellery was snuggled against me as our legs were wrapped around each other and tangled in the sheets. She stirred and moved her hand down my chest as she looked up me and smiled. I kissed the tip of her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning, baby,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, babe; I want to wake up like this every day. I love waking up in your arms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing her say that made me very happy. I was afraid she thought things were moving too fast with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t think of a more perfect way to start off the day than waking up with you in my arms,” I smiled as I kissed her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both got up when we heard a knock on the door. I put on my pajama bottoms and opened the door. It was our complimentary breakfast. As we were enjoying breakfast and coffee, Ellery received a text message from her ex-boyfriend, Kyle. She seemed concerned because he was in Michigan, and he wanted to see her. I told her it was fine and to tell him where we were. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Ellery was really upset by his text message. She didn’t tell me, but I could see the anguish in her face. We headed to the bedroom, got dressed, and packed our bags to head back to Michigan. It wasn’t too long before Kyle knocked on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllery sighed and let him in. He had a surprised look on his face when he saw me. I smiled, waved, and said hello. He wanted to talk to Ellery in private, but she had refused. I said it was ok and that I’d be in the bedroom if she needed me. She nodded her head, and Kyle thanked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter about 10 minutes, I heard Ellery yelling at Kyle. I decided to wait it out a little bit to see if she would calm down before I went out there. When she didn’t, but instead continued to get louder, I stepped out of the bedroom and overheard Kyle asking her if she had told me something. I walked over to where they stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what?” I asked as I looked at Ellery. She was pleading with Kyle to be quiet for both their sakes. I didn’t know what the hell was going on. All I knew was that Kyle was trying to tell me something, and Ellery was scared shitless; I could tell by the look on her face. Kyle didn’t listen to Ellery and looked directly at me with cold eyes. I looked over at Ellery as tears started streaming down her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She has cancer, but she refuses to go and get treatments; she’s just going to let herself die. That’s why I left her. I couldn’t sit there and watch her die,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze. I didn’t believe it. Kyle looked at Ellery, said he was sorry, and he walked out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart started racing and it felt like it was going to jump out of my chest. I looked at Ellery as her tears flowed freely from her eyes. I was too scared to hear the answer to my next question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellery, is that true?!” I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flinched at my raised voice and nodded her head. “Yes, it’s true,” she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clenched my fists and tightened my jaw. “You’ve known your cancer was back even before I met you, but you still hid it from me after everything we’ve been through? What kind of person are you?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI screamed at her. I didn’t know what I was doing. I was confused and in disbelief. My skin grew hot, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, Connor, let me explain,” she pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so angry that I couldn’t see straight. “Explain what? What’s left to explain? Were you just going to tell me one day that you were dying? And why the f**k aren’t you getting any treatment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis didn’t make any sense to me. Why would she just refuse treatment and let herself die? Who does that sort of thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, calm down, Connor,” she pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calm down? You expect me to be calm when I just found out that the woman I love and want to spend the rest of my life with is dying? I don’t want to hear anything from you. You make me sick, Ellery. I can’t do this; I can’t even look at you.” I was blinded by rage, and my emotions were out of control. I turned towards the bedroom. Ellery followed after me and grabbed my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, Connor, don’t do this; let me explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my arm away, and she fell back onto the floor. I turned and looked at her, my voice now calm, but pained. “Your dizzy spells and your tiredness, it’s all part of the cancer. You’re getting worse, and you knew it, but you still didn’t tell me. I bared my soul to you. I told you things nobody in this world knows. I shared myself with you. How could you do that to me, Ellery?” I asked as my eyes filled with tears. I walked to the bedroom and slammed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paced back and forth across the floor. My breathing was still rapid, and my heart felt like it had been broken into a million tiny pieces. There was no way that I could drive with her back to New York, so I pulled out my phone and booked her on the next flight back to New York. I grabbed my bag and opened the bedroom door. As I was walking towards the door, Ellery jumped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Connor, wait, please,” she begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and pointed at her, “Stay away from me. I booked a flight for you back to New York; it leaves in two hours, so compose yourself and be ready. I’m driving back by myself. I can’t stand to look at you right now, let alone ride in a car with you for 10 hours.” I walked out of the hotel room and left the love of my life alone, scared, and crying. What kind of person was I? I questioned myself as I got inside the Range Rover and gripped the steering wheel as tight as I could. I picked up my phone and dialed Denny. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-19.html","bookId":1820,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:14 PM"}
