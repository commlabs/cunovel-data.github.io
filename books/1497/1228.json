One could still see some green grass patches on the plains. However, most of it was a desolated bright yellow colour. Occasionally, some eagles would fly in the sky above while being accompanied by a couple of sharp eagle cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesolation covered this entire plain. At a certain moment, the space of this place rippled. Immediately, a dark black hole was split opened in this empty space. A couple of human figures exited from it in a somewhat miserable manner. After which, they landed on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zi Yan, are you alright?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Fairy Doctor hurriedly asked when she landed and saw Zi Yan’s pale white face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZi Yan shook her head. Purple light flashed on the body. Immediately, she began to slowly shrunk. Within the blink of an eye, she had turned back into the little girl from before. She panted a little before wiping off the cold sweat on her forehead and said, “It’s nothing. I will be fine after resting a little. You should take a look at XIao Yan’s condition first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeng zun-zhe by the side held Xiao Yan’s pulse the moment he appeared. His expression became increasingly ugly after a deep probe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone’s heart sunk when they saw this manner of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile everyone were completely silent, the dark black ring on Xiao Yan’s finger shook. Yao Lao’s illusory body flashed and appeared. He grabbed Xiao Yan’s pulse. A moment later, a murderous intent suddenly surged within his eyes. He coldly said, “Old ghost Zhai Xing, what a vicious tactic!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Old fellow…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeng zun-zhe felt a lament when he saw his old friend at this moment. However, now was not the time to catch up on old times. The most important thing now was Xiao Yan’s injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mister Yao Lao, how is Xiao Yan’s injury?” Little Fairy Doctor’s pretty face was a little pale as she softly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The veins in his body are all shattered and seventy percent of his bones are broken. That palm of old ghost Zhai Xing had contained all of his strength.” Yao Lao’s voice was low and deep as he spoke. That usual smiling face of his currently contained a ferociousness no matter how one saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hall of Soul… from today onwards, we will not rest until one of us die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Chen’s savage voice caused Feng zun-zhe by the side to sigh softly. It was the first time that he saw the calm and indifferent Yao Lao show such an emotion in so many years. Even when Han Feng had betrayed Yao Lao back then, the latter did not show such a surge in emotion. It seemed that the importance of Xiao Yan in his heart was quite great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Fairy Doctor’s already pale face became even whiter when she heard Yao Chen’s words. Her delicate body sway unsteadily. Zi Yan by the side hurriedly supported her upon seeing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such a serious injury…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTian Huo zun-zhe and Xiong Zhan exchanged looks with one another before sighing softly. Forcefully receiving a full force palm from an expert at the peak of the five star Dou Zun class. Forget about Xiao Yan, even the two of them would likely end up losing their lives on the spot. It was already not easy for Xiao Yan to still have a breath left at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There should still be some method right? Aren’t you known for being able to save someone as long as that person still has a breath left?” Feng zun-zhe hurriedly opened his mouth to speak after seeing that everyone had dark hazy faces. However, he smiled bitterly when he spoke. He had forgotten about Yao Lao’s current condition. Not only did the latter not possess a body but he had been turned quite weak by the Hall of Soul. How would he possess the kind of strength that he had when he was at his peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao’s expression was gloomy. He sat beside Xiao Yan and looked at the latter’s face, which was covered with fresh blood. The killing intent within his heart once again surged without control. It was the first time that he had such a rich desire to kill in his heart in these many years. He was aware that if it was not because Xiao Yan had come to rescue him, the latter would definitely not allow himself to fall into such a dangerous situation, given his shrewdness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calm down first. Xiao Yan had rescued you after much difficulty. Aren’t you delivering yourself to be captured if you head to the Hall of Soul now?” How could Feng zun-zhe, who had been acquainted with Yao Lao for so many years, not know what the latter was thinking after seeing his expression? Immediately, he patted Yao Lao’s shoulder and softly spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The most important thing now is not to seek revenge but to rescue Xiao Yan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Chen also inhaled a deep breath of air after hearing this. He was aware that Feng zun-zhe was right. At this moment, he must definitely not create trouble…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should think properly about what should be done. With your alchemist skills, you should have some solution…” Feng zun-zhe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao inclined his head slightly. The ferocious expression on his face was withdrawn. His hand rubbed over Xiao Yan’s pulse and carefully probed deeply into the condition within the latter’s body. When he focused and probe deeply, the familiar Yao zun-zhe aura on his body also gradually seeped out. Back then, he had shook the entire continent. Who was not aware of the name Yao zun-zhe. Many super strong individuals wished to befriend him but was unable to find a way to do so. Although he had currently fell into a low point, it was not difficult for him to recover to his peak with his ability. However, these were not the things that he currently needed to consider. If any accident was to occur to Xiao Yan, it was likely that Yao Lao’s remaining life would be lived with a crazy vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Yao Lao focusing his mind and engaging in a deep examination, the few people beside him also did not dare to make any noise and disturb him. Xiong Zhan and Tian Huo zun-zhe separated and guarded against any sudden and unexpected situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quiet and tensed atmosphere lingered over this entire area. It was a long while later before Yao Chen, who had his eyes shut, suddenly opened them. He softly said, “The situation… is a little better than I had imagined.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Fairy Doctor and the rest let out a soft sigh of relief upon hearing this. Currently, they were unable to endure even more blows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a way to save him?” Feng zun-zhe also asked while feeling rejoice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The constitution of this little fellow is extremely strong. That palm from old ghost Zhai Xing should have severed all of his life force. However, he had managed to forcefully endure through it. Moreover, there is the Heavenly Flame guarding his heart. Hence, it is not truly fatal…” Yao Lao fondled his beard and slowly said. “Moreover, the interior of his body currently has a Heavenly Flame helping him repair his injured body…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean… the Three Thousand Burning Flame?” Little Fairy Doctor asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, the Three Thousand Burning Flame is known as the undying flame. Little fellow, who has swallowed and refined it, also possess this kind of special characteristic. As long as the Three Thousand Burning Flame is not extinguished, it is possible for any injury in his body, regardless of how severe it was, to be healed…” Yao Lao nodded and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, he is currently already unconscious. The recovery by the Three Thousand Burning Flame is automatically activated. This kind of Heavenly Flame need to absorb the strength of the stars. Hence, we must find a place where the strength of the stars is extremely great. Only then is it possible to increase the recovery rate…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Strength of the stars?” Feng zun-zhe was involuntarily startled when he heard this. He immediately laughed, “Let’s go to the Falling Star Pavilion then. You have forgotten that the place where the Falling Star Pavilion was built at is originally a meteorite from space. Even after countless number of years, the strength of the stars within it is still gathered there without scattering. It is the most suitable place for Xiao Yan to recuperate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA joy flashed passed Yao Lao’s eyes when he heard these words. He had really nearly forgotten about that good place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With the help of that meteorite, this little fellow’s life can be considered to be saved…” Yao Lao softly laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Additionally… it is not that I wish to say words that will give others a blow but even though Xiao Yan’s life is saved, such a serious injury will definite affect his training. If in the future… in the future he discovers that his strength has halted and is unable to advance, with Xiao Yan’s character… it is likely very difficult for him to accept it.” Feng zun-zhe appeared to have thought of something. He hesitated for a moment before softly speaking with a bitter smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heart of Little Fairy Doctor by the side, which had just been relaxed, immediately became tensed. She understood Xiao Yan very well. If the latter discovered that his strength would no longer be able to advance even an inch in the future, it was likely that he would feel worse than having been killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ke ke, there is no need to be worried about this. Currently, Xiao Yan’s body had already become so broken that it cannot be more so. This is an opportunity for him to breakthrough his current shell and obtain a new self… you should come and sense the interior of his body. See if you can find something familiar.” Yao Lao merely shook his head and laughed when he heard the concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeng zun-zhe was startled. He extended his hand as he was told and probe deep into Xiao Yan’s body. A moment later, he did indeed sense an extremely familiar mysterious energy. His eyes were suddenly opened as he exclaimed in shock, “This… this is the Yin-Yang Mysterious Dragon Pill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao smiled and nodded. He sighed, “Fortunately, we have gotten one Yin-Yang Mysterious Dragon Pill from Han Feng back then. Otherwise, it will really be troublesome today…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right. Now, the Yin-Yang Mysterious Dragon Pill is most suitable for him. The injuries within his body is even more severe than those of mine back then. He would definitely be able to completely activate all of medicinal strength within the Yin-Yang Mysterious Dragon Pill…” Feng zun-zhe was a little excited. He immediately laughed, “It is indeed a great blessing. This time around, this little fellow might even get a blessing in disguise and breakthrough to the Dou Zun class…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This will depend on his luck…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao smiled and nodded. His mood had also relaxed a little. With the presence of the Three Thousand Burning Flame and the Yin-Yang Mysterious Dragon Pill, it would be difficult for Xiao Yan to die this time around even if he wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan by the side also sighed in relief and appeared to have been relieved of a great burden after hearing the conversation of those two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, we should hurry back to the Falling Star Pavilion. With the help of the meteorite strength there, Xiao Yan’s injury will be healed a little faster.” The tensed atmosphere of this place immediately relaxed after Xiao Yan’s problem was resolved. Feng zun-zhe stood up. His eyes swept around him, mused for a moment and said, “This should be the northern Desolated Plains that is tens of thousands of kilometres from the Death Soul Mountain Range. There is still some distance to the Falling Star Pavilion. Therefore, we cannot delay any longer…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, the branch hall is destroyed and the Hall of Soul will most likely not allow this matter to rest. The terrain of the Falling Star Pavilion in unique and it is well hidden. It is an extremely good hiding spot…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Chen nodded. Currently, they must allow Xiao Yan to recover as soon as possible. There will be opportunities to settle the scores with the Hall of Soul in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, no one had any objections to Yao Lao’s words. That big fellow Xiong Zhan came over and carried Xiao Yan on his back. Being large and tough, he was the best person to be entrusted with this task. However, Little Fairy Doctor was worried about his rugged manner. Therefore, she continued to follow behind him. She was afraid that a bump might shake the currently extremely weak Xiao Yan until something happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire group was all ready to get going after it had a target. After packing up briefly, they rose into the air and swiftly rushed towards the area where the Falling Star Pavilion was located.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1227\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1229\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1228","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
