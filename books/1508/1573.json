All of his concentration was completely focused on the task at hand. The main body of the divine runic symbol was nearly finished, and as he reached the end, his speed became even slower and his movements ever the more cautious.

His soul force controlled the thousand some tiny runes in the air, having them all maintain their current positions.

This was not an easy task to accomplish.

After all, Qin Yi came from Divine Void Divine Kingdom and they were faintly considered a competitor to the Divine Runic Masters Guild. In truth, there wasn’t any major conflicts of interest between these two great organizations, but even so, whether it was martial artists or divine runic masters, one would always have the heart and spirit to outdo everyone else.
