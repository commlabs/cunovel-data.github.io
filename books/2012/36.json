The sea to the east and plains to the west. The droughts were in the south kingdoms, and in the other Kolanse territories. I do not know when they started, Mortal Sword, but even in the tales from my childhood I seem to recall grief lying heavy upon the settled lands.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And the Elan Plains?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. ‘Always dry, always trouble – it is why the clans fought so much. We were running out of everything. I was a child. A child gets used to things, it all feels … normal – for all the years I was with my people, it was like that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So what brought the Adjudicators to the place,’ Gesler wondered, ‘if it was already suffering?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Weakness,’ said Stormy. ‘Take any starving land, and you’ll find a fat king. Nobody’d weep at that slaughter in the throne room. Priests blathering on about justice. Must have sounded sweet, at least to start with.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye,’ Gesler agreed. ‘Still, that Spire, where they built their temple – Kalyth, you called it cursed. Why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is where a star fell from the sky,’ she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Recently?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, long ago, but round the promontory the seawater is red as blood – and nothing can live in that water.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did any of that change once the Adjudicators installed their temple?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know. I have never seen the place – please, I just don’t know. I don’t even know why we’re marching in this direction. There is nothing to the east – nothing but bones.’ She glared at Gesler. ‘Where’s your army of allies? Dead! We need to find somewhere else to go. We need—’ somewhere to hide. Ancestors forgive me . No, her fears were all too close to the surface. A score of questions could rip through her thin skin – it hadn’t taken much, had it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We don’t know that,’ Stormy said, chewing at his moustache and not meeting her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m sorry. I know .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When Gu’Rull gets back,’ Gesler said in a low tone, ‘we’ll know more. In the meantime, on we go, Destriant. No point in doing anything else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. I know. Forgive me. Forgive us all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir power was a dark, swirling stain, spinning out like a river at the head of the vast, snaking column. Gu’Rull studied the manifestation from above, where he was gliding just beneath the thick overcast which had spread down from the northwest. His wounds were healing, and he had travelled far, ranging out over the Wastelands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had observed the tattered remnants of human armies, swollen with massive trains. And south of them but drawing closer by the day another force, the ranks disciplined in their march, unblooded and, as far as such things went, formidable. Despite the commands of the Mortal Sword, neither force was of much interest to the Shi’gal Assassin. No, the knots of power he had sensed elsewhere were far more fascinating, but of them all, not one compared to that which emanated from the two human children, Sinn and Grub. Travelling there, at the very head of the Gunthan Nest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it could be called ‘Nest’ no longer, could it? There was no room, no solid, protected roost for the last clan of the K’Chain Che’Malle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven leadership had been surrendered. To three humans. There was no doubt that without them the Che’Malle would have been destroyed by the Nah’ruk. Three humans, clad in strange titles, and two children, wearing little more than rags .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many lusted after power. It was the crushing step of history, in every civilization that had ever existed. Gu’Rull had no taste for it. Better that more of his kind existed, behind every throne, to cut the throat at the first hint of mad ambition. Enough heads rolling down the ages and perhaps the lesson would finally be learned, though he doubted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin must never die. The shadows must ever remain. We hold the world in check. We are the arbiters of reason. It is our duty, our purpose .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have seen them. I have seen what they can do, and the joy in their eyes at the devastation they can unleash. But their throats are soft. If I must, I will rid the world of them . The power was sickly, a swathe of something vile. It leaked from their indifferent minds and fouled the sweet scents of his kin – their joy at victory, their gratitude to the Mortal Sword and the Shield Anvil, their love for Kalyth, the Destriant of the K’Chain Che’Malle. Their faith in a new future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut these children. They need to die. Soon .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Forkrul Assail,’ whispered Grub into Sinn’s ear. ‘The Crystal City knew them, even the Watered ones. It holds the memory of them. Sinn, they are at the centre of the war – they’re the ones the Adjunct is hunting.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-36.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
