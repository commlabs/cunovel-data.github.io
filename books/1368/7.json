Her charms are heightened by the affectation of an amorous leer, which she directs to her youthful husband, in grateful return for a similar compliment which she supposes paid to herself. This gives her face much meaning, but meaning of such a sort, that an observer being ask, ”How dreadful must be this creature’s hatred?“ would naturally reply, ”How hateful must be her love!“\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In his demeanor we discover an attempt to appear at the altar with becoming decorum: but internal perturbation darts through assumed tranquillity, for though he is plighting his troth to the old woman, his eyes are fixed on the young girl who kneels behind her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The parson and clerk seem made for each other; a sleepy, stupid solemnity marks every muscle of the divine, and the nasal droning of the lay brother is most happily expressed. Accompanied by her child and mother, the unfortunate victim of his seduction is here again introduced, endeavouring to enter the church, and forbid the banns. The opposition made by an old pew-opener, with her bunch of keys, gave the artist a good opportunity for indulging his taste in the burlesque, and he has not neglected it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A dog (Trump, Hogarth’s favorite), paying his addresses to a one-eyed quadruped of his own species, is a happy parody of the unnatural union going on in the church.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The commandments are broken: a crack runs near the tenth, which says, Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife; a prohibition in the present case hardly necessary. The creed is destroyed by the damps of the church; and so little attention has been paid to the poor’s box, that it is covered with a cobweb! These three high-wrought strokes of satirical humour were perhaps never equalled by any exertion of the pencil; excelled they cannot be.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On one of the pew doors is the following curious specimen of church-yard poetry, and mortuary orthography.\n\u003cbr\u003e These: pewes: vnscrud: and tane: in: svnder\n\u003cbr\u003e In: stone: thers: grauen: what: is: vnder\n\u003cbr\u003e To: wit: a valt: for: burial: there: is\n\u003cbr\u003e Which: Edward: Forset: made: for: him: and: his.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is a correct copy of the inscription. Part of these lines, in raised letters, now form a pannel in the wainscot at the end of the right-hand gallery, as the church is entered from the street. The mural monument of the Taylor’s, composed of lead, gilt over, is still preserved: it is seen in Hogarth’s print, just under the window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A glory over the bride’s head is whimsical.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bay and holly, which decorate the pews, give a date to the period, and determine this preposterous union of January with June, to have taken place about the time of Christmas;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “When Winter linger’d in her icy veins.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Addison would have classed her among the evergreens of the sex.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It has been observed, that “the church is too small, and the wooden post, which seems to have no use, divides the picture very disagreeably.” This cannot be denied: but it appears to be meant as an accurate representation of the place, and the artist delineated what he saw.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The grouping is good, and the principal figure has the air of a gentleman. The light is well distributed, and the scene most characteristically represented.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The commandments being represented as broken, might probably give the hint to a lady’s reply, on being told that thieves had the preceding night broken into the church, and stolen the communion-plate, and the ten commandments. “I suppose,” added the informant, “that they may melt and sell the plate; but can you divine for what possible purpose they could steal the commandments?\"—“To break them, to be sure,” replied she; —“to break them.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1452/43656.html","bookId":1368,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 2:14:59 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 2:14:59 AM"}
