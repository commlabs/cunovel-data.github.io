Even though it was dark, Lynch’s goggles could still make out this slight change in expression.

He even knew what kind of toy that coin that was stuck to Peperus’ body was. Once that kind of stuff was activated, over ten irregular metal threads would seep out and pierce into the human body. Due to it being easy to deform, after piercing a centimeter into the human body, these metal threads would change their path and ultimately form an intricate and messy sphere. If one forcefully pulled it out, it would bring with it a clump of flesh. There were drugs applied to these threads that could prevent coagulation, stimulate, numb the muscles, and heighten one’s sensitivity. In addition, it could also release minute streams of electricity to further excite one’s sensation of pain. Not only could they be used to carry out punishment, they could also effectively restrict movement.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThese little things were called demon coins, one of the Trials Division’s well known toys.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Boss, why don’t I wipe out all of these fellas too?” Lynch asked in a low voice.

Many people were already immersed within warm dreams, while even more fell unconscious from cold and hunger. During nights like these, there would always be people who died while struggling. There was also a small portion of people who didn’t need to worry about the basic necessities of life, but they were still awake, experiencing another type of struggling for survival.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNot far from dragonrider general headquarters was an enormous square shaped construct. It was three floors above the ground and four floors underneath. This was the Black Dragonriders’ comprehensive training building. One could even try out various types of infantry firearms here. Most people who used this training building were low level dragonriders and a few subordinates. Even though the fee this place charged was extremely pricey, the expenses to construct one’s own training location was still far greater than that of using public facilities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe close combat training area was divided into a large region and ten smaller compartments. In the dead of the night, there were still monotonous\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ebang bang\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003esounds ringing through this place. The two middle-aged men that were in charge of this area were already so sleepy their eyes were already starting to close, but they still had to persist with this job. In this era, being about to obtain this type of stable and relaxed job that didn’t require one to risk their life was already not easy. Every individual that had the qualifications to work here wasn’t worth provoking. As such, no matter how long their training went, they still had to accompany them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s breathing was well-distributed and long. His upper body was bare with some cloth strips tightly wrapped around him. He brandished his fists, monotonously and mechanically striking the rubber dummy in front of him. Whenever a fist descended, the rubber dummy similarly swayed backwards before bouncing back. As soon as it returned to its original position, a new fist would greet it, causing it to once again sway backwards.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNext to the dummy was a bright screen that continuously displayed the strength the dummy received. All types of data could be seen, but the most striking one was the fist power number. Every time Su’s fist landed, a tremendous 1200 kilograms of force would be displayed, with the difference in weight only detectable three digits behind the decimal point. The fist strength wasn’t the only data that remained constant; even the point of contact and swaying width remained the same.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eUnder Su’s bright, clean, and exquisite skin, one could vaguely see muscles wriggling about. A faint steam surrounded his body and slowly rose upwards. Su continued to maintain a pace of two punches per second, as if he was a robot that only knew how to punch.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu had already been here for three hours, and he had similarly punched this dummy like a robot for three hours as if he would never tire. 1200 kilograms of fist force was already equivalent to four levels of power strengthening, and in the olden era, it could easily cause even the most robust men’s chest to cave in. For Su who had only strengthened power twice, he owed this four levels of fist power to his robust fundamental constitution as well his precise control over various parts of his body.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe two middle-aged men that were in charge of this area already closed their eyes. Four levels of physical strength in the Black Dragonriders was too common. What they were shocked at was Su’s patience. However, there was a chance of any dragonrider being a monster. Forget about hitting a dummy for three hours, even if they did something else, these two still wouldn’t feel like it was strange. They didn’t know know that Su only had two levels of power strengthening, and they even more so didn’t understand how hard it was to display four levels of power with only two levels of power or what this level of strength control implied.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu could clearly sense the bones in his arms changing. More and more cracks appeared, and they were becoming more and more fine. Each time his fist landed on the dummy, the recoil would similarly shake up the cracks in his bones. In addition, when he exhausted the powerful momentum, the cracks would become more fine, and the bones’ constitution would slowly readjust. These cracks could not only conduct the force that was transmitted back, they could even disperse part of it into his muscle tissue, using the muscle tissues’ flexibility to neutralize quite a bit of the impact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e1200 kilograms of fist power was already quite close to Su’s current limit. Even if he harmed his own body as the price, he would still only be able to add a bit more power. Su struck at the dummy in front of him with constant speed and exhausted his stamina at the same pace as well, all while maintaining his fists’ speed and strength as close to the limit as possible. This was one of the most common methods of training one’s power. However, if one was going to reach Su’s level of stability and maintain it for three hours, this would be a hard feat to accomplish even for higher level dragonriders.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn reality, when the first hour had just passed, Su already felt like his body’s consumption of stamina was already at its limit, so he only wanted to continue at it a bit further. Just like that, this bit of continuation strangely continued for three hours. Along with the exhaustion of his stamina, bits of energy continuously flowed out from the tiniest of tissues to maintain these robotic and steady strikes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu already noticed the slight changes that were happening to the bones in his arms a long time ago and simply treated it as a natural transformation his body underwent when his degree of evolution reached a certain point without paying too much attention to it. It was written clearly on the Black Dragonriders’ abilities guidebook that even if the ability was injected from an ability formulation, there would still always be slight differences in every person’s genes and constitution. When one developed a high level ability, this difference would leave an even greater impact on the body’s organs. That was why strictly speaking, everyone’s abilities would be different to some extent.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu wasn’t training with single-hearted devotion.
