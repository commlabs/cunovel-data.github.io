They would have a hurried breakfast in the cafeteria and occasionally pass one another in the corridors. They communicated mainly by leaving notes in the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinner is in the fridge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The microwave is out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, I didn\u0027t have time to clean up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the three of us having dinner out Saturday night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impossible hours continued to be a punishment, testing the limits of endurance for all the residents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige welcomed the pressure. It gave her no time to think about Alfred and the wonderful future they had planned together. And yet, she could not get him out of her mind. What he had done filled her with a deep pain that refused to go away. She tortured herself with the futile game of \"what if?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if I had stayed with Alfred in Africa? What if he had come to Chicago with me? What if he had not met Karen? What if ...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a Friday when Paige went into the change room to put on her scrubs, the word \"bitch\" had been written on them with a black marker pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day when Paige went to look for her scut book, it was gone. All her notes had disappeared. Maybe I misplaced it, Paige thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t make herself believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world outside the hospital ceased to exist. Paige was aware that Iraq was pillaging Kuwait, but that was overshadowed by the needs of a fifteen-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia. The day East and West Germany became united, Paige was busy trying to save the life of a diabetic patient. Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister of England, but more important, the patient in 214 was able to walk again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat made it bearable was the doctors Paige worked with. With few exceptions, they had dedicated themselves to healing others, relieving pain, and saving lives. Paige watched the miracles they performed every day, and it filled her with a sense of pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe greatest stress was working in the ER. The emergency room was constantly overcrowded with people suffering every form of trauma imaginable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long hours at the hospital and the pressures placed an enormous strain on the doctors and nurses who worked there. The divorce rate among the doctors was extraordinarily high, and extramarital affairs were common.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom Chang was one of those having a problem. He told Paige about it over coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle the hours,\" Chang confided, \"but my wife can\u0027t. She complains that she never sees me anymore and that I\u0027m a stranger to our little girl. She\u0027s right. I don\u0027t know what to do about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has your wife visited the hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you invite her here for lunch, Tom? Let her see what you\u0027re doing here and how important it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChang brightened. \"That\u0027s a good idea. Thanks, Paige. I will. I would like you to meet her. Will you join us for lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChang\u0027s wife, Sye, turned out to be a lovely young woman with a classic, timeless beauty. Chang showed her around the hospital, and afterward they had lunch in the cafeteria with Paige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChang had told Paige that Sye had been born and raised in Hong Kong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you like San Francisco?\" Paige asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small silence. \"It\u0027s an interesting city,\" Sye said politely, \"but I feel as though I am a stranger here. It is too big, too noisy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" But I understand Hong Kong is also big and noisy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I come from a small village an hour away from Hong Kong. There, there is no noise and no automobiles, and everyone knows his neighbors.\" She looked at her husband. \"Tom and I and our little daughter were very happy there. It is very beautiful on the island of Llama. It has white beaches and small farms, and nearby is a little fishing village, Sak Kwu Wan. It is so peaceful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was filled with a wistful nostalgia. \"My husband and I were together much of the time, as a family should be. Here, I never see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige said, \"Mrs. Chang, I know it\u0027s difficult for you right now, but in a few years, Tom will be able to set up his own practice, and then his hours will be much easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom Chang took his wife\u0027s hand. \"You see? Everything will be fine, Sye. You must be patient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" she said. There was no conviction in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they talked, a man walked into the cafeteria, and as he stood at the door, Paige could see only the back of his head. Her heart started to race. He turned around. It was a complete stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChang was watching Paige. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Paige lied. I\u0027ve got to forget him. It\u0027s over. And yet, the memories of all those wonderful years, the fun, the excitement, the love they had for each other ... How do I forget all that\u0027? I wonder if I could persuade any of the doctors here to do a lobotomy on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige ran into Honey in the corridor. Honey was out of breath and looked worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everything all right?\" Paige asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney smiled uneasily. \"Yes. Fine.\" She hurried on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney had been assigned to an attending physician named Charles Isler, who was known around the hospital as a martinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Honey\u0027s first day of rounds, he had said, \"I\u0027ve been looking forward to working with you, Dr. Taft. Dr. Wallace has told me about your outstanding record at medical school. I understand you\u0027re going to practice internal medicine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. So, we\u0027ll have you here for three more years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey began their rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first patient was a young Mexican boy. Dr. Isler ignored the other residents and turned to Honey. \"I think you\u0027ll find this an interesting case, Dr. Taft. The patient has all the classic signs and symptoms: anorexia, weight loss, metallic taste, fatigue, anemia, hyperirritability, and uncoordination. How would you diagnose it?\" He smiled expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney looked at him a moment. \"Well, it could be several things, couldn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Isler was watching her, puzzled. \"It\u0027s a clear-cut case of - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other residents broke in, \"Lead poisoning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Dr. Isler said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney smiled. \"Of course. Lead poisoning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Isler turned to Honey again. \"How would you treat it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney said evasively, \"Well, there are several different methods of treatment, aren\u0027t there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second resident spoke up. \"If the patient has had long-term exposure, he should be treated as a potential case of encephalopathy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Isler nodded. \"Right. That\u0027s what we\u0027re doing. We\u0027re correcting the dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, and giving him chelation therapy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Honey. She nodded in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next patient was a man in his eighties. His eyes were red and his eyelids were stuck together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have your eyes taken care of in a moment,\" Dr. Isler assured him. \"How are you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, not too bad for an old man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Isler pulled aside the blanket to reveal the patient\u0027s swollen knee and ankle. There were lesions on the soles of his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Isler turned to the residents. \"The swelling is caused by arthritis.\" He looked at Honey. \"Combined with the lesions and the conjunctivitis, I\u0027m sure you know what the diagnosis is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney said slowly, \"Well, it could be ... you know ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Reiter\u0027s syndrome,\" one of the residents spoke up. \"The cause is unknown. It\u0027s usually accompanied by low-grade fever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Isler nodded. \"That\u0027s right.\" He looked at Honey. \"What is the prognosis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The prognosis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other resident replied. \"The prognosis is unclear. It can be treated with anti-inflammation drugs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" Dr. Isler said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made the rounds of a dozen more patients, and when they were finished, Honey said to Dr. Isler, \"Could I see you for a moment alone, Dr. Isler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Come into my office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were seated in his office, Honey said, \"I know you\u0027re disappointed in me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must admit that I was a little surprised that you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney interrupted. \"I know, Dr. Isler. I didn\u0027t close my eyes last night. To tell you the truth, I was so excited about working with you that I... I just couldn\u0027t sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her in surprise. \"Oh. I see. I knew there had to be a reason for ... I mean, your medical school record was so fantastic. What made you decide to become a doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney looked down for a moment, then said softly, \"I had a younger brother who was injured in an accident. The doctors did everything they could to try to save him ... but I watched him die. It took a long time, and I felt so helpless. I decided then that I was going to spend my life helping other people get well.\" Her eyes welled up with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s so vulnerable, Isler thought. \"I\u0027m glad we had this little talk.\" Honey looked at him and thought, He believed me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-6.html","bookId":2365,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM"}
