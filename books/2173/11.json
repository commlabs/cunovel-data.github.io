has been exposed as a lie by many species but never with more telling effect than by the Gowachin on Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Here, they showed us the \"Walden Fallacy\" in ultimate foolishness, explaining:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Given any species which reproduces by genetic mingling such that every individual is a unique specimen, all attempts to impose a decision matrix based on assumed

said, found himself on sand at just past Dosadi\u0027s midmorning.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He looked up, seeking his first real-time view of the God Wall, wanting to share the Dosadi feeling of that enclosure.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;All he saw was a thin haze, faintly silver, disappointing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The sun circle was more defined than he\u0027d expected and he knew from the holographic reproductions he\u0027d seen that a few of the third-magnitude stars would be filtered out at night.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What else he\u0027d expected, McKie could not say, but somehow this milky veil was not it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Too thin, perhaps.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It appeared insubstantial, too weak for the power it represented.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visible sun disk reminded him of another urgent necessity, but he postponed that necessity while he examined his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall white rock?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yes, there it was on his left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d warned him to wait beside that rock, that he\u0027d be relatively safe there.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Under no circumstances was he to wander from this contact point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can tell you about the dangers of Dosadi, but words are not enough.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Besides, the place is always developing new threats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings he\u0027d learned in the briefing sessions over the past weeks reinforced the warning.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The rock, twice as tall as a Human, stood only a few paces away, massive and forbidding.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He went over and leaned against it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Sand grated beneath his feet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He smelled unfamiliar perfumes and acridities.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The sun-warmed surface of the rock gave its energy to his flesh through the thin green coveralls they\u0027d insisted he wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie longed for his armored clothing and its devices to amplify muscles, but such things were not permitted.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Only a reduced version of his toolkit had been allowed and that reluctantly, a compromise.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had explained that the contents would be destroyed if anyone other than himself tried to pry into the kit\u0027s secrets.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Still, they\u0027d warned him never to open the kit in the presence of a Dosadi native.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The most dangerous thing you can do is to underestimate any of the Dosadi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie, staring around him, saw no Dosadi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar off across a dusty landscape dotted with yellow bushes and brown rocks, he identified the hazy spires of Chu rising out of its river canyon.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Heat waves dizzied the air above the low scrub, giving the city a magical appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie found it difficult to think about Chu in the context of what he\u0027d learned during the crash course the Gowachin had given him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Those magical fluting spires reached heavenward from a muck where \"you can buy anything . . . anything at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch\u0027s aides had sewn a large sum in Dosadi currency into the seams of his clothing but, at the same time, had forced him to digest hair-raising admonitions about \"any show of unprotected wealth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jumpdoor attendants had recapitulated many of the most urgent warnings, adding:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may have a wait of several

be most alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay clear of any Dosadi natives except your contacts.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Above all, don\u0027t even appear to threaten

safest thing to do.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Anyone who\u0027d dare to nap out there would have to be damned well protected.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There\u0027d be some risk, of course, but there always is on Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But they\u0027d be awfully leery of anyone casual enough to nap out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, McKie glanced around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharp whistlings and a low rasp like sand across wood came from behind the tall rock.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Quietly, McKie worked his way around to where he could see the sources of these noises.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The whistling was a yellow lizard almost the color of the bushes beneath which it crouched.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The rasp came from a direction which commanded the lizard\u0027s attention.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Its source appeared to be a small hole beneath another bush.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie thought he detected in the lizard only a faint curiosity about himself.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Something about that hole and the noise issuing from it demanded a great deal of concentrated attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething stirred in the hole\u0027s blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lizard crouched, continued to whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ebony creature about the size of McKie\u0027s fist emerged from the hole, darted forward, saw the lizard.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Wings shot from the newcomer\u0027s sides and it leaped upward, but it was too late.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;With a swiftness which astonished McKie, the lizard shot forward, balled itself around its prey.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A slit opened in the lizard\u0027s stomach, surrounded the ebony creature.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;With a final rasping, the black thing vanished into the lizard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this time, the lizard continued to whistle.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Still whistling it crawled into the hole from which its prey had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things are seldom what they seem to be on Dosadi,\" McKie\u0027s teachers had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered now what he had just seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whistling had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lizard and its prey reminded McKie that, as he\u0027d been warned, there had not been time to prepare him for every new detail on Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He crouched now and, once more, studied his immediate surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny jumping things like insects inhabited the narrow line of shade at the base of the white rock.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Green (blossoms?) opened and closed on the stems of the yellow bushes. The ground all around appeared to be a basic sand and clay, but when he peered at it closely he saw veins of blue and red discoloration.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He turned his back on the distant city, saw far away mountains:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a purple graph line against silver sky.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Rain had cut an arroyo in that direction.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He saw touches of darker green reaching from the depths.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The air tasted bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, McKie made a sweeping study of his surroundings, seeking any sign of threat.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Nothing he could identify.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He palmed an instrument from his toolkit, stood casually and stretched while he turned toward Chu.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;When he stole a glance at the instrument, it revealed a sonabarrier at the city.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Absently scratching himself to conceal the motion, he returned the instrument to his kit.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Birds floated in the silver sky above the sonabarrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy a sonabarrier? he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would stop wild creatures, but not people.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His teachers had said the sonabarrier excluded pests, vermin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The explanation did not satisfy McKie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings are seldom what they seem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the God Wall, that sun was hot.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie sought the shady side of the rock.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Seated there, he glanced at the small white disk affixed to the green lapel at his left breast:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;OP40331-D404.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was standard Galach script, the lingua franca of the ConSentiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They speak only Galach on Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They may detect an accent in your speech, but they won\u0027t question it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch\u0027s people had explained that this badge identifed McKie as an open-contract worker, one with slightly above average skills in a particular field, but still part of the Labor Pool and subject to assignment outside his skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This puts you three hierarchical steps from the Rim\" they\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027d been his own choice.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The bottom of the social system always had its own communications channels flowing with information based on accurate data, instinct, dream stuff, and what was fed from the top with deliberate intent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Whatever happened here on Dosadi, its nature would be revealed in the unconscious processes of the Labor Pool.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In the Labor Pool, he could tap that revealing flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be a weaver,\" he\u0027d said, explaining that it was a hobby he\u0027d enjoyed for many years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe choice had amused his teachers.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had been unable to penetrate the reason for their amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is of no importance right now.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;One choice is as good as another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d insisted he concentrate on what he\u0027d been doing at the time, learning the signal mannerisms of Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Indeed, it\u0027d been a hectic period on Tandaloor after Aritch\u0027s insistence (with the most reasonable of arguments) that the best way for his Legum to proceed was to go personally to Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In retrospect, the arguments remained persuasive, but McKie had been surprised.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;For some reason which he could not now identify, he had expected a less involved overview of the experiment, watching through instruments and the spying abilities of the Caleban who guarded the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie was still not certain how they expected him to pull this hot palip from the cooker, but it was clear they expected it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch had been mysteriously explicit:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are Dosadi\u0027s best chance for survival and our own best chance for . . . understanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey expected their Legum to save Dosadi while exonerating the Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was a Legum\u0027s task to win for his client, but these had to be the strangest circumstances, with the client retaining the absolute power of destruction over the threatened planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Tandaloor, McKie had been allowed just time for short naps.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Even then, his sleep had been restless, part of his mind infernally aware of where he lay:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the bedog strange and not quite attuned to his needs, the odd noises beyond the walls - water gurgling somewhere, always water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d trained there as a Legum, that had been one of his first adjustments:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the uncertain rhythms of disturbed water.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gowachin never strayed far from water.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Graluz - that central pool and sanctuary for females, the place where Gowachin raised those tads which survived the ravenous weeding by the male parent - the Graluz always remained a central fixation for the Gowachin.

Gowachin?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;How did this Wreave female differ from other Wreaves?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Where were her loyalties?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What was the \u0027Wreave Bet\u0027?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis led McKie into another avenue never sufficiently explored:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what Human capabilities had led the Gowachin to him?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dogged persistence?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A background in Human law?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The essential individualism of the Human?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no sure answers to these questions, no more than there were about the Wreave.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Her presence continued to fascinate him, however.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie knew many things about Wreave society not in common awareness outside the Wreave worlds.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were, after all, integral and valued partners in BuSab.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In shared tasks, a camaraderie developed which often prompted intimate exchanges of information.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Beyond the fact that Wreaves required a breeding triad for reproduction, he knew that Wreaves had never discovered a way to determine in advance which of the Triad would be capable of nursing the offspring.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This formed an essential building stone in Wreave society.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Periodically, this person from the triad would be exchanged for a like person from another triad.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This insured their form of genetic dispersion and, of equal importance, built countless linkages throughout their civilization.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;With each such linkage went requirements for unquestioning support in times of trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Wreave in the Bureau had tried to explain this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take, for example, the situation where a Wreave is murdered or, even worse, deprived of essential vanity.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The guilty party would be answerable personally to millions upon millions of us.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Wherever the triad exchange has linked us, we are required to respond intimately to the insult.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The closest thing you have to this, as I understand it, is familial responsibility.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We have this familial responsibility for vendetta where such affronts occur.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You have no idea how difficult it was to release those of us in BuSab from this . . . this bondage, this network of responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gowachin would know this about the Wreaves, McKie thought.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Had this characteristic attracted the Gowachin or had they chosen in spite of it, making their decision because of some other Wreave aspect?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Would a Wreave Legum continue to share that network of familial responsibility?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;How could that be?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Wreave society could only offend a basic sensibility of the Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Frog God\u0027s people were even more . . . more exclusive and individual than Humans.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;To the Gowachin, family remained a private thing, walled off from strangers in an isolation which was abandoned only when you entered your chosen phylum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he waited beside the white rock on Dosadi, McKie reflected on these matters, biding his time, listening.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The alien heat, the smells and unfamiliar noises, disturbed him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He\u0027d been told to listen for the sound of an internal combustion engine.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Internal combustion!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But the Dosadi used such devices outside the city because they were more powerful (although much larger) than the beamed impulse drivers which they used within Chu\u0027s walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fuel is alcohol.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Most of the raw materials come from the Rim.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It doesn\u0027t matter how much poison there is in such fuel.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They ferment bushes, trees, ferns . . . anything the Rim supplies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sleepy quiet surrounded McKie now.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;For a long time he\u0027d been girding himself to risk the thing he knew he would have to do once he were alone on Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He might never again be this alone here, probably not once he was into Chu\u0027s Warrens.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He knew the futility of trying to contact his Taprisiot monitor.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch, telling him the Gowachin knew BuSab had bought \"Taprisiot insurance,\" had said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even a Taprisiot call can penetrate the God Wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the event of Dosadi\u0027s destruction, the Caleban contract ended.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie\u0027s Taprisiot might even have an instant to complete the death record of McKie\u0027s memories.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Might.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That was academic to McKie in his present circumstances.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Calebans owed him a debt.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Whipping Star threat had been as deadly to Calebans as to any other species which had ever used jumpdoors.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The threat had been real and specific.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Users of jumpdoors and the Caleban who controlled those jumpdoors had been doomed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Fannie Mae\" had expressed the debt to McKie in her own peculiar way:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The owing of me to thee connects to no ending.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch could have alerted his Dosadi guardian against any attempt by McKie to contact another Caleban.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie doubted this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch had specified a ban against Taprisiot calls.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But all Calebans shared an awareness at some level.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If Aritch and company had been lulled into a mistaken assumption about the security of their barrier around Dosadi . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, McKie cleared his mind of any thoughts about Taprisiots.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This wasn\u0027t easy.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It required a Sufi concentration upon a particular void.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There could be no accidental thrust of his mind at the Taprisiot waiting in the safety of Central Central with its endless patience.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Everything must be blanked from awareness except a clear projection toward Fannie Mae.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie visualized her:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the star Thyone.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He recalled their long hours of mental give and take.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He projected the warmth of emotional attachment, recalling her recent demonstration of \"nodal involvement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, he closed his eyes, amplified that internal image which now suffused his mind.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He felt his muscles relax.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The warm rock against his back, the sand beneath him, faded from awareness.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Only the glowing presence of a Caleban remained in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who calls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words touched his auditory centers, but not his

was echoing and portentous, not at all like the probing curiosity he always sensed in Fannie Mae.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He fought to regain that first clear image.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The inner glow of a Caleban contact returned.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He supposed there might be something worshipful in this experience.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You were never absolutely certain of a Caleban\u0027s meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s McKie, friend of Fannie Mae,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glow within McKie dimmed, then:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"But you occupy a point upon Dosadi\u0027s wave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a familiar kind of communication, one to which McKie could apply previous experience in the hope of a small understanding, an approximation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the God Wall permit me to contact Fannie Mae?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords echoed in his head:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One Caleban, all

body then, the trembling flesh, the zombie-like trance state which went with Caleban or Taprisiot contact.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The question had no meaning to him, but the body contact was real and it threatened to break off communication.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Slowly, McKie fought back to that tenuous mind-presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Jorj X.
