But to the five Tribes that once made up the great Crow Divinity Tribe, a Tribe which had passed down legacies for many years, well, Spirit Stones…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere something they had a lot of!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey might not have enough to keep a large flying machine going for many years, but it would at least get them half way. After the arrival of the violet rain, the spiritual energy grew scarce to the point where it virtually didn’t exist. Therefore, Spirit Stones, which were in fact an expendable resources, became the only way to replenish spiritual energy. Therefore, some were wasted in this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, the fact that there were not many Cultivators in the Crow Divinity Tribes meant that the consumption was reduced by quite a bit. At the moment, there were plenty remaining. Currently, the main problem was how to acquire a large flying machine that wasn’t powered by the spiritual energy of Cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked around thoughtfully at members of the Crow Divinity Tribes as they trudged along. “Right now, many Tribes are migrating through the Western Desert North region. A treasure like that… would certainly be incredibly expensive if it were to be purchased!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was already the tenth day of the Crow Divinity Tribes’ migration. These mountains were where the Tribes had lived from generation to generation. Other than occasional Tribe members who went out to travel in the great lands of the Western Desert and never came back, or a few random other members, most members of the Crow Divinity Tribes never left the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain continued to fall heavily. Everyone, both Cultivator and ordinary Tribe member alike, had to do everything possible to prevent the rainwater from touching them. Otherwise, their life force would slowly be burned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the neo-demons were the same, although they were able to hold out much longer. Anything that was alive, though, would slowly die if exposed to the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the thorns were broken off of the vines, they became something like bark, which were then used to make articles of clothing that resembled woven, rush raincoats. These coats became an essential item to the Tribe members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe migration included not just the thousand members of the Crow Divinity Tribes, but also Meng Hao’s neo-demon horde. Thankfully, the neo-demons could survive inside Meng Hao’s bag of holding, which made things much easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a special trait of neo-demons. Unfortunately, Cultivators could not survive inside of a bag of holding. Therefore, the road they had to travel along during the migration was difficult and packed with frustrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky above was dark and filled with the sound of falling rain. They moved in silence along a road that seemed to have no end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA month later, they entered the borders of the mountains. Meng Hao led the way, wearing a woven rush raincoat like everyone else. It draped about him like a cloak, covering his entire body. He also wore a wide, conical hat, which made his appearance very bleak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wild Giant panted as it walked along behind Meng Hao. It’s massive frame was too big to fit inside a bag of holding, so it was forced to walk along in the outside world. Gu La walked next to the Wild Giant, coughing, his face pale. His life force was dimming, but luckily, it showed no signs that it would sputter out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in this violet rain, he, like the other Cultivators, were gradually becoming like mortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne could imagine, that before too long, they would be Cultivators who could not perform any magic whatsoever. At that time, they… truly would be mortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black crow suddenly appeared. It flew through the air, shrinking in size until it was small enough to land on Gu La’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu La looked at the bird for a moment, and then said, “There’s a Tribe that’s been following us for three days….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crow Scout Tribe Greatfather turned to look behind them. Frowning, he said, “It’s most likely a local Tribe called the Grand Fusion Tribe. They are a mid-sized Tribe….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Outlander beast, the parrot, and the meat jelly had once again fused into one body. At the moment, it was the voice of the parrot which said, “Do you want Lord Fifth to go screw them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao didn’t reply. He continued to walk, pulling out a jade slip. The jade slip was simple and unsophisticated; it was something he had acquired from Yi Chenzi’s bag of holding, a description of the blood sacrifice magic that Yi Chenzi had cultivated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also described the method to cultivate the black moon totem, as well as his escape art. In addition, it detailed a vicious magic known as the Blood Sacrifice Soulsearch, a brutal and ruthless technique that left the victim alive but crippled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao had been studying it thoughtfully during the traveling, and now understood it quite well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the others saw Meng Hao acting like this, they didn’t say anything more. The group of a thousand continued to walk for seven or eight days until they reached what looked like a sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore precisely, it was an enormous lake. This was the very edge of the mountains, and before the rain had come, was actually an enormous basin that led out of the mountains. Before, it had been filled with neo-demons as well as lush vegetation. Now, it was nothing more than waters stretching out as far as the eye could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked out at the lake for a moment, then turned. “They’re here,” he said coolly. The other turned with vigilant eyes to stare back in the direction they had just come from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe members of the Crow Divinity Tribes scattered out, creating a wide, open space. Their eyes flickered with displeasure, especially the members of the Crow Fighter Tribe. After Meng Hao’s return, he had branded them with his Frost soil totem, causing their Cultivation bases to advance, returning them to where they had been before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot too much time passed before footsteps could be heard, mixed with the sound of grunts and growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tribe of roughly three thousand people appeared, many of whom were mounted on fierce beasts that looked somewhat like lions. They charged across the ground as they approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong their numbers were five Nascent Soul Cultivators, one of whom was in the mid Nascent Soul stage. All five of them were covered with totem tattoos, although their faces were somewhat wan and thin. Nonetheless, they radiated fierceness as they approached. The thousands of Cultivators all came to a stop about three hundred meters away to stare darkly at the Crow Divinity Tribes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather stepped forward, his eyes gleaming coldly. He had been nearing death before, but after returning, Meng Hao had give him some medicinal pills to restore his life force. His voice was cold as he said, “You must be the Grand Fusion Tribe. We are the Crow Divinity Tribe. You’ve been following us for some time. If you just happen to be traveling in the same direction, then please be on your way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that his Cultivation base was at the mid Nascent Soul stage, the sound of it echoed out completely clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one responded to the Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather’s words. Of their five Nascent Soul Cultivators, the one with the mid Nascent Soul stage Cultivation base was an old man wearing a black robe, who carried a Feng Shui compass in his hand. After glancing at the compass, he suddenly looked up at the crowd of people in front of him. Eventually, his gaze came to rest on Meng Hao, whose Cultivation base was obscured. In this man’s estimation, the person who was the greatest threat to him personally was the Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather. After a moment’s thought, he clenched his jaw. Killing intent and greed instantly shone in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That guy has it! As for everyone else, do not leave a single one alive!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conjunction with his words, the Tribe members at his side roared as they pulled out Spirit Stones from which they quickly absorbed spiritual energy. The neo-demons they rode also roared, and then the entire group of three thousand people charged toward Meng Hao. The five Nascent Soul Cultivators flew forward, using power from their Cultivation bases that they were normally reluctant to part with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered as he gave a cold snort. He waved his right hand, instantly causing the power of Frost soil to magically appear. A frigid wind blasted out along with Frost soil. He instantly moved forward with a minor teleportation, reappearing directly next to one of the early Nascent Soul Stage Cultivators. He waved a hand, causing the power of his Fire-type totem tattoo to boil out. Attacked with both freezing cold and burning hot, the early Nascent Soul stage Cultivator’s body instantly exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight immediately shocked the entire Grand Fusion Tribe, causing their expressions to fill with astonishment. This was something that they couldn’t possibly have predicted would happen. Meng Hao’s attack had exterminated one of their Priests!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-robed old man gasped, and his heart started to pound. However, he had little time for consideration. He burst into action, heading directly toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cultivators of the Crow Divinity Tribes chose this moment to launch their assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao attacked swiftly and violently. He teleported, reappearing directly in front of the black-robed old man. His right hand lifted up, and a flame sea roared up. Then he lowered his hand, and the golden rain of this Metal-type tattoo appeared. As it shot forward, the black-robed old man performed an incantation with two hands. Shockingly, a nine-headed liger suddenly appeared in front of him, roaring as it shot toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao gave another cold snort and punched out with his right hand. A boom echoed through the air as the nine-headed liger exploded into pieces. A cold wind gusted out as Meng Hao appeared again in front of the black-robed old man. The old man’s face immediately fell. He pulled out a Spirit Stone to replenish his spiritual energy, shooting backward at the same time. Meng Hao’s eyes flickered and he pointed out with his finger. The black-robed man’s face filled with astonishment as he realized that his body and even his Cultivation base had been sealed. Meng Hao approached calmly and took the Feng Shui compass out of the man’s hand. He looked it over, whereupon his face grew dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the Feng Shui compass was a bright dot, indicating Meng Hao’s location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you get this thing?” asked Meng Hao coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-robed old man had recovered control of his body. Panting, but not speaking a word, he backed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not going to tell me? Well, I’ll just keep it.” With that, he slapped his bag of holding. Instantly, his neo-demon horde emerged. “Other than the neo-demons, leave none of them alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThousands of neo-demons blotted out the sky and shot forward, whereupon miserable shrieks began to fill the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this great migration in the Western Desert, it was a situation of “if you don’t die, then I don’t live.” There was no room for benevolence. If they showed mercy, the Crow Divinity Tribes would be destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment when Meng Hao had decided to protect the Crow Divinity Tribes, his heart had grown cold regarding any enemy who attacked them. Since they had chosen to attack, they would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he strode forward, his body suddenly turned into a green smoke as he used Yi Chenzi’s escape art. He immediately appeared in front of the black-robed old man. His lifted his hand and the Lotus Sword Formation appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter returning from the Realm of the Bridge Ruins, the power of Time had returned to its normal level. However, the world was now one in which the power of extermination and the lack of spiritual energy were constantly making almost undetectable attacks on the life force of Cultivators. The power of the Lotus Sword Formation spread out, instantly causing a sixty-year cycle worth of time to fade away from the black-robed old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is….” his face immediately fell, and his mind reeled. His life force was already weak enough as it was. For a sixty-year cycle worth of time to vanish made him even older than he had been before. He was also shocked to discover that while the amount of spiritual energy he consumed when employing divine abilities could not be replenished fast enough via Spirit Stones, this young man against whom he was matched hadn\u0027t used even a single Spirit Stone at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was with incredible speed that Meng Hao neared him. His right hand lifted up and suddenly a strange, mysterious glow appeared that resembled a black moon. Even as the old man’s life force was vanishing, the moon came to rest on the top of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soulsearch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bloodcurdling scream could be heard coming from the old man’s mouth. His body shook violently, and just as he was trying to struggle, the Lotus Sword Formation once again spun, sucking away yet another sixty-year cycle of life. The old man’s eyes went wide as he felt his memories slipping away like flowing water as Meng Hao looked them over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face suddenly grew dark and icy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Dennis Liu, Hoang Nguyen, Michael Harrison and Anonymous\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-477\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-479\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-478","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:25 AM"}
