Still, Lash held on to some illusion that he was in control and not flying blind, chasing a trail so faint it might qualify as nonexistent after a Covenant capital ship and the UNSC destroyer In Amber Clad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single spark lit the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got one,\" Lieutenant Yang cried. \"Mass spectrometer pegs it as titanium-50. Consistent with UNSC battle plate. One of ours, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good.\" Commander Lash clapped his hand on Yang\u0027s shoulder. \"Keep watching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed off and drifted back to the captain\u0027s chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLash felt uneasy sitting here; it really belonged to Captain [glesias, but he was in rehab back on Earth. Radiation treatment for six months. This war would probably be over by then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat and clicked the harness on. For better or worse he was in charge now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably for the worse, because this mission was a cross between a wild-goose chase and pure suicide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis prowler, Dusk, had been close enough to act when In Amber Clad had entered the Covenant capital ship Slipspace rift as it left New Mombassa. They were one of four UNSC ships with charged Slipspace capacitors, and nimble enough to make the transition before the overpressure wave generated by an in-atmosphere transition crushed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda Keyes was the ballsiest officer in the fleet to go after that Covenant ship on her own. Was she nuts? Or trying to live up to the legendary reputation of her father?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLash would never know what that felt like. His dad had been a welder on the Cradle … at least before the Cradle had been destroyed at Sigma Octanus earlier this year. Dad had always wanted to be a hero. He\u0027d gotten his wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dusk—with the two frigates Redoubtable and Paris, and the corvette Coral Sea— had approximated the entrance vector of the Covenant ship, hoping to find out where they were headed, that or assist In Amber Clad in blowing her to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been caught in the wake of the Covenant craft and accelerated to many times the maximum velocity of any UNSC ship in Slipspace. A lucky break. They\u0027d have never caught it otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnically \"acceleration\" and \"velocity\" were the wrong terms. They didn\u0027t map to the eleven nondimensions of Slipspace, but Commander Lash had never gotten the knack of thinking so abstractly. He left that to his NAV Officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat this wake effect meant in concrete terms was Covenant ships traveled geometrically faster from point to point than their ships. One more strategic advantage the aliens possessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Lash surveyed his bridge crew. His first. Lieutenant Commander Julian Waters, sat next to him, scanning engine output semantics, his forehead furrowed with worry lines. At NAV sat Lieutenant Bethany Durruno running diagnostics, nodding off. She had ice in her veins, and sadly that calm-under-disaster fortitude was wasted in Slipspace. At the sensor station was Lieutenant Joe Yang; his youngest officer had seen more battle in the last four years than most saw in a lifetime, and he had suffered for it. Back in Engineering was Lieutenant Commander Xaing Cho, doing his job and the job of three other technicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had all pulled double shifts, and the waiting was started to wear at them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dusk had been caught between rotations when the Covenant hit Earth. The ship normally had a crew of ninety They had to make do with a complement of forty-three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they were alone now, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Redoubtable, the Paris, and the Coral Sea, with their larger engines, had moved ahead in the Slipstream wake. They\u0027d passed out of limited COM range an hour ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sensor hits correlated, sir,\" Yang said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA graph appeared on Commander Lash\u0027s display, plotting frequency and temporal distributions of their ion trail. It was a power-law decay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the last ion they could expect. The trail was as cold as liquid helium. That meant either the Dusk had lost In Amber Clad … or it had dropped out of Slipspace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand by for transition,\" Lash said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis officers snapped to, readying the Dusk to drop into the normal interstellar vacuum— or into the middle of a star or planet, for all they knew. There had been no time to plot a course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Lash took a deep breath. \"Jettison the HORNET mines,\" he told Lieutenant Commander Waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it. Pull denotation codes and send then down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaters sighed explosively and nodded his head. \"Yes, sir. Understood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis junior bridge officers exchanged a look, but they all knew they had to lose the nukes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were going to remain stealthed, no matter what the cost, and fissile materials exiting Slipspace lit up with Cherenkov radiation—a signal flare to any Covenant ship within light-minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mines away,\" Waters whispered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-19.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
