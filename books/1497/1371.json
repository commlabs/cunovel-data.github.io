All he could do was sigh. Even though he was Xun Er’s father, it was the first time that he had seen Xun Er be this intimate with a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should have met Xiao Xuan, right?” Gu Yan faintly asked. He stepped into the moonlight and slowly walked toward the embarrassed Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was a little startled. He hesitated for a moment before replying, “Yes, I’ve met him…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am able to sense the bloodline strength within your body. It is likely that it should be the last bloodline of the Xiao clan…” Gu Yuan clicked his tongue and sighed. “It is indeed not easy for Xiao Xuan to do such a thing. He is willing to turn himself into that in order to help the Xiao clan retain its final seed…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was silent. He naturally understood that the Heavenly Tomb was an enormous prison. As energy bodies, Xiao Xuan and the others were just prisoners within it. Although they were able to live in another form, they had to endure an endless loneliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elder Gu Yuan, is there no way to help him escape?” Xiao Yan’s voice was a little soft as he inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the very least, even I do not have the ability to do so. It is rumored that the Heavenly Tomb was created by an elite Dou Di a long time ago. If one wishes to break the rules within it and allow Xiao Xuan to escape, perhaps… one must also reach that level.” Gu Yuan shook his head. Xiao Yan could clearly sense the complicated expression on Gu Yuan’s face when he mentioned the words ‘Dou Di.’ This class was like a heavy burden that pressed on the souls of the people from the ancient clans. It drove all of them to put in all their effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dou Di…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan bitterly laughed. This kind of legendary existence was really too unimaginable. Even Gu Yuan in front of him, who could be called one of the true top experts in the Dou Qi continent, would likely only have a heart filled with fear and respect because of these two simple words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does this world truly have an existence known as Dou Di?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan became quiet when he heard Xiao Yan’s question. A moment later, he finally muttered to himself, “This… who knows. One would be like a god overlooking the continent at that level. Everyone will likely be ant-like existences in their[a] eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Their[b]?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan narrowed his eyes. However, he was not aware what Gu Yuan’s words meant. Was this so-called “their” merely illusory or did it truly refer to some existence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan waved his large hand while Xiao Yan was considering the answer. He said, “You will be leaving tomorrow. Be careful. Given your current strength, those Elders from the Gu clan are unlikely to make things overly difficult for you. However, due to the matter of the Ling clan, Xun Er will not be able to leave the Gu Realm for the time being…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan nodded and replied, “Does Elder Gu Yuan think that the change in the Ling Realm this time around is the result of a man-made or a natural disaster?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan frowned in the face of Xiao Yan’s question. He replied, “We are not very sure about this, but I think that they have met with a great trouble. The chances of it being caused by man is very low. After all, the Ling clan’s strength could be ranked among the super factions on the continent. Even the Gu clan has difficulty forcing them to such an extent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if it was the Hun clan?” Xiao Yan slowly asked. Back in the Heavenly Tomb, Xiao Xuan had said that the Hun clan was far too mysterious. Even though the Xiao clan and the Hun clan had been enemies for many years, the members of the clan did not dare to say that they completely understood this mysterious clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan was startled upon hearing this. Immediately, he shook his head once again and replied, “It is likely impossible. If the Hun clan wished to force the Ling clan until such an extent, it would definitely have to launch a big campaign. Therefore, it is impossible for the Gu clan to not receive any information. Additionally, even if the Hun clan possess such an ability, why would they become enemies with a faction as powerful as the Ling clan for no reason? Although the Ling clan has declined during these years, it is still not a faction that is easy to deal with…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan slightly nodded. However, the doubt in his heart increased. If it was not the Hun clan, what other faction could force the Ling clan into such a state? Could it really be due to some natural disaster?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright. These matters are not very related to you. I think that the truth will come out after an investigation…” Gu Yuan waved his hand. He looked at the quiet bamboo house and continued in a soft helpless voice, “Additionally, you should not forget about the matters you promised me… Xun Er’s bloodline is very important to the Gu clan. If any problems occur, those old fellows will become furious even if I do not do anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was a little embarrassed when he heard these words. He bitterly smiled and immediately nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright it is already quite late. You should rest. You still have to leave tomorrow morning…” Gu Yuan nodded after seeing Xiao Yan nod. His body gradually paled before completely disappearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan helplessly sighed as he stared at the spot where Gu Yuan disappeared. He clicked his tongue and felt as though he had not expressed himself sufficiently...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the morning sunlight scattered over this vast space the next morning, this mountain range, which had been quiet for the night, once again became lively. The sound of rushing wind continued to appear…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan and Xun Er walked out of the bamboo house when the mountain range became noisy. After which, they flew to the edge of the mountain range where a couple of enormous battleships were suspended in the air. Dark clouds rolled around, giving them a mighty appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s eyes swept around him after he had appeared in the air. He found quite a number of familiar figures. Ling Quan, Lin Xiu, and the other top experts among the younger generation of the Gu clan were present. However, these people dodged his eyes with some fear. Currently, Xiao Yan’s strength had soared to the peak of an eight star Dou Zun. This allowed them to understand that they had lost any qualification to be arrogant in front of Xiao Yan. After all, when Xiao Yan was only a five star Dou Zun back then, he was able to defeat the eight star Dou Zun Gu Yao. Even less needed to be said now that his strength had soared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, the only ones among the younger generation of the Gu clan who could fight with him were Xun Er or perhaps Gu Qing Yang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan detected a pair of eyes focusing on him while he was scanning the area. He immediately shifted his eyes before finally pausing them on a mountain a short distance away. A figure was standing against the wind at that spot. His black and white hair revealed his identity, Gu Yao, who bad been defeated by Xiao Yan half a year ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of those two met in the air. Surprisingly, no rich sparks erupted. Gu Yao’s face was indifferent, and he slowly nodded to Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was a little stunned when he saw Gu Yao’s slightly friendly action. Xiao Yan smiled and nodded in return. From the looks of it, Gu Yao had walked out of the shadow of his failure. A young person of his talent would definitely be groomed by the Gu clan. His future potential would be extraordinary. Xiao Yan would have one less hidden trouble if he could maintain a good relationship with him. It was ultimately better for Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this Gu Yao also had feelings for Xun Er, he could be considered the type of person who could accept whatever came his way. This kind of character was rather upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ao ao!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an increasing number of people hurrying over, a horn sounded from the battleships in the sky. Clearly, they were about to send all these people out of the Gu Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure suddenly walked through the air when Xiao Yan was planning to say goodbye to Xun Er. Xiao Yan swept his eyes over, only to discover that this person was Yao Xing Ji of the Yao clan. He knit his brows and indifferently asked, “Is there something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan did not really like this Yao Xing Ji in his heart. Hence, he was not as courteous to Yao Xing Ji as he was to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Xing Ji curled his lips when he noticed Xiao Yan’s indifferent question. His heart felt quite displeased, but due to Xiao Yan’s current strength, he did not utter any mocking words. He flicked his finger and an emerald-colored jade token shot toward Xiao Yan. “This is the invitation of our Yao clan’s clan ceremony. Don’t frown. Your teacher will require it. He understands what the clan ceremony of the Yao clan represents. Trust me, he will come regardless of what kind of unhappiness he has with the Yao clan,…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan received the emerald jade token. He stared at Yao Xing Ji for a moment but did not return the token. Instead, he put the jade token into his Storage Ring. Subsequently, he cupped his hands together, “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This time, I was not able to compete with you in terms of alchemy skills. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to do so next time…” Yao Xing Ji cupped his fist. After which, he ceased saying anything else as he moved and swiftly boarded a battleship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan played with some thoughts after seeing Yao Xing Ji leave. Regardless of what this so-called Yao clan’s clan ceremony was, he would deliver the message to teacher first. Whether he would attend would completely depend on teacher’s intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xun Er, it’s time. I should be leaving…” Xiao Yan turned his head, looked at Xun Er beside him, and softly spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take care…” Xun Er slightly smiled and gently replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan nodded with a grin. He did not delay any longer as he waved his hand and turned around. His body transformed into a light figure that leaped onto a battleship in a free and easy manner. Finally, he disappeared in front of everyone’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXun Er sighed in a lonely manner as she watched Xiao Yan’s disappearing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ao ao!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an increasing number of people rushing onto the battleships, the siren once again resounded. Immediately, dark clouds churned and the battleships slowly shook. Finally, they turned into dark clouds in front of numerous eyes. They contained a shocking momentum as they swiftly flew toward the exit of Gu Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[a]Their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[b]Should use their in the paragraph above for this to make more sense.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1370\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1372\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1371","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
