I could see anger in them. “You want to know why? I haven’t been able to do anything because I’m stuck here taking care of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I just hear this bastard right? Did he just say he’s STUCK here taking care of me? I felt my blood pressure rise as my heart felt like it had been stabbed with a knife. He realized what he said because he turned towards the window again and ran his hands through his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stuck, you’re not stuck here Connor, I didn’t f**king ask you to come here; I didn’t f**king ask you to take care of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned towards me, “Baby I didn’t mean it like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thoughts running through my insane mind were that he felt trapped. “Get out of here,” I screamed as I picked up a glass and threw it at him. He ducked and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, if that’s what you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned just like that and walked out as I flinched when I heard the apartment door slam shut. My phone quickly signaled a text message from Mason, “Everything ok? We just saw Connor storm out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers typed frantically, “I’m fine; we’ll talk tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dialed Peyton and let out a sigh of relief when she answered, “Hi Elle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t even get the words hello out first. “Connor and I got into an argument and he stormed out,” I started to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked what we argued about and I told her the stuck comment he made. I was appalled how quickly she proceeded to yell at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know I love you Elle, but I’m telling you this for your own good. You need to get your head out of your ass and start thinking about someone else. I know you’re sick and I’m sorry for that, in fact, I hate that I’m not there with you, but you need to step out of your, oh pity me self, and think about what Connor is going through. You think it’s easy for him to watch the woman he’s only loved go through cancer? He needs to vent to you know, you’re not the only one who gets to scream and be pissed off at the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t speak. I was frozen with the reality that Peyton was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elle, are you still there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, “Yes and thank you, as always you’re right.” I could feel her smile over the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome that’s what best friends are for. Now cut that man some slack and think about his feelings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up and climbed out of bed. I walked over to the shattered glass, sat on my knees and started picking up the pieces. How could I not realize Connors feelings? How could I not stop wallowing in my own pity for just a minute and see how hard this was for him? I sat there staring at the pieces of glass as he took my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop, you’re going to cut yourself,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a deep breath and slowly turned my head so I was looking at him, “I’m sorry, I just…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my face in his hands, “I know baby and its ok.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No it’s not Connor, I know this is hard for you and I’m so sorry.” His soft lips brushed against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s ok, I didn’t mean what I said; it came out wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI melted into his arms as he wrapped them around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you didn’t, I overreacted.” He kissed the top my head. I looked up at him with pleading eyes and a pouty mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at my lips and lightly nipped them, “I bought you something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and helped me up. He walked to the dresser and handed me a brown bag. I smiled excitedly as I opened the bag and peeked inside. I looked up at him and his big smile as he took my hand and led me to the bed. I dumped the brown bag in the middle and stared at the pile of chocolate that looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I figured that would make you feel better,” he said with caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are amazing and absolutely perfect, I love you,” I said as I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him on top of me. “I know something else that will make me feel better,” I smiled as he hovered over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bit his bottom lip. “Are you sure? Are you up for it?” I lifted my head and kissed him passionately, that was the only sign he needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 37\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out of bed the next morning and stumbled into the kitchen for some already brewed coffee. Connor was sitting on the couch with his cup and typing something into his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey babe, I hope I didn’t wake you?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope not at all, what are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to talk, come sit down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach got all panicky, his tone was serious. I sat down next to him and kissed him on his cheek. He smiled and put his phone down on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go back to New York today for a meeting regarding the sale of a company I’ve been interested in. I want you to come back with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him and twisted my face, “Can I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not, you don’t get your next set of injections till next month. We’ll go back today, stay through Thanksgiving and come back before your next treatment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile grew across my face, “I’ll get to see Peyton, she’ll be so excited and my apartment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor frowned, “You’re not staying in that box you call an apartment; you’re living with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a pouty look, “Do I have to stay in the guest bedroom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed as he touched my cheek, “There is no way you are staying in the guest bedroom; I want you in my bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took his private jet back to New York. I ran to Denny as I saw him leaning up against the black limo. I threw my arms around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Denny, I’ve missed you, how are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and twirled me around, “Look at you Elle, you look great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Connor smirking as he put our bags in the trunk. “I’m sorry Mr. Black let me get those.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No Denny its ok, she’s been dying to see you, she missed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenny looked at me and gave me a hug, “I’ve missed you to, and it’s nice to see your bright smiling face here again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid into the back of the limo and Connor followed interlacing our fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called Peyton and told her I was back in town and I needed her help with something for you, so she’s coming by the penthouse around 7 tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t tell her I was here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tightened the grip on my hand, “No, I was going to let you surprise her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my head on his shoulder, “I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived back at the penthouse around five. Connor took our bags to the bedroom while I went to the kitchen to get some water. I went up the stairs and headed straight to his room. I’ve only been in his room one time and that was when I brought him home from the club. The door was open and I walked in; I gasped at what I saw. Connor turned around and looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I forgot you haven’t been in here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes glanced to the right, then above the bed and then to the left side of the room. Each wall was displayed with my paintings from the art gallery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bought my paintings?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his hands up, “Please tell me you aren’t mad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the painting that hung over his bed, the one of the man and woman dancing under the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not mad; I just want to know why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “Look at them Elle, they’re beautiful. It was my way of being able to be close to you when you weren’t around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his waist, “Thank you, it means a lot.” He let out a sigh as if he was relieved there wasn’t going to be a battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to his bed and slightly chuckled remembering the night I struggled to get his clothes off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s so funny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just remembering the night you were passed out on this bed and I was straddled over you taking off your clothes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sexy smile captivated me as he laid down on the bed and spread out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t remember you doing that and I want to, so I thought you could reenact it for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip as I pulled my shirt over my head and threw it on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Umm, I don’t think you did that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seductively smiled, “No I didn’t, but I’m going to make it a little more interesting this time.” I unbuttoned my pants and took them off, throwing them on top of my shirt. I straddled him and slowly unbuttoned his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck it, I need you now,” he said. Before I knew it I was lying on my back and he was on top of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed in the kitchen while Connor went to the elevator and greeted Peyton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ok Connor, what is so important that you need my help with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped from the kitchen. “That would be me!” I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton shrieked as she ran to me and we hugged jumping up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my god Elle! I’m so happy you’re here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor smiled, “I’ll let you two catch up. I’ll be in my office if you need anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took Peyton to the kitchen and poured us each a glass of wine. We moved ourselves to the comfort of the couch in the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, tell me what’s going on with you and Henry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled her big Peyton smile and told me they were doing great and she thought he was going to propose at Christmas. We talked for a few hours before Henry called her and asked her when she was coming home. She took my hands and held them in front of her as I noticed her eyes start to tear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are my best friend and I hate that you have to fight cancer again. I want you to know that I will always be here for you no matter what. You will beat this Ellery Lane or I will kick your ass, do you understand me?” I hugged her and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes Peyton, I will beat this because you scare me.” She let out a laugh and walked out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked upstairs to find Connor in bed sound asleep. I changed into my nightshirt and climbed into his king size bed. I watched his chest slowly rise and fall with each peaceful breath. I envisioned this being my future. I laid down and snuggled against him. He stirred and put his arm around me bringing me in closer to him. It was the perfect end to the perfect day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe week went by rather quickly as I visited the soup kitchen and the art gallery. Connor took me shopping and bought me some new clothes. I insisted on paying for them myself, but he just laughed and told me to stop being silly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Connor was at the office, I would occupy my time painting and hanging out with Peyton. Sal called me to let me know that two of my paintings sold and that I needed to paint more. I asked Connor if he bought them and he just laughed.
