Evans was embroiled in chaos and blackness. There was another scream. One of the flashlights bounced on the floor and rolled, pointing in a corner. In the shadows Evans saw a large dark figure attack Sarah, who screamed and kicked. Without thinking, Evans threw himself against the attacker, grabbing an arm in a leather jacket. He could smell the man\u0027s beery breath, hear him grunting. Then someone else pulled him off, slamming him to the ground, and he was kicked in the ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled away, banging against the furniture, and then a new, deep voice held up a flashlight and said \"Move away now.\" Immediately the attacker stopped fighting with them, and turned to this new voice.

Another man got up and turned toward the flashlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a crackling sound and the man screamed and fell backward.

The men were beginning to cough, and wake up. \"Sanjong, let\u0027s get them to the front door.\" They hauled the intruders to their feet, and half-led, half-dragged them out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans was alone with Sarah. \"How did Kenner get in the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was in the basement.

A single sheet of paper, neatly folded, was inside. She stared at it in disbelief.
