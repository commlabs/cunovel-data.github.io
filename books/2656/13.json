If I go back up to my room, you\u0027ll leave without me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re not safe dressed as you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll be perfectly safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mind me, Marjorie,” he gritted out. “And stop this stubbornness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mind you? Mind you?” Her heart beat double time with her pique; she felt it glitter in her eyes, suffuse her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye.” He spun to face her but then froze. He consumed her with his gaze, and her skin seemed to tighten over her body in response to the predatory scrutiny. Finally, he spoke again, and it came out a snarl. “Mind me”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promise to mind every word you say, the moment we set foot through these doors.” She placed a hand on the heavy iron latch as though ready to begin then and there. “But as for my clothing, folk might recognize me from the work I do at Saint Machar, so no, Cormac,” she said, backing against the door to shove it open. “A costume makes sense, and a costume I shall have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe growled in frustration. “You\u0027re stubborn and impudent and… “\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And? And what, Cormac? I\u0027ll have you know I am still the same Marjorie after all these years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you\u0027re not the same Marjorie,” he shouted. Taking a deep breath, he devoured the sight of her hips, her legs. He spoke again, this time more subdued. “Believe me, the years have brought quite a few changes. Changes that aren\u0027t nearly hidden enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sputtered, battling embarrassment, shame, and hot awareness. She remembered an older, greater shame, from that day so long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At least find yourself a cloak,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. I\u0027ll wear a cloak.” She\u0027d weather his blame for the loss of his brother, but she\u0027d not abide his intolerance. She would help find Davie. She would redeem herself. “But I don\u0027t trust you won\u0027t leave while I search for one. You may ask Angus to fetch me a man\u0027s cloak. One of his should suffice.” And, in the end, she was glad she had it. The thick wool of the man\u0027s bonnet and cloak didn\u0027t just warm her, they made her feel safer, too; the docks were a much grittier and more frightening place than she\u0027d anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d reached the head of North Pier, stone pilings topped with rotting wooden planks that stretched like an arm into the sea. A sloop had newly docked, and he wanted to investigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind whipped off the water and found its way straight to her bones. The place smelled thick and briny, like sea creatures caught and left to rot. The morning sky was as gray as the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was thankful it was daylight and thankful she had Cormac by her side. She thought about wee Davie. He was somewhere out there, facing all this alone. She was a grown woman, in daylight, and still the docks made her nervous. Young Davie, alone for days, and God only knew where? The boy would be terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait here,” Cormac told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gripped his arm. “Can\u0027t I come with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have the look of smugglers about them.” He nodded to the end of the pier. “I\u0027d feel better if you stayed back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it safe for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barked a cynical and incredulous laugh. “Aye, lass, safe enough. Now truly,” he added, scanning the area one last time, “you\u0027ll be fine for a few minutes. I\u0027d not have a boatload of smugglers lay eyes on you. One clout on my head, and they\u0027d have you on board before you knew what they were about. And then it\u0027d be you I\u0027d have to come searching for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought terrified her. She\u0027d never felt in true peril before in her life. At least not since the day Aidan was taken. But then she registered his last sentence. “You\u0027d come to search for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come for you?” Something gentle flickered in his eyes for the briefest of moments. “How could I not?” The words warmed Marjorie to her soul. If he\u0027d come for her, he didn\u0027t hate her. He might bear her blame, or resentment, but somewhere down deep he still valued her. “Fine, then. I\u0027ll wait here. But don\u0027t be long.” With a brisk nod, he was off down the pier, and in no time she was watching him talk to a shadowy figure on board the sloop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rustling of activity slowly emerged behind her, but Marjorie pretended to be engrossed only in a single point at the end of the dock. It wasn\u0027t so much an act, either. She refused to let Cormac out of her sight. And to think she\u0027d threatened to come down here by herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA legless man on a cart rolled himself in front of her, staring up for a time before moving on. Shivering, she pulled the cloak\u0027s hood lower over her head. She wondered if, when they returned safely home, she should swallow her pride and thank Cormac for making her wear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren\u0027t you a pretty laddie?” The voice was a slurred rasp, coming from over her shoulder. There was a laugh in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart kicked against her chest. She felt the presence of two men standing behind her. She refused to tear her eyes away from Cormac. Surely he\u0027d be done soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand brushed at her cloak. “What brings a pretty boy like you to the quays?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you looking at, laddie?” the second man asked, coming to stand shoulder to shoulder by her. Eyeing the sloop, he told his companion, “If laddie here has business with those runners, he\u0027s got money in his purse.” She ducked her head. So these men knew about the smugglers. Might they know something else? But how could she ask?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis companion came to stand on her other side. She could see both of them in her peripheral vision, one hulking, one tall and rangy. They smelled of ale gone foul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll wager we\u0027ve got a wee lordling, fancying himself in for some sport, eh, Fergal? You don\u0027t mind if we have a look-see, do you now?” A hand tugged the hood from her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, would you look here? \u0027Tisn\u0027t a laddie at all!” The tall man gripped her chin and gave it a wiggle, and she bit her lip not to scream. “What\u0027s a lovely crumpet like yourself doing here? Why don\u0027t you give us a peek under your coat, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not a crumpet.” She pulled from his grip, fighting to regulate her breathing, refusing to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac. Come back to me, Cormac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers were numb from the grip she had on the front of her cloak. She definitely didn\u0027t want these men seeing her in the trews, which felt suddenly, scandalously too tight. “And what do you know of smugglers?” she challenged. “Do you know of men in these parts who… smuggle people?” The men laughed. “Smuggle people?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice of a third rose dark and menacing over the others. “What\u0027s a wee thing like you want to know about smuggling people?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerror prickled up the backs of her legs. Three men. How many more were there? She felt like a piece of raw meat that\u0027d been tossed into a pit of dogs. The scent of blood was in the air, and there\u0027d be no stopping the rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe poured her whole self into staring at Cormac, willing him to look at her. And look he did. He instantly stiffened, seeing the gathering around her. He said some final thing to the man on the boat and strode directly toward her. He rested a hand on his sword, and though the gesture was nonchalant, it was loaded with meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought crumpling with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And who\u0027s this, then?” one of the men wondered, spotting him coming up the pier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorry slithered cold up her spine. What had she gotten them into? Surely these men had knives or even guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac was armed, but how would he fare against three men? They\u0027d kill him and then take her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmuggling people indeed. Cormac\u0027s words came back to her, something about a lass getting her own self snatched from the docks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould she not do anything right? Because of her, Aidan had been taken. Would Cormac be killed because of her, too? She fisted her hands even tighter in her cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seems we\u0027re not the only ones interested in our fine lass here. But she\u0027s so quiet.” Someone tugged the bonnet from her head. Waves of long, light-brown hair spilled out, and they all laughed. “Such a fine thing you are, I might just smuggle you away myself. Why so quiet, luwie? You won\u0027t be so quiet when I get you under me.” Cormac walked straight to her. His face was a mask of barely checked rage, and she knew a flicker of hope. They just might manage a way out of there. Their eyes locked, and he seemed to be trying to communicate something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gentlemen,” he said in a low, tight voice. He didn\u0027t take his eyes from her. “I see you\u0027ve discovered our little secret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold menace in his voice made her tremble. Shaking his head imperceptibly, he mouthed, “Hush.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” one of the men demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, perhaps we\u0027d like a wee cut of what you\u0027re about,” another added with a nod toward the smuggler\u0027s boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What we\u0027re about?” Cormac\u0027s voice was steady and calm. “Lass, are you ready to tell them what we\u0027re about?” Her every muscle vibrated with tension. She didn\u0027t understand what he was trying to tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a scraping of steel as one of the men unsheathed a blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready?” Cormac asked her again quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReady? What could he possibly mean, ready?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the rasping voice stepped just behind her. Marjorie shot him a backward glance. He looked mean, with black hair and murder in his eyes. He spoke through gritted teeth. “I said, who are you?” Stricken with terror, she looked back to Cormac. The blue-gray of his stormy eyes grew eerily tranquil. They didn\u0027t waver from her. “Ready, Ree?” he asked in the barest whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought not to gape, wondering who this stranger before her really was. He\u0027d disarmed her, and her voice cracked, “Aye, I\u0027m rea—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Duck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie\u0027s knees buckled instinctively, and in the space\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof a heartbeat, Cormac\u0027s calm transformed into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething else, something feral and raging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d ducked, leaving Cormac facing the man who\u0027d been standing behind her. A sword appeared in Cormac\u0027s hand, and in one stroke, he slashed the man\u0027s throat and swung around to thrust at another. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-13.html","bookId":2656,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM"}
