I always thought he was weird. Who knew it was because he was an alien.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips tipped up at the corners. “You’re handling all of this well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused, fork halfway to her pretty mouth. “There are minutes when I think I’ve got a handle on all of this, and then minutes where I think I’m actually insane and in a padded room, so I really don’t think I’m doing that great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena was handling it better than 98% of the population would. “What did Mel say they were arguing over—the brothers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something about Project Eagle and kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was this project?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a little shake of her head, she patted her fork on a piece of chicken. “She didn’t say and I didn’t ask because I thought she lost her mind and…” She took a deep a breath. “I feel terrible about that. If I believed her, maybe I would’ve done something different and Mel—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She wouldn’t be alive, Serena. No matter what you did. By not believing her, you probably saved your life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flicked up and met mine for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an endless amount of guilt in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat and sorrow for her friend. “Things are so freaking fuzzy. I feel like I wasn’t paying attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I’m forgetting things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might be.” And I needed her to remember, because then I could lure the officers back here and get her on her way. That’s what I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least that’s what I needed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I went with the one thing I knew that would make her focus. “If you can remember something, remember more, then it’s going to help your friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena’s gaze sharpened. “How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was such a bastard. “If the Luxen were up to something and she was silenced because of what she overheard, and not so much what she saw, the senator and his sons might not be held accountable for her death, but they will be dealt with. And that’s better than nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is,” she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer attention turned to the woods, head shaking a little. Time passed, and I didn’t pester her. “I know there was—Pennsylvania!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pennsylvania?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting toward me, she nodded eagerly. “Yes. She mentioned something about the kids being kept in Pennsylvania.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. “Kids being kept in Pennsylvania?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuxen kids or…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t elaborate, but she said Phillip and Elijah were arguing about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had to be more, especially if the Luxen bypassed the DOD and took out Mel. What could the galactic glowworms be up to? Were they stashing Luxen kids away from the watchful eye of the DOD?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould be possible. There were hidden Arum and Luxen communities. Few, but they existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena blew out a frustrated breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m trying. I really—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt as frustrated as she looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit down on her lip and turned her gaze to her plate. “This was nice,” she said eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The dinner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprise shuttled through me and I heard myself saying, “I don’t do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity marked her brown eyes, darkening them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt reminded me of when she’d been aroused. Her eyes had turned the color of rich, untainted soil. Then again, for me everything pretty much circled back around to being aroused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said, dropping one leg off the chair. “I can’t remember the last time I ate with someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Surely it can’t be that long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It has been very long ago.” I watched her set her plate aside and pick up the wineglass. “Full?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stuffed,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said, eyeing me above the rim of her glass. “Seriously, you do…socialize, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour kind does do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, my gaze settling on the darkening sky. Within moments, the sun set and twilight vanished into night. “We really don’t have a need to socialize.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But everyone—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone who is human, Serena. I am not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heartbeat passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the other Arum? The ones I ran into at the gazebo? They were together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When we are together, we are not socializing. We are mostly aligning ourselves with who we think is more powerful. It’s about survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot friendship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sounds really lonely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t get lonely.” My gaze followed Serena’s slender finger along the rim of her glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why…why do you keep staring at me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI barked out a short laugh. “Am I not allowed to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess you are, but you’re always watching me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like watching you. It’s your hair.” Did I just say that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My hair?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had. “It’s the color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small smile appeared on her lips. “So, what do you do when you’re not working?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that before answering, actually considered it. “I like to work with my hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena’s gaze slid to mine. “Why do I have a feeling there’s an innuendo behind that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking of where my hands hand been last night, I cracked a grin. Her cheeks heated and the red shaded the aura around her. I bet if I slipped my hand between her thighs right now she’d be wet and ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a lot to not find out. “I like to build things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth opened, and then her eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait. Do you like to carve?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brow arched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you make the gazebo by the main part of the lodge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I didn’t say anything, a wide smile broke out across her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did! Oh my God, Hunter, that is amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted in the seat. “Not really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is! I wish I could do something like that. The design is so amazingly intricate. Do you do that a lot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena continued to pepper me with questions about the woodwork I did, and while I wished I hadn’t said a damn thing, I answered the questions without thinking, like she had my balls in a pair of vise grips. Yes, I had built the gazebo from scratch. It had taken an entire summer. No, I didn’t find it hard. Yes, I built other things. That had made me think of the horses with Serena’s breasts and I’d laughed, which had brought another smile to Serena’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, Serena was a really, really good-looking woman, but when she smiled? Hell, she was hands down beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the lull of conversation, Serena sat up and pointed at the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh look! Is that a falling star? Jesus. I’ve never seen one that close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes searched out the trailing flash of white light zooming down to Earth at an ungodly speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinct fired, causing my skin to tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot to my feet. “That is not a falling star.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Fear lanced her voice. “Is it one of them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Serena?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?” She was on her feet now, coming to my side. “It’s one of them, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to her. “Go inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she hesitated, I leaned down, my lips close to hers as I spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go inside, Serena.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I pulled away, Serena didn’t move. Shit. I had a feeling she was going to stand right out here and argue with me until she got herself killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping my voice low, I ushered her back toward the door. “It is one of them and you need to be inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No buts.” I shoved her inside. “Keep the doors locked and the lights off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t answer the door for anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that I closed the door, shutting her inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeparated by glass, I met Serena’s stare, willing her to listen to me. Then finally she reached out and the click of the lock being turned broke the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took very little time for me to find the “falling star.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving among the shadows, faster than the wind could carry, I ended up on the other side of the lake, deep in the thick woods of Monongahela National Forest and behind the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowing down, I moved soundlessly as the man walked out from between two tall elms. He was dressed in black, as if he sought to hide himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather ironic considering the bright white light outlining the human form gave him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey there,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fancy meeting you all the way out here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man spun around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock splashed across his face. “Arum…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Luxen, ” I mimicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe Luxen demanded, hands flexing at his sides. “How could I not sense you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, that is strange, isn’t it?” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Luxen was bold. I appreciated that. “I should be able to sense you,” he said. The pupils of his eyes started to burn bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is that possible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cocked my head to the side. “Even if I had the desire and the time to go into that, I wouldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the Luxen’s pupils were as bright as diamonds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over his shoulder toward the cabins, and then his gaze settled on me. “Why are you here, so close to the colony? You wouldn’t dare to venture where you’re sorely outnumbered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d dare to go wherever I damn pleased, but that was beside the point. “I have a question for you, Rainbow Brite.” I drifted a scant inch closer. “Why are you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think to question me?” The Luxen’s form began to shimmer in anger. “You’re nothing but a lower life-form—a bottom feeder compared to us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, Luxen were such pompous asses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was bored with this. As long as I’d lived here, Luxen never crossed the mountain. They were forbidden by the DOD, for obvious reasons. If one was here, he was here for Serena, which begged the question as to how they had discovered Serena’s whereabouts, but I wasn’t stupid enough to believe that the Luxen would willingly talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will destroy you and then I’ll—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blah, blah bullshit,” I cut in, smirking. “I’ve heard it all before and the end is always the same. You talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe fight. I feed. You die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Luxen dropped its human skin and took its true form. Blinding light illuminating the dark forest, a shape of a man spun forward, light pulsing with energy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-19.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
