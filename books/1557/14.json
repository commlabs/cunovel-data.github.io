But others things, the important stuff, did not change too much. Loren fell into a time portal as she entered. She felt the high school tingle in her belly, the constant state of insecurity; the need for both approval and rebellion churned inside of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knocked on Mother Katherine\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a young girl sitting in the office. She wore the same school uniform that Loren had so many years ago, the white blouse and tartan skirt. God, she\u0027d hated that. The girl had her head down, clearly post-Mother Katherine berate. Her stringy hair hung down in front of her face like a beaded curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine said, \"You may go now, Carla.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoulders slumped, head still lowered, Carla slinked off. Loren nodded as she passed, as if to say, I feel for ya, sister. Carla did not meet her eye. She closed the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine watched all of this with a look both bemused and disheartened, as though she could read Loren\u0027s mind. There were stacks of bracelets, all different colors, on her desk. When Loren pointed to them, the bemusement vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those bracelets belong to Carla?\" Loren asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dress code violation, Loren thought, fighting off the desire to shake her head. Man, this place will never change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t heard about this?\" Mother Katherine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heard about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bracelet\"- she took a deep breath-\"game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine closed her eyes. \"It\u0027s a recent... the word would be fad, I believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The different bracelets... I don\u0027t even know how to say this... the different colors represent certain acts of a sexual nature. The black one, for example, is supposed to be... uh, for one thing. Then the red one...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren held her hand up. \"I think I get the picture. So the girls wear them as some kind of, I don\u0027t know, level of achievement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not here about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girls like Carla wear the bracelets around the boys. If the boy can grab the bracelet off the girl\u0027s arm, she must then, well, perform the act that corresponds with the bracelet color.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me you\u0027re kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine gave her a look as heavy as the ages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old is Carla?\" Loren asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sixteen.\" Mother Katherine pointed to another set of bracelets as if afraid to touch them. \"But I took this set off an eighth grader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing to say to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine reached behind her. \"Here are the phone logs you requested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building still had that chalk-dust musk Loren had always associated, until just now, with a certain sort of adolescent naivete. Mother Katherine handed her a small stack of papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eighteen of us share three phones,\" Mother Katherine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six of you to a phone, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine smiled. \"And they say we don\u0027t teach math anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren looked at Christ on the cross behind the Mother Superior\u0027s head. She remembered an old joke, one she heard when she first got here. A boy is getting all Ds and Fs in math so his parents send him to Catholic school. On his first report card, his parents are shocked to see their son getting straight As. When his parents ask him why, he says, \"Well, when I went into the chapel and saw that guy nailed to a plus sign, I knew they were serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine cleared her throat. \"May I ask a question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they know how Sister Mary Rose died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re still running tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all I can tell you right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Loren who waited. When Mother Katherine turned away, Loren said, \"You know more than you\u0027re saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About Sister Mary Rose. About what happened to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you learned her identity yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But we will. Before the end of the day, I\u0027d bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine straightened her back. \"That would be a good start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s nothing else you want to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct, Loren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren waited a beat. The old woman was... lying would be too strong a word. But Loren could smell evasion. \"Did you go through these calls, Mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. I had the five sisters who shared the phone with her go through them too. Most were to family members, of course. They called siblings, parents, some friends. There were some to local businesses. They order pizza sometimes. Chinese food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought nuns had to eat, uh, convent food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough,\" Loren said. \"Any numbers that stuck out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine\u0027s reading glasses dangled from a chain. She slid them onto the end of her nose and beckoned for the sheets. Loren handed them back to her. She studied the first page, licked her finger, moved to the second. She took out a pen and circled something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave the sheet back to Loren. The number had a 973 area code. That would put it in New Jersey, no more than thirty miles from here. The call had been made three weeks ago. It lasted six minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren spotted the computer on the credenza behind Mother Katherine\u0027s desk. It was weird to think about, the Mother Superior surfing the Web, but it truly seemed as though there were very few holdouts anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I borrow your computer?\" Loren asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren tried a simple Google search on the phone number. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you looking up the number?\" Mother Katherine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the link on the Verizon Web page, the number is unlisted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren looked back at her. \"You tried already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I looked up all the numbers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" Loren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just to be certain nothing was overlooked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was very thorough of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine nodded, kept her head high. \"I assume that you have sources to track down unlisted numbers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to see Sister Mary Rose\u0027s quarters now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was pretty much what you\u0027d expect- small, stark, white walls of swirling concrete, one large cross above a single bed, one window. Very dormitory. The room had all the warmth and individuality of a Motel Six. There was almost nothing of a personal nature, nothing that told you anything about the room\u0027s inhabitant, almost as if that were Sister Mary Rose\u0027s goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The crime-scene technicians will be here in about an hour,\" Loren said. \"They\u0027ll need to dust for prints, check for hairs, that kind of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine\u0027s hand went slowly to her mouth. \"Then you do think Sister Mary Rose was...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t read into it, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone trilled. Loren picked it up. It was Eldon Teak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, sweetums, you coming by today?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In an hour,\" she said. \"Why, what\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found the current owner of our silicone breast manufacturer. SurgiCo is now part of the Lockwood Corporation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The huge one in Wilmington?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere in Delaware, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you give them a call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it did not go well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told them we had a dead body, a serial number on a breast implant, and that we needed an ID.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t release the information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. They blathered on and on and used the term \u0027medical privacy\u0027 a whole lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bullsh-\" Mother Katherine\u0027s lips pursed. Loren caught herself. \"I\u0027ll get a court order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re a big company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll cave on this. They just want legal protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll take time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about that. Eldon had a point. The Lockwood Corporation was out of state. She\u0027d probably need a federal court judge to issue a subpoena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something else,\" Eldon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At first they seemed to have no problem with any of it. I called down, spoke to someone, she was going to look up the serial number for me. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s routine, but it really shouldn\u0027t be a big issue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then some lawyer with a bigwig-sounding name called back and gave me a very terse no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren thought about it. \"Wilmington\u0027s only, what, two hours from here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way you drive, maybe fifteen minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking of testing out that theory. You have the name of Mr. Bigwig Lawyer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got it here somewhere. Oh, wait, yes, Randal Horne of Horne, Buckman and Pierce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call Mr. Horne. Tell him I\u0027m driving down to serve his ass a subpoena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have a subpoena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up and placed another call. A woman answered the phone. Loren said, \"I need an unlisted number looked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name and badge number, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren gave it. Then she read the unlisted phone number Sister Mary Rose had called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please hold,\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Katherine pretended to be busy. She looked in the air, then across the room. She fiddled with her prayer beads. Through the phone Loren heard fingers clacking a keyboard. Then: \"Do you have a pen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren grabbed a stubby golf pencil from her pocket. She took a gas receipt and flipped it over. \"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The number you requested is listed to a Marsha Hunter at Thirty-eight Darby Terrace, Livingston, New Jersey.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-14.html","bookId":1557,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM"}
