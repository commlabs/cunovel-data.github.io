Her tone of voice suggested she was challenging him to disagree with her. \"No, there isn\u0027t any shame in being afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked relieved. Did she need his approval, then? Caine wondered about that possibility a long minute, then remarked, \"Now I know how you got those bruises on your shoulders.

The remaining members of the Tribunal couldn\u0027t risk the chance of you finding the pirate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was the possibility that Pagan would be able to convince you that she didn\u0027t have anything to do with your brother\u0027s death.

How in God\u0027s name are we going to find the bastards? We have absolutely nothing to go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong, Colin,\" Caine said. \"We have quite a bit of information to start with. We know that Hammond, the Tribunal\u0027s director, was a legitimate department head. The three men he recruited were Ice, Fox, and Prince. Now only one or two are still living, correct? And one or both are Willburn\u0027s directors. Willburn, by the way, has to be leading a duel life.

Willburn was protecting his backside, Colin, and neither file had any substantial information that could be checked out. Security was given as the reason, of course. By the way, you both were given medals for valor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did they bother?\" Colin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To appease,\" Caine answered. \"Our father\u0027s a duke, Colin. Willburn couldn\u0027t just let you disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo many questions would be asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Nathan?\" Colin asked. \"Why did they bother honoring him after his death? His father was already dead and there weren\u0027t any other Wakerfields with a title. Did they want Jade to be appeased?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine shook his head. \"You\u0027re forgetting Nathan\u0027s other numerous titles,\" Caine said. \"He\u0027s also the Marquess of St. James, remember? The Tribunal must have considered all the ramifications if they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade that barbaric faction suspicious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did forget about the St. James men,\" Colin announced. He turned to grin at Nathan. \"You don\u0027t talk much about that side of your family, Nathan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you?\" Nathan replied dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin laughed. \"This isn\u0027t the time for levity,\" Jade muttered. \"Besides, I\u0027m certain all those stories about the St. James men are pure exaggeration. Why, underneath all that grufFness, they\u0027re really very kind men. Aren\u0027t they, Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Nathan\u0027s turn to laugh. \"In a pig\u0027s eye,\" he drawled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade gave him a good frown for being so honest. Then she turned her attention back to Caine. \"Did you go to the ceremony honoring Colin and Nathan?\" she asked. \"Was it lovely? Were there flowers? Was it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea sizable group . . . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t attend the ceremony,\" Caine interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shame on you,\" she announced. \"You missed your own brother\u0027s . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, I was too angry,\" Caine interrupted again. \"I didn\u0027t want to listen to speeches or accept any medals on Colin\u0027s behalf. I let my father have that duty. I wanted . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Revenge,\" Colin interjected. \"Just like the time you went after the Bradley brothers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter making that remark, Colin turned to explain the incident to Nathan. Jade grew impatient again. \"I would like to get back to our original topic,\" she announced. \"Have you come up with any solutions yet, Caine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I think I have a sound plan to take the jackals off my trail. It\u0027s worth a try, anyway, but that\u0027s only one threat. We still have to worry about Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Colin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin, we\u0027re dealing with two separate issues here. I\u0027m one target, yes. We must assume they know I won\u0027t give up looking for Pagan, their convenient scapegoat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what does that have to do with Jade?\" Colin asked. \"They can\u0027t possibly know she\u0027s Pagan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine let out a sigh before answering. \"Let\u0027s start at the beginning. It\u0027s obvious that the other two members of the Tribunal knew Fox had saved the letters. Since they couldn\u0027t locate them, they did the next best thing. They used their man, Willburn, to recruit you, Nathan. What better way to keep an eye on Fox\u0027s son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t wait for Nathan to respond to that statement, but continued on. \"I imagine your rooms at Oxford were searched more than once, weren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan nodded. \"They had to be pretty certain you had the letters. For a time, you were the only logical candidate. Your sister was too young, and Harry had already taken her away. Now then,\" he added with a nod. \"No one could believe that Fox would have trusted Harry with the letters. His appearance alone would lead anyone to that decision. They couldn\u0027t know Fox had known Harry for some time either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade felt like sighing with relief. Caine was being so logical now. She felt as though he\u0027d just taken the burden away from all of them. From the look on his brother\u0027s face, she concluded that Colin was feeling much the same relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" Nathan prodded when Caine remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They waited,\" Caine answered. \"They knew eventually the letters would surface. And that\u0027s exactly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat happened. Harry gave the letters to Jade. She showed them to Nathan and he shared the information with you, Colin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know all this,\" Nathan snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush, Nathan,\" Jade whispered. \"Caine\u0027s being methodical now. We mustn\u0027t interfere with his concentration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Colin told Willburn about the letters, he went to the Tribunal, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so we were sanctioned,\" Colin said. \"I trusted the wrong man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you trusted the wrong man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re still after the letters,\" Nathan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine\u0027s nod was quick. \"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin sat up a little straighten \"Now that they think we\u0027re dead, Nathan, there can only be one other person who could have the damning evidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look at Jade. \"They know you have them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t be certain,\" Jade argued. \"Or they would have killed me,\" she added. \"That\u0027s why they\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estill searching, why your lovely house was destroyed, Nathan, the reason your fine carriage was shredded too . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, they don\u0027t have anywhere else to search. There\u0027s only one avenue open to them now,\" Nathan interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll try to take her,\" Colin predicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Nathan agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to let anyone near her,\" Caine announced then. \"But I\u0027m not convinced they\u0027re certain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe has the letters. Either one of you could have hidden them before you were taken. It must be making them crazed, though, waiting for the letters to surface again. They\u0027re getting desperate, 1 would imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do we do?\" Colin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First things first,\" Caine said. He turned to look at Jade. \"Do you remember what you asked of me when you came into the tavern that night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowly nodded. \"I asked you to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You what?\" Nathan roared his question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked me to kill her,\" Caine repeated, though he never took his gaze off Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he declined my request,\" Jade explained. \"I knew he would, of course. And just what does that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave to do with your plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dimple was back in evidence when he grinned at her. \"It\u0027s really very simple, love. I\u0027ve changed my mind. I\u0027ve decided to accommodate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pagan has to die,\" Caine said, his voice low, emphatic. \"It\u0027s the only way.\" He stared at Nathan when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe made that statement. Jade\u0027s brother was quick to nod agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade bounded out of her chair. \"I don\u0027t want to die,\" she cried out. \"I won\u0027t have it, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Jade . . .\" Nathan began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s talking about the pirate,\" Colin explained. \"He isn\u0027t really going to kill you, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade glared at Colin. \"I know exactly what he\u0027s talking about,\" she snapped. \"And I still won\u0027t have it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you have any idea how many years it\u0027s taken to build my reputation? When I think . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men were ignoring her now. Nathan and Colin were actually smiling. Jade gave up. She sat down again and turned to frown at Caine. \"If you hadn\u0027t started your hunt to capture Pagan, none of this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould be necessary now. This is all your fault, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, it\u0027s the only way,\" Nathan argued. \"If Pagan dies, or rather, if the world believes the pirate is dead, then Caine would have to give up his hunt, wouldn\u0027t he? The Tribunal knows he fully believes Pagan is responsible for killing his brother, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reluctantly nodded. \"Then they\u0027d leave Caine alone, wouldn\u0027t they? He\u0027d be safe again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan smiled. He turned to Caine. \"This plan of yours solves more than one problem,\" he remarked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith a telling glance in his sister\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. \"Jade, you\u0027re going to have to change a few of your ways. When Pagan dies, you aren\u0027t going to be able to . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my work,\" she cried out. \"It\u0027s what I do best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine closed his eyes. \"Exactly what is it that you do so well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan answered him. \"Harry did the pirating,\" he explained. \"Jade was always on board, but he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe leader back then. She took care of the land raids. She does have a special talent, Caine.

He was frowning at Jade when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe made that statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took immediate exception to both his manner and his opinion. \"I don\u0027t care what you think of me, Caine. The deception\u0027s over now and you\u0027ll never see me again, so it really doesn\u0027t matter to me . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade stopped her tirade when Harry\u0027s bellow reached her. A woman\u0027s shrill scream came next. Jade assumed one of the servants was being terrorized. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me for a moment?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t bother to wait for permission, but rushed out of the room. As soon as the door closed behind her, Caine turned to Nathan. \"She\u0027ll figure it all out very soon,\" he announced. \"But hopefully by then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe will have staged Pagan\u0027s death and it will be too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin nodded. \"Yes, she\u0027s bound to realize they know she\u0027s with you and that killing Pagan isn\u0027t going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto make any difference now. You\u0027re both still in danger. Odd, but Jade\u0027s usually much quicker,\" he added. \"How long do you think it will take for her to sort it all out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Nathan who answered. \"She already has, Colin. Didn\u0027t you see the look of relief in her eyes. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas fleeting, but there all the same. Deep down, I think she wants it to be over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t you?\" Caine asked Colin. \"How could any of you want to go back on the ocean again? Jade isn\u0027t capable of being very logical right now. She thinks she has to resume her former. . . duties,\" he whispered. \"It\u0027s a way of proving herself, perhaps. Still, it doesn\u0027t matter what her motives are now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needs someone to take the possibility away from her, to demand she quit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s you, Caine?\" Colin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade walked back into the salon then.
