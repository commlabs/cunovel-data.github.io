I don’t love her face on my pillow like that. My nose wrinkles involuntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought crosses my mind and I send him a text. \u0027You\u0027re cooler than I thought you were\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ah, so you see me as human now?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just barely!\u0027 I smile when I press send.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How\u0027s the guy from the gym?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \u0027Not good. Bit of a wanker.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone rings. I roll away from Michelle, who sounds like she might fall asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice is deep and relaxed, \"I thought he was your dreamboat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, it\u0027s playful and resembles a giggle, \"Who even says dreamboat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, playing with the edge of the blanket I\u0027m lying on. \"No. Not so dreamboatish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs and I\u0027m not entirely sure it isn’t relief, \"Why? Did he hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my lips together and nod. It takes me a minute to answer, \"I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" His voice is angry. The switch is fast and slightly creepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn’t…like…touch…me. He just made me do things I didn’t want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god, what?\" He sounds panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moan, \"No. He...like made me drink water from a sports bottle he touched and made me dinner at a penthouse he lured me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. I\u0027ve never heard a full laugh from him before. It sounds like he\u0027s pulled his hands away, and his laugh is an echo in the silent room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops laughing. No amount of Bon Iver will fix the way he\u0027s mocking me. He\u0027s still chuckling when he speaks, \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn’t mean to laugh. I very nearly made a phone call I couldn’t take back. You scared me. I thought he\u0027d done something to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well he did. He\u0027s trying to fix me. He\u0027s trying to push me and I don’t want that. Not from him. I just wanted him to see me as a normal girl. As a girl at school. Not a project to fix.\" I realize I\u0027ve raised my voice and am sitting up staring at the cold floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clears his throat, \"Have you considered he sees you as a girl. Not all girls are whole when you meet them. Sometimes you have to help them get there. Right now, you are a broken girl. That doesn’t mean that you\u0027ll always be broken. That doesn’t make you less of a girl.\" He clears his throat again, \"I\u0027ll call the doc. She\u0027ll want to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears in my eyes don’t come out. They stay in there like tiny kaleidoscopes, trying to make the world the way I need it to be. My words don’t come right away. I don’t hear the click on his end when I whisper, \"I\u0027m not broken.\" But he isn’t there. He never really is. He is the master of not being there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeeks have passed and I have not seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what his number is or how to find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t find my way back to the penthouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried. I got lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even attempted to use his name and 411 but that is an impossibility. People only have cell phones, which are hard to track. I almost asked Stuart to help me track him. But I didn’t. Who wants to be the girl the guy doesn’t want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian has evaded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s still an asshole?\" She mutters it over her laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her and frown, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShell smiles, \"I saw the look in your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Just tired. No look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"K. I won\u0027t say I saw him yesterday then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart almost jumps out of my chest, \"What? Where? Did he talk to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods with a sinister grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI throw my pillow at her, knocking her computer screen down and closing the laptop. She shoots me a blazing glare and points a bright red fingernail, \"That better not have done anything to that. I was done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say? Why didn’t you tell me yesterday?\" I\u0027m dying. Why is she being so sneaky?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens the computer. I groan, \"Shell, I am going to snap that thing in half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, \"He said he was good and asked me a million, no maybe a billion, questions about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\" I quickly grab my pillow and put it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he missed you and wished things had worked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl, \"That’s not good. Wished? Like past tense?\" Shit, the only guy that ever got me. Shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilts her head, \"No. Like he\u0027s picking you up in fifteen-minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes a second to sink in, \"What? Why?\" Then I get angry, \"I don’t want to see him.\" I know it\u0027s irrational but I can\u0027t stop myself from being indignant. \"He\u0027s a jerk. Why would he be coming here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, \"Oh my god, for a girl who has never dated you have spun out head case mastered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jump up and start grabbing clothes. I\u0027m furious, \"Why didn’t you tell me. Oh my god. I hate you.\" I pick up all her dirty laundry and put it in the hamper and wipe down the room again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, \"Because I knew you would find a way not to see him and you\u0027ve been moping around here non stop. You\u0027re acting nuts dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m ripping my clothes off and then pulling on new ones. I\u0027m not even sure what I\u0027m wearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just rant. \"I cannot believe you would do this to me. I told you I have no desire to see him. He was a jerk to me.\" I can\u0027t stop my arms from dragging a brush down my hair or lipgloss from being applied. I look at her in the mirror as I draw on some eyeliner, \"You are so selfish sometimes. You just want to go off and be with Stuart. You don’t want to leave me with the lonely so you hired me a babysitter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inspect myself and look back at her, \"And for another thing, Daddy Uncle Weirdo isn’t going to just let me go out. You\u0027ve probably started a war now.\" I dump a ton of hand sanitizer on my hands and grab a wipe to open the door with. I glare back at her when I grab my cell phone and storm to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" She asks, stifling a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snarl, \"I have to go tell him to get lost. The nuns raised me better than that.\" I fling open the door and stomp down the halls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guy gives me a crazy look as he almost slides against the wall to avoid me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stomp down the stairs and fling the door open. Sebastian isn’t standing at the bottom of the stairs. He isn’t even there. I look at my cell for the time just as it vibrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read, \u0027Hi.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes, \u0027Not now.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t be sassy. What are you doing?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Waiting for Sebastian so I can tell him to get lost!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If you leave the dorms message me!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Whatever. I already left. I\u0027m out front.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t push me!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Whatever!!!!!!!!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the phone back in my pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jump when I hear a voice in the dark silence, \"You look nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up. Sebastian\u0027s staring at me from the shadows of the pathway. He\u0027s leaning against a post. He looks divine. How is it possible, he\u0027s only wearing faded jeans and a beige long sleeve shirt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you here?\" I don’t move. I\u0027m terrified I will forget that I\u0027m mad, because if I\u0027m honest I want him. I want to be with him. More than I want anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needed to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeed. That is a strong word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I still have acid on my tongue leftover from yelling at Michelle and my words are filled with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needed to see you.\" He repeats himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. I like that word, need. It\u0027s not want. He had no choice because it was a need to see me. I like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushes off of the pole and walks towards me. His watch catches my eye. It\u0027s shiny and not his running watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I ask again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbs the stairs, standing just below me, down a couple stairs. His eyes are at my level instead of a foot above me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows, \"I\u0027m sorry I researched your paranoia and OCD. I\u0027m sorry I presumed to hire a chef to make you dinner. Mostly I\u0027m sorry I challenged your comfort and tried to get you to drink the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe melts all my irrational anger. I realize I\u0027m more hurt that he stayed away so long. I lift my hand, it frightens me more than anything in the world, but I do it. I touch his face. His skin is warm. I can feel his stubble. He looks tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you come and see me?\" I know the answer. Because I am a head case. Because I can\u0027t eat dinner or drink water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head subtly, \"I thought I should stay away. I scared you. I didn’t mean to. The way you looked at me, when we were at my penthouse was so horrid. You were terrified. I never wanted to see you look like that again. I hated myself for making you feel that way. Not to mention how angry you looked when I made you drink the water. I\u0027m sorry, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers dig in slightly. I have the strangest urge. Before I can think my way out of it, I grab his face and pull him in. His arms wrap around me. He squeezes me. There is a tremor to his touch. Like he\u0027s panicked. I know I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms are fully encompassing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never meant to overstep my bounds.\" My hair in his face muffles his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"It was my fault. I just don’t trust people. You scared me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I just want you to let me in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t face him. I whisper, \"You can\u0027t fix me, Sebastian. I\u0027m not broken. I\u0027m ruined.\" My brain holds all the reasons why I\u0027m ruined behind a wall. I don’t ever get to see them. But I know they\u0027re there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel his jaw clench against my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to accept me for what I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowers his hands and grips both of mine. He pulls back and presses his soft lips into my cheek. He stays there, breathing on me. It\u0027s disturbing and delicious. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-9.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
