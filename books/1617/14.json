{"id":94199,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all white noise to Haley, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoch Awe. Great. A king and a loch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made good progress from there, as the hills slowly smoothed into a thick carpet of knotty green grass. The loch appeared, and nausea twinged sharp in Haley\u0027s gut. She knew there weren\u0027t any such bodies of water in the Massachusetts she\u0027d se en. It was huge, stretching along a fold in the gently curving valley, and glittering as promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gray building emerged in the distance, a spectral thing in the hazy light that materialized as they approached. Her queasiness became insistent, clutching at the front of her belly. Haley breathed through her mouth now as if that could curb the roiling and flipping in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must\u0027ve faltered, or made some sound, because she felt both of MacColla\u0027s hands steadying her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn\u0027s castle came into focus. It was a huge rectangular building constructed of dingy gray stone and studded with a few small, square openings. A granite fortress, grim and nearly windowless, in the old “hall house” style of ancient castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochs, kilts, kings, and now castles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s your king\u0027s name?” Her voice was a reedy whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait. MacColla. Charles? Charles the first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you well, lass?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt his hand on her shoulder, but she pulled away sharply. Swinging a trembling leg in front of her, Haley slid off the pony\u0027s back and buckled to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard muted chatter, then she registered the girl ranting a stream of unintelligible Gaelic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEffortless Gaelic babbling all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the possibility came to her. But rather than the illuminating click of a bulb, Haley\u0027s sudden realization snuffed out the light. It was a boulder come crashing down, as if to seal her in a cramped, airless cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the phrase that did it. An obscure phrase that had been spoken to her. That nagged at her still. The name Jean had called her brother - she remembered it. And she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear Thollaidh nan Tighean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDestroyer of Houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlasdair MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Alasdair MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran teetering for several yards before collapsing to her knees. The weathered building loomed in the distance, mocking her, an indifferent witness to her horror. The nausea that had quivered at the edges of her belly and in the back of her throat erupted full force now, and it was as if a great, violent fist punched into her gut, hauling up everything from Haley\u0027s stomach with its clenched hand. The strain robbed her of breath, forced bile singeing into her sinuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain in her ribs made her vision waver, and a great wail escaped her. She tried to still her spasming body, tried to silence her own cries. Every movement was sheer agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the small blip of burst blood vessels around her eyes as she retched again. And still she convulsed, as if some instinctual part of her believed she could make it all disappear by the full force of her body alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe violence of it made her bones creak, awoke fresh agony in her already abused ribs, and she sicked-up once more from the stabbing in her torso alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the knack of sensing MacColla near, and she felt him now, standing over her, the cool cast of his shadow on her back. Knew without thought that he was leaning down toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd though her heart pounded with fear, she summoned a look of defiance. Against him, against her condition. Against the whole unreal, unfathomable, inconceivable situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” she shouted, as she scrambled to the side, scrubbing the trails of her body\u0027s fluids from her face. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most brutal men in Scottish history. Somehow come for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw him, looming over her, as still as the hills at theirbacks. She clawed tight to her flickering consciousness and heard Jean on the edges of it. “I warned you, Alasdair. The lass is not right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this time instead of focusing Haley, giving her strength. Jean\u0027s distant words erased her. Unmoored her. Not right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the impermeable wall of masonry Haley had spent years stacking up and around herself became a great towering house of cards, fluttering lightly to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla eased himself into the bath. The copper tub barely held him, but the water was hot and unclenched his tight muscles. He reached back to grind at the knots along the tops of his shoulders, taking pleasure in the stretch of tendons along the backs of his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn had generously given them their choice of rooms, th e majority of his family currently residing in their primary home in Glassary, to the east. MacColla wasn\u0027t much for luxuries, and had chosen the smaller but warmer of the rooms offered him. The hearth was big, the window faced west, and the mattress was softer than any ground he\u0027d used as a bed these past weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still, he was tenser than he thought he had reason to be, and wondered at the strange woman who\u0027d put him so on edge. Dunking his head underwater, he tugged his fingers through his hair, untan gling the matted mass before he washed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla sat up abruptly and whipped his hair from his face. Curse his distraction, but he still hadn\u0027t pressed the issue of the woman\u0027s clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d thought she was a spy. All signs pointed to it. She\u0027d come upon them in Campbell\u0027s own lair. A mysterious woman, strong and alone, with no ready explanations or denials on her tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, most troubling of all, she had suspected the truth of James Graham\u0027s fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, in his heart he didn\u0027t believe it to be true. S he\u0027d seemed so… innocent. He\u0027d thought it was merely her injury that made her appear so. But feeling her quake before him as they rode, steadying her with his own hand, he\u0027d sensed her confusion, her vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome sort of scout for Clan Campbell? He couldn\u0027t give the notion much credence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d trembled like a newborn foal, terrorized by the sight of Fincharn. And then she\u0027d gotten violently ill, and he\u0027d wondered if she weren\u0027t actually an enemy of John\u0027s clan Scrymgeour. And yet there had been no recognition between the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt mercy for the poor lass. Wary, but merciful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, oh, how he wanted her. The image of those creamy arms and shoulders stayed in his mind, taunting him. And the smooth stretch of her belly. He fantasized about pulling that strange white shirt up and over her head. He knew her breasts would be even paler and more perfect, if such a thing were possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla shut his eyes, marshalling his body back to composure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d keep her close until he could discover the truth of her origins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd God help her if she turned out to be something she didn\u0027t appear to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley paced another frantic circle around the room, dragging her hand hard along the cold stone as she went. The sharp peaks and edges of granite h ad made her palm raw, but she couldn\u0027t stop herself. Something had to make this experience real to her. She pressed her hand harder onto the damp rock, foisting her physical self onto this strange world, hoping her mind would follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was back in time and didn\u0027t know how it had happened, just that it had. The evidence was all around her. But it was more than simply the clothes and the Gaelic. More than the godforsaken chill of the castle she now found herself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley knew. She felt it. Felt it in the desolation around her. An animal knowing, bone- deep and as old as man, that she could travel for miles in any direction before encountering another soul. She felt the absence of technology like a sudden silence. Felt nature around her, ascendant, all-powe rful, in a way she\u0027d never sensed it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of all, she felt small and vulnerable and terrified out of her wits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped. She needed to search again for something, anything that could be used as a weapon. She\u0027d already noted the small candleholder on the table at her bedside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pitcher full of water could do some damage too. And pocketing the small knife on the tray of cheese and bread had been a no-brainer. Her eyes roved the room. There must be something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stormed to the bedside for the hundredth time. Small table with candles, pitcher, basin. She peeled the thin mattress away from the bed. It was packed tightly with straw and made a light crunching sound. There was a woven hammock beneath, attached to the wooden cot. She kicked at the base of it. The thing was too sturdy to remove a leg, and it\u0027d be too readily noticed anyhow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked at the hammock that was to be her seventeenth- century version of a box spring. It was actually a well-made thing, the rope tied off into strong, even knots and pulled over and under into a dense basket weave. Definitely something to keep in mind. Once she severed that rope, though, that was it for the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God, how? She dropped the mattress back into place and sat suddenly. How? How had she gotten there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind kept returning to the gun. And that hideous painting. A wooden panel bearing the crude likeness of a man and a woman. The man was MacColla, she knew that now. And she was the woman, with a scar on her neck. It had been glistening with fresh blood. But whose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat weapon and that painting were the two things that linked her to… when?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to place herself in time. Tried to remember her history. When and how MacColla died. It had been on a battlefield in Ireland. He\u0027d been betrayed, slain. She didn\u0027t recall the precise date, just that it would\u0027ve been in the 1640s. The time of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, that politically correct name for what some still referred to as the British Civil Wars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when, exactly? 1645? \u002746?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why her? Why Alasdair MacColla? She tried to remember as much as she could about the man. He\u0027d been fierce. Brave. Vicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany claimed he\u0027d invented the Highland Charge, the battlefield strategy that had brought the Highlanders so many triumphs for so many years. Fire off a musket shot, then charge, finishing off the battle with sword and targe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch famous MacColla victories. Such infamous MacColla brutality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe certainly was as huge as the history books said he was. She had never seen an image of the man, and thought with a shudder that the horrific wooden panel might be the only painting of him that ever existed. But his legend hadn\u0027t exaggerated his size. His power was clear in his broad chest, tremendous arms, and his thighs, solid as wood, which had cradled her as they rode as if she nestled within the branches of some great tree. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-14.html","bookId":1617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM"}
