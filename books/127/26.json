It\u0027s a deterioration ?a stagnation!\"He\u0026nbsp; stared\u0026nbsp; from\u0026nbsp; one\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; other\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; they\u0026nbsp; gazed\u0026nbsp; fixedly\u0026nbsp; at\u0026nbsp; him.\n\u003cbr\u003e Fara was\u0026nbsp; the first to\u0026nbsp; recover. \"Well, mystical philosophy\u0026nbsp; isn\u0027t going tohelp us here. Let us be concrete. Do you deny that Hari Seldon could easilyhave\u0026nbsp; worked out historical\u0026nbsp; trends of\u0026nbsp; the future by\u0026nbsp; simple psychologicaltechnique?\"\"No,\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; course not,\"\u0026nbsp; cried\u0026nbsp; Hardin.\u0026nbsp; \"But we\u0026nbsp; can\u0027t\u0026nbsp; rely on\u0026nbsp; him for\u0026nbsp; asolution. At\u0026nbsp; best, he might indicate the problem, but\u0026nbsp; if ever there is tobe\u0026nbsp; a solution,\u0026nbsp; we must\u0026nbsp; work it out\u0026nbsp; ourselves. He\u0026nbsp; can\u0027t do it\u0026nbsp; for us.\"Fulham spoke suddenly. \"What\u0026nbsp; do you mean ?\u0027indicate the problem\u0027? We knowthe problem.\"Hardin whirled\u0026nbsp; on him. \"You think\u0026nbsp; you do? You think\u0026nbsp; Anacreon is all HariSeldon is\u0026nbsp; likely to be worried\u0026nbsp; about. I disagree! I\u0026nbsp; tell you, gentlemen,that as yet none of you has the faintest conception of what is really goingon.\"\"And you do?\" questioned Pirenne, hostilely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think\u0026nbsp; so!\" Hardin\u0026nbsp; jumped up and\u0026nbsp; pushed his chair away.\u0026nbsp; His eyes werecold and\u0026nbsp; hard. \"If there\u0027s one\u0026nbsp; thing that\u0027s definite, it\u0026nbsp; is that there\u0027ssomething smelly\u0026nbsp; about the whole situation;\u0026nbsp; something that is bigger thananything we\u0027ve\u0026nbsp; talked about yet. Just ask\u0026nbsp; yourself this question: Why wasit that among the original population of the Foundation not one first-classpsychologist was\u0026nbsp; included, except Bor\u0026nbsp; Alurin? And he\u0026nbsp; carefully refrainedfrom training his pupils in more than the fundamentals.\"A short silence and Fara said: \"All right. Why?\"\"Perhaps because\u0026nbsp; a psychologist might have caught on\u0026nbsp; to what this was allabout ? and too soon to\u0026nbsp; suit Hari Seldon. As\u0026nbsp; it is, we\u0027ve been stumblingabout, getting\u0026nbsp; misty glimpses of the\u0026nbsp; truth and no more.\u0026nbsp; And that is whatHari Seldon wanted.\"He laughed harshly. \"Good day, gentlemen!\"He stalked out of the room.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47154.html","bookId":127,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 4:37:21 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 4:37:21 AM"}
