His hand touched a badge and holding it he said, “There is no force felt from this badge, it seems that the pulling force of the badge only works on those acolytes who are still alive. If that\u0027s the case!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin waved his hands, and 2 badges that belonged to two level 3 acolytes was tossed out of the light bubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese two badges had, at one time, belonged to Silver-Claw Saurun and the female blonde acolyte. Since Leylin had already collected sufficient badges, he would no longer keep these two with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I also have this thing with me!” said Leylin, as he withdrew an iron chain that had an electrical current and also threw that away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a thorough examination by the A.I. Chip on this destroyed magic artifact, there was a hidden spiritual force within it which kept pulsating — it seemed that this force had a tracking ability. If Leylin were to bring this item with him, then the professors of the enemy academy would know immediately that he was the one who had killed Torash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the other items taken from the acolytes — the half dagger and the shattered palm — there were no problems if he brought them back with him. They were carefully placed within his rucksack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The final procedure!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin smiled heartily, and removed the Shapeshifting spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscles on his face contorted, as his height continuously grew. Very soon, Leylin resumed the state of his original appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have been acting inside the secret plane with this disguise, where no one had seen my true appearance!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m afraid after I exit, the enemy academy would wildly search for an acolyte that doesn\u0027t exist?” After thinking of the probable scene in the future, he could not help but smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now, I am Leylin Farlier, an ordinary Potioneering acolyte!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the dazzling rainbow coloured exit, Leylin’s smile widened yet even more….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith much effort, Leylin managed to suppress the dizziness that came abruptly and did not vomit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The feeling of crossing planes is not a great one!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hurry up and move, don\u0027t block the way!” A cold voice sounded right beside Leylin’s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin hurriedly bowed and left the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then, did he take a look at the surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the exit of the secret plane, it looked the same as before. The 3 academies were divided into a triangular formation where they faced each other. Sage Gotham’s Hut and Whitewoods Castle members stood closer together, and faced the common enemy, Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for now, acolytes continuously swarmed out from the exit, returning back to their respective professor’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is that person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin saw a black robed man ahead of the 3 chairmen. He couldn’t help guessing the person’s identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Shua!* But now, because the black-robed man felt Leylin’s unwavering sight upon him, he turned his head around and looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe immediately glanced upon a pair of dark green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surrounding world was as if it had been suspended in time; everywhere one could see only green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe acolytes and professors around Leylin seemed to turned into jade statues where no signs of life could be observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin strove to open his mouth, but he found no words coming out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin! Leylin! Leylin!“\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surrounding statues suddenly opened their mouths, chanting Leylin’s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is happening?” Leylin roared within his heart, but not a single word could be spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Peng! Peng * The dark green sculptures began to move and green dust constantly fell off of them. Their eyes had become red-colored, as if the sockets had been embedded with rubies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless green statues swarmed around Leylin, drowning him….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Argh!” Leylin suddenly regained consciousness and panted heavily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened earlier?” The surrounding acolytes now seemed to be doing fine, yet Leylin did not dare to look in the direction of those chairmen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax, son!” A pair of hands with a medicinal scent covered Leylin’s head, emitting a white glowing light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Professor Kroft!” Leylin bowed deeply. Under the white light, he felt much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was it you who saved me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not exactly ‘save’ you, only a small favour.” Professor Kroft smiled and led Leylin back towards their academy’s gathering area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Official Magi always have a defensive force field surrounding them. Moreover, most of it are instantly activated or have a permanent effect. As for higher ranking Magi, they have an even stronger force field encircling them at all times. An ordinary acolyte cannot even get close to them!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKroft explained for Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just now, that Magus from the Lighthouse of the Night did not do it intentionally; he just looked over this side and immediately many apprentices got caught in a hallucination. If a professor wasn’t here, then I would have been. . . ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKroft’s expression slowly turned stern, “Leylin, before you turn into an official Magus, remember to steer clear of any high ranking Magus! If not, I would not even be able to imagine your end….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll keep that in mind!” Leylin’s expression was extremely solemn as he nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a slight glance had almost cost Leylin his life, which left him a lingering fear. Moreover it had resolved his determination to climb up in the ranks of the food chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t wish for my soul to crumble immediately in the future just because a high ranking Magus crosses my path in the future. This would really be a grievance!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough higher ranking Magus could exercise restraint on their forcefields, it would mean that they were showing their softer side. Leylin could not imagine anyone doing that for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright now! Welcome back son!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter healing Leylin, Kroft revealed a sincere smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Being able to see you again is really great!” Leylin also smiled as he hugged his professor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, only then he had time to view the casualties in his own academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the teaming up of the other two academies, a huge number of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy’s acolytes had perished previously in the war. Right now it seems that Abyssal Bone Forest Academy suffered an even more severe casualty count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, behind the professors, there was only a few scattered acolytes standing behind him. Most of them carried injuries with a gloomy expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin!” A pleasantly surprised voiced sounded in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bicky!” Leylin smiled warmly and hugged the curvaceous and beautiful Bicky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very good. I still believed in you….” Tears welled up in Bicky’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like she was worried about Leylin but that she did not know he was the mysterious man who had saved her before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin took another look at Bicky and was rather surprised when she was actually not injured the slightest, only that her mental state did not seem to to be in the best condition. He could not help but feel so as even if it was a level 3 acolyte from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, under the oppression in numbers from their enemy, they may not be able to protect their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if seeing Leylin’s bewilderment, Bicky spoke on her own accord, “I met Molly right after entering. Also, I met with an extremely powerful enemy acolyte, but a stranger saved me. After that, I met Fayle and it was him who kept me by his side, so I was able to live up till now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBicky pointed at an acolyte behind a professor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked over, and it was indeed Fayle who he saw before. After a span of 3 years, he seemed to be even more mature and had more charisma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a level 3 acolyte protecting her coupled with some luck, it was probable that she could survive. Leylin nodded his head and did not ask further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter casually exchanging a few sentences with Bicky, Leylin looked at the secret plane’s exit. Most of them were enemy acolytes streaming out, where very few Abyssal Bone Forest Academy acolytes came out. Leylin sighed inwardly, “It seems that this time Abyssal Bone Forest Academy suffered a great loss. I\u0027m afraid that there will be a scenario where Abyssal Bone Forest Academy would have more professors than acolytes period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Peng! * At this moment, another acolyte walked out from the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis acolyte wore the grey robes of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, and had several holes in them. Injuries seemed to riddle his body and there was even traces of blood. Moreover, an arm was missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Jayden!” Leylin’s pupils contracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards magicians, missing a limb was no big issue. There were various and mysterious spells which could regrow their limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJayden braced himself and walked several steps forward. After seeing his professor from Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, he smiled and fainted immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Shua! * A white figure immediately appeared in front of Jayden and caught him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the white flash stopped, Leylin saw the appearance of the Magus within - It was a skeleton with an underworld flame in its eyes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Professor Dorotte!” Leylin called out the name of this set of bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, it was Dorotte who led Leylin into Abyssal Bone Forest Academy. Moreover, he was Jayden’s mentor and even gave Jayden a magic artifact. It seemed like he doted on Jayden rather much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright! After my detection, there are no more surviving acolytes inside the secret plane. Seal the exit!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black robed figure standing before the 3 chairmen spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he spoke, the 2 camps sank into deep silence, before the murmuring and sighing noises sounded incessantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! Where is my Torash? He is definitely still inside!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Silver-Claw Saurun? Hurry and come out! He is a genius acolyte, how could the Abyssal Bone Forest Academy manage to defeat him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morphis! Morphis, where are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstant cries were heard from the enemy camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Abyssal bone Forest Academy’s party seemed to have already expected this. Although the numbers of dead acolytes were many, the reactions of all professors were much lower than what Leylin had expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven for the Potioneering talent Merlin, his responsible Professor (Kroft) only let out a soft dismal gasp upon receiving news of his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Torash! Torash! I left spiritual force coordinates on his body; he should be present amongst us here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the opposite side, a blue bearded old guy yelled madly, following which he chanted an incantation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Bang! *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bright blue beam of light drifted floated above Jayden who had fainted. Within this light an indistinct badge of an acolyte could be seen .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Argh! No! My Torash! I will kill you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression on the face of the blue bearded old guy contorted, where a massive thunderstorm appeared midair above him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Torash’s power, when compared to this, is absolutely rubbish.” Leylin gulped, and suddenly felt extremely lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-97\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-99\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-98","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
