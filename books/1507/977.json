The head looked at Meng Hao and then let out a roar that echoed out like a powerful attack. Blood sprayed from Meng Hao’s mouth, and he staggered back. As for the Door of Immortality, it slowly began to close!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the Fang Clan was completely shocked by this. When Fang Wei attacked the Door of Immortality, it had only continued to open wider and wider. It had never shown any signs of closing back up. Everyone gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on? This Door of Immortality... is so hard to open!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fang Hao’s Tribulation Clouds were different than everyone else’s, plus there were those Immortal Palaces. It’s only to be expected that his Door of Immortality is unusually hard to open!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Wei\u0027s eyes glittered as he stared at Meng Hao, and it was clear that he wanted to fight. As for Fang Xiushan, the killing intent in his eyes grew stronger, and his expression was transforming into one of wild joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He can’t open the Door of Immortality!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cultivators from the sects and clans of the Ninth Mountain and Sea were all shocked by what they were seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Immortal Tribulation like this, and a Door of Immortality like this, would be impossible for any other Chosen to deal with!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s hard to say whether Fang Hao... will actually be able to open the Door of Immortality!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside of Planet East Victory, within the starry sky, Meng Hao was forced backward by about 3,000 meters before coming to a stop. He wiped the blood from his mouth as he looked at the Door of Immortality with a vicious gleam in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cultivation base suddenly exploded with power, and his 30,000-meter Dharma Idol reappeared. He fused with the Dharma Idol, transforming into a 30,000-meter giant that took a 3,000 meter step forward to appear directly in front of the Door of Immortality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised both of his hands, placed them onto the Door of Immortality, and roared. Then he shoved forward violently, causing massive rumbling sounds to echo out in every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Door of Immortality trembled, sending a powerful backlash attack against Meng Hao. He shook as his Eternal stratum exploded out, restoring him even as he rotated his cultivation base and shoved again violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Door of Immortality opened by another crack, causing Immortal light to shine out in the starry sky once again. Immortal qi spread out, and Meng Hao’s eyes turned red. He gritted his teeth against the backlash, and went all out, pushing with all the might he could muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMMMMBLLLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Door of Immortality slowly opened wider, causing more Immortal light to spill out. In the blink of an eye, it was just as open as it had been before. The face of the old man that had been materialized by the Door of Immortality appeared once again. He roared in rage at Meng Hao, and once again, powerful light exploded out in an attack against Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Meng Hao was ready. Even as the force descended upon him, he stepped backward and performed a double-handed incantation gesture, then shoved his hands straight out in front of him. Immediately, his eight Immortal meridians sparkled, causing eight streams of power to flow out into his right hand. He then unleashed a punch directly toward the old man’s face, causing the Immortal qi to shoot out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, they slammed into each other, sending a huge boom echoing out in all directions. The face faded away, and the eight streams of Immortal qi swirled together and returned to Meng Hao. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and yet, his desire to fight was even stronger. He stepped forward, placed his palms on the Door of Immortality, then began to push.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Immortal light grew stronger, and the Immortal qi more dense. Booms echoed out as the Door of Immortality opened further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the things that had just happened left everyone completely amazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that just now? Eight streams of Immortal qi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What divine ability was that...?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll areas of the Ninth Mountain and Sea were in a complete commotion. Blue veins popped out on Meng Hao’s forehead as the Door of Immortality opened wide enough for a person to fit through, but not Meng Hao’s Dharma Idol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I completely destroyed the Tribulation Clouds and shattered all of the Immortal Palaces. As for the Door of Immortality... if it remained closed, it wouldn’t matter. But once I start, I’m going to open it all the way and step inside!” Meng Hao\u0027s eyes were completely bloodshot as he once again rotated his cultivation base and shoved against the door. It opened a bit more, and yet, in that same instant, he suddenly backed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he did, glittering starlight appeared within his left eye. In the blink of an eye, light began to pour out of his eye, transforming into a beam of light 3,000 meters long. Then it was 30,000 meters long, enveloping Meng Hao completely. It was at this point that... five characters appeared in Meng Hao\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne Thought Stellar Transformation 一念星辰变 ! [1. I left in the Chinese characters of One Thought Stellar Transformation so you could see the \"five characters\" that were mentioned, despite the translation being four words]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the most powerful Daoist magic of the Fang Clan’s first generation Patriarch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling rose up as the light surrounding Meng Hao began to spread out. The starlight flew out of his left eye, transforming into the starstone. The starstone rapidly dissolved, forming a liquid that shot toward Meng Hao and, in the blink of an eye, completely covered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the space of a few breaths of time, even as the Door of Immortality was closing, the light that surrounded Meng Hao vanished. In his place, there was no longer his normal form, but rather, what appeared to be... a gigantic asteroid!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe asteroid was fully 3,000 meters wide, and shocking to the extreme. The void around it cracked and shattered, as if the mere appearance of the asteroid was enough to rock the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, an intense aura exploded out from it. Countless motes of starlight appeared, which then descended onto the asteroid’s surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden, it didn’t look like an asteroid any more, but rather, a planet!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA droning sound began to emanate out from the planet as it smashed into the Door of Immortality. Everyone watching was filled with shock as the huge stone bashed into the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One Thought Stellar Transformation!!” gasped the Grand Elder, his face flickering as he stood there among the other members of the Fang Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as his words echoed out, other clan members gasped as they gaped in astonishment at the enormous stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?! That’s.... One Thought Stellar Transformation!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the first generation Patriarch’s most powerful Daoist magic, One Thought Stellar Transformation! Supposedly, you can use it to actually transform into a planet! It can basically destroy anything!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fang Hao actually acquired the One Thought Stellar Transformation when he went into the ancestral Land! According to the clan’s ancient records, the most powerful form of that magical technique is that you can transform into a real planet!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the cultivators on Planet East Victory and the rest of the Ninth Mountain and Sea were shocked by Meng Hao assuming planetary form. At the same time, that very planet slammed into the Door of Immortality, causing a huge boom to rattle out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRipples spread out in every direction; apparently the attack had contained enough energy to cause tremors to spread far and wide. The Door of Immortality shuddered, and a massive wind kicked up. In the blink of an eye, the Door of Immortality opened completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne swift attack, and the Door of Immortality opened wide!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if a sluice gate had been opened. Boundless Immortal light spread out rapidly, filled with wildly surging Immortal qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, the planet vanished, and Meng Hao reappeared. His face was pale, and he coughed up four or five mouthfuls of blood as the Immortal light and qi surrounded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boundless Immortal qi surged into him, filling him. His eight Immortal meridians trembled, and began to transform. Immediately, a ninth Immortal meridian began to form!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, outside of his body, and visible outside of the Door of Immortality, what people saw was not a ninth meridian, but rather, the first meridian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever someone reaches true Immortal ascension, in the moment that they open the Door of Immortality, their Immortal meridians will cause images of Immortal dragons to appear above the Door of Immortality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, the first Immortal dragon was rapidly solidifying high above Meng Hao and the Door of Immortality, swirling in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmortal qi surged and glittered brightly, illuminating the starry sky until it seemed like daytime. Everyone watching on Planet East Victory cried out in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Door of Immortality... opened!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s opening his Immortal meridians! I wonder how many meridians Fang Hao will be able to open!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless cultivators were watching as the first Immortal dragon appeared above the Door of Immortality. As it roared, a second Immortal meridian formed, then a third and a fourth and a fifth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, boundless Immortal qi, which far exceeded what had come from the bronze dragon in the ancestral land’s necropolis, inundated Meng Hao. 10. 20. 30 Immortal meridians appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30 Immortal dragons swirled through the air, roaring. Each one of those Immortal dragons was noted by the audience in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, and caused their hearts to tremble. They stared blankly, especially the other true Immortal Chosen, whose hearts were pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those are... those are Immortal meridians?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How come each one of his Immortal meridians seems to be multiple times bigger than the Immortal meridians that appeared for everyone else who just achieved true Immortal Ascension!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The level of difficulty of his Immortal Tribulation was unheard of. His Door of Immortality was so hard to open! Considering he succeeded, it’s little wonder that his Immortal meridians exceed that of others. They\u0027re so strong!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the Fang Clan on Planet East Victory was completely shocked. Fang Wei watched with a pale face, staring at Meng Hao. Despite everything Meng Hao had done to fight against the Immortal Tribulation and open the Door of Immortality, Fang Wei still wanted to battle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as expressions of shock could be heard throughout Planet East Victory, the cultivators from the various sects and clans of the Ninth Mountain and Sea looked on with astonishment as Meng Hao opened his Immortal meridians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The strength of his Immortal meridians represents his battle prowess within the Immortal Realm,” said the old woman next to Fan Dong’er, her voice soft as she peered into the crystal. “He will be incomparable.... He experienced Paragon Immortal Tribulation, and he has become... the only Paragon Immortal!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patriarchs of the other sects and clans also came to similar conclusions as they watched Meng Hao with glittering eyes and thoughtful hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stood in the Door of Immortality, bathed in Immortal light, surrounded by Immortal qi. Rumbling echoed out in all directions as boundless Immortal qi poured into him. Cracking sounds could be heard as 40 Immortal meridians opened, and then more!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e41. 45. 50....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmidst all the rumbling, the Immortal dragons outside the Door of Immortality were now 50 in number. They flew around, roaring, causing anyone who heard the sound to be completely shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, things weren’t over yet!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e55. 60. 70. 80....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e80 Immortal dragons appeared outside of the Door of Immortality in a relatively short period of time. Those 80 Immortal dragons exuded shocking energy as they flew around in the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s body was surrounded by roaring. His body felt like it was being shredded as the boundless Immortal qi poured into him, causing the 81st Immortal meridian to form....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, the 81st meridian was finished, after which was the 82nd. Then there were 83.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs everyone in the Ninth Mountain and Sea watched, Meng Hao reached 90 Immortal meridians!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-972\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-974\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-973","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
