He wanted to hide, dig deep into the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaile had told him to find another place to hide because they might come back, looking for the Horn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDared he go out there? Dared he stay here? Olver cracked his eyes open, then nearly screamed. A pair of legs ending in hooves stood beside the wagon. A moment later, a snouted face leaned down and looked at him, beady eyes narrowing, nostrils sniffing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver yelled, scrambling back, clutching the Horn. The Trolloc yelled something, heaving the wagon over and nearly smashing it down on Olver. The wagon’s contents of arrows went scattering across the ground as Olver dashed away, looking for safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was none. Dozens of the Trollocs turned toward him, and they called to one another in a language Olver did not recognize. He looked about, Horn in one hand, knife in the other, frantic. No safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horse snorted nearby. It was Bela, chewing on some grain leaked from a supply cart. The horse raised her head, looking at Olver. She didn’t have a saddle on, only a halter and bridle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood and ashes, Olver thought, running for her, I wish I had Wind. This plump mare would end him in the cookpot for certain. Olver sheathed his knife and jumped up onto Bela’s back, seizing the reins in one hand, clutching the Horn in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pig-snouted Trolloc from the wagon swung, nearly taking off Olver’s arm. He cried out, kicking Bela into motion, and the mare galloped out from among the Trollocs. The beasts ran behind with howls and yells. Other calls sounded throughout the camp, which was nearly emptying out as they converged on the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver rode as he’d been taught, down low, guiding with his knees. And Bela ran. Light, but she ran. Mat had said that many horses were frightened of Trollocs, and would throw their rider if forced near them, but this animal did none of that. She thundered right past howling Trollocs, right through the center of the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver looked over his shoulder. There were hundreds of them back there, chasing him. \"Oh, Light!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d seen Mat’s banner atop those Heights, he was sure of it. But there were so many Trollocs in the way. Olver turned Bela to ride the way Aravine had gone. Perhaps he could round the Trolloc camp and get out that way, then come up the back of the Heights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake the Horn to Mat, or all is lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver rode for all he was worth, urging Bela on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is nobody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, a large force of Trollocs cut him off. Olver turned back the other way, but others approached from that direction, too. Olver cried out, turning Bela again, but a thick black Trolloc arrow hit her in the flank. She screamed and stumbled, then dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver tumbled free. Hitting the ground knocked the air from his lungs and made him see a flash of light. He forced himself to crawl to his hands and knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Horn must reach Matrim Cauthon . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver grabbed the Horn, and found that he was weeping. \"I\u0027m sorry\", he said to Bela. \"You were a good horse. You ran like Wind couldn’t have. I’m sorry\". She whinnied softly and drew a final breath, then died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left her and ran beneath the legs of the first Trolloc that arrived. Olver couldn’t fight them. He knew he couldn’t. He didn’t unsheathe the knife. He just ran up the steep slope, trying to reach the top from where he had seen Mat’s flag fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might as well have been a continent away. A Trolloc grabbed at his clothing, pulling him down, but Olver ripped free, leaving cloth in its thick nails. He scrambled over broken ground, and with desperation, spotted a little cleft in a rocky outcrop at the base of the slope. The shallow crack looked up at the black sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw himself toward it, then wiggled in, clinging to the Horn. He barely fit. Trollocs milled around above him, then began to reach in for him, tearing at his clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver whimpered and closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogain hurled himself through the gateway, weaves already forming before him as he struck at Demandred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stood on the smoldering slope that looked over the dried river and toward the failing Andoran pike formations. The Aiel, Cairhienin and Legion of the Dragon fought there as well, and all were in danger of being surrounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pikes were all but shattered, now. It would soon be a rout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogain launched twin columns of fire toward Demandred, but Sharans threw themselves in the way, interfering with his attack. Flesh burned away, bones charring to dust. Their deaths gave Demandred time to spin about and lash out with a weave of Water and Air. Logain’s burst of fire hit that and turned to steam, then boiled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogain had hoped that after so much channeling, Demandred would be weakened. Not so. A complex weave formed in front of the man, a weave such as Logain had never seen. It made a field that rippled in the air, and when Logain next attacked, his weave bounced free like a stick thrown against a brick wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogain leaped to the side, rolling as lightning struck from the sky. Shards of rock pelted him as he wove Spirit, Fire and Earth, slicing at the strange wall. He ripped it down, then lobbed broken bits of stone from the ground to intercept fire from Demandred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA diversion, Logain thought, realizing that Demandred had woven something else, more complex, behind the fire. A gateway opened and shot across the ground, opening to a maw of redness. Logain threw himself to the side as the Deathgate passed, but it left a trail of burning lava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred\u0027s next attack was a jet of air that hurled Logain backward, toward that lava. Logain desperately wove Water to cool the lava. He hit shoulder-first, passing a burst of steam that scalded his skin, but he had cooled the lava enough that it formed a crust atop the still-molten flow beneath. Holding his breath against the steam, he hurled himself to the side as another series of lightning bolts pulverized the ground where he had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose bolts shattered the crust he’d made, reaching into the molten rock. Drops of lava splashed across Logain, searing his skin, burning pocks in his arm and face. He screamed and wove through his rage to send lightning down on his foe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slice of Spirit, Earth and Fire cut his weaves from the air. Demandred was just so strong. That sa’angreal was incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next flash of lightning blinded Logain, throwing him backward. He hit a patch of broken shale, the points of the rock biting into his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are powerful\", Demandred said. Logain could barely hear the words. His ears . . . the thunder . . . \"But you are not Lews Therin\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogain growled, weaving through his tears, hurling lightning at Demandred. He wove twice, and though Demandred cut one bolt from the ai \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-265.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
