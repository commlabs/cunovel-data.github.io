Katie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Katie started to cry as Jenni said, \"No, but she\u0027s here with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie grabbed the phone away from Jenni. \"Daddy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katie, are you and Lydia okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie shook her head and whispered, \"No, no. I\u0027m fine, but Lydia, she didn\u0027t make it. She…Daddy…she…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Katie-baby. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell by his voice that he truly was. Despite his misgivings with her lifestyle, he had come to accept and be quite close to Lydia. Though her mother had remained blissfully in denial until her death, her father had tried hard to understand. His painful, sometimes embarrassing questions had only showed her how much he was trying. And when he had shown up at her wedding, dressed in his military uniform, beaming and near tears, to walk her down the aisle, she knew that he loved her even if he didn\u0027t understand her completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they shared a moment of silence over the woman Katie had loved so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, honey,\" he said again. \"But you can\u0027t let it affect you right now, understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know. I\u0027m trying to keep a cool head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good girl.\" A tinge of pride crept into his tone, though it remained dominated by fear. \"Listen, Katie, whatever the hell this is, it\u0027s all over the city. You need to get down to the police department. We\u0027re barricaded in and you\u0027ll be safe here. We got the National Guard on its way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Daddy. Okay. We\u0027ll be there as soon as we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katie, be careful.\" His voice was rich with emotion and she wiped a tear away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m armed, Daddy. I have a good vehicle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that little-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. A truck. I\u0027m in a truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How…nevermind…this day…too many weird things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie nodded and pressed the cell phone tighter to her ear, ignoring the little stab of her earring against her skin. \"Daddy, what are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know. The damn Ruskies are behind it. I know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe never could trust them. Everyone else is saying terrorists, but I\u0027m telling you, Katie, the Soviet Union never really died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t help but laugh a little. He was such a Cold War warrior. She could hear many voices behind him, demanding, questioning. Without a doubt her dear old dad was at the center of the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katie, I gotta go. I love you. Get here as soon as you can. Be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Daddy. Okay. Love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie snapped the phone shut and pressed it tightly against her lips. She couldn\u0027t think of Lydia right now. She couldn\u0027t think of how she had pulled up to their beautiful home to see Lydia tearing at the mailman with their neighbors at her side. She couldn\u0027t think of how Lydia had rushed toward her, not to kiss her and hold her and make the world better, but to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what they are,\" Jenni said softly beside her. She was intently staring at her feet, especially her one bloodstained toe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Well, what are they then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zombies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie laughed bitterly, then her voice died away as the crested a hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore them lay the city. It was smoldering. Down in the city, chaos ruled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven from their high position, they could see clearly that it was overrun. The things were every where.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katie, don\u0027t come here! Don\u0027t come here! I just got word in. It\u0027s not safe to come in. The National Guard was overrun. Don\u0027t come, Katie! Run! Get the hell out of the city! Keep safe, baby, keep safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie rested her forehead against the steering wheel. \"Daddy…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do it, baby. Just do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither he hung up or the lines finally went dead for suddenly there was nothing but a pulsing tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie looked up through the windshield as she clutched the steering wheel. A car sped past her and down the hill toward downtown. She watched it for several blocks and then it was overrun by a horde of those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to go now,\" Jenni\u0027s faint, singsong voice said. She turned her glassy gaze to Katie. \"We really do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie turned the wheel and they headed back up the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn here,\" Jenni said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie obeyed automatically. Tears streamed down her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni pointed again. \"Turn here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie turned the truck and sped down a back road that sliced behind the suburbs nestled into the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will take us far away from the city,\" Jenni sighed and reached down and cleaned her toe with the edge of her bathrobe. \"Away from the zombies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie whispered, \"There is no such thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what are they?\" Jenni\u0027s voice held a hint of emotion. \"Some bum bit Lloyd last night when he was coming home from work. This morning he ate my baby!\" Abruptly, her voice was on the edge of hysteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia racing toward her, bloody hands stretched out, her chest torn open…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie drew in a sharp breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they are not zombies, what are they?\" Jenni\u0027s voice was shrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie looked at her and reached out and grabbed Jenni\u0027s cold, clammy hand with her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zombies, okay, Jenni. They are zombies. And you\u0027re right. This is the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni sighed and nodded and laid her head against the back of the passenger seat. \"I know. I know…\" And she closed her eyes and slept\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Into the Hills\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni woke to the steady hum of the road. She opened her eyes slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nightmares released her and she sighed with relief. Her dreams were even worse than this new, horrible reality. In her sleep she had curled up, resting against the passenger door. Now raising her head, she saw the dry and caked blood her son had smeared on the window when he had tried in vain to reach her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for hugs and kisses, but for far worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the swath of gore the world was speeding by. Hills, large and small, covered in trees decked out in colorful spring flowers greeted her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime for Easter and Easter baskets. She would fill them with candies and toys and the kids were scramble around the backyard looking for colorful eggs. But that wouldn\u0027t happen now. It was all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLloyd had taken away her kids. Stolen them away. Just like she had known he would. Maybe he was something else when he had attacked them, but he had only finished out the cycle he had started when he had decided to marry his blushing eighteen year old bride. His looks, his money, and his success had blinded her. He was older and wiser. In her heart, she hadn\u0027t truly loved him, but she had believed she would one day. When he spoke of his first failed marriage, she had vowed that she would never let him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would be his perfect wife, his perfect companion, and that he would never have to say a negative word about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, she had failed him. No matter how hard she had tried, she had failed him. At first his lashings were verbal and fierce, then it was the back of his hand, and, eventually, it was his fists. But she had continued to try. She had struggled with her inadequacies, done everything he asked of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToward the end, she had known in her heart it would come to this. She would either die at his hand or he would kill the children as he had threatened to do so many times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he was a zombie in the end,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni blinked, not realizing she had spoken aloud. She turned slowly to gaze at the woman beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver of the truck was a very pretty lady with golden blond hair that fell just to her shoulders in tousled curls. She had a strong, pretty feminine face with cat-eyes and a sensuous mouth. Jenni was sure that the driver was the sort of girl who was the homecoming queen and head cheerleader and student council president all rolled into one. The smart, pretty girl who was actually nice. Jenni felt comforted by this. She had always been on the fringe of the popular girls. She understood this type. They lead, you followed. It was simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name was Katie. That was right. Katie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was dreaming,\" Jenni answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie nodded. \"You didn\u0027t miss anything. After the last traffic light on the edge of the neighborhood it was smooth sailing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one comes this way anymore. Not since the highway was built. I like it out here. It\u0027s peaceful.\" Jenni didn\u0027t feel so cold anymore. She still felt awfully numb, but it was a pleasant sort of numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure where we are going,\" Katie said after a beat. \"I\u0027m just driving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni looked at the phone resting on Katie\u0027s lap. \"Did you talk to your Dad again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie shook her head, pressing her lips tightly together for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. There\u0027s no signal.\" She motioned to the radio. \"And that doesn\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni nodded, understanding. They were alone, detached from the rest of the world. Strangely, this was how she often felt. It was almost comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, she was sure Katie would figure things out. She looked strong and very capable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll need gas soon,\" Katie said. \"Know if there are any stations out this way?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-3.html","bookId":2481,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM"}
