And it had taken all afternoon to forget the feel of her fingertips as they grazed his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis intention had been to send her away, hurt her if he had to, so the break would be final. He hadn’t grasped how much that would cost him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty hours later, he was still angry. Still in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking back into his living room at 2:00 a.m., Colby sank into the recliner and reached for the television remote control. Surely there’d be some movie playing that would hold his attention for an hour or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wrong. All he could find—other than infomercials and vapid talk shows—was a 1950s love story, filmed in nostalgic black and white. The last thing Colby was in the mood to watch was a sentimental romance with a happy ending. He turned off the television and stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t been out to the Bloomfields’ in three days. Although David was home and they’d scheduled an appointment at the office early in the week, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to stop by and see how the older man was recovering. They were friends, and it was the least Colby could do—for the sake of a longstanding friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat decision made, he found himself yawning loudly. Fatigue greeted him like an old comrade, and in that moment Colby knew he’d be able to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie was dressed, her suitcase packed. She’d lingered in her room far longer than necessary. Her flight wasn’t until 1:00 p.m.—not for another four hours—so she had plenty of time, yet she felt an intense need to be on her way. But there was another feeling that ran even deeper, even stronger: she dreaded leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Valerie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to see Steffie standing in her bedroom doorway, frowning as she glanced at the suitcase. “Are you sure you’re doing the right thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie gave her a wide and completely artificial smile. “I’m positive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you smile?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s such a beautiful morning, how could I possibly not smile? Dad’s home and thriving, you’re here, and Norah’s in seventh heaven because she’s got someone to cook for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteffie grinned. “Yeah, I know. But I can’t help feeling you shouldn’t go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My life’s in Texas now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteffie wandered into the room and sat on the edge of the bed. “If you’re running away, it’s a mistake. I made the same one myself three years ago. I embarrassed myself in front of Charles Tomaselli, and then because I was so mortified and because I couldn’t bear to face him, I decided to study in Europe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You had a wonderful opportunity to travel. Do you honestly regret it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Oh, not the travel and the experience. But leaving was wrong. I didn’t realize it then, but I do now. I went into hiding. I know that sounds melodramatic, but it’s the truth. At the time it seemed like the only thing to do, but I understand now that I should have swallowed my pride instead of walking away from everything I loved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes we don’t have any choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And sometimes we do,” Steffie said. “Don’t make the same mistake I did. Don’t run away, because at some point down the road, you’re going to regret it, just like I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sister’s eyes were intent, silently pleading with Valerie to reconsider. If she hadn’t gone to Colby the day before, Valerie might have hesitated, but there was no reason now for her to stay. There was no reason to hope Colby would change his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone’s coming,” Steffie said, walking over to look out Valerie’s bedroom window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie moved aside the white curtains and peered outside. Steffie was right. A maroon car was making its way down the long driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA surge of excitement shot through her. He’d come to tell her he’d changed his mind, to ask her not to leave. Only seconds before, she’d been so sure there was no hope and now it flowed through her like current into an electrical wire. Try as she might, she couldn’t squelch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It—it’s Colby,” Valerie said, when she found her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteffie gave a cry of sheer joy. “I knew it! I knew he wouldn’t be able to let you go. Everyone knows how he feels about you, how you feel about him. He’d be a fool if he let you go back to Texas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t know I was leaving today,” Valerie said calmly, although he must have figured it out for himself. He must’ve recognized that she wouldn’t stay in Orchard Valley any longer than necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll find out what he wants,” Steffie said, her voice high and excited. “Let’s play this cool, okay? You stay up here and when he asks for you, I’ll casually come and get you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Steffie…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Valerie, for heaven’s sake, be romantic for once in your life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There could be plenty of other reasons Colby’s here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to make him suffer, or are you going to forgive him right away? Personally, I think he should suffer…but only a little.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell chimed and Steffie hurried downstairs without another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie couldn’t keep her heart from racing, but she refused to play this silly game of wait-and-see. She reached for her suitcase and started resolutely down the stairs, the way she’d originally intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was on the top step when she heard Colby ask to see her father. Her father—not her. If it hadn’t hurt so much, Valerie would have laughed at Steffie, who looked completely stunned. Her sister stared at Colby, her mouth open, hand frozen on the door, blocking his entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My father,” Steffie repeated after a shocked moment. “You’re here to see Dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is my patient.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome slight sound must have alerted Colby that Valerie was standing at the top of the stairs. His gaze rose and linked with hers before slowly lowering to the suitcase in her hand. Valerie detected a frown, as though he’d been caught by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Valerie’s leaving for the airport this morning,” Steffie announced in a loud, urgent voice, implying that Colby had better do something fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Steffie hadn’t grasped was that Colby didn’t want to do anything—other than bid her a relieved farewell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should tell Dad that Dr. Winston’s here,” Valerie said mildly. “He’s probably in the kitchen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteffie left, and Valerie gradually descended the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks like you’re packed up and ready to go,” he said in a conversational tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “My flight leaves at one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So soon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not soon enough, though, is it, Colby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored the question, and Valerie regretted the pettiness that had prompted her to ask. He stood before her, his expression unreadable. She was grateful when her father appeared. Grateful because she wasn’t nearly as expert at hiding her feelings as Colby. She was afraid he could read much more of her emotional turmoil than she wanted him to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Colby, my boy, good to see you. You’ve been making yourself scarce the last few days.” David steered Colby into the kitchen, then glanced back at Valerie, scowling at the suitcase in her hand. “You’ve got plenty of time, Val. Come and have a cup of coffee before you leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor her father’s sake, she resisted the temptation to argue. Shrugging, she set her luggage aside and dutifully followed Colby and David into the large family kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men sat at the table while Norah served them coffee. Valerie didn’t sit with the others, but pulled out a stool in front of the counter and perched on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I’d check in and see how you were feeling,” Colby was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never felt better,” her father said in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie noticed how Colby avoided looking in her direction. He was uncomfortable with her; his back was stiff, his shoulders rigid with tension. Perhaps he’d expected her to have left by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie sipped her coffee and briefly closed her eyes, wanting to savor these last few moments with her family. Norah, an apron tied around her waist, was busy pulling hot cinnamon rolls out of the oven. Homemade ones, from the recipe their mother had used through the years. The scent of yeast and spice filled the kitchen, and it was like stepping back in time. Their kitchen had always been where everyone gathered, a place of warmth and laughter and confidences shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteffie couldn’t seem to stand still. She paced to one side of the room, then crossed to the other, as though debating her next course of action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie found it endearing that her sister cared so much about what happened between her and Colby, especially when Steffie’s own romance was so problematic. Valerie sensed that things weren’t going well between her sister and Charles Tomaselli, but she wasn’t in any position to be offering advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteffie paused, her eyes pleading with Valerie. She seemed to be begging her to stay in Orchard Valley. To listen to her heart…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment Valerie couldn’t meet her sister’s gaze and purposely looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversation floated past her, but she wasn’t aware of what was being said or who was saying it. The sudden need to leave was too powerful to ignore. If she didn’t do it soon, she might never be able to. Slipping down from the stool, she deposited her mug, still half full of coffee, in the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The rolls will be ready to eat any minute,” Norah said, looking at her anxiously. She, too, seemed to want Valerie to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, I’ll pick up something at the airport later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going?” her father asked, as if this was news to him. “You’ve still got lots of time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie gave the first excuse that came to mind. “I’ve got to get the rental car back to the agency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure you want to go?” Steffie asked forlornly, moving toward her sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure,” Valerie answered in a soft voice, throwing her arms around Steffie in an affectionate hug. “It isn’t like I’ll never be back, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t let it take you three years, the way it did me,” Steffie whispered into Valerie’s ear. “I just can’t help thinking you’re making a mistake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I’m doing is for the best,” Valerie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorah stood behind Steffie, waiting her turn to be hugged, her pretty blue eyes as sad as Steffie’s. “I can’t believe you’re really going. I loved having you home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s been good, hasn’t it, Dad?” Valerie said, trying to lighten the atmosphere. “I’d like to suggest another family reunion, only next time let’s plan things a bit differently. If I’m going to take three weeks away from CHIPS, I’d prefer to see more than a hospital waiting room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Bloomfield stood, his gaze holding Valerie’s. He seemed to be asking her to remain a little longer, but she firmly shook her head. Every minute was torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dared not look in Colby’s direction. That made it easier to pretend he wasn’t there. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/orchard-valley-grooms-orchard-valley-0/page-21.html","bookId":1979,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:05 AM"}
