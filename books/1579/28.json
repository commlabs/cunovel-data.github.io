On those nights, gathered around the fi re, snow fal ing harmlessly about them outside the Dome, they can almost imagine that the normal orbit of the world occurs inside the Dome and that it is the vaster outside world that is fal en, dysfunctional, afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater in the day, they grant me privacy for the wash I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd more: a towel, something called “soap,” and a promise not to peek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time when I strip off my clothes next to the pond, I feel a thousand times more self- conscious alone than when I threw off my briefs yesterday in front of Sissy. The very memory makes me cringe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wade into the pond and scrub myself. The soap thing produces miniature bubbles where it rubs against my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s scentless but removes body odor, they tel me. Perfect for my needs. Once in a while, I steal a furtive look at the mud hut they\u0027re all in. The doors and windows, as they\u0027ve promised, remain closed. I listen in that direction, expecting to catch some derisive laughter. But it\u0027s quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m scrubbing my hair underwater when I hear something pe-culiar. At fi rst, I think it\u0027s just my submerged ears playing tricks on me, but when I surface the sound is clearer. A melody of voices, warbling out of the mud hut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound is eerie yet beautiful. I stand captivated, water dripping off my hair into the pond, ripples breaking out in circular emanations around me. I wade out of the pond, toweling off even as I grab my clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt fi rst, they don\u0027t notice me. I peer through the front door, my damp hair dripping onto my hastily fl ung- on clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are seated in a circle, Ben and Jacob partial y facing me, their eyes closed as if in rapture. The warbling brings back memories of my mother. Times when she would sit on the edge of my bedding and stroke my hair, her face barely discernible in the gray darkness of the house. It\u0027s her voice I remember, more so than her face, lilted and unaffected by the sadness or despair that later hunched my father\u0027s shoulders down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil unseen, I move away from the entrance and sit outside, out of sight but with the front door cracked open so I can hear. With my back against the scrabbled wal of the mud hut, I let their voices wash over me, even as the warm rays of the descending sun fl ood over me. Everything about me feels warm and soft, as though the world has gone buttery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song ends and there is a short discussion about what next to sing. At least fi ve suggestions— they must have dozens in their repertoire— are quickly made before they settle on a song titled “Up High.” It begins slowly. At fi rst, it\u0027s only Sissy\u0027s voice, undulating with the peaks and boughs of the melody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground beneath your feet hums with the heat of the day\u0027s sun all alone, the heat trapped within your heartbeat until the night falls and the sun is done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other voices join in the chorus, harmonizing perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re so fl uid and fl awless, it\u0027s evident they\u0027ve sung this song hundreds of times before. Imprisoned by glass and distance, they probably have nothing else to do to while away the endless days but sing. Singing gives them what they most need: an il usion of hope, a transportation to other places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSailing through the bluest sky Above the hawks that sigh above the clouds that cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song, though haunting in places, has an undeniable catchiness about it. At fi rst, I just mouth the words. Then, almost unwittingly, I fi nd myself pushing air through my larynx, formu-lating sounds. But it\u0027s not easy. It\u0027s all croaks coming out of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something happens: it\u0027s as if a giant bal of phlegm in my throat is dislodged. For one verse, I hit the notes. For just those few moments, I\u0027m completely lost in the rhythm of the song. I ride it, a kite fl ung in the air, catching the sweetest of winds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe song ends, and there is laughter coming from inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey burst out seconds later, Ben leading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I heard an asthmatic dog wheezing to death out here,” Jacob says, friendly laughter dancing in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dog, what ever,” David says, smiling. “That was more like an elephant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More like a herd of elephants,” Ben says, so beside himself, he\u0027s hopping from one foot to the next. They\u0027re al laughing now, the sun playing off their hair, adding dots of light to their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunshine glimmers off the hairs on their arms, little puffs of dust kick up at their feet, their carefree voices ring into the bright air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C\u0027mon, it\u0027s funny, you have to admit it,” Sissy says to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face is all abandon and nakedness as she looks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a smile in her eyes, her nose, her mouth, her cheekbones, her forehead, all of it spil ing so infectiously outward to me, past me, fi l ing the world like the sun. She busts out with sweet laughter, her eyes closing in sheer delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, something trickles out of me I thought was long ago irretrievably lost. A laugh shakes out, guttural and coarse through disuse, bursting through my constricted vocal cords. And my face— there\u0027s no other way to describe this— rips apart like a cracked hard- boiled eggshel . A smile crinkles across my mouth, 164 ANDREW FUKUDA spreading along my face. I feel pieces of the mask fal ing off, like crusts of dried paint fl aking off a wal . I laugh louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the heck was that?” Jacob says. “Did a goril a just fart through its mouth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they crack up even more, their laughter lifting into the air, joined only moments later by the sound of my own laughter, guttural and coarse, free and thoughtless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave the Dome not because I want to but because I have to. Not that the Dome will be closing anytime soon— after yesterday\u0027s close cal , I\u0027m not taking any chances and I have at least fi fteen minutes to spare. I have to get back for some serious shut- eye. all two hours of what\u0027s left of the day, anyway. I\u0027ve been running on fumes the last few nights, and there\u0027s a real danger, not so much of dozing off during to night\u0027s Gala, but of getting careless in front of all the guests and cameras: a yawn, a frown, an unsuppressed cough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t get sloppy at such a crucial time. Just a couple more nights to hang on; then, as long as I can pul off my broken- leg stunt, I\u0027l be home free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith food and water in me, the walk back to the library seems so much shorter. What before was a signifi cant hike is now nothing more than a short strol . Even with the added weight of three ful bottles of water, I\u0027m halfway there before— Hello, what\u0027s this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, a dot, moving. Directly in front of the Institute building— no, not a dot, but a dark smear running. Toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freeze. There\u0027s nowhere to hide. Not a boulder to crouch behind, not even a depression in the ground into which to slink. It\u0027s got to be an animal lost out in the Vast. But then again, it\u0027s rare to see wildlife out here; most animals have learned not to stray too close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horse, I think to myself, it\u0027s got to be a horse, escaped out of the stable. Then I remember what my escort previously told me: There are no horses at the Institute out of fear the hepers might use them to escape. On rare occasions, like to night\u0027s Gala event, when guests arrive by horse back and carriages, the horses are kept under tight lock in the stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt runs closer, and I realize what it is. Not wildlife, not a horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve been spotted. Yet. I quickly prostrate myself, my chin jutting into the crusty desert soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s one of the hunters, it has to be, testing out one of the accessories. Donning the SunCloak or the SunBlock Lotion. Judging from the bulbous hooded shape around the head, probably the SunCloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I realize its intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hepers. It\u0027s making a break for the hepers, trying to get at them before the protective Dome emerges. And now, just minutes from the Dome\u0027s closing and with the sun rays less potent, is its chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, a door on the ground fl oor of the Institute building swings open. And something— someone—shoots out like a racing horse out of the blocks. It moves with wicked speed, a blur. Moving straight toward the heper vil age. Or me. I\u0027m lying in a direct line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cloaked fi gure is at a ful sprint now— I can see arms pumping hard, legs pounding the ground. But it\u0027s the second fi gure that\u0027s just emerged that is far quicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, it\u0027s covered half the distance between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin no more than ten seconds, both are close enough for me to recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cloaked fi gure is Ashley June, her pointed chin unmistakable under the hood. There\u0027s something off about her. But my attention is quickly diverted to the sprinting fi gure almost caught up to her now— Beefy. His appearance is bizarre and frightening. He\u0027s smeared over completely with the SunBlock Lotion, the rich yel ow white cream lathered SunBlock Lotion, the rich yel ow white cream lathered thickly over his torso like icing on cake. He\u0027s completely naked (for speed?) except for a pair of black goggles pul ed tight over his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leap up, dropping the bottles of water, and sprint. Not to the library— it\u0027s too far away. But to the Dome. I\u0027l pretend to be joining the Hunt, make them think I\u0027m running with the pack. That\u0027s the only way I can explain being outside. True, I have neither SunCloak nor SunBlock Lotion, but I\u0027m hoping that detail will be forgotten in the excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt works. Ashley June runs past me, laboring— the SunCloak is not working, the sunlight is getting to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, Beefy fl ashes by, the smel of the lotion overpowering. Nobody says anything: we\u0027re competition to one another; it\u0027s survival of the fi ttest, not friendliest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, the sun emerges from behind a cloud. Shafts of light blaze across the Vast, bringing a hazy quality to the air. But it\u0027s not haze to Ashley June and Beefy. It\u0027s a shower of concentrated acid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley June fal s to her knees, crumpling in a pile of clothes. Beefy seizes up, stumbling. In the dusk light, the cream on his body glows with an eerie yel ow luminescence, jaundice on radiation ste roids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil he pushes on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give chase. I smel something else, the raw burn of fl esh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SunBlock Lotion is useless; the sun is penetrating right through it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-28.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
