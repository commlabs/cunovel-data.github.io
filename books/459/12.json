Men, outside his own profession, were mere figures to him. They did n\u0027t count. He spoke to them in the chit-chat of the day, and when they mentioned architecture, he changed the subject deftly. The alembication of engineering and art they could n\u0027t understand, so why talk of it? Women he didn\u0027t mind so much. They had a soft place in his heart, because they had been good to him as a boy and child whom there had been few to care for.... And he had had his little love-affairs, natural as the phases of the moonâ€”calf-love, sentiment, adoration, passion. They had loitered, knocked, passed by. None had ever touched that inmost self of him to whom God had once called and said seriously: \"You are to build bridges.\" \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then he saw Cecily Stanford coming toward him with her serious shining eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90006.html","bookId":459,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:28:37 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:28:37 PM"}
