Stress brought on nightmares for him, so I pulled out my phone and texted him. Dream of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis response was so perfectly Gideon, it brought a smile to my face. Fly faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just that quick, I knew he was back on his game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow.” I stared out the window of the jet as it taxied to a halt at a private airport on the outskirts of Rio. “Now, that’s a view.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding on the tarmac were Gideon, Arnoldo, Manuel, and Arash. All dressed casually in long shorts and T-shirts. All dark-haired and tall. Beautifully muscular. Tanned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were lined up like a row of exotic, outrageously expensive sports cars. Powerful, sexy, dangerously fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no doubts about my husband’s fidelity, but if there had been any, looking at him would’ve settled them. His friends were loose-limbed and relaxed, their engines cooled by long, hard rides. That they’d enjoyed Rio—and its women—was stamped all over them. Gideon, however, was taut. Watchful. His motor was running, purring with the need to roar from zero to sixty in the space of a pounding heartbeat. No one had given my man a test drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had come to him with the intent to soothe, to strategize, to take a bit of my wounded pride back. Instead, I was going to be the driver who burned his fuel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a slight bump as the rolling staircase was positioned against the jet. Clancy exited first. My mom followed. I went after her, pausing at the top of the stairs to snap a picture with my phone. The image of Gideon and his friends was going to give the Internet something else to talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the first step down and Gideon moved, his arms unfolding as he closed the distance between us. I couldn’t see his eyes, only myself in the reflection of his lenses, but I felt the intensity with which he had me in his sights. It made my knees weak, forcing me to hold on to the handrail for balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook Clancy’s hand. He endured and even managed to reciprocate a brief hug from my mother. But he never took his eyes off me or slowed more than a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d put on red fuck-me heels for him. Tight, white shorts barely covered my ass and fastened well below my navel. My top was red lace, with thin straps. A red satin ribbon secured the corsetlike back. I had clipped my hair in a messy updo. Gideon made it messier when he caught me up on the last step and shoved his hand into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth sealed over mine, as if he hadn’t noticed the red gloss I’d slicked on my lips. I was held suspended in his embrace, my feet off the ground, his arm banded tightly around my waist. Wrapping myself around him, I locked my ankles together at the small of his back, pushing up so that his head tilted back and I curved around him, my tongue licking deep into his mouth. The hand he’d had in my hair slid down to cup and support me, his grip kneading my ass in the demanding, possessive way I loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s fucking hot,” Cary said from somewhere behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManuel gave a piercing whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t care less what kind of spectacle we made. Gideon’s hard body felt delicious and the taste of him was intoxicating. My thoughts scattered. I wanted to ride him, rub up against him. I wanted him naked and sweaty, covered in my scent. On his face, his hands, his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy husband wasn’t the only one who wanted to mark his territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva Lauren,” my mother scolded. “Get ahold of yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of my mom’s voice cooled us both off instantly. I unwound my legs from his hips and let him ease me down until I was standing again. I pulled away reluctantly, my hands briefly lifting Gideon’s sunglasses so I could look into his eyes. Fury … lust …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped the traces of my lip gloss off his mouth with my fingers. His lips were swollen from the passion of our kiss, the sensual curves softened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cupped my face in his hands, his thumbs brushing over my lips. Urging my head back, he kissed the tip of my nose. He was tender now, his ferocious joy at seeing me tempered by having touched me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva,” Arnoldo said, coming up beside me with a small smile on his handsome face. “So good to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to greet him, feeling nervous. I wanted us to be friends. I wanted him to forgive me for hurting Gideon. I wanted—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me full on the mouth. Stunned, I didn’t react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Off!” Gideon snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not a dog,” Arnoldo shot back. He looked at me with amusement. “He has been pining for you. Now, you can release him from his torment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy anxiety faded. He was warmer toward me than he’d been recently, more like he’d been when we were first introduced. “It’s really good to see you, too, Arnoldo.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-93.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
