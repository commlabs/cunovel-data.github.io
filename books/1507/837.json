This was especially true considering everything she had said in front of Meng Hao’s parents. When she thought about that, her scalp went numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise, how could Meng Hao forget all of the venomous things she had said just moments ago? He reached out and took the bottle, looked at it, then threw it back to Fang Xiangshan. The bottle was not unfamiliar to him; there had been many like it inside the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it had the music of a Dao inside, that was simply because it had existed inside the temple for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring Fang Xiangshan, Meng Hao turned and transformed into a beam of light that shot off into the distance. When he finally disappeared, the three old Dao Protectors sighed and helped the injured Fang Yunyi to his feet, then took him and terrified Fang Xiangshan off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral days passed by in a flash. During that time, Meng Hao traveled around in the Eastern Lands, mostly in the area surrounding the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple mountains. He didn’t reveal his appearance or aura, but instead concealed it with the bamboo hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for clothing, he pulled out a long robe that had belonged to Sun Hai from the Church of the Emperor Immortal. He roamed through the area slowly, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting… for those two damned bandits!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How dare they steal business from me!” he thought, his expression dark. Meng Hao had long since been brooding about the two mysterious bandits who had stolen all the items that belonged to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless I’m mistaken, I know exactly which bastards pulled such a shameless stunt!” He snorted coldly as he flew through midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those two bastards fled during my battle with the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, and haven’t dared to show their faces since then. This time, I’ll definitely track them down!” For some reason, Meng Hao was certain that there was no one other than the meat jelly and the parrot who could have accomplished something that caused him to lose out on so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although, those two little bastards aren’t that strong. How could they have managed to rob so many Chosen?” Meng Hao was very curious about this, and it was the one thing he couldn’t figure out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did they come across some sort of good fortune?” he thought suspiciously. He continued to fly through midair in the region near the mountain range. Three days passed, until finally, he ran into one of the Eastern Lands’ walled cities. He glanced at it, then slowly and deliberately flew around in the city a few times before finally making his way off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he didn’t notice was that in one of the city’s inns, two pairs of eyes were surreptitiously peering out at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo burly fellows, tall and sturdy, were at a table slurping alcohol and chomping down on meat. One of them sat cross-legged in a chair, the other squatted down next to the table. Apparently, those were the only positions that were comfortable to these two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven stranger, the burly fellow who sat there cross-legged would drink the alcohol in huge slurps, and would toss enormous quantities of food into his mouth with each bite. As for the other man, he… pecked at his food almost like a bird would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you see that?” said the bird-like man. He blinked, and then a wily gleam appeared in his eyes as he watched Meng Hao disappear off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” said the other man, looking up to stare at Meng Hao’s retreating figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You idiot!” said the bird-like man, smacking the other man hard across the head. “Fool! Get a brain, would you!! Lord Fifth has hauled you around for so many years now! How could you still be so stupid!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?!” roared the big man, food spraying from his mouth, revealing dancing electricity inside. “You’re being immoral! You’re being shameless! This isn’t right! I’m gonna convert you!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quiet down,” said the bird-like man self-assuredly. “Listen to me, did you see that guy with the bamboo hat? He was hiding his aura. That hat is definitely some kind of treasure!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Treasure!?” said the big man, his eyes lighting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. Definitely a treasure. Based on my experience, people who carry treasures like that are usually weaklings. They’re basically lambs waiting for the slaughter!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have faith in the Lord Fifth; that guy is definitely an easy mark! Furthermore, his cultivation base probably isn’t very high, but his bag of holding is probably very deep. Did you see his clothes? Not too long ago, we robbed a guy who was wearing clothes exactly like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most important of all, he clearly doesn’t want people to recognize him. That indicates he has secrets! Secrets, I tell you!” The bird-like man was continuing to get more and more excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Secrets!” exclaimed the big man, his eyes glowing brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With secrets like that, and a weak cultivation base, plus a plump bag of holding… he’s definitely ripe for the plucking. Besides, a single look, and you can tell he’s the kind of person who knows how to dress well. He’s the perfect mark for us. Trust me, if we can clean him out, then we’ll be able to live in complete comfort.” The bird-like man was even more excited than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man’s eyes gleamed brightly, but then he hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we failed so many other times, and even almost got captured. Especially in the past few days. Whenever you take on HIS appearance, we end up getting chased by everyone…. Wait, is he a bully?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got it!” said the bird-like man, nodding. “Of course he’s a bully. He couldn’t be anything else! Look, we’ll definitely succeed this time, just have faith in the Lord Fifth. All the other times were mere mishaps. Those Chosen have all left, so the only people left behind have got to be easy marks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Straighten him out!” said the big man, clenching his jaw and nodding his head. “Fudge, Lord Third is gonna set him straight!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on, let Lord Fifth plan this out. A person like that, hmm… there’s an eighty to ninety percent chance that he’s a ladies man. Okay, we can’t use the same tactic that we used before. This time, we’ll directly implement plan #9. Quickly, transform into a hot babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“#9? Which one is nine? How dare you ridicule Lord Third!!” the big man raged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh… #3! Plan #3!!” replied the bird-like man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well why didn’t you say so earlier? Alright, who should I look like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anybody, it doesn’t matter, as long as she’s hot and seductive. Come, hurry up, we need to go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hot and seductive?” The big man thought for a moment, and then a popping sound rang out as he changed form. Now he was a woman, extremely curvaceous and completely alluring, with a beautiful, entrancing face, and eyes that tugged at the heart and soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Meng Hao were here, he would instantly recognize that this was… Demoness Zhixiang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too many clothes!” said the bird-like man. “Come on, less clothes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePop!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man changed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now you’re way too revealing! Y-y-you, you idiot! How could you even go outside looking like that!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter seven or eight adjustments, the bird-like man was satisfied and prodded the other man out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man in Zhixiang form wore extremely revealing clothes, and felt completely resentful because of it. Consequently, he started picking his nose and making big, manly strides as they walked down the road, causing the bird-like man to fly into a rage. More adjustments were made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao had just left the city. Beneath the bamboo hat, he was frowning. After traveling around the area near the mountain range for all these days, he still hadn’t run into the two bastards he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could they have left?” he thought. “Or maybe they detected my aura?” Suddenly, his face flickered, and he spun around. There, in midair not too far off, a woman was approaching him. An anxious expression could be seen on her face, as if she were being pursued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant the woman appeared, Meng Hao’s jaw dropped in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis woman was none other than Zhixiang, which was of course the big man in disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore revealing clothing, and smelled like a spring breeze. She possessed an alluring charm and grace, and had a flirtatious look in her eyes, eyes that seemed capable of enchanting anyone who looked into them. Most people who laid eyes on her would instantly find their hearts pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she passed Meng Hao, she looked over and smiled shyly. Then she made to hurry off. However, before she could get very far, she turned and looked back at him, apparently having been attracted to him in some way. She gave him an entrancing, tantalizing look, then turned and walked off, her curves undulating gently. The sight of her slender figure from behind was enough to cause any man who saw her to palpitate with eagerness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao gaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Zhixiang’ was not happy at all, and was inwardly muttering about how obvious things had been made, and yet the mark didn\u0027t respond at all. Instead, he just stared with a slack jaw. Finally, ‘Zhixiang’ intentionally spit out a mouthful of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face went pale, and she staggered in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fellow Daoist, save me!” she cried, looking back at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes were wide as he examined ‘Zhixiang.’ Then, a virtually imperceptible smile appeared in his eyes. Grinning, he approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With me here,” he said, “you have nothing to fear, Fellow Daoist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone’s chasing me,” said ‘Zhixiang’ lightly, her voice somewhat weak and yet even more enticing than before. “As I fled, I was injured. Fellow Daoist, if you can escort me to my Immortal’s cave, then I’ll definitely be very grateful….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInwardly, Meng Hao laughed loudly, and mused about how fake this whole act was, and yet he smiled the same as before, and immediately nodded. Then, he flew into the air with the woman. The two of them sped into the mountains, to an Immortal’s cave. The woman gestured for him to follow her inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, Meng Hao’s eyes narrowed. The Immortal’s cave seemed extraordinary. The spell formation outside radiated a sense of danger, and based on Meng Hao’s cultivation base, he knew that even he would have a tough time breaking out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter stepping into the Immortal’s cave, the woman sighed, and then stopped and turned to Meng Hao with a charming smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Many thanks, Fellow Daoist,” she said, intentionally edging closer to him. “Would you mind acting as Dharma Protector for me here? Once my wounds are recovered, I’ll definitely repay your kindness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, no problem!” said Meng Hao, suppressing the urge to vomit. He backed up a few steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disguised man frowned. Things weren’t going according to plan, and now he wasn’t sure what to do. He quickly stamped his foot onto the ground, which instantly sent a secret notification to the bird-like man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few breaths of time passed, the door of the Immortal’s cave slammed open, and a monstrous aura surged out that gave Meng Hao quite a shock. A man emerged, wearing black robes, his features handsome. He even emanated the aura of a scholar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you’re back, wife!” said the young man, laughing. However, when he saw Meng Hao and ‘Zhixiang,’ he suddenly stopped in place, and then his eyes went wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Slut! Y-you’re actually committing adultery right here!?!?” The young man’s face twisted with rage, and his aura exploded with power. Heaven and Earth went dark, and everything began to tremble and seemed to be on the verge of exploding. The door of the Immortal’s cave exploded, and the shocking spell formation Meng Hao had seen collapsed into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA terrifying aura raged out that far exceeded the Spirit Realm. It was incredibly powerful, and made it seem as if an Immortal was descending. The entire area was instantly locked down, causing an intense sense of deadly crisis to rise up in Meng Hao’s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as if the person standing in front of him had an aura that could easily decide whether or not he lived or died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Husband, this is all just a misunderstanding….” said ‘Zhixiang.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Misunderstanding my ass! Get the hell out of my way! Since we\u0027re husband and wife, I won’t kill you this day. However, this paramour of yours had better give me some compensation! I don’t care what sect he comes from, when the one surnamed Meng wants a person dead, who would dare to save him!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered as he looked at the young man, and a strange expression appeared on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis young man looked… exactly like Meng Hao himself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Meng Hao was wearing the bamboo hat, which changed his appearance in such a way that no one would be able to recognize him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 833: An Amateurish Seduction Con\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-832\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-834\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-833","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
