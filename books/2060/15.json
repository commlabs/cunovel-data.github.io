He was carrying a box of books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got them,\" he said. \"Hurry and take them before you get in trouble for talking to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed them over, and I grunted. They were heavy. \"Christian gave you these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Managed to talk to him without anyone noticing. He\u0027s got kind of an attitude, did you ever notice that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I noticed.\" I rewarded Mason with a smile that he ate up. \"Thanks. This means a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hauled the loot up to my room, fully aware of how weird it was that someone who hated to study as much as I did was about to get buried in dusty crap from the fourteenth century. When I opened the first book, though, I saw that these must be reprints of reprints of reprints, probably because anything that old would have long since fallen apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSifting through the books, I discovered they fell into three categories: books written by people after St. Vladimir had died, books written by other people when he was still alive, and one diary of sorts written by him. What had Mason said about primary and secondary sources? Those last two groups were the ones I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever had reprinted these had reworded the books enough so that I didn\u0027t have to read Ye Olde English or anything. Or rather, Russian, I supposed. St. Vladimir had lived in the old country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I healed the mother of Sava who has long since suffered from sharp pains within her stomach. Her malady is now gone, but God has not allowed me to do such a thing lightly. I am weak and dizzy, and the madness is trying to leak into my head. I thank God every day for shadow-kissed Anna, for without her, I would surely not be able to endure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna again. And \"shadow-kissed.\" He talked about her a lot, among other things. Most of the time he wrote long sermons, just like what I\u0027d hear in church. Super boring. But other times, the book read just like a diary, recapping what he did each day. And if it really wasn\u0027t just a load of crap, he healed all the time. Sick people. Injured people. Even plants. He brought dead crops back to life when people were starving. Sometimes he would make flowers bloom just for the hell of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReading on, I found out that it was a good thing old Vlad had Anna around, because he was pretty messed up. The more he used his powers, the more they started to get to him. He\u0027d get irrationally angry and sad. He blamed it on demons and stupid stuff like that, but it was obvious he suffered from depression. Once, he admitted in his diary, he tried to kill himself. Anna stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, browsing through the book written by the guy who knew Vladimir, I read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd many think it miraculous too, the power the blessed Vladimir shows over others. Moroi and dhampirs flock to him and listen to his words, happy just to be near him. Some say it is madness that touches him and not spirit, but most adore him and would do anything he asked. Such is the way God marks his favorites, and if such moments are followed by hallucinations and despair, it is a small sacrifice for the amount of good and leadership he can show among the people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded a lot like what the priest had said, but I sensed more than just a \"winning personality\" People adored him, would do anything he asked. Yes, Vladimir had used compulsion on his followers, I was certain. A lot of Moroi had in those days, before it was banned, but they didn\u0027t use it on Moroi or dhampirs. They couldn\u0027t. Only Lissa could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut the book and leaned back against my bed. Vladimir healed plants and animals. He could use compulsion on a massive scale. And by all accounts, using those sorts of powers had made him crazy and depressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdded into it all, making it that much weirder was that everyone kept describing his guardian as \"shadow-kissed.\" That expression had bugged me ever since I first heard it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re shadow-kissed! You have to take care of her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Karp had shouted those words at me, her hands clenching my shirt and jerking me toward her. It had happened on a night two years ago when I\u0027d been inside the main part of the upper school to return a book. It was nearly past curfew, and the halls were empty. I\u0027d heard a loud commotion, and then Ms. Karp had come tearing around the corner, looking frantic and wild-eyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoved me into a wall, still gripping me. \"Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew enough self-defense that I could have probably pushed her away, but my shock kept me frozen. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re coming for me. They\u0027ll come for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lissa. You have to protect her. The more she uses it, the worse it\u0027ll get. Stop her, Rose. Stop her before they notice, before they notice and take her away too. Get her out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...what do you mean? Get her out of...you mean the Academy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! You have to leave. You\u0027re bound. It\u0027s up to you. Take her away from this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words were crazy. No one left the Academy. Yet as she held me there and stared into my eyes, I began to feel strange. A fuzzy feeling clouded my mind. What she said suddenly sounded very reasonable, like the most reasonable thing in the world. Yes. I needed to take Lissa away, take her -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeet pounded in the hallway, and a group of guardians rounded the corner. I didn\u0027t recognize them; they weren\u0027t from the school. They pried her off of me, restraining her wild thrashing. Someone asked me if I was okay, but I could only keep staring at Ms. Karp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let her use the power!\" she screamed. \"Save her. Save her from herself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guardians had later explained to me that she wasn\u0027t well and had been taken to a place where she could recover. She would be safe and cared for, they assured me. She would recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly she hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the present, I stared at the books and tried to put it all together. Lissa. Ms. Karp. St. Vladimir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was I supposed to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone rapped at my door, and I jerked out of my memories. No one had visited me, not even staff, since my suspension. When I opened the door, I saw Mason in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twice in one day?\" I asked. \"And how\u0027d you even get up here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed his easy smile. \"Someone put a lit match in one of the bathroom\u0027s garbage cans. Damn shame. The staff\u0027s kind of busy. Come on, I\u0027m springing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. Setting fires was apparently a new sign of affection. Christian had done it and now Mason. \"Sorry, no saving me tonight. If I get caught - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lissa\u0027s orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut up and let him smuggle me out of the building. He took me over to the Moroi dorm and miraculously got me in and up to her room unseen. I wondered if there was a distracting bathroom fire in this building too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside her room, I found a party in full swing. Lissa, Camille, Carly, Aaron, and a few other royals sat around laughing, listening to loud music, and passing around bottles of whiskey. No Mia, no Jesse. Natalie, I noticed a few moments later, sat apart from the group, clearly unsure how to act around all of them. Her awkwardness was totally obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa stumbled to her feet, the fuzzy feelings in our bond indicating she\u0027d been drinking for a while. \"Rose!\" She turned to Mason with a dazzling smile. \"You delivered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swept her an over-the-top bow. \"I\u0027m at your command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped he\u0027d done it for the thrill of it and not because of any compulsion. Lissa slung an arm around my waist and pulled me down with the others. \"Join the festivities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we celebrating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Your escape tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few of the others held up plastic cups, cheering and toasting me. Xander Badica poured two more cups, handing them to Mason and me. I took mine with a smile, all the while feeling uneasy about the night\u0027s turn of events. Not so long ago, I would have welcomed a party like this and would have downed my drink in thirty seconds. Too much bothered me this time, though. Like the fact that the royals were treating Lissa like a goddess. Like how none of them seemed to remember that I had been accused of being a blood whore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike how Lissa was completely unhappy despite her smiles and laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get the whiskey?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Nagy,\" Aaron said. He sat very close to Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone knew Mr. Nagy drank all the time after school and kept a stash on campus. He continually used new hiding places - and students continually found them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa leaned against Aaron\u0027s shoulder. \"Aaron helped me break into his room and take them. He had them hidden in the bottom of the paint closet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others laughed, and Aaron gazed at her with complete and utter worship. Amusingly, I realized she hadn\u0027t had to use any compulsion on him. He was just that crazy for her. He always had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why aren\u0027t you drinking?\" Mason asked me a little while later, speaking quietly into my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down at my cup, half surprised to see it full. \"I don\u0027t know. I guess I don\u0027t think guardians should drink around their charges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not your charge yet! You aren\u0027t on duty. You won\u0027t be for a long time. Since when did you get so responsible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t really think I was all that responsible. But I was thinking about what Dimitri had said about balancing fun and obligation. It just seemed wrong to let myself go wild when Lissa was in such a vulnerable state lately. Wiggling out of my tight spot between her and Mason, I walked over and sat beside Natalie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey Nat, you\u0027re quiet tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held a cup as full as mine. \"So are you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed softly. \"I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head, watching Mason and the royals like they were some sort of science experiment. They\u0027d consumed a lot more whiskey since I\u0027d arrived, and the silliness had shot up considerably. \"Weird, huh? You used to be the center of attention. Now she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked in surprise. I hadn\u0027t considered it like that. \"I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Rose,\" said Xander, nearly spilling his drink as he walked over to me. \"What was it like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was what like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Letting someone feed off you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others fell quiet, a sort of anticipation settling over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t do that,\" said Lissa in a warning voice. \"I told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, I know nothing happened with Jesse and Ralf. But you guys did it, right? While you were gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let it go,\" said Lissa. Compulsion worked best with direct eye contact, and his attention was focused on me, not her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, it\u0027s cool and everything. You guys did what you had to do, right? It\u0027s not like you\u0027re a feeder. I just want to know what it was like. Danielle Szelsky let me bite her once. She said it didn\u0027t feel like anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a collective \"ew\" from among the girls. Sex and blood with dhampirs was dirty; between Moroi, it was cannibalistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are such a liar,\" said Camille.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m serious. It was just a small bite. She didn\u0027t get high like the feeders. Did you?\" He put his free arm around my shoulder. \"Did you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa\u0027s face went still and pale. Alcohol muted the full force of her feelings, but I could read enough to know how she felt. Dark, scared thoughts trickled into me - underscored with anger. She usually had a good grip on her temper - unlike me - but I\u0027d seen it flare up before. Once it had happened at a party very similar to this one, just a few weeks after Ms. Karp had been taken away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreg Dashkov - a distant cousin of Natalie\u0027s - had held the party in his room. His parents apparently knew someone who knew someone, because he had one of the biggest rooms in the dorm. He\u0027d been friends with Lissa\u0027s brother before the accident and had been more than happy to take Andre\u0027s little sister into his social fold. Greg had also been happy to take me in, and the two of us had been all over each other that night. For a sophomore like me, being with a royal Moroi senior was a huge rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank a lot that night but still managed to keep an eye on Lissa. She always wore an edge of anxiety around this many people, but no one really noticed, because she could interact with them so well. My heavy buzz kept a lot of her feelings from me, but as long as she looked okay, I didn\u0027t worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMid-kiss, Greg suddenly broke away and looked at something over my shoulder. We both sat in the same chair, with me on his lap, and I craned my neck to see. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head with a sort of amused exasperation. \"Wade brought a feeder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed his gaze to where Wade Voda stood with his arm around a frail girl about my age. She was human and pretty, with wavy blond hair and porcelain skin pale from so much blood loss. A few other guys had homed on her and stood with Wade, laughing and touching her face and hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s already fed too much today,\" I said, observing her coloring and complete look of confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreg slid his hand behind my neck and turned me back to him. \"They won\u0027t hurt her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kissed a while longer and then I felt a tap on my shoulder. \"Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up into Lissa\u0027s face. Her anxious expression startled me because I couldn\u0027t feel the emotions behind it. Too much beer for me. I climbed off of Greg\u0027s lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be right back.\" I pulled Lissa aside, suddenly wishing I was sober. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded toward the guys with the feeder girl. She still had a group around her, and when she shifted to look at one of them, I saw small red wounds scattered on her neck. They were doing a sort of group feeding, taking turns biting her and making gross suggestions. High and oblivious, she let them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t do that,\" Lissa told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a feeder. Nobody\u0027s going to stop them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa looked up at me with pleading eyes. Hurt, outrage, and anger filled them. \"Will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d always been the aggressive one, looking after her ever since we were little. Seeing her there now, so upset and looking at me to fix things, was more than I could stand. Giving her a shaky nod, I stumbled over to the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You so desperate to get some that you\u0027ve got to drug girls now, Wade?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up from where he\u0027d been running his lips over the human girl\u0027s neck. \"Why? Are you done with Greg and looking for more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands on my hips and hoped I looked fierce. The truth was, I was actually starting to feel a little nauseous from all I\u0027d drunk. \"Aren\u0027t enough drugs in the world to get me near you,\" I told him. A few of his friends laughed. \"But maybe you can go make out with that lamp over there. It seems to be out of it enough to make even you happy. You don\u0027t need her anymore.\" A few other people laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t any of your business,\" he hissed. \"She\u0027s just lunch.\" Referring to feeders as meals was about the only thing worse than calling dhampirs blood whores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a feeding room. Nobody wants to see this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" agreed a senior girl. \"It\u0027s gross.\" A few of her friends agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWade glared at all of us, me the hardest. \"Fine. None of you have to see it. Come on.\" He grabbed the feeder girl\u0027s arm and jerked her away. Clumsily, she stumbled along with him out of the room, making soft whimpering noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best I could do,\" I told Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me, shocked. \"He\u0027s just going to take her to his room. He\u0027ll do even worse things to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liss, I don\u0027t like it either, but it\u0027s not like I can go chase him down or anything.\" I rubbed my forehead. \"I could go punch him or something, but I feel like I\u0027m going to throw up as it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face grew dark, and she bit her lip. \"He can\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned to the chair with Greg, feeling a little bad about what had happened. I didn\u0027t want to see the feeder get taken advantage of anymore than Lissa did - it reminded me too much of what a lot of Moroi guys thought they cold do to dhampir girls. But I also couldn\u0027t win this battle, not tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreg had shifted me around to get a better angle on my neck when I noticed Lissa was gone a few minutes later. Practically falling, I clambered off his lap and looked around. \"Where\u0027s Lissa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for me. \"Probably the bathroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t feel a thing through the bond. The alcohol had numbed it. Stepping out into the hallway, I breathed a sigh of relief at escaping the loud music and voices. It was quiet out here - except for a crashing sound a couple rooms down. The door was ajar, and I pushed my way inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeder girl cowered in a corner, terrified. Lissa stood with arms crossed, her face angry and terrible. She was staring at Wade intently, and he stared back, enchanted. He also held a baseball bat, and it looked like he\u0027d used it already, because the room was trashed: bookshelves, the stereo, the mirror...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Break the window too,\" Lissa told him smoothly. \"Come on. It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHypnotized, he walked over to the large, tinted window. I stared, my mouth nearly hitting the floor, as he pulled back and slammed the bat into the glass. It shattered, sending shards everywhere and letting in the early morning light it normally kept blocked out. He winced as it shone in his eyes, but he didn\u0027t move away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lissa,\" I exclaimed. \"Stop it. Make him stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He should have stopped earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI barely recognized the look on her face. I\u0027d never seen her so upset, and I\u0027d certainly never seen her do anything like this. I knew what it was, of course. I knew right away. Compulsion. For all I knew, she was seconds away from having him turn the bat on himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Lissa. Don\u0027t do it anymore. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the fuzzy, alcoholic buzz, I felt a trickle of her emotions. They were strong enough to practically knock me over. Black. Angry. Merciless. Startling feelings to be coming from sweet and steady Lissa. I\u0027d known her since kindergarten, but in that moment, I barely knew her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Lissa,\" I repeated. \"He\u0027s not worth it. Let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t look at me. Her stormy eyes were focused entirely on Wade. Slowly carefully, he lifted up the bat, tilting it so that it lined up with his own skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liss,\" I begged. Oh God. I was going to have to tackle her or something to make her stop. \"Don\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He should have stopped,\" Lissa said evenly. The bat quit moving. It was now at exactly the right distance to gain momentum and strike. \"He shouldn\u0027t have done that to her. People can\u0027t treat other people like that - even feeders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re scaring her,\" I said softly. \"Look at her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened at first, then Lissa let her gaze flick toward the feeder. The human girl still sat huddled in a corner, arms wrapped around herself protectively. Her blue eyes were enormous, and light reflected off her wet, tear-streaked face. She gave a choked, terrified sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa\u0027s face stayed impassive. Inside her, I could feel the battle she was waging for control. Some part of her didn\u0027t want to hurt Wade, despite the blinding anger that otherwise filled her. Her face crumpled, and she squeezed her eyes shut. Her right hand reached out to her left wrist and clenched it, nails digging deep into the flesh. She flinched at the pain, but through the bond, I felt the shock of the pain distract her from Wade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let go of the compulsion, and he dropped the bat, suddenly looking confused. I let go of the breath I\u0027d been holding. In the hallway, footsteps sounded. I\u0027d left the door open, and the crash had attracted attention. A couple of dorm staff members burst into the room, freezing when they saw the destruction in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of us looked at each other. Wade looked completely lost. He stared at the room, at the bat, and then at Lissa and me. \"I don\u0027t know...I can\u0027t...\" He turned his full attention to me and suddenly grew angry. \"What the - it was you! You wouldn\u0027t let the feeder thing go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dorm workers looked at me questioningly, and in a few seconds, I made up my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to protect her. The more she uses it, the worse it\u0027ll get. Stop her, Rose. Stop her before they notice, before they notice and take her away too. Get her out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see Ms. Karp\u0027s face in my mind, pleading frantically. I gave Wade a haughty look, knowing full well no one would question a confession I made or even suspect Lissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, if you\u0027d let her go,\" I told him, \"I wouldn\u0027t have had to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSave her. Save her from herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that night, I never drank again. I refused to let my guard down around Lissa. And two days later, while I was supposed to be suspended for \"destruction of property,\" I took Lissa and broke out of the Academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in Lissa\u0027s room, with Xander\u0027s arm around me and her angry and upset eyes on us, I didn\u0027t know if she\u0027d do anything drastic again. But the situation reminded me too much of that one from two years ago, and I knew I had to defuse it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little blood,\" Xander was saying. \"I won\u0027t take much. I just want to see what dhampir tastes like. Nobody here cares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Xander,\" growled Lissa, \"leave her alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped out from under his arm and smiled, looking for a funny retort rather than one that might start a fight. \"Come on,\" I teased. \"I had to hit the last guy who asked me that, and you\u0027re a hell of a lot prettier than Jesse. It\u0027d be a waste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m stunningly sexy but not pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarly laughed. \"No, you\u0027re pretty. Todd told me you buy some kind of French hair gel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXander, distracted as so many drunk people easily are, turned around to defend his honor, forgetting me. The tension disappeared, and he took the teasing about his hair with a good attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the room, Lissa met my eyes with relief. She smiled and gave me a small nod of thanks before she returned her attention to Aaron. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1/page-15.html","bookId":2060,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:00 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:00 AM"}
