Blondie was the antithesis of how my sister had been, but still...with the same name and the way she’d hooked up with Hamilton, I hadn’t been able to brush off the brotherly feelings I’d grown for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” she asked, climbing onto the bed with worried eyes to sit beside me. “You were yelling my name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. “Was I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It freaked us out.” Ham sat on the corner, his expression matching his woman’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat and glanced away. “Yeah, well...sorry about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were dreaming about your sister, weren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a glare at Ham for even asking that and an internal cringe at myself for once admitting to them that I’d had a sister named Zoey, I then glanced away and gave a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlondie took my hand. “Do you want me to change my name? I would. For you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s sweet,” I said and sent her a small smile as I squeezed her fingers thankfully. Then I pulled her toward me and gave her a hug. “But, no. I’ll just keep calling you Blondie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “Okay. I like Blondie. It’s way better than Milk Tits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out of the hug to scowl at her. “Milk Tits is a kick-ass nickname.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and shook her head. “No. It’s actually really awful.” But as soon as her smile started, it settled. “Do you want to talk about it? Your nightmare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, no. The last time I’d talked about this shit, I’d ended up with this very nightmare. I was done talking. I shook my head. “No. I’m good. You guys can go back to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?” Ham asked. “Can we get you some water or anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. These two. Their sweetness was beginning to make my teeth rot. “Mom. Dad.” I lifted my hands. “I’m fine. Seriously. I’m sorry for waking you. Now get back to bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, they relented. Blondie had to give me another hug and Ham patted my shoulder, but once they were gone, I couldn’t get back to sleep. I tossed and turned and before I knew it, I was grabbing my phone off the nightstand and zinging a text off to Caroline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter writing, Nobody puts baby in a corner, I sighed and tossed the phone back onto the counter, only for it to immediately ding with a response. Not expecting her to write back at this time of night, I picked it up, thrilled to see it really was from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are you sending me a Dirty Dancing quote at two in the morning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned, and immediately, my chest felt looser. I could breathe easier, and the headache that had been forming behind my eyes abated completely. I’ve been studying up. I wanted to wow my sexy movie-expert girlfriend with my new knowledge of movie one-liners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I’m not wowed. Everyone knows THAT line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I typed, Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo which she typed back, Clark Gable. Gone with the Wind. Send a real challenge already. I’m yawning over here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin lit my face. Maybe you’re yawning because you’re up at two in the goddamn morning. Maybe someone needs to…make you an offer you can’t refuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGODFATHER. And you’re the one waking me up at two in the goddamn morning. What’s up with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was leaving a message for you to read when you woke up. I didn’t mean for it to actually wake you, Rosebud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell it woke me, Citizen Kane. What’re you doing up now, anyway? You didn’t work tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI debated over whether I should tell her, but then I shrugged. What the hell? Bad dream, I typed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo seconds later, my phone rang. I shook my head and answered. “Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What were you dreaming about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was nothing,” I started, only for her to talk over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was about your sister, wasn’t it? We had that big heart-to-heart on the roof earlier and it brought up a bunch of memories. Damn it, I should’ve suspected this might happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A misdiagnosis from Dr. Caroline?” I gasped. “I think I’m going to need a refund from our last session.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause before she said, “I don’t even know what that means. You’re not regretting that sex on the theater roof, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, no.” I laughed, and damn, it felt good to laugh. I was actually glad my text had woken her. Just hearing her voice was already making me feel better. “I don’t know what I meant,” I admitted. “It just sounded good.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-92.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
