How do you feel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLines worry her eyes and she strains to hold the smile. “I know the doctor cleared you to start practicing, but I think you should wait another week or two. Just to be sure everything healed correctly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom expertly weaves the tie into a knot and tightens it up to my throat. She stares at it for a second before letting her hand touch my cheek—a rare physical gesture for both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad you’re okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe withdraws. “I talked to your brother again this morning. He asked how you were doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark knows how I’m doing. We’ve talked on the phone every day since I was released from the hospital. Mark must still be feeling awkward talking to Mom and looking for the easiest conversation to have. I busy myself with buttoning my cuffs. “What did you tell him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That you’re stubborn like your father and wouldn’t tell me if you were in pain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine, Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom fiddles with her pearls. “If we had listened to you that morning…If we had listened to you weeks before…If I had stood up to your father when Mark told us…none of this would have happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay.” I wish they had listened to me the morning Beth ran away. I wish they had listened to me weeks before when I told them I cared for her. I wish Mom had stood up to Dad and kept Mark in our family, but none of that happened. Even if it did, there’s no telling if it would have stopped the nightmare in motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth ran away because living in Groveton terrified her. She would have run regardless of what happened between us and because I love her, I would have followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom sighs and falls into social mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mark’s coming home for dinner on Sunday. I thought we could keep it simple. Just me, you, Mark…hopefully your father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds great.” Even though we both know Dad will go into town while Mark is home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad still refuses to acknowledge Mark exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing much has changed in my parents’ marriage. Mom’s choosing me and Mark, and Dad dropped the idea of running for mayor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’s still home and they’re still going to counseling. As I said, who knows what the future might bring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t forget the corsage.” Mom slips out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my car keys, the red rose wrist corsage, and head out to the garage. From the corner of my eye, I see Dad sitting behind his desk in his office. We haven’t talked since that day in my bedroom and I guess today won’t be the day either of us breaks our silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I open the door to my Jeep, I hear the squeak of his chair and footsteps against the cement floor. Dad walks to his tool bench and sifts through the boxes of bolts and nuts. “Your mom told me you signed a National Letter of Intent to play for the University of Louisville.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy muscles tense in preparation for a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe letter required a parent to sign with me and I asked Mom for help. “Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She said that you’re planning on playing with the team for a year, then reassessing whether or not you’re ready to go pro.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling naked without my cap, I rub the back of my head. I could go the easy route and give him a simple yes, but I’m done saying or doing whatever it takes to appease him. “At the end of my freshman year, I’ll decide if I’m good enough to go pro. I’m also going to major in creative writing. I love writing and baseball and I want to give them both a shot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad slides a drawer full of nails closed and nods his head. “Did you get her a corsage? Girls like flowers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold the clear box in my hand. “Yeah,” I say, and lift it up so he can see. “You taught me that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCOTT AND ALLISON’S BEDROOM is too gaudy for my taste. The curtains are blue silk and frilly things like flowers and paintings of flowers decorate every available space. The bed is beyond massive. Scott and Allison don’t have to go to separate rooms if they fight; they can roll over a couple times and be in different zip codes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on the overly cushioned chair in front of Allison’s vanity and watch as she pins the hair onto my head. I hate the updo, but I can’t complain. An hour ago, she dyed six stripes of temporary black color in my hair. Now my hair is an inch and a half of golden-blond at the roots, black flows over my shoulders, and black stripes even it out. “Scott is going to be pissed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she says. “He is, but I’ll deal with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips curve and when Allison catches it in the mirror she smiles too. We’ve had an uneasy truce since I came home from the hospital and sometimes I’m scared I’m going to say the wrong thing and send her over the edge. “Why are you being nice to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison lifts the curling iron again and shoots me a glare when I fidget. She twists a few strands that refuse to be a part of her plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because Scott loves you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved me before, but that didn’t keep her from hating every cell in my body. Not like I helped. “I’m sorry I accused you of trapping him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curling rod pulls at the roots of my hair and I bite my lip. She releases the hair and little ringlets dance on the back of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I deserve the pulling—and the ringlets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe now we’ll be even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison sets the iron back on her vanity. “I’m sorry…well, I’m sorry. I didn’t want you here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink. That was blunt, yet honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scott told me about his past, but it was easy to pretend it was a story until you came into the picture. I prefer life clean and simple. You made Scott complicated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scott was always complicated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison spritzes hair spray on me. “I know that now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott clears his throat and both Allison and I turn to see him entering the room. I stand and Scott grins when he sees me in the black strapless dress with a skirt that ends at the knees. He frowns again when he sees my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did it,” says Allison without a hint of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott’s eyes widen. “You did that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You told her last weekend she could wear those God-awful shoes with her dress and I told you that you’d regret it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fidget in my official Chuck Taylors. “I’m wearing panty hose.” That was a major concession on my part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should put on a sweater,” Scott says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s not wearing a sweater.” Allison swats at him. “That would look wretched.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t care how she looks. I care how much skin is showing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison leans forward and Scott kisses her lips. I glance away. They do this more since I came home from the hospital. Not just kissing, but kissing like they mean it. Kissing because they truly love each other. She steps out of the room and Scott shoves his hands in his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resist the urge to scratch my healing temple. “She covered the cut with the makeup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I noticed.” He gestures to my left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s it feeling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. “Fine.” The black cast is temporary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent shattered lots of the bones in my hand, wrist, and arm. I’ll have to have another surgery in two weeks. My nondamaged fingers drum against my leg. I thought I could go without asking, but I can’t. “How did Mom’s court appearance go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom and Trent had preliminary hearings yesterday. I told Scott that I didn’t want to know what happened, but the curiosity is eating me alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay to want to know.” He meets my eyes while I wrestle with the millions of emotions tugging me in different directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and he continues, “She accepted the plea bargain and will be serving six years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent pleaded not guilty against his lawyer’s recommendation. The D.A. thinks they can get him to serve fifteen years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ball of dread forms in my stomach and I sink back into the chair. “Then there will be a trial.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott lowers his head. All of us had hoped to avoid this. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan and I will have to face Trent again when we testify. I take a deep breath to calm myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you talk to Mom?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and I’m not sure how I feel about that. I’m not sure how I feel about my mom at all. Six years. My mom is going to prison for six years and I’m the one who put her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did the right thing, kid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” I say softly. I do know, but it doesn’t mean that it sucks any less. The doorbell rings and the dread starts to fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan’s here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good-natured smile settles on Scott’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Prince Charming awaits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Scott?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motions for me to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could you keep the heroin to yourself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, that’s a pretty big secret. I know that you wanted something to blackmail me with, but it was heroin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott scratches behind his ear. “I was in the process of hiring private detectives to find you when your aunt called. When I got to the police station, there was no way you were going home with anyone but me. One look at your mom and I knew things were bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs. “She was so jumpy around the cops that I figured she was hiding something. I would have said anything I had to in order to keep you. But I never used the word heroin with you or your mom and I never went into your mom’s apartment. I guessed that she had a secret and I bluffed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I sort of feel like an idiot. A happy idiot, but an idiot nonetheless. “Well played.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirks. “I think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAT THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING, my hands begin to sweat, including the one in the cast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndian summer in Kentucky has a strange way of making November feel like July. As we walk to the open field behind the scoreboard, Ryan holds my hand and he doesn’t seem to care it’s cold and wet. People yell and scream from the bleachers and the announcer informs the crowd that our team is at the first and ten—whatever the hell that means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other couples nominated for homecoming court stand closer to the lamppost, but I hesitate farther back and Ryan plays along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gwen won’t bother you,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” He’s right. She won’t. Since Ryan and I returned to school, she’s been less than her normal stuck-up self, quiet and withdrawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe apologized to both me and Ryan. I accepted it, but it doesn’t mean I have to like her or be near her. Perfectly groomed, Gwen stands off to the side of the group. I sort of feel bad for her. Guilt is a horrible emotion. I should know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could go talk to Carly and Brent,” Ryan teases. “She’s a big fan of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. “Carly and I were paired as lab partners today.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dare-you-to-pushing-the-limits-2/page-56.html","bookId":2753,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:14 PM"}
