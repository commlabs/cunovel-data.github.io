She paled and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steady jolt as the steam engines deep in the Ivory Tower’s cellars winched them down became almost hypnotic. Will didn’t find them so. He prowled the small room, his hands clasped behind his back and his eyes bright with anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate small spaces,” he said, too much white showing in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she suddenly realized his temper wasn’t only strung so tightly because of Colchester. “Does it—does it remind you of the cage?” She had to clear her throat to get the words out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze cut to hers and he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here,” she said, slipping her hand into his. “I’m here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding at her, he looked away. But his fingers slid through hers, squeezing hard. “The cage weren’t so bad. I could see through the bars.” His expression darkened. As if he saw something else, something beyond the smooth walls of the elevation chamber. “When I disobeyed they used to beat me unconscious. But as I grew older the threat of that didn’t scare me as it used to.” Licking his lips. “There were a cellar. Deep underground. They used to lock me in there. For days. Or weeks. No way o’ knowin’, it were so dark. Not even a rat down there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little boy, lost in the dark. Her heart ached for him. “You’re free now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill’s gaze met hers. “I ain’t free, Lena. Not yet. It’s just, the cage’s bigger now. All o’ Whitechapel to roam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’re here now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn angry twist of his expression. “’Til the treaty’s signed. I have to make sure the Norwegians sign it, else I’m back in the ’Chapel and the others, those like me, are still in their chains.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words took her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what they promised you?” A disaster. An absolute disaster. “They promised you freedom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me and every verwulfen in the Empire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned back against the wall, hand to her chest. Will was more involved in this than she’d expected. By moving against him, working against him, she was threatening to destroy his chances of freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what about Charlie? Her hand dropped to her side. What was she going to do? Heat ached behind her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lena?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill waited for a reply. She couldn’t think quickly enough. “The jarl’s daughter seemed to take a liking to you,” she said automatically, as if her heart didn’t feel the blow. “If you charmed her—” She couldn’t say anymore. The words shriveled in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know nothin’ ’bout charm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena laughed, a miserable little sound. She had to get out of here. The walls felt like they were closing in on her. “That’s the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevation chamber came to a shuddering halt and she spun around. The bell rang and the doors started to open. Lena stepped through them as soon as they were wide enough to accommodate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more flight of stairs to the ground entrance. She gathered her pink skirts and started dashing down them, but Will leaped in front of her, a frown on his face. “What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.” She tried to push past, but he blocked her way. Standing two steps below her put his face on a level with hers. “Will, I’m tired. I want to go home. This is not—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your scent changed.” He took a step up, his thighs pressing against her skirts. “As soon as I told you what they’d promised.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid guilt have its own scent? She pressed her fingertips against his chest. Whether to hold him at bay or draw him closer, she didn’t know. The superfine of his coat was soft beneath her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It changed again,” he admitted, little sparks of molten copper flaring in his irises. “When you mentioned Lady Astrid.” His head lowered, gaze dropping to her mouth. “Just as it’s changed now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena’s heart started beating faster. Every emotion, every hope, dream, and despair she thought she’d kept hidden from him was betrayed by her scent. She met his eyes and couldn’t read the look in them. Hot amber. Eyes that she could drown in if he let her. The color of them softened, melted, as he leaned closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis intentions stole her breath. He meant to kiss her. In the foyer of the Ivory Tower, in front of anyone who walked down the stairs. Exhilaration leaped through every nerve in her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you dare,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, his mouth an inch from hers. “I never understand you.” His eyes darkened with heat. “Yes or no, Lena?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarm breath against her lips. Her hand softened on his chest. She knew the answer before her traitorous mouth could say the words. And so did he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill captured the yes on her lips, his hands cupping her face and tilting it up to him. The first taste of him was intoxicating. Lena clutched his lapels and rose on her toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world around them faded. All she could feel was the heat of his hard body, pressed firmly against hers, and the taste of his mouth, of champagne and lemon tarts. Darting her tongue against his, she swallowed his soft moan. As if sensing permission, his own tongue met hers and he devoured her, all hot, male possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill’s hand splayed over her bottom and he wrenched her against him. Every burning inch. She could feel the layers of fabric bunching between them, and the hint of his shaft, pressed hard against her hips. Wanting more, needing more, she slid her hands into his hair, abandoning herself to the taste of his mouth. There was no skill involved, no finesse, none of the careful kisses she’d flirted with in the Echelon. Nothing but hunger and the barely contained raw fury she could sense beneath his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking him to bed would never be tame. Never safe. And she wanted it more than she’d ever wanted anything in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take me home,” she whispered, before she dared think about it. “Your home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill lifted his head, an iron stillness running through his body. Hot little sparks of copper burned in his gaze and she knew instantly she’d said the wrong thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed him again, biting at his bottom lip, but he didn’t rise to meet her. Cupping her face in both hands, Will drew back, breathing hard, his forehead pressed to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lena.” A word full of hunger and denied need. “I can’t. We can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid her hands down his chest, hovering over his abdomen. “Yes, we can. Nobody would know.” A shiver ran through her. “I want you, Will. I need you. Need this. It’s not a game to me.” The last few words were a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuddered, eyes closed, fighting something she didn’t understand. “Can’t.” He tore away from her, red heat flushing his cheeks. The look he shot her was dark, dangerous. Hungry. Slowly he shook his head. “Even this should never have happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might as well have stabbed her in the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wanted me,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I want and what I should do ain’t the same.” He ran his hands over his head, disheveling the neat queue. Strands of thick honey-gold cascaded around his face, caressing the stark cheekbones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe denial rocked her. As if in mockery, her pulse raced through her veins, something hot and heavy throbbing between her thighs. Her body had not realized what the rest of her had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I’m verwulfen, Lena.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t care. You know I don’t care—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill caught her wrists. “I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything she’d ever feared. Heat flushed behind her eyes and she turned her face away. This had turned into one of the most horrendous nights she’d ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let go of me,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments ticked by. Then he let her go and stepped away. Finally some space to breathe. Swallowing hard, she forced her tears back and clutched at her ruined gloves. “You may as well return to the ball,” she said. “You have a job to do. I’ll find my way to the carriage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lena—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d rather you went back. I want to go home.” Wherever that might be. “To Waverly Place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to bear his presence anymore, she pushed past in a flurry of skirts and made her escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shop bell chimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man behind the counter looked up, his smile paling somewhat when he saw who stood there. A mercenary gaze raked over Will’s workman’s shirt and leather trousers. “May I help you, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe display cases gleamed in the weak sunlight. Row upon row of pistols filled the cases. In the corner was another case with less common forms of weaponry; a gilded crossbow, meant for a lady; a handheld mace; even a pair of leather fingerless gloves, with razors cut into the back of them. One punch and you’d kill a man with them. Will looked at them lingeringly, then pushed toward the pistols. He wasn’t here for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m after a pistol,” he said. “Somethin’ dainty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shop owner’s eyebrows lifted. “Something like that won’t come cheap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking at him, Will tossed him a purse. It bounced on the counter, heavy coins clinking together. “Weren’t expectin’ it to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned on the counter, splaying his hands wide as he examined the contents. A heavy derringer, a German-made M1879 Reichsrevolver, a steam-firing pistol… And there, something small enough to fit Lena’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inlay was mother-of-pearl, the fittings gilded. A brass eyesight was mounted on the barrel and delicate little etchings lined the handle. “That one,” he said, stabbing his finger at the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A beautiful piece, sir. May I ask its purpose? It was designed for target shooting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Protection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shop owner unlocked the case and lifted out the mahogany box the pistol rested in. “It’s a seventeen caliber. Won’t stop much more than a pigeon, or small animal, I’m afraid. Unless you’re a damned good shot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will when I’m done with it.” He fingered the smooth barrel. A few alterations and Lena would be able to take down a bear—or a blue blood. Her own father had designed a type of bullet that would explode on impact. All he had to do was replicate the chemical mix and refine the bullets to something that would fit the compact pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shopkeeper fussed about him until his teeth were on edge, now that Will had proven to have good coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And these,” he said instinctively, pointing toward the half-gloves before it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, sunlight danced over the street. Passersby glanced at him in curiosity, but none said a word. A young woman in embroidered yellow cotton grabbed her son’s hand and dragged the staring child out of the way. Will was tempted to smile at her with bared teeth, but something about what Lena had said to him rang true. He wasn’t a beast. Not truly. No matter what the woman saw when she looked at him. Forcing out a curt nod, he strode past her as if he belonged here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night had been long and sleep hard to find. Colchester played on his mind, the adversary he didn’t know enough about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Lena thought her best defense against a blue blood was to lie down and submit, then she had another thing coming. Last night scared him. Even at a gathering of nearly four hundred people, Colchester managed to get near her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found his way to a jeweler’s and strode in out of the wind. A pair of blue bloods were examining the wares at the counter, clad in velvets and lace. One wore a perfumed, fragrant wig, much in the style of Georgian times, and leaned heavily on a cane. Beneath the perfume lingered a faint rotting smell that made Will’s hackles rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the verge of the Fade. The blue blood wouldn’t have much time left before someone decided to put him out of his misery—and spare the city another vampire massacre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle-aged man grabbed his arm as the elder turned, leaning heavily on the cane. “Here, Grandfather. Take a seat.” He guided him to a chair and gestured at the shopkeeper. “Blud-wein. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of them had smelt him yet. Will prowled the cabinets, fighting the urge to turn and keep them in sight at all times. The scent made his blood chill. He’d only ever faced one vampire. And one was enough, as the scars across his abdomen would attest. They were the only wounds his virus hadn’t been able to heal completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Georgian times, a spate of vampires almost drowned the city in blood. It cost ten thousand lives before the Echelon managed to destroy them all. Now, when the virus finally overtook them and the Fade threatened, a blue blood was closely watched. As soon as his body started paling—his eyes filming over and his teeth sharpening—an ax was sent for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shop bell tinkled and a pair of heavy boots strode in. Will caught a glimpse of the newcomer’s reflection in the glass of the cabinet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heart-of-iron-london-steampunk-2/page-22.html","bookId":1583,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:15:32 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:15:32 AM"}
