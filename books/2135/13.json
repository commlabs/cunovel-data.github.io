The forty-five minute plane ride from Vegas to Ontario had seemed like an eternity. Now, driving home from the airport, an inexplicable fear gripped me. Something was seriously wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept I didn\u0027t know what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy kids, I thought, pressing the gas harder. Something with my kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving extrasensory perception had its benefits, but also its pitfalls. Being keenly aware that something was wrong, but not knowing what, was, if anything, torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, as the dread in me grew to a fever pitch, my cell phone rang. It was my sister, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car blasted its horn next to me. I jumped, jerking my wheel. I had inadvertently swerved into its lane. It continued honking at me even as I snatched up the phone and made an inhuman sound. A squeak, of some sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy kids, of course, were staying with their Aunt Mary Lou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary Lou,\" I gasped, pressing the phone hard into my ear. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How - never mind.\" She swallowed. \"It\u0027s Tammy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Tammy? What\u0027s wrong?\" My voice had reached a very loud, shrill note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She ran away, Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a lot of worthless air. I had expected worse, true. Running away wasn\u0027t the worst, granted, but it wasn\u0027t good either. Tammy was, after all, only ten years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did she leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Lou explained that Tammy had been grumpy all day, irritable. I nodded to myself as Mary Lou spoke. Yes, I\u0027d been noticing this lately, too, although I had chalked it up to her going through some life changes. My sister had assumed Tammy was in her guest room all day, either reading or on the phone. Later, Anthony came out of the very same room and asked where Tammy was. They searched the house and called her cell phone. Her phone was turned off. And that\u0027s when Mary Lou called me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did anyone see her leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but we\u0027re pretty sure she went out the back door, then through the side gates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she take a bike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the bikes are here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear a car pull up front?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but we weren\u0027t paying a lot of attention to the front of the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I didn\u0027t have access to my own children\u0027s thoughts, that didn\u0027t mean they completely escaped my extra-sensory perception, which was why I had sensed something was wrong, and why I had seen the dark halo around Anthony last year, when he had been critically ill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my minivan\u0027s speedometer climbed past 110 mph, I told Mary Lou I would be there soon and hung up. I focused on keeping the minivan from flipping over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd keeping myself together. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-13.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
