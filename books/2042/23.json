When she was ready to go to the airport, I offered to drive her. The rental car had been found, but Dimitri was using it to clean up after the mission. Within twenty-four hours, the Warriors had vacated their compound, which had turned out to be a rental facility generally used for retreats. They\u0027d left almost no trace of their presence behind, but that hadn\u0027t stopped the guardians from scouring every inch of the abandoned compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks again,\" Sonya told me. \"I know how busy you must be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no problem. It\u0027s the weekend, and anyway this is what I\u0027m here for - to help you guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed softly to herself. Her recovery in the last couple of days had been remarkable, and she now looked as pretty and bright as usual. She wore her auburn hair down today, letting it fall in fiery waves around the delicate lines of her face. \"True, but it seems like you keep having to go above and beyond your job description.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re okay,\" I said earnestly. I\u0027d grown close to Sonya and was sad to see her go. \"Back in that arena... well, it was kind of terrifying.\" Some of her amusement faded. \"It was. I was out of it most of the time and not really able to process what was going on around me. But I do remember your words. You were pretty amazing, not to mention brave, to face down that crowd and defend me. I know how hard it must have been to be in opposition with your own kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those people are not my kind,\" I said adamantly. Some part of me wondered exactly who my kind were. \"What\u0027s going to happen to your research now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027ll continue back East. Dimitri will be returning soon too, and there are other researchers who can help us at Court. Having an objective spirit user like Adrian was extremely useful, and we\u0027ve got plenty of data to keep us busy now, thanks to the blood samples and aura observations. We\u0027ll let Adrian continue with his art and get in touch later if we need him again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still couldn\u0027t shake the guilt over how my refusal to give more blood had indirectly resulted in Sonya\u0027s kidnapping. \"Sonya, about my blood - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" she interrupted. \"You were right about me being pushy and also that we need to focus on Dimitri first. Besides, we might be making some headway with getting Alchemist help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Stanton had seemed pretty against it when we spoke. \"They said yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but they said they\u0027d get back to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"With them, that\u0027s a pretty positive answer.\" I fell silent for a moment, wondering if this meant everyone would forget about my blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween the Warriors and the potential of Alchemist aid, surely my blood was no longer important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, initial study had found nothing special. No one had any reason to worry about my blood anymore. Except, the thing was... I was kind of worried. Because no matter how much I dreaded being experimented on, that nagging question wouldn\u0027t leave me alone: Why hadn\u0027t the Strigoi been able to drink my blood?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya\u0027s earlier mention of auras reminded me of another burning question. \"Sonya, what does purple mean in someone\u0027s aura? Adrian says he saw it in mine but won\u0027t tell me what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Typical,\" she said with a chuckle. \"Purple... well, let\u0027s see. From what I\u0027ve observed, it\u0027s a complex color. It\u0027s a spiritual but passionate color, tied to those who love deeply and also seek a higher calling. It\u0027s interesting in that it has such depth. White and true gold tend to be the colors associated with higher powers and metaphysics, just as red and orange are linked to love and baser instincts. Purple kind of has the best of all of those. I wish I could explain it more clearly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that makes sense,\" I said, pulling into the airport\u0027s circle driveway. \"Kind of. It doesn\u0027t exactly sound like me, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s hardly an exact science. And he\u0027s right - it\u0027s there in you. The thing is...\" We\u0027d stopped at the curb, and I saw her studying me carefully. \"I\u0027ve never noticed it before. I mean, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s always been there, but whenever I looked at you, I just saw the yellow of most intellects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian isn\u0027t as adept at reading auras as I am, so I\u0027m surprised he noticed what I missed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t the only one. Spiritual, passionate... was I really those things? Did Adrian believe I was those things? The thought made me feel warm all over. Elated... and confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya seemed like she was about to say more on the matter and then changed her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared her throat. \"Well, then. Here we are. Thank you again for the ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" I said, my mind still swimming with visions of purple. \"Have a safe trip.\" She opened the car door and then paused. \"Oh, I have something for you. Clarence asked me to give it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clarence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya rustled through her purse and found an envelope. \"Here you are. He was pretty adamant you get it - you know how he is when he gets worked up about something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya left with her luggage, and curiosity made me open the envelope before I drove away. Inside was a photograph, showing Clarence and a young guy, close to my age, who looked human. The two of them had their arms around each other and were smiling at the camera. The unknown guy had straight blond hair that just barely brushed his chin and stunning blue eyes that stood out against suntanned features. He was extremely handsome, and although his eyes mirrored his smile, I thought there was a little sadness too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so caught up in his good looks that I didn\u0027t notice his tattoo right away. It was on his left cheek, an abstract design made of clustered crescents of various sizes and orientations, lying together so that they almost looked like a vine. It was exotic and beautiful; the rich indigo ink a near match for his eyes. Studying the design more closely, I noticed something familiar about its shape and swore I could see a faint glimmer of gold edging the blue lines. I nearly dropped the picture in shock. The crescents had been tattooed over an Alchemist lily. I flipped the picture over. One word was scrawled on it: Marcus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus Finch, whom the Warriors had claimed was an ex-Alchemist. Marcus Finch, whom the Alchemists had claimed didn\u0027t exist. The crazy thing was, unless someone locked away like Keith counted, there were no \"ex-Alchemists.\" You were in it for life. You couldn\u0027t walk away. Yet, that obscured lily spoke for itself. Unless Marcus had had a name change that somehow eluded the Alchemists, Stanton and the others were lying to me about knowing who he was. But why? Had there been some rift? A week ago, I would have said it was impossible that Stanton wouldn\u0027t tell me the truth about him, but now, knowing how carefully information was parceled out - or not - I had to wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the picture a few more moments, caught up in those haunting blue eyes. Then, I tucked it away and returned to Amberwood, resolved to keep the photograph a secret. If the Alchemists wanted to deny Marcus Finch\u0027s existence to me, I would let them continue until I figured out why. That meant my only lead was Clarence and the absent Warriors. Still, it was a start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, sometime, I was going to find Marcus Finch and get my answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised to see Jill sitting outside our dorm when I walked in. She was in the shade, of course, still able to enjoy the nice weather without the sun\u0027s full force. We\u0027d finally moved into a sort of autumn around here, not that eighty was what I usually associated with brisk fall weather. Jill\u0027s face was pensive, but she brightened a little when she saw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Sydney. I was hoping to catch you. Can\u0027t find you anymore without your phone.\" I made a face. \"Yeah, I need to replace that. It\u0027s been a huge pain.\" She nodded in commiseration. \"Did you drop Sonya off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s on her way back to Court and Mikhail - and hopefully a much more peaceful life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good,\" said Jill. She glanced away and bit her lower lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew her well enough by now to recognize the signs of when she was bracing to tell me something. I also knew better than to push the matter, so I waited patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did it,\" she said at last. \"I told Micah it\u0027s over... really over.\" Relief flooded me. One less thing to worry about. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"I know that must have been hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brushed curly hair away from her face as she considered. \"Yes. And no. I like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027d like to keep hanging out with him - as friends - if he wants to. I don\u0027t know, though. He took it kind of hard... and our mutual friends? Well... they\u0027re not very happy with me right now.\" I tried not to groan. Jill had made such headway with her status here, and now it could be shattered. \"But it\u0027s for the best. Micah and I live in different worlds, and there\u0027d be no real future with a human anyway. Besides, I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about love... like, epic love...\" She looked up at me for a moment, her gaze softening. \"And that wasn\u0027t what we had. Seems like if I\u0027m with someone, that\u0027s what I should feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought epic love was kind of a stretch for someone her age but didn\u0027t say so. \"Are you going to be okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snapped back to reality. \"Yeah, I think so.\" A small smile played over her lips. \"And once this has passed, maybe Eddie will want to go out sometime - away from campus, of course. Seeing as we\u0027re \u0027related.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words were almost a repeat of what I\u0027d heard the other night at Clarence\u0027s, and I stared in surprise as realization dawned on me. \"You don\u0027t know... I thought you would since Angeline\u0027s your roommate...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill frowned. \"What are you talking about? What don\u0027t I know?\" Oh God. Why, oh why, did I have to be the one to deliver this news? Why couldn\u0027t I be locked away in my room or the library doing something enjoyable, like homework?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eddie\u0027s, um, asked Angeline out. I don\u0027t know when it\u0027s going to happen, but he decided to give her a chance.\" He hadn\u0027t borrowed my car, so presumably there\u0027d been no date yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill looked stricken. \"W-what? Eddie and Angeline? But... he can\u0027t stand her...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something changed,\" I said lamely. \"I\u0027m not sure what. It\u0027s not like, er, epic love, but they\u0027ve gotten closer these last few weeks. I\u0027m sorry.\" Jill seemed more devastated by this than breaking up with Micah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away and blinked back tears. \"It\u0027s okay. I mean, I never encouraged him. He probably still thinks I\u0027m dating Micah. Why should he have waited around? He should have someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jill - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027ll be okay.\" She looked so sad and then, amazingly, her face grew even darker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Sydney. You\u0027re going to be so mad at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still thinking of Micah and felt totally confused at the topic change. \"Why?\" She reached into her backpack and pulled out a glossy magazine. It was some kind of southern California tourism one, with articles and ads highlighting the area. One of the pages was marked, and I turned to it. It was a full-page advertisement for Lia DiStefano, a collage of pictures of her various designs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one of the photos was of Jill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a moment to catch it. The picture was a profile shot, with Jill in sunglasses and a fedora - as well as that peacock-colored scarf Lia had given her. Jill\u0027s curly hair streamed out behind her, and the angles of her face looked beautiful. If I hadn\u0027t known Jill so well, I would never have identified her as this chic model - though it would certainly be obvious that she was a Moroi to anyone who knew what to look for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" I demanded. \"How did this happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill took a deep breath, ready to accept her blame. \"When she dropped off the costumes and gave me the scarf, she asked if I\u0027d let her take a picture to see how the colors photographed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had some of the other accessories in the car, and I put those on too. She wanted to prove to me that with the right coverage, she could hide my identity. But I never thought... I mean, she didn\u0027t say she\u0027d use it. God, I feel so stupid.\" Maybe not stupid, but certainly naive. I nearly crumpled up the magazine. I was furious at Lia. Part of me wanted to sue for using a picture of a minor without permission, but we had much bigger problems. How wide was this magazine\u0027s circulation? If Lia had only put Jill\u0027s photo on display in California, maybe no one would recognize her. Still, a Moroi model could raise eyebrows. Who knows what kind of trouble this was going to cause for us now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sydney, I\u0027m sorry,\" said Jill. \"What can I do to fix this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I said. \"Except to stay away from Lia.\" I felt ill. \"I\u0027ll take care of this.\" I really didn\u0027t know how, though. I could only pray no one noticed the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do whatever you need if you think of something. I - oh.\" Her eyes lifted to something behind me. \"Maybe we should talk later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back. Trey was walking toward us. Another problem to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a good idea,\" I said. Jill\u0027s heartache and publicity would have to go on the back burner. She left as Trey came to stand beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melbourne,\" he said, attempting one of his old smiles. It faltered a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know you were still around,\" I said. \"I thought you\u0027d left with the others.\" The Warriors had scattered to the wind. Trey had said before that they traveled for their \"hunts,\" and Master Angeletti had also mentioned gathering from various places of the country. Presumably, they had all returned to where they\u0027d come from. I\u0027d thought Trey would simply disappear as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope,\" he said. \"This is where I go to school, where my dad wants me to stay. Besides, the other Warriors never had a permanent base here in Palm Springs. They\u0027ll move on to wherever...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t finish, so I did. \"Wherever you get a tip-off about monsters you can brutally execute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t like that,\" he said. \"We thought she was one of the Strigoi. We still do.\" I scrutinized his face, this guy I\u0027d thought was my friend. I was pretty sure he still was. \"Not you. That\u0027s why you threw the fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t,\" he protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did. I saw you hesitate when you could have taken out Chris. You didn\u0027t want to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou didn\u0027t want to kill Sonya because you weren\u0027t sure she really was Strigoi.\" He didn\u0027t deny it. \"I still think they should all be destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I.\" I reconsidered. \"Well, unless there\u0027s a way to save them all, but that\u0027s unclear.\" Despite how much I\u0027d said while advocating for Sonya, I wasn\u0027t quite comfortable letting him on the secrets and experiments. \"If the Warriors travel around, what\u0027ll happen the next time they\u0027re in this area? Or even ll.A.? Will you join them again? Will you travel to the next hunt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" The answer was hard. Blunt, even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope surged in me. \"You\u0027ve decided to split off from them?\" The emotions on Trey\u0027s face were hard to read, but they didn\u0027t look like happy ones. \"No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey decided to cut us off - me and my dad. We\u0027ve been outcast.\" I stared for a few moments, at a loss for words. I didn\u0027t like the Warriors or Trey\u0027s involvement, but this wasn\u0027t quite what I\u0027d been trying to achieve. \"Because of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Yes. I don\u0027t know.\" He shrugged. \"Indirectly, I guess. They don\u0027t blame you personally or even the Alchemists. Hell, they still want to team up with the Alchemists. They figure you just behaved in your typically misguided way. But me? I\u0027m the one who pushed to let you in, who swore everything would be fine. So, they blame me for the lapse of judgment and fallout that came from it. Others are taking the blame too - the council for agreeing, security for not stopping the raid - but that doesn\u0027t make me feel better. Dad and I were the only ones exiled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I\u0027m sorry. I never thought anything like that would happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t your place to,\" he said pragmatically, though his tone was still miserable. \"To a certain extent, they\u0027re right. I was the one that got you in. It is my fault, and they\u0027re punishing my dad for what I did. That\u0027s the worst part of all.\" Trey was trying to play it cool, but I could see the truth. He\u0027d worked so hard to impress his father and ended up causing the ultimate humiliation. Trey\u0027s next words confirmed as much. \"The Warriors have been my dad\u0027s whole life. To be kicked out like that... well, he\u0027s taking it pretty badly. I have to find a way to get back in - for him. I don\u0027t suppose you know where any easy-to-kill Strigoi are, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"Especially since none of them are easy kills.\" I hesitated, unsure how to proceed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trey, what\u0027s this mean for us? I understand if we can\u0027t be friends anymore... seeing as how I, uh, ruined your life\u0027s work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hint of his old smile returned. \"Nothing\u0027s ruined for good. I told you, I\u0027ll get back in. And if it\u0027s not by killing Strigoi, who knows? Maybe if I learn more about you guys, I can bridge the gap between our groups and get us to all work together. That would score me some points.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome to try,\" I said diplomatically. I really didn\u0027t think that would happen, and he could tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll figure something out then, some big move to get the Warriors\u0027 attention and get my dad and me back in with them. I have to.\" His face started to fall again, but then there was a brief return of the phantom smile - though it was tinged with sadness. \"You know what else sucks? Now I can\u0027t ask Angeline out. Hanging out with you is one thing, but even if I\u0027m an outcast, I can\u0027t risk being friendly with Moroi or dhampirs. I especially can\u0027t date one. I mean, I\u0027d figured she was one a while ago, but I could have played dumb. That attack in the arena kind of killed any chance of that. The Warriors really don\u0027t like them either, you know. Dhampirs or Moroi. They\u0027d love to see them brought down too - they just think it\u0027s too hard and less of a priority right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about those words made me shiver, particularly since I recalled the offhand Warrior comment about eventually taking out Moroi. The Alchemists certainly had no love for dhampirs and Moroi, but that was a far cry from wanting to bring them down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gotta get going.\" Trey reached into his pocket and handed over something that I was grateful to see. My phone. \"Figured you were missing this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" I took it eagerly and turned it on. I hadn\u0027t known if I\u0027d get it back and had been on the verge of buying a new one. This one was three months old and practically out-of-date anyway. \"Thanks for saving it. Oh. Wow.\" I read the display. \"There are like a million messages from Brayden.\" We hadn\u0027t spoken since the night of Sonya\u0027s disappearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mischievous look I liked so well on Trey returned. \"Better get on that then. True love waits for no one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True love, huh?\" I shook my head in exasperation. \"So nice to have you back.\" That earned me an outright grin. \"See you around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I was alone, I texted Brayden: Sorry for the radio silence. Lost my phone for three days. His response was almost immediate: I\u0027m at work, due for a break soon. Come by?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. Seeing as I had no life-saving tasks right now, this was as good a time as any. I texted back that I\u0027d leave Amberwood right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrayden had my favorite latte ready for me when I got to Spencer\u0027s. \"Based on when you were leaving, I calculated when I would need to make it in order for it to be hot when you arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said, taking it. I felt a little guilt that I had a greater emotional reaction to seeing the coffee than him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told the other barista he was going on break and then led me over to a remote table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This won\u0027t take long,\" Brayden said. \"I know you probably have a lot of things to do this weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things are actually starting to lighten up,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, showing that same resolve and anxiety he\u0027d had when asking me for future dates. \"Sydney,\" he said, voice formal, \"I don\u0027t think we should see each other anymore.\" I stopped mid-sip. \"Wait... what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know how devastating this probably is for you,\" he added. \"And I admit, it\u0027s hard for me too. But in light of recent events, it\u0027s become clear you just aren\u0027t ready for a relationship yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Recent events?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded solemnly. \"Your family. You\u0027ve broken off a number of our social engagements to be with them. While that kind of familial devotion is admirable, I just can\u0027t be in that kind of volatile relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Volatile?\" I just kept repeating his key words and finally forced myself to get a grip. \"So...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elet me get this straight. You\u0027re breaking up with me.\" He thought about it. \"Yes. Yes, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for some internal reaction. An outpouring of grief. The sense of my heart breaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny emotion, really. But mostly, all I felt was kind of a puzzled surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was apparently enough of a distraught reaction for Brayden. \"Please don\u0027t make this harder than it is. I admire you a lot. You\u0027re absolutely the smartest girl I\u0027ve ever met. But I just can\u0027t be involved with someone as irresponsible as you.\" I stared. \"Irresponsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrayden nodded again. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure where it started, somewhere in my stomach or chest, maybe. But all of a sudden, I was consumed by uncontrollable laughter. I couldn\u0027t stop. I had to set down my coffee, lest I spill it. Even then, I had to bury my face in my hands to wipe away tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sydney?\" asked Brayden cautiously. \"Is this some kind of hysterical-grief reaction?\" It took me almost another minute to calm myself enough to answer him. \"Oh, Brayden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve made my day. You\u0027ve given me something I never thought I\u0027d get. Thank you.\" I reached for the coffee and stood up. He looked completely lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, you\u0027re welcome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left the coffee shop, still laughing like a fool. For the last month or so, everyone in my life had gone on and on about how responsible I was, how diligent, how exemplary. I\u0027d been called a lot of things. But never, ever, had I been called irresponsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I kind of liked it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-lily-bloodlines-2/page-23.html","bookId":2042,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM"}
