And they know how to treat a fellow, so long as they don’t end up beheading him. I still haven’t figured out what keeps that from happening\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat turned to her. \"You realize that if Rand were here, he’d probably ask you to stay\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s just the truth, Min. The bloody truth. I was there when Rand brought them to his side, and I can tell you, he was worried. The Seanchan and Aes Sedai don’t get along too well, if you hadn’t noticed\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s about as obvious as your pride is, Mat\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch. Here I’m trying to help. I tell you, Min. How much relief do you think it would bring Rand if he knew that someone he trusted had Tuon’s ear, someone who could nudge her to play nicely with the Aes Sedai by giving the right omens’ at the right time? Of course, you could be back at the camp hauling water and running messages. I’m sure that would be just as helpful as you would be keeping an eye on a foreign monarch and encouraging her to trust and respect the Dragon Reborn, building a bridge of friendship between her and the rest of the nations\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin stood silently for a moment. \"I hate you, bloody Mat Cauthon\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s the spirit\", Mat said, raising a hand to greet Tuon. \"Now, let’s see which of my limbs she cuts off for throwing away her fancy clothing\". Too bad about that. Nice embroidery on that robe. A man needed a little embroidery to keep him refined. Still, he was not about to wear that heap of cloth into battle. He would have better luck trying to fight while carrying Pips on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others did their usual bowing and scraping when Tuon walked up, though she had been gone only a few minutes. Mat gave her a nod. She took in his clothing with a long glance, up and down. Why was everyone so sour on a good shirt and jacket? He had not chosen the ratty one he had worn to visit Elayne. He had burned that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greatest One\", Courtani said. She was of the High Blood, and could address Tuon directly. \"May you always draw breath. The Raven Prince has determined that he himself must visit the battlefield, as he has judged our messengers and generals to be lacking skill\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat hooked his thumbs into his belt, regarding Tuon, as a groom finally arrived with Pips. About bloody time. Had the boy stopped for lunch along the way, perhaps taken in a gleeman performance or two?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why are we waiting?\" Tuon asked. \"If the Prince of the Ravens wishes to see the battlefield, I would think that loyal servants of the Empire would have tripped over themselves in their haste to carry him there\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourtani looked as if she had been slapped. Mat grinned at Tuon, and she favored him with a smile. Light, but he liked those smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you’re coming along, then?\" he asked Tuon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. You see a reason why I should not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a one\", Mat said, groaning inside. \"Not a single bloody one\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Loss of a Hill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Focus attention on the Fades!\" Egwene said, releasing a burst of Air toward the Trollocs climbing up the hillside. The Trollocs had made a gaping hole in the ranks of pikemen defending the hill and were pouring through. Now accustomed to assaulting channelers, they squatted and braced themselves. That gave Egwene a good view of the fist and the Myrddraal hiding at the very center. It wore a brown coat over its usual clothing and held a Trolloc catchpole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder I had trouble spotting him, Egwene thought, destroying the creature with a weave of Fire. The Halfman writhed, shaking and screeching in the fire, its eyeless face turned toward the heavens. The fist of Trollocs dropped as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene smiled in satisfaction, but her pleasure was short lived. Her archers were getting low on arrows, the pike ranks were tattered and some of the Aes Sedai were clearly fatigued. Another wave of Trollocs replaced those that Egwene had dropped. Will we be able to stand another day of this? she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA banner of lancers suddenly broke from the left flank of Bryne\u0027s army fighting at the river. They flew the Flame of Tar Valon—that would be the unit of heavy cavalry that Bryne was proud of. He had cobbled them together under Captain Joni Shagrin out of a mix of seasoned veterans from the cavalries of other countries and those soldiers from the Tower Guard who wanted to join this elite fighting force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lancers skirted the Sharans opposite them and rode furiously toward Egwene’s hills, directly at the rear of the Trolloc army that was assaulting her position. Right behind them, a second cavalry unit followed in the dust of the first, this one displaying the dark green banner of Illian. It looked like the general was finally going to send her some relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut . . . Wait. Egwene frowned. From her vantage, she could see that the main army’s left flank was completely unprotected now. What is he doing? Some . . . some sort of trap for the Sharans?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there had been a trap planned, the jaws did not snap shut. Instead, a Sharan cavalry unit charged into Bryne’s exposed left flank and began to inflict heavy casualties on the foot soldiers defending that position at the river. And then Egwene saw another movement on the field below that really horrified her—an even larger Sharan cavalry banner had broken off the enemy’s right flank and was bearing down on the lancer unit that had come to help Egwene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gawyn, get word to those lancers—it’s a trap!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no time to do anything. Within moments, the Sharan cavalry had begun slaying the White Tower lancers from behind. At the same time, the back ranks of Trollocs had turned around to face the lancer charge. Egwene could see that these Trollocs all carried long polearms that ripped through the flesh of man and horse. The front ranks of lancers went down in a bloody heap, and the Trollocs waded between the bodies to pull down and thrust their weapons through the cavalrymen behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene shouted, drawing what Power she could and trying to destroy that Trolloc force—and the other women joined her. It was a massacre on both sides. There were just too many Trollocs, and the lancers were unprotected. In minutes, it was over. Only a few cavalrymen had managed to survive, and Egwene saw them riding at full bore toward the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt shook her. At times, the armies seemed to move at the turgid pace of enormous ships at dock—and then, in an instant, everything would burst and entire ban \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-171.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
