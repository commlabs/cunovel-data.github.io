I...\" I\u0027m looking down at the photo of Sam Ho. \"I... don\u0027t...\" I start breathing hard, and since the air is so cold and thick in this room it burns my lungs. \"They... listen, they... I think they double people. I mean, I don\u0027t know how, but I think they have. doubles. That\u0027s not Sam Ho... that\u0027s someone else... I mean, I think they have doubles, Palakon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Palakon,\" Crater says. The tone in his voice suggests a warning. Palakon stares at me, mystified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m fumbling in my pocket for another Xanax and I keep trying to reposition myself to keep my arms and legs from falling asleep. I let Russell light a cigarette somcone\u0027s handed me but it tastes bad and I\u0027m not capable of holding it and when I drop it on the floor it lands hissing in a puddle of melting ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelta reaches down for his Starbucks cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother photo is handed to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina Gibson. A simple color head shot, unevenly reproduced on an 8 x 10.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the girl I met on the QE2,\" I say. \"Where is she? What happened to her? When was this taken?\" And then, less excited, \"Is she... okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon pauses briefly before saying, \"We think she\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice is cracking when I ask, \"How? How do you know this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Johnson,\" Crater says, leaning in. \"We think this woman was sent to warn you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I say, unable to hold the photo any longer. \"Sent to warn me? Warn me about what? Wait a minute. Jesus, wait-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to piece together, Mr. Johnson,\" Delta says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon has leaned toward the VCR and presses Play on the console. Camcorder footage, surprisingly professional. It\u0027s the QE2. For an instant, the actress playing Lorrie Wallace leans against a railing, demurely, her head tilted, and she\u0027s alternating staring at the ocean with smiling at the person behind the camera, who quickly pans over to where Marina lies on a chaise longue, wearing leopard-print Capri pants, a white gauzy half-shirt, giant black tortoiseshell sunglasses that cover almost half her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s her,\" I say. \"That\u0027s the girl I met on the QE2.

That\u0027s the girl I was going to go to Paris with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon pauses, pretending to consult his file, and finally, hopelessly, again says, \"We think she\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I was saying, Mr. Johnson,\" Crater says, leaning toward me a little too aggressively, \"we think that Marina Cannon was sent to warn-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, wait, guys, wait,\" I\u0027m saying. \"It was Gibson. Her name was Gibson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it was Cannon,\" Delta says. \"Her name was Marina Cannon.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-185.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
