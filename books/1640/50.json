Just a little bit of me keeping an eye on things until you’re clear of the Woodentop Navy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How does anyone lose a Sangheili, BB?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It takes some doing. So, Magnusson better not make any long-term career plans, then. I’l brief Osman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d better move some listening posts closer to Sanghelios. If Jul’s survived the portal, he’l head back there or cal home sooner or later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wel , I did leave some comms drones from Stanley’s little day trip, but they haven’t picked up anything about Jul yet,” he said. “Look, you real y do need an AI of your own, ma’am. Not a dumb one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, BB, it’s like getting a puppy. When you’re my age, you worry because it’l probably outlive you and you don’t know if anyone wil love and care for it in the same way that you did once you’re gone. Dumb works best for me now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shal go dig up a bone and chase my tail, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No offense, BB. I prefer AIs to people most of the time. Come to that, I like puppies better than people, too. Ah wel . Better go and ask Terrence if he wouldn’t mind dropping me off at Trevelyan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHood knew better than to ask Parangosky why she needed to divert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t ask if it weren’t important, Terrence,” she said, playing the weary old woman card that she knew never fooled him anyway. “But the director’s struggling somewhat. A research station the size of a warship is one thing. An entire planet is another. I’l have to put another management structure in place for these one-off projects, I think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as it’s not something I said.” Hood smiled. “Are you sure you’re not bored with this new toy now, Margaret?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not at al , but I’m confident that she can do the job, so I’l get out of your hair. As Thursday Wars go, that was very promising. I’d say she’s ready for ful deployment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carpeting,” Hood said. “I’l be happier when everything’s squared away properly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I take it the Arbiter’s grateful for our help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I imagine you know better than I do, given your contacts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stil not invited him for a tour of the ship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’l wait until the wardroom silver’s been polished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wel , thank you for the front-row seat, Terrence. You real y must visit Trevelyan soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not too soon. She had some cleaning of her own to do first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was her second inspection of Trevelyan, and a painful contrast to the triumphant mood of the last one. She reassured herself it was stil a goldmine of technology even if it wasn’t as secure as she’d first thought. They’d have to do something about those portals. If the Huragok couldn’t get them working, identify them, or shut them down, then she at least expected some cooperation on securing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnusson’s deputy, Hugo Barton, was forty-six, humorless, and a materials physicist. He met Parangosky at the exit from the sphere’s external dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You stil okay being bounced around in a Warthog, ma’am?” he asked, jumping out of the driver’s door to help her. He placed her holdal reverently on the rear seat and gave her sidearm a sly glance. “No roads here, of course, but I’l take it slowly over the bumps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’l be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think you’l be needing that pistol?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sidearm real y did seem to trouble him. “I’m ninety-two. I can’t strangle staff so wel these days. Think of it as a disability aid.” The uneven ground was more like a vehicle test range but she refused to wince. Whatever vehicles the Forerunners had used, they probably didn’t rely on utility suspensions that hadn’t changed much in a century. “Where’s Magnusson now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s with the Huragok, inspecting the portal chamber.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One question, Hugo.” First names. Start as we mean to go on. Get him on side. “Why did anyone think it was a good idea to al ow a Sangheili free movement without an escort?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarton squirmed. He didn’t dive straight in to dig Magnusson’s grave any deeper, which Parangosky rather admired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He seemed more interested in the Forerunners. We were monitoring him at al times, audio too, and al he talked about was where the Forerunners came from and whether they were real y gods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So someone assumed that he was just another religious Elite,” she said. “And someone also assumed that the Huragok would fol ow any order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have very little patience with assumptions, Hugo, especial y from scientists.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I try not to make them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And nobody logged al the portal sites first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that’s going to take us years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then he should have been kept in his cel for years. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe it was done to make him feel more amenable to cooperating with us and revealing information.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wouldn’t have had much to tel us. We should have terminated him when we first acquired him. That’s my fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wel , at least we tested the GM irukan, so that’s something we’ve got in reserve. What’s going to happen to Irena?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long have you worked for ONI?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wel , then. You can’t have failed to notice that I don’t like avoidable mistakes. And I especial y don’t like mistakes that compromise me with Admiral Hood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the worst that can happen if ‘Mdama shows up somewhere in one piece, and talks?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’l be in a spot with Hood. The Arbiter might kick off the war again, although Sanghelios is pretty fragmented at the moment. And he’l know we’ve acquired Huragok, although that might actual y be another useful deterrent. Even so—I don’t like losing prisoners.” It was time to break the news to him. “By the way, you’re now appointed director. Magnusson’s relieved of duty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” He didn’t blink. It looked like an effort. “Does she know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarton knew when to shut up, another desirable quality in a facility director. The Warthog drove into the middle of nowhere and pul ed up at an isolated structure that looked like a lonely church spire dumped from a great height. Parangosky wondered if her hips were going to cope with whatever was coming next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brace yourself, ma’am,” Barton said. “Just walk forward, and ignore the creepy feeling. It’s just a maintenance portal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParangosky put her weight on her cane. It sank into the ground a little, but then something made her skin crawl and the next step found the cane hitting concrete or stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uhh … yes, I see what you mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around. The world had dissolved into a precisely built stone chamber with inscribed wal s like a mausoleum. She could now hear voices, Magnusson’s and an artificial one that had to be the Huragok interpretation system. Barton didn’t offer explanation or opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must show me, Prone,” Magnusson was saying. “I don’t want to damage anything. I just want to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParangosky rounded the corner and found Magnusson talking to a Huragok who was hovering between her and the wal . It took Parangosky a few moments to work out from Magnusson’s occasional random sidesteps that the creature was blocking her. Then Magnusson turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hel o, Admiral.” She looked flushed and panicky. “I’m sorry. Prone’s very anxious about the portals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So am I, Irena. Is he getting in your way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. He’s much stronger than he looks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But not strong enough to stop Jul ‘Mdama from forcing him to release the harness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnusson shrank visibly. “It’s al about the perceived threat to Forerunner technology. He’s already thrown one of the marines out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s not violent, just very protective. I’m trying a quieter approach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s a bag of gas, no matter how clever he is. Shoot him if you have to. I like them, but we can replace him now. “Then why bring him down here at al ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re total y dependent on them to understand al this, ma’am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, al anyone needed to know was whether Jul was alive and starting trouble somewhere, or if he wasn’t. Parangosky wasn’t too fussed about the nature of the wasn’t, although there was no way of tel ing if he was stil roaming the sphere and would find another portal station to escape from. She needed to see a body. She had the feeling that life wasn’t going to be helpful and hand her one just to watch the relief on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we can’t re-create the conditions of the escape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Admiral.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnusson shot Barton a glance. Parangosky didn’t miss it. She walked up to Prone and looked into his little animal eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Prone, are you tel ing us the truth about Kelekos?” Parangosky asked quietly. “Do you real y not know where it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt; No. The Forerunners all knew. There was no need to explain it. It went there and came back from there. \u0026gt; It was probably like expecting the coordinates of Sydney or Earth to appear on a flight timetable. Everyone knew what Earth was. Only pilots needed the numbers. “What else did Jul say? What concerned him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProne didn’t move from the wal . He had six eyes, so keeping one on Magnusson was probably no trouble. \u0026lt; He talked about the Didact. He was interested in him. I told him he was in Requiem and we were never told where it was. \u0026gt; “This was a Forerunner, yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt; The one who despised humanity. I told Magnusson all this. \u0026gt; “I know. I’m just trying to understand. Can you give us a list of al the Forerunner worlds linked to this shield world?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt; Yes. But there are many. And there are many more not linked where some portals may now go. \u0026gt; “That’s fine.” Parangosky had to think about that for a few seconds. Prone didn’t know where faulty portals emerged at any given time. “Just tel us. We have to find Jul. For his own safety, if nothing else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt; I did my duty. I’m sorry. But the shield world must be preserved. \u0026gt; “Prone, have you shut down al the portal stations in here?” It was an obvious question and Parangosky was sure Magnusson had asked it. “So that nobody else can use them for the time being.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt; No. But we can shut the maintenance portals if you wish to stop searching them. \u0026gt; “Let’s make sure everyone’s out and accounted for, and then we can do that.” Parangosky turned and fixed Magnusson with her sentencing stare. No, the idiot hadn’t even had the sense to ask him if he could shut al the doors. “I think we should go now, Irena, and let Prone lock the exits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd get us that damned list.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something rather surreal about Prone. He left, stil sticking close behind Magnusson, but otherwise did exactly as he was told. If nothing else, Parangosky had learned something about Huragok—how far they could be trusted to fol ow orders and the line beyond which they wouldn’t be pushed. It was better to know that before the whole of UNSC became entirely dependent on them. They were a wonderful asset, but it was time to put some effort into understanding their processes so that AIs and technicians could emulate them and to work out how to shut them down in an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shared information. That meant no individual Huragok was indispensable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot an entirely negative outcome, then. But I won’t get much sleep until we find Jul ‘Mdama or his remains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParangosky walked into the main accommodation block with Barton, Magnusson, and Prone, and decided to stay overnight. There was no tel ing when she’d get back here again, and she needed to cement her understanding with Barton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I get you something to drink, Admiral?” Barton asked. “We’re pretty limited at the moment, but we can keep you fed and watered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Later.” Parangosky was looking around for a marine or two. She wanted to get this over with, minimum fuss and maximum speed. “Excuse me a moment. I won’t be long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to walk out into the compound again to find anyone in uniform. A pleasant young marine who reminded her a little of Corporal Beloi was passing with a crate in his arms, but he put it down and snapped to attention when she stepped out in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marine, I need you to detain someone for me, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am.” He looked puzzled. “Don’t tel me we’ve found the hinge-head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid not.” She went back into the block with the marine fol owing her, sidearm drawn. “You probably won’t need that, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnusson shouldn’t have been surprised, nor Barton, but that was the look on their faces. What did they expect? This was ONI, not some grocery store where underperforming staff were given written warnings to shape up. Parangosky expected the same discipline and common sense from her civilian staff as she did from those in uniform. She indicated Magnusson with one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marine, I want you to detain Dr. Magnusson and hold her in solitary until she’s transferred.” Magnusson’s jaw dropped. She literal y gaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps she stil thought the stories were al just that, stories. Now she knew that every myth about Parangosky was true. “Irena Magnusson, you’re relieved of duty, and you’l be detained under security protocols indefinitely while I carry out an investigation into the escape of the prisoner. You’l be held at Midnight Facility until further notice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marine took Magnusson’s arm a little awkwardly. She was a slight woman, and he probably didn’t want to seem heavy-handed. As he led her away, she found her voice, looking back over her shoulder as best she could with that same disbelieving expression that Parangosky had seen too many times. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-thursday-war-halo-10/page-50.html","bookId":1640,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:57 PM"}
