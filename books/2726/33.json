They’re both leaning in to look at something on Kat’s cell phone. Lillia’s twirling a lollipop around in her mouth. Kat’s picking the shredded parts of her jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” I say. “What are you guys looking at?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillia jumps down from the perch, and her pleated skirt lifts up just the littlest bit. She shifts the lollipop so the white stick juts out of the corner of her mouth. “Kat took a video of some people singing Alex’s song in the cafeteria today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat jumps down next, and her boots make a slapping sound on the concrete deck. She holds her phone up for me to look. “These kids were doing it like a rap. But I heard other people singing it like a jazzy number, heavy metal style—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jeez,” I say. “Maybe Alex is a good songwriter? I mean, it’s in everyone’s head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat rocks back with laughter that fills the entire building, bounces off every wall, every tile. “That shit is catchy, I give him that much.” And then she gets a cigarette out from her pocket and lights it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m worried that Kat shouldn’t be smoking in here. But I’m not about to tell her to put it out. So instead I ask, “Do you think anyone suspects we’re behind it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat rolls her eyes. “No one suspects us. And no one even knows who you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I look hurt, which I am, but then Lillia says, “Yup. That’s why you’re our secret weapon!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joke, “Yeah, I’m silent but deadly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like a fart!” Kat cracks up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh too, and then I give her the middle finger. I think it might be the first time I’ve ever done that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat grins. “Aww, look. Sweet little Mary’s turning into a hell-raiser.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am not!” I squeal, louder than I mean to, and I cup my hand over my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m only kidding,” Kat says. “But seriously. We’re scary good at this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better than good,” Lillia corrects, and pulls her lollipop out. The inside of her mouth is a deep cherry red. “We’re amazing.” She looks down at her cell phone and starts tapping the screen. Without looking up she says, “I mean, we could even quit now, if we wanted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Kat and I look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillia slips her phone into her purse. “I’m just saying . . . we could quit while we’re ahead, and just get started on Rennie or Reeve.” Her voice is a bit quieter than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way, dude!” Kat says. “Tomorrow’s going to be so epic. First football game of the season. Everyone watching our plan go down. This is going to be our best work yet. I bet I won’t sleep a wink tonight. It’s like freaking Christmas Eve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat isn’t taking Lillia seriously, I can tell. She’s just grinning, thinking about tomorrow. But I see the look in Lillia’s eyes. Something’s different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s changed?” I ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bites her lip. “I don’t know. Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The football game is tomorrow,” I say. “We’ve already done so much work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpatiently Kat says, “Lil, quit with the guilty act.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought this was my revenge,” she says, sliding her hands into her pockets. “Shouldn’t that mean I get to say when it’s over?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you want to chicken out now?” Kat demands. “Did you tell someone? Did you say something to Rennie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! God, it’s not like that. Look, I’m pretty sure that whatever went down between my sister and Alex is over. So, Kat, feel free to start up with Alex again. Whatever keeps him from sniffing around my sister is fine by me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you bring me into this!” Kat’s pacing. “This is your thing, not mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, please. Don’t act like you aren’t benefiting from it. You like Alex, he hooked up with my sister, and now he’s back on the market. Congrats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat glares at Lillia. “Get it straight, Lil. Your baby sister had my sloppy seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step in between them. “Um, what are you two talking about?” Alex and Kat? They were a thing? “Why didn’t either of you tell me!” I start shaking my head. “This is seriously screwed up. We can’t keep secrets from each other!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right, Mary.” Lillia spins toward Kat so hard, her hair whips from one shoulder to the other. “Kat, what were you and Alex, exactly? Boyfriend and girlfriend? Texting ‘I love you’ every night? Or just a one-night mistake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat’s eyes flash with fire. But before she can say anything back, the door to the pool building closes with a sickening thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep voice calls out, “Hello? Who’s in here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp. So does Lillia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat sinks down and grinds her cigarette out on the floor. She lifts her chin and nudges it toward a door. The three of us run over, and she opens it, revealing a small electrical closet. We squeeze inside together, and then Kat closes the door except for a crack, so we can see out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is that?” Lillia hisses, but Kat holds up a finger. I think we all stop breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the wedge of light we watch one of the construction workers look around. He’s a big guy, with dirty jeans, work boots, a yellow hard hat, and a ring of tinkling keys. He calls out “Yo! Who’s in here?” again. And then he starts sniffing the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cigarette smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to me Kat closes her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stay absolutely motionless, watching the construction worker walk over to the pool, looking around suspiciously. He walks over to where we’re hiding, and then pushes the door closed, trapping us in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes a second for my eyes to adjust. Slowly I start to make out Lillia standing next to me. I think she’s about to faint. Her eyes are closed, and she’s shaking out her hands really fast. Kat sees her too, and she grabs one of Lillia’s hands and holds it, trying to calm her down. Lillia doesn’t open her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s quiet for a few more minutes, and then we hear the pool door open and then close again. We wait for a few more seconds before we leave our hiding spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” Kat breathes. “That was close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillia doesn’t look relieved. She’s still pretty shaken up. “You shouldn’t have been smoking in here, Kat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat brushes it off. “Whatever. It’s not like we got caught. Besides, I’m not the one who was screaming.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burn-for-burn-burn-for-burn-1/page-33.html","bookId":2726,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:24 PM"}
