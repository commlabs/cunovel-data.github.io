{"id":44709,"no":43,"title":"10th August","content":"Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e SIR: I address you from the second crotch in the willow tree\n\u003cbr\u003e by the pool in the pasture. There\u0027s a frog croaking underneath,\n\u003cbr\u003e a locust singing overhead and two little `devil downheads\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e darting up and down the trunk. I\u0027ve been here for an hour;\n\u003cbr\u003e it\u0027s a very comfortable crotch, especially after being upholstered\n\u003cbr\u003e with two sofa cushions. I came up with a pen and tablet hoping to\n\u003cbr\u003e write an immortal short story, but I\u0027ve been having a dreadful time\n\u003cbr\u003e with my heroine--I CAN\u0027T make her behave as I want her to behave;\n\u003cbr\u003e so I\u0027ve abandoned her for the moment, and am writing to you. \n\u003cbr\u003e (Not much relief though, for I can\u0027t make you behave as I want\n\u003cbr\u003e you to, either.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If you are in that dreadful New York, I wish I could send you some\n\u003cbr\u003e of this lovely, breezy, sunshiny outlook. The country is Heaven\n\u003cbr\u003e after a week of rain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Speaking of Heaven--do you remember Mr. Kellogg that I told you about\n\u003cbr\u003e last summer?--the minister of the little white church at the Corners. \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, the poor old soul is dead--last winter of pneumonia. I went\n\u003cbr\u003e half a dozen times to hear him preach and got very well acquainted\n\u003cbr\u003e with his theology. He believed to the end exactly the same things\n\u003cbr\u003e he started with. It seems to me that a man who can think straight\n\u003cbr\u003e along for forty-seven years without changing a single idea ought to\n\u003cbr\u003e be kept in a cabinet as a curiosity. I hope he is enjoying his harp\n\u003cbr\u003e and golden crown; he was so perfectly sure of finding them! There\u0027s a\n\u003cbr\u003e new young man, very consequential, in his place. The congregation\n\u003cbr\u003e is pretty dubious, especially the faction led by Deacon Cummings. \n\u003cbr\u003e It looks as though there was going to be an awful split in the church. \n\u003cbr\u003e We don\u0027t care for innovations in religion in this neighbourhood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During our week of rain I sat up in the attic and had an orgy\n\u003cbr\u003e of reading--Stevenson, mostly. He himself is more entertaining\n\u003cbr\u003e than any of the characters in his books; I dare say he made himself\n\u003cbr\u003e into the kind of hero that would look well in print. Don\u0027t you\n\u003cbr\u003e think it was perfect of him to spend all the ten thousand dollars\n\u003cbr\u003e his father left, for a yacht, and go sailing off to the South Seas? \n\u003cbr\u003e He lived up to his adventurous creed. If my father had left me ten\n\u003cbr\u003e thousand dollars, I\u0027d do it, too. The thought of Vailima makes\n\u003cbr\u003e me wild. I want to see the tropics. I want to see the whole world. \n\u003cbr\u003e I am going to be a great author, or artist, or actress, or playwright--\n\u003cbr\u003e or whatever sort of a great person I turn out to be. I have a\n\u003cbr\u003e terrible wanderthirst; the very sight of a map makes me want to put\n\u003cbr\u003e on my hat and take an umbrella and start. `I shall see before I die\n\u003cbr\u003e the palms and temples of the South.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thursday evening at twilight,\n\u003cbr\u003e sitting on the doorstep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Very hard to get any news into this letter! Judy is becoming\n\u003cbr\u003e so philosophical of late, that she wishes to discourse largely\n\u003cbr\u003e of the world in general, instead of descending to the trivial\n\u003cbr\u003e details of daily life. But if you MUST have news, here it is:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Our nine young pigs waded across the brook and ran away last Tuesday,\n\u003cbr\u003e and only eight came back. We don\u0027t want to accuse anyone unjustly,\n\u003cbr\u003e but we suspect that Widow Dowd has one more than she ought to have.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Weaver has painted his barn and his two silos a bright pumpkin yellow--\n\u003cbr\u003e a very ugly colour, but he says it will wear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Brewers have company this week; Mrs. Brewer\u0027s sister and two\n\u003cbr\u003e nieces from Ohio.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of our Rhode Island Reds only brought off three chicks\n\u003cbr\u003e out of fifteen eggs. We can\u0027t imagine what was the trouble. \n\u003cbr\u003e Rhode island Reds, in my opinion, are a very inferior breed. \n\u003cbr\u003e I prefer Buff Orpingtons.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The new clerk in the post office at Bonnyrigg Four Corners drank\n\u003cbr\u003e every drop of Jamaica ginger they had in stock--seven dollars\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e worth--before he was discovered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Old Ira Hatch has rheumatism and can\u0027t work any more; he never saved\n\u003cbr\u003e his money when he was earning good wages, so now he has to live\n\u003cbr\u003e on the town.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There\u0027s to be an ice-cream social at the schoolhouse next\n\u003cbr\u003e Saturday evening. Come and bring your families.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I have a new hat that I bought for twenty-five cents at the post office. \n\u003cbr\u003e This is my latest portrait, on my way to rake the hay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s getting too dark to see; anyway, the news is all used up.\n\u003cbr\u003e Good night,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Friday\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Good morning! Here is some news! What do you think? You\u0027d never,\n\u003cbr\u003e never, never guess who\u0027s coming to Lock Willow. A letter to Mrs.\n\u003cbr\u003e Semple from Mr. Pendleton. He\u0027s motoring through the Berkshires,\n\u003cbr\u003e and is tired and wants to rest on a nice quiet farm--if he climbs\n\u003cbr\u003e out at her doorstep some night will she have a room ready for him? \n\u003cbr\u003e Maybe he\u0027ll stay one week, or maybe two, or maybe three; he\u0027ll see\n\u003cbr\u003e how restful it is when he gets here.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Such a flutter as we are in! The whole house is being cleaned and\n\u003cbr\u003e all the curtains washed. I am driving to the Corners this morning\n\u003cbr\u003e to get some new oilcloth for the entry, and two cans of brown floor\n\u003cbr\u003e paint for the hall and back stairs. Mrs. Dowd is engaged to come\n\u003cbr\u003e tomorrow to wash the windows (in the exigency of the moment, we waive\n\u003cbr\u003e our suspicions in regard to the piglet). You might think, from this\n\u003cbr\u003e account of our activities, that the house was not already immaculate;\n\u003cbr\u003e but I assure you it was! Whatever Mrs. Semple\u0027s limitations,\n\u003cbr\u003e she is a HOUSEKEEPER.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But isn\u0027t it just like a man, Daddy? He doesn\u0027t give the remotest\n\u003cbr\u003e hint as to whether he will land on the doorstep today, or two weeks\n\u003cbr\u003e from today. We shall live in a perpetual breathlessness until he comes--\n\u003cbr\u003e and if he doesn\u0027t hurry, the cleaning may all have to be done over again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There\u0027s Amasai waiting below with the buckboard and Grover. \n\u003cbr\u003e I drive alone--but if you could see old Grove, you wouldn\u0027t be\n\u003cbr\u003e worried as to my safety.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With my hand on my heart--farewell.\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. Isn\u0027t that a nice ending? I got it out of Stevenson\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e letters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Saturday Good\n\u003cbr\u003e morning again! I didn\u0027t get this ENVELOPED yesterday before\n\u003cbr\u003e the postman came, so I\u0027ll add some more. We have one mail a day\n\u003cbr\u003e at twelve o\u0027clock. Rural delivery is a blessing to the farmers! \n\u003cbr\u003e Our postman not only delivers letters, but he runs errands for us\n\u003cbr\u003e in town, at five cents an errand. Yesterday he brought me some\n\u003cbr\u003e shoe-strings and a jar of cold cream (I sunburned all the skin\n\u003cbr\u003e off my nose before I got my new hat) and a blue Windsor tie and a\n\u003cbr\u003e bottle of blacking all for ten cents. That was an unusual bargain,\n\u003cbr\u003e owing to the largeness of my order.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Also he tells us what is happening in the Great World. \n\u003cbr\u003e Several people on the route take daily papers, and he reads them as he\n\u003cbr\u003e jogs along, and repeats the news to the ones who don\u0027t subscribe. \n\u003cbr\u003e So in case a war breaks out between the United States and Japan,\n\u003cbr\u003e or the president is assassinated, or Mr. Rockefeller leaves a million\n\u003cbr\u003e dollars to the John Grier Home, you needn\u0027t bother to write;\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ll hear it anyway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No sign yet of Master Jervie. But you should see how clean our\n\u003cbr\u003e house is--and with what anxiety we wipe our feet before we step in!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I hope he\u0027ll come soon; I am longing for someone to talk to. \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Semple, to tell you the truth, gets rather monotonous. \n\u003cbr\u003e She never lets ideas interrupt the easy flow of her conversation. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s a funny thing about the people here. Their world is just\n\u003cbr\u003e this single hilltop. They are not a bit universal, if you know\n\u003cbr\u003e what I mean. It\u0027s exactly the same as at the John Grier Home. \n\u003cbr\u003e Our ideas there were bounded by the four sides of the iron fence,\n\u003cbr\u003e only I didn\u0027t mind it so much because I was younger, and was so\n\u003cbr\u003e awfully busy. By the time I\u0027d got all my beds made and my babies\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e faces washed and had gone to school and come home and had washed their\n\u003cbr\u003e faces again and darned their stockings and mended Freddie Perkins\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e trousers (he tore them every day of his life) and learned my lessons\n\u003cbr\u003e in between--I was ready to go to bed, and I didn\u0027t notice any lack\n\u003cbr\u003e of social intercourse. But after two years in a conversational college,\n\u003cbr\u003e I do miss it; and I shall be glad to see somebody who speaks\n\u003cbr\u003e my language.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I really believe I\u0027ve finished, Daddy. Nothing else occurs to me\n\u003cbr\u003e at the moment--I\u0027ll try to write a longer letter next time.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours always,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. The lettuce hasn\u0027t done at all well this year. It was so dry\n\u003cbr\u003e early in the season.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59765.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
