There was Richard Wagner, for example, who wrote the words and the music to all his operas. Cole Porter and Bob Dylan are two others who have proven their mastery of both language and composition.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But while these three men combined their talents to produce great songs,\n\u003cbr\u003e Ned Rorem has employed his musical and literary gifts in a different way.\n\u003cbr\u003e By keeping the two separate, he has gained a huge reputation as a\n\u003cbr\u003e composer of serious music and also as a prose writer of formidable style.\n\u003cbr\u003e In 1976 he won the Pulitzer Prize for music. And last month Simon and\n\u003cbr\u003e Schuster published his eighth book, An Absolute Gift.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At 54, Rorem has become somewhat of a fixture on the New York artistic scene, who no longer sparks the controversy that he once did. But in Paris, where he spent nine years during his early career in the 1950s, Rorem was as well-known for his socializing as for his music. With his handsome, youthful good looks and boyish charm, his biting wit, and his wide knowledge of the arts, he became a close companion of many of the leading literary and musical figures of France.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His recollections of those years were carefully recorded in his first book, The Paris Diary, published in 1966 amid fanfare on both sides of the Atlantic. It was quickly followed by The New York Diary, which was more popular still. Since then, Rorem\u0027s books have appeared at fairly regular intervals, all of them either diaries or essays, or a combination of both.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In print, Rorem comes across as being somewhat disillusioned with life and art. In person, however, he is a warm, sincere host. With a tendency toward shyness that does not come through in his books. Rorem makes all of his remarks so matter-of-factly that nothing he says seems vicious or outrageous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leaning back on the sofa of his large Westside apartment, with one hand resting against his chin and the other stroking his pet cat Wallace, Rorem answers one of the first questions saying that yes, he is upset by the negative review that An Absolute Gift received in the New York Times.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A bad review in the Times can kill a book,\" he explains. \"It killed my last book. And I don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair that they gave my new book to the same reviewer. He made some of the same statements that he did last time, with almost the same wording. But just today I got a very good review from the Washington Post. And I hope there will be something in the New York Review of Books. That\u0027s even more important than the Times.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rorem is considerably more versatile as a composer than as a writer. His output includes five operas, three symphonies, and \"literally hundreds of vocal pieces for solo voice and ensembles of various sizes. And instrumental music of every description.\" He is considered by many to be the world\u0027s greatest living composer of art songs. Generally he sets other people\u0027s words to music. Asked for the definition of an art song, Rorem says, \"I hate the term. I composed dozens of arts songs before ever hearing the word. It\u0027s a song sung by a trained singer in concert halls.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The piece that won him the Pulitzer, surprisingly, was not a song at all, but an orchestral work titled Air Music, which was commissioned for the U.S. Bicentennial by the late Thomas Schippers and the Cincinnati Symphony. This summer the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy will premiere a new, major composition of Rorem\u0027s, Sunday Morning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I feel very, very, very lucky that I\u0027m able to support myself as a composer of serious music,\" he says. \"My income is not so much from royalties as from commissions, prizes, fellowships, and official handouts, such as the National Endowment of the Arts, and the Guggenheim Fellowship, which I now am living on.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Born in Indiana and raised in Chicago, Rorem began composing music at the age of 10. He was never attracted to pop music, and today he likes it less than ever. \"Inasmuch as pop music goes hand in hand with high volume, I bitterly resent it,\" he says. \"When the Met Opera gives a concert in Central Park the same night that the Schaefer Beer Festival gives one of their concerts, they\u0027re crushed like the runt beneath the belly of a great fat sow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When a desire for more space and lower rent drove Rorem from Greenwich Village to the West Side 10 years ago, he feared that he was moving to \"a big, nonartistic, bourgeois ghetto.\" He soon changed his mind. In An Absolute Gift he makes the statement: \"From 116th Street to 56th Street, the West Side contains more first-rate artists, both performers and creators, than any concentrated neighborhood since Paris in the 1920s.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of Rorem\u0027s favorite Westside businesses is Patelson\u0027s Half Price\n\u003cbr\u003e Music Shop at 160 W. 56th Street, right across from the stage door of\n\u003cbr\u003e Carnegie Hall. \"It\u0027s the best music shop in America,\" he testifies. \"They\n\u003cbr\u003e have everything or they can get it for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All of Rorem\u0027s books carry a fair amount of philosophy. But the only principle that the artist claims to have stuck by during the entire course of his life is: \"I\u0027ve never sold out. I\u0027ve never done what I didn\u0027t want to do. â€¦ I\u0027ve never been guided by other than my heart. And certainly not by money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/45002.html","bookId":46,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 3:00:18 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 3:00:18 AM"}
