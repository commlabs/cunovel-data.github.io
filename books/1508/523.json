After all, Lin Ming was able to instantly kill Mo Da, and Mo Da was a master who was only inferior to these six Great Elders.

Lin Ming’s formidable aura instantly rose to the pinnacle. He flicked his finger, and the Divine Demon Thunder Soul which was fused from three Thunder Souls shot out. On the three inch long needle, there was a Purple Flood Dragon and a crimson snake curled around the base. On the crown of the needle, there was a fierce image of a thunder beast.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe Divine Demon Steel Needle howled.

For a time, the billowing demon essence was like a titanic pillar that shot into the sky. It penetrated into the clouds, as if it were connecting the heavens and earth!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe six Great Elders attacked together. Their momentum was like a heaven-breaking spear. All of the surrounding martial artists were horrified. In the Silent Green Tribe, these six Great Elders were god-like existences. The six Great Elders combining their attacks caused everyone to flee backwards, lest they be caught up in the swirling storm of demon essence!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAgainst this strike that could change the heavens and earth, Lin Ming’s Tempering Marrow true essence completely erupted. At the same time, he combusted the blood of the Ancient Phoenix. Lin Ming’s skeleton emitted explosive crackling noises. Behind him, the phantom of an Azure Dragon appeared. A resounding dragon roar impacted through the horizon!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA spear thrust out. On the Purple Comet Spear, thunder and flame howled, twining together at a single point.

This was Lin Ming’s strongest ability. Especially after absorbing the Disenchanting Dream Light, the power of Thunderfire Annihilation was even more terrifying than before. Within the ancient battlefield, he hadn’t been able to use Thunderfire Annihilation because of the suppressive laws of that broken world. But, he could use it in this one. Thunderfire Annihilation immediately formed a black hole of origin energy. All of the power of thunder and fire between the heavens and earth howled out!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThunder and fire wove together, exploding against the billowing clouds of demon energy. The horrible shock wave rolled out in all directions, breaking through all of the walls, causing sand to fly and completely shattering all of the floor tiles. The detonation had caused a 100 foot deep pit to appear in the ground. As for the great Sky Worm Silk tent which had been torn apart by the Blood Drinking Seals, it was disintegrated by the great currents of energy, vanishing into ash.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn just a moment, the entire Silent Green Tribe headquarters had been razed to the ground.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf the six Giant Demon Elders, three of them were lying down in a pool of their own blood, barely hanging onto their lives. As for the other three, they had been severely injured. Their bodies dripped with blood.

After all, the disparity of strength was just too great. But, none of them expected that as they killed their way over, over 70%of the enemy, including every Demon General at three-stars or above, would be all killed by Lin Ming. Just a single touch was all it took for them to die. And in the end, even the six Great Elders of the Silent Green Tribe had been swept away by him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThose that followed on Lin Ming’s heels hadn’t experienced any bitterly dangerous battle.

He took out a red token from a spatial ring. The token was the size of palm. It was heavy, thick, and a crimson-colored ‘kill’ word had been carved into the front. On the back, there was an engraving of an ancient Giant Demon’s head. It had curved horns and sharp teeth, making it seem hideously fierce.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs Lin Ming took the token in his hand, he could feel a faint murderous aura coming from it.
