Thorne is a Northern vampire in search of Maharet, his \u0027maker\u0027, the ancient Egyptian vampire queen who holds him and others in thrall with chains made of her red hair, \u0027bound with steel and with her blood and gold\u0027. When the Visigoths sack his city, Marius is there; with the resurgence of the glory that was Rome, he is there, still searching for his lost love Pandora, but bewitched in turn by Botticelli, the Renaissance beauty Bianca, with her sordid secrets, and the boy he calls Amadeo (otherwise known as the Vampire Armand). Criss-crossing through the stories of other vampires from Rice\u0027s glorious Pantheon of the undead, haunted by Pandora and by his alter ego Mael, tracked by the Talamasca, the tale of Marius, the self-styled guardian of \u0027those who must be kept\u0027 is the most wondrous and mind-blowing of them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:53 PM"}
