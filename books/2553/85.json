He didn\u0027t have to worry about anyone hearing; security staff was minimal on Sundays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca hadn\u0027t seen the bodies yet, but Lowery, who\u0027d found them, had told them that both their skulls had been cracked like eggs. That sounded eerily similar to the way Ricker and Green had bought it off the Saw Mill. But this was in broad daylight, damn it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould things get any fucking worse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if in answer to his question, the secure phone rang. He hesitated - because, yes, things could get a lot worse - then answered it. He repressed a sigh of relief when he heard Lowery\u0027s hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been checking around the area and found some squatters in this broke down old apartment house on the same block.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they see anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not what happened to Snyder and Grimes, but they did see this black van parked on the street - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re sure it was black?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Double-checked that. They swear it was black. But here\u0027s the meat: the one looking out the window says she saw a very swollen looking female sim being led into the black van.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no! No! They\u0027ve found her! Snatched her right out from under our noses! How the fuck could this happen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s absolutely sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was doing the leading?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two men - one \u0027very strange looking,\u0027 according to her, but she was kinda vague about that - along with a woman, and another sim, an old male.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca dropped into his desk chair and cradled his head in his free hand. Cadman and Sullivan. Had to be. Plus that old sim Sullivan kept around, and someone else working with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they had the pregnant sim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Luca said, straightening. This wasn\u0027t FUBAR yet. It still could be salvageable. \"We abandon Newark. Divide the remaining men into four teams: one on Sullivan\u0027s apartment, one on his office, one on Cadman\u0027s apartment, one on her office. You see them, grab them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what you have to do to nab them, just get it done. If there\u0027s any flack we\u0027ll straighten it out later. I want one of those shits and I want them brought to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d interrogate them personally and they\u0027d lead him to this pregnant sim. No need to worry about being recognized because whoever he dealt with would not be leaving vertically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if they\u0027d all gone to ground?\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-85.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
