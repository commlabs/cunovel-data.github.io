Alas, how could Shangguan Bing’er possibly be swindled again? Her movements were like the wind as she descended upon him with fiery anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“NNOooooo ……”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, our dear Little Fatty Zhou was curled up on the ground, like a boiled shrimp, his whole body trembling as he groaned incessantly. He looked so pitiful, as if he would die at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er looked at that rascal, speechless. In truth, she had barely punched him at all, but this fellow’s acting skills were truly top notch. Even when she obviously knew he was acting, she still could not continue her beating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er could not help but to burst into an exasperated laugh. “Stop acting already, get up quickly, I’ll let you off for today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn hearing that, Zhou Weiqing, who seemed to be on the verge of death just moments ago, immediately somersaulted from the ground, jumping up in a burst of energy. Although there were still a few bruises on his face, but he was clearly full of spirit and vigor. From young, he had taken many a beating, his physical resistance was naturally something an average person could not compare to. Previously, at the Ice Spring Lake when he had run into Difuya, if not for the fact that he did not imagine that Difuya would dare attack him with her Elemental Jewel, he wouldn’t have been injured so severely. Therefore, he had learnt that no matter what, he had to always be on his guard. Difuya’s attack had gave him the valuable lesson, that nothing in this world was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er stared at him, saying “Who asked you to break that Purple Dawn Bow? Do you know the value of that kind of high quality bow? Xiao Se already lost it to you in the bet, you should have just taken it for your use.” As she was from common birth, where the poor person’s child usually learnt to manages finances early, looks at the broken Purple Dawn Bow on the ground, she felt a pain in her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing shook his head, assuming an air of self approbation: “I do not want his bow, I’m afraid I will dirty my hands. One look at that gigolo, I know that he is not a good thing. If it were your bow given to me to use, I will definitely take good care of it and keep it as my collection. Every day, I can smell your residual fragrance on it, I will be re-energized!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er once again clenched her the fist, “You are asking for a beating again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s body shrank back immediately, staring at her with widened eyes and said: “Didn’t you just say that you will let me off for today? If you really want to hit me, then come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er was realising more and more that she just could not easily deal with him. You truly could not judge this rascal with conventional thinking, his slyness was truly at another level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Less idle talk. Since you have linked with your Heavenly Jewels, so what attributes do your Elemental Jewel contain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the practice of Heavenly Jewel Masters was mentioned, Zhou Weiqing immediately became serious, a rare sight indeed. He said: “After my Heavenly Energy and Elemental Jewel melded, I saw several different colours, when I focused on each color, my body would have a corresponding change. I have five different colors, and I have judged what they likely are: Green which should be Wind attribute, blue which should be the Lightning attribute, black which should be the Darkness attribute, silver being the Spatial attribute. The last one is grey in color, when I focus on it, I am immediately consumed with bloodlust and have the urge to kill. My Heavenly Energy is also consumed very rapidly, it was very strange. I have temporarily called it the Evil attribute.” He did not mention his last attribute, not because he did not trust Shangguan Bing’er, but because he was sure that even Shangguan Bing’er would not know what attribute that was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon listening to his words, Shangguan Bing’er’s pupils constricted, in the heart she mused: I do not understand why this rascal has so many good attributes. Moreover, because of him I also ……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking her head, Shangguan Bing’er tried to make herself stop dwelling upon the events of the other night, and the way she looked upon Zhou Weiqing became somewhat strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Follow me.” As she said that, she carried her Purple Dawn Bow on the back, took two quiver of arrows and walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing followed her out of the command tent, towards the outskirts. Very soon, both of them had exited the camp area, and Shangguan Bing’er turned to look at him, saying: “Use your wind attribute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do I use it?” Zhou Weiqing asked blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er said: “Focus your will on the green colored portion of the status wheel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing stopped, and Released his Heavenly Jewels. He then slowly moved his Heavenly Energy into his Elemental Jewel, and immediately, the six color wheel of light appeared once again, and he focused his will onto the green region as asked. Almost instantly, he felt his body becoming very light, as if a swirl of flowing air was revolving around his body, making him feel extremely comfortable and buoyant, as light as a feather. Amongst the various attributes that his Elemental Jewel contained, the wind Attribute was the one which consumed the lowest amount of Heavenly Energy. While he activated his Elemental Jewel, the four Death Acupuncture Point energy whirlpools that had formed also accelerated, speeding up their absorption of the Heavenly Energy from the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er waited for Zhou Weiqing patiently as he started wielding his Elemental Jewel. The entire process took almost two minutes, until she saw a layer of dim green light started surrounding Zhou Weiqing’s body; she then started her own movement, and in a flash of green light, she also activated her own wind Attribute, leading Zhou Weiqing along at an extremely high speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Zhou Weiqing’s first time making use of his Elemental Jewel’s ability, and he felt like his body was so light and buoyant, and everything seemed so effortless. He only needed to lightly touch his feet on the ground, and he would naturally float three to four metres ahead. This method of running was not only several times faster than normal, and also did not take much effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNo wonder so many people want to become Jewel Masters, the ability of Jewel Masters is really miraculous! \u003c/em\u003eAs Zhou Weiqing curiously examined the various advantages that the wind Attribute brought to him, he couldn’t help but exclaim that in his heart. However, at the same time, he also could see the huge disparity between his abilities and Shangguan Bing’er’s. She had activated her wind Attribute instantaneously, not requiring the long preparation time which he needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, they had almost travelled ten miles from the military compound, reaching the outskirts of Heavenly Bow City, entering the Stars Forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bing’er, you wouldn’t be trying to silence a witness of a crime* right?” Zhou Weiqing said jokingly with a laugh as he followed Shangguan Bing’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-2-chapter-9-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-2-chapter-10-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-2-chapter-9-04","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
