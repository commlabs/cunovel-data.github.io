TALBOT AND THE DOG.","content":"\"You didn\u0027t tell me what a violent temper your son had,\" said James Talbot, when Robert had left the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He has a good temper, James, but I suppose he was taken by surprise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll take him by surprise!\" said Talbot spitefully. \"He\u0027ll find out that he has a master.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, James,\" pleaded Mrs. Talbot. \"Remember that he is my son.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will treat him well if he treats me well, not otherwise. He has the temper of a fiend.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am so sorry,\" said the bride, and she indulged in weak tears. \"I looked forward with so much pleasure to this day, and now——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps you are sorry you married me,\" said Talbot, biting his mustache.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh no, not that, but Robert has gone away without his dinner.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Serves him right. When he gets hungry enough he will come back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 16]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Promise, James, that you will overlook his rudeness.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James Talbot was silent a moment, and then constrained his harsh features into a smile, which he tried to make pleasant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will remember that he is your son, Sarah,\" he said, softening his voice. \"It will not be my fault if I do not teach him to like me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you! How good you are!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And now, my love, let me remind you that I am hungry. Won\u0027t you order dinner served? Really, I am almost famished.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jane, you may put the dinner on the table,\" said Mrs. Talbot, looking relieved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jane followed directions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And where is Master Robert, Mrs. Frost—no, I mean Mrs. Talbot?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He has gone out for a short time. If he is not back before long, you may save some dinner for him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s queer, his going out just as his mother gets back,\" thought Jane, but she kept silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked disapprovingly at the new husband.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure, he looks like a gorilla,\" she mused. \"How could the mistress marry him when her first husband was such a fine handsome man? I[Pg 17] mistrusts he and Master Robert won\u0027t get along very well together.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James Talbot took the place at the head of the table, and began to carve the fowls. Jane noticed that though he helped his wife first, he reserved the nicest portion of the chicken for himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure, he\u0027s a selfish beast!\" reflected Jane. \"If he was a gentleman he wouldn\u0027t take all the breast for himself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was right. Talbot was selfish and had always been so. Some men can conceal this trait. He did not try to do so. He did not trouble himself about criticism, as long as he got what he wanted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish Robert were here,\" said Mrs. Talbot plaintively. \"I can\u0027t be happy, thinking that he is going without his dinner.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027ll be all right to-morrow. I\u0027ll try to make friends with him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you really? It will be so good of you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I always try to be kind and considerate, my love. Your son is very hasty, but he will soon understand me better.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, I do hope so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After dinner Talbot said: \"Now, my love, I wish you would show me over the house—our house,\" he added with cat-like softness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 18]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I shall be so glad to do so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They passed out into the hall, and the new husband\u0027s attention was drawn to the portrait of Robert\u0027s father. He frowned slightly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who is that?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is my first husband.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James Talbot glanced curiously at the picture. He was displeased to notice that the portrait represented such a handsome man—a man with whom he was not to be compared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He was generally considered a fine-looking man,\" remarked the bride.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Humph! Tastes differ. No doubt he was a good man, but I don\u0027t consider him handsome.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Through the open door Jane heard this remark, and took instant offense, for she had liked Mr. Frost, who was always kind to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He didn\u0027t look a gorilla, as you do,\" she said to herself, and would like to have said aloud.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile Robert went down to the village. He was the prey of contending emotions. It looked as if all the happiness of their quiet home was gone. This man—this interloper—would spoil it all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How could mother marry him?\" he said to himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But in spite of his dissatisfaction, he felt hun[Pg 19]gry. There was a restaurant in the village, and he turned in there. He felt that on this day at least he could not dine at home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sat down at the table beside Mr. Jameson, a jeweler, and an old friend of the family. The jeweler regarded Robert with surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How is it that you don\u0027t dine at home?\" he asked. \"I believe, however, that your mother is away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It isn\u0027t that, for Jane prepares the meals.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You want a change then?\" said Mr. Jameson smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, it isn\u0027t that either. Mother has got home,\" he added bluntly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you go away at such a time?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I may as well tell you—everybody will know it soon. She has come home with a new husband.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You amaze me! And you don\u0027t like the arrangement?\" he asked, with a keen glance at his young companion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; he\u0027s not a gentleman,\" answered Robert bitterly. \"I don\u0027t see how she could have married him—or anybody, after my father.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is natural for you to feel so. Still, she had a right to do so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They talked further, and Mr. Jameson gradu[Pg 20]ally modified Robert\u0027s excited feelings. He made the boy promise that if Mr. Talbot should show a disposition to be friendly, he would at any rate treat him with courtesy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e About three o\u0027clock in the afternoon Robert met his new step-father in the street. He paused, uncertain how to act. But James Talbot approached him with a soft, ingratiating smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Robert,\" he said, \"I am sorry you have taken such a dislike to me. You will excuse my saying that it is quite unreasonable, as you can\u0027t know anything about me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps I was hasty,\" Robert forced himself to say, \"but it was a trial to me to think my mother had married again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Quite natural, I am sure, so I shall not look upon your manifestations of dislike as personal to myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose not,\" said Robert slowly. \"Of course, I don\u0027t know much about you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When you do, I hope you will like me better,\" said Talbot cheerfully. \"Have you had any dinner?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope you will come home to supper. It makes your mother feel very sad to have you stay away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 21]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I will come.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shall we take a walk together? I don\u0027t know anything of your village. You might show me something of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert hesitated, but he was naturally polite, and, though rather reluctantly, he walked through different parts of the village and pointed out the churches and the public library, the center school-house, and other buildings. Gradually they approached the outskirts of the village till they reached a house occupied by an eccentric old bachelor, who kept a large dog of an uncertain temper. As the two passed, the dog bounded from the yard and ran after them. This gave Robert a chance to judge of his step-father\u0027s courage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James Talbot turned pale with fright, and started to run.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Save me, Robert!\" he called out, in tremulous accents. \"Will he—will he bite?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think so, Mr. Talbot,\" said Robert manfully, not exhibiting the least alarm. \"What do you mean, Tige?\" he continued sternly, addressing the dog.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He snatched a stout stick from the side of the road, and made threatening demonstrations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The dog stood still, evidently cowed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think he is dangerous, Mr. Talbot,\"[Pg 22] Robert started to say, but he looked in vain for his step-father.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here I am, Robert,\" he heard in quavering accents.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James Talbot had managed, with an agility hardly to be expected of a man of forty-five, to climb into a tree by the roadside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I—I thought I should be safer here,\" he said, Robert wanted to laugh, but he was polite, and refrained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I—I hope he won\u0027t bite you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll risk it, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What a terrible situation! I don\u0027t dare to come down.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think you may, sir; I will protect you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How can you? You wouldn\u0027t be a match for a dog like that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By this time Tiger had got over his fierce demonstrations, and seemed quite friendly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You see he has got over his fierceness. You had better come down.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you really think it would be safe?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sure of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James Talbot got down from the tree cautiously, eyeing the dog askance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now let us get away from here at once,\" he said nervously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 23]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They took the road for home, the dog making no hostile demonstrations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I—I was always afraid of dogs,\" said Talbot, half ashamed. \"If it had been a man I wouldn\u0027t have cared.\" And then he began to tell Robert how he had once frightened a burglar from the house where he was lodging; but Robert didn\u0027t believe him. He felt contempt for his step-father as a coward.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801/52287.html","bookId":1053,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:38:29 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:38:29 AM"}
