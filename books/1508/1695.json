As he looked at Xiao Moxian, there was a hint of appreciation in her eyes. “It’s already impressive for her to pass the heaven-step difficulty.

When Xiao \u0026nbsp;Moxian had chosen the heaven-step difficulty, she had indeed felt nervous. But because she had experienced Xiao Moxian’s strength, she knew that even though Xiao Moxian couldn’t compare to Sheng Mei, she should still be able to survive the Gate of Laws without a problem.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNow, she saw Xiao Moxian come out.

He thought of taking Xiao Moxian under his wings. Since he was rising to fame, he needed to build up his own power and forces. If he could capture Xiao Moxian’s body and mind, she would undoubtedly be an excellent dual cultivation partner. Not only could he drink deep in his lust for her, but it would also be a great help for himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This miss is called Xian’er, right?
