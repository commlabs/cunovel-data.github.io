I am lying on my back, arms folded behind my head, looking up at a flawless summer sky. \u0027Yes?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulie stirs on the red blanket, scooting a little closer to me. \u0027Do you think we\u0027ll ever see jets up there again?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think for a moment. I watch the little molecules swim in my eye fluids. \u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Really?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Maybe not us. But I think the kids will.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How far do you think we can take this?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Take what?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Rebuilding everything. Even if we can completely end the plague . . . do you think we\u0027ll ever get things back to the way they were?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lone starling swoops across the distant sky, and I imagine a white jet trail sketching out behind it, like a florid signature on a love note. \u0027I hope not,\u0027 I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are silent for a while. We are lying in the grass. Behind us, the battered old Mercedes waits patiently, whispering to us in sizzles and pings as its engine cools. Mercey, Julie named it. Who is this woman lying next to me, so overflowing with vitae she can grant life to a car?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027R,\u0027 she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yeah.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you remember your name yet?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this hillside on the edge of a crumbled freeway, the bugs and birds in the grass perform a tiny simulation of traffic noise. I listen to their nostalgic symphony, and shake my head. \u0027No.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You could give yourself one, you know. Just pick one. Whatever you want.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI consider this. I thumb through the index of names in my brain. Complex etymologies, languages, ancient meanings passed down through generations of cultural traditions. But I\u0027m a new thing. A fresh canvas. I can choose what history I build my future on, and I choose a new one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My name is R,\u0027 I say with a little shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twists her head to look at me. I can feel her sun-yellow eyes on the side of my face, as if trying to tunnel into my ear and explore my brain. \u0027You don\u0027t want to get your old life back?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No.\u0027 I sit up, folding my arms over my knees and looking down into the valley. \u0027I want this one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulie smiles. She sits up with me and faces what I\u0027m facing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airport spreads out below us like a thrown gauntlet. A challenge. There was no global transformation after the skeletons surrendered. Some of us are on our way back to life, some are still Dead. Some are still lingering here at the airport, or in other cities, countries, continents, wandering and waiting. But to fix a problem that spans the globe, an airport seems like a good place to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have big plans. Oh yes. We\u0027re fumbling in the dark, but at least we\u0027re in motion. Everyone is working now; Julie and I are just pausing for a moment to enjoy the view, because it\u0027s a beautiful day. The sky is blue. The grass is green. The sun is warm on our skin. We smile, because this is how we save the world. We will not let Earth become a tomb, a mass grave spinning through space. We will exhume ourselves. We will fight the curse and break it. We will cry and bleed and lust and love, and we will cure death. We will be the cure. Because we want it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-21.html","bookId":2434,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:01 PM"}
