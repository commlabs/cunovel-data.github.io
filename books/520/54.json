{"id":44720,"no":54,"title":"15th May","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Is it good manners when you get into a car just to stare straight\n\u003cbr\u003e ahead and not see anybody else?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A very beautiful lady in a very beautiful velvet dress got\n\u003cbr\u003e into the car today, and without the slightest expression sat\n\u003cbr\u003e for fifteen minutes and looked at a sign advertising suspenders. \n\u003cbr\u003e It doesn\u0027t seem polite to ignore everybody else as though you\n\u003cbr\u003e were the only important person present. Anyway, you miss a lot. \n\u003cbr\u003e While she was absorbing that silly sign, I was studying a whole car\n\u003cbr\u003e full of interesting human beings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The accompanying illustration is hereby reproduced for the first time. \n\u003cbr\u003e It looks like a spider on the end of a string, but it isn\u0027t at all;\n\u003cbr\u003e it\u0027s a picture of me learning to swim in the tank in the gymnasium.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The instructor hooks a rope into a ring in the back of my belt, and runs\n\u003cbr\u003e it through a pulley in the ceiling. It would be a beautiful system\n\u003cbr\u003e if one had perfect confidence in the probity of one\u0027s instructor. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m always afraid, though, that she will let the rope get slack,\n\u003cbr\u003e so I keep one anxious eye on her and swim with the other,\n\u003cbr\u003e and with this divided interest I do not make the progress that I\n\u003cbr\u003e otherwise might.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Very miscellaneous weather we\u0027re having of late. It was raining\n\u003cbr\u003e when I commenced and now the sun is shining. Sallie and I are going\n\u003cbr\u003e out to play tennis--thereby gaining exemption from Gym.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A week later\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I should have finished this letter long ago, but I didn\u0027t. You\n\u003cbr\u003e don\u0027t mind, do you, Daddy, if I\u0027m not very regular? I really\n\u003cbr\u003e do love to write to you; it gives me such a respectable feeling\n\u003cbr\u003e of having some family. Would you like me to tell you something? \n\u003cbr\u003e You are not the only man to whom I write letters. There are\n\u003cbr\u003e two others! I have been receiving beautiful long letters this\n\u003cbr\u003e winter from Master Jervie (with typewritten envelopes so Julia won\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e recognize the writing). Did you ever hear anything so shocking? \n\u003cbr\u003e And every week or so a very scrawly epistle, usually on yellow\n\u003cbr\u003e tablet paper, arrives from Princeton. All of which I answer\n\u003cbr\u003e with business-like promptness. So you see--I am not so different\n\u003cbr\u003e from other girls--I get letters, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did I tell you that I have been elected a member of the Senior\n\u003cbr\u003e Dramatic Club? Very recherche organization. Only seventy-five\n\u003cbr\u003e members out of one thousand. Do you think as a consistent Socialist\n\u003cbr\u003e that I ought to belong?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What do you suppose is at present engaging my attention in sociology? \n\u003cbr\u003e I am writing (figurez vous!) a paper on the Care of Dependent Children. \n\u003cbr\u003e The Professor shuffled up his subjects and dealt them out promiscuously,\n\u003cbr\u003e and that fell to me. C\u0027est drole ca n\u0027est pas?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There goes the gong for dinner. I\u0027ll post this as I pass the box.\n\u003cbr\u003e Affectionately,\n\u003cbr\u003e J.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59776.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
