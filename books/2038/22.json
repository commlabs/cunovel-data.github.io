{"id":109189,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t give Lara all the details the next day, only that I\u0027d just broken up with a guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ice cream,\" she advised me through the phone. \"Lots of ice cream. And tequila. That\u0027s the key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t do a lot of drinking right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. Well, maybe get one of those liqueur-flavored ice creams. Like with Kahl��a or Irish cream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any other hot tips?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chick flicks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good God. I\u0027m disconnecting right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, try this.\" She sounded huffy. \"I just got a call from a guy who thinks there\u0027s a troll in his basement. Seems like beating one of those up would be therapeutic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara\u0027s full of shit,\" Tim told me later when I recounted the phone call. \"Why do women turn to ice cream? It makes them fat, then they hate themselves and start going on and on about how they\u0027ll never find anybody, blah, blah. It\u0027s stupid. Now, if you\u0027ve got some peyote squirreled away, that\u0027d be a different matter....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"No peyote. Not after what happened last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a face. \"All right, then. My best advice? Don\u0027t call him. He\u0027s probably going through all sorts of regret and guilt. You call him, he\u0027ll feel smothered and put up his defenses. Let him stew for a while, and he\u0027ll call you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want him to call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Eug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up taking down the troll later that day, but it didn\u0027t really do much for me. Neither did the Kiss puzzle I put together that night. With my doldrums growing, I was only too happy when my next lesson with Dorian came the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering his fascination with human things and novelty in general, I thought he\u0027d like eating out somewhere. I didn\u0027t know why I bothered; we probably should have gone straight to the lesson. Maybe I felt guilty about the sex thing. Maybe I was lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a quick drive, I arrived at the Catalina Lodge, a prissy hotel about a mile or so from Catalina State Park. I parked in a remote spot, hopefully away from watchful eyes, and sat down on the ground with crossed legs. The ring sat beside me on the asphalt. Slipping on my sunglasses, I leaned against the car and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy timing couldn\u0027t have been more perfect. A few minutes later, I felt the pressure and tingling, and then Dorian materialized beside me. He\u0027d left the robes and cloaks at home, wearing dark pants and a blousy, sage-colored shirt that looked only moderately out of place. He squinted up at the bright sunlight and then noticed me on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it ever cloudy in this infernal place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened up, and he offered a hand to help me rise. \"I could arrange that if you wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And risk you wiping out half of your fair city? No thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figured you\u0027d appreciate that. It\u0027ll make your world domination easier. One less place to conquer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I need this place intact. I plan on keeping prisoners and exiled enemies here. Where exactly are we today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mere steps away from the best food of your life, if rumors are true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed me one of his trademark grins. \"Pleasure before business? My, my, you never fail to astound me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, wait\u0027ll you hear me identify every water source in the restaurant.\" That, at least, had been a good thing to come from Beltane. I could now feel cactuses, wells, and any other water source within a certain distance. I could even sense people now since the human body was supposed to be, what, 65 percent water? That meant no one could sneak up on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside and seated, Dorian found watching his surroundings far more fascinating than anything on the menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pick something for me,\" he said distractedly, watching a family leave with four small children in tow. He cocked his head curiously. \"By the gods, do all those little ones belong to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up. \"Likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And their mother looks pregnant again. Incredible. Back home, those people would be worshipped as fertility deities. A family with two children is remarkable enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress returned. I ordered spinach-stuffed ravioli for me and some sort of spicy chicken for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of middle-and upper-class families actually go out of their way to only have two kids. And a lot of them don\u0027t even start until they\u0027re older than me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baffling.\" He propped his elbow on the table, resting his chin in his hand. \"A woman your age could have had that many children by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m like twenty-six. I\u0027m not that old. I don\u0027t even look my age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your father\u0027s blood. And I wasn\u0027t insulting your age - merely making an observation.\" He sighed. \"I\u0027d give up half my kingdom for just one child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled slyly. \"And the chance to be the father of Storm King\u0027s grandson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be just as happy to father his granddaughter too. I\u0027d be happy to father anyone\u0027s child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why don\u0027t you find some nice girl and do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, it hasn\u0027t been for lack of trying.\" His face held a rare seriousness, but the expression vanished as quickly as it came. \"Ah, now there\u0027s a fetching young woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing his gaze across the restaurant, I saw a tall blond woman exit the restroom. She was stuffed into a tiny spandex dress, her chest practically spilling out. I didn\u0027t have the heart to tell Dorian there was probably a lot of silicone in there. His eyes lingered on her, then his charm-alarm must have gone off for fear of neglecting me. He turned back around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that you don\u0027t look lovely today too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to pacify me.\" I laughed. \"You\u0027re welcome to ogle other women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur late-afternoon meal proceeded nicely, and everything about it continued to enchant Dorian. The credit card I used to pay with at the end especially captivated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has information about me stored in it,\" I tried to explain. \"That information lets the restaurant get money from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the returned card gingerly, turning it over and over in his fingers. \"Intriguing. I imagine this has to do something with electricity? The blood of your culture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wry tone made me smile. \"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until we were on the mile and a half walk to Catalina State Park that things got a little tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heard from the kitsune lately?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a name,\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heard from Kiyo lately?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? He hasn\u0027t tried to contact you and beg for forgiveness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I repeated between gritted teeth. Something about the way he said it made it sound like I\u0027d been dealt a great insult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Odd. I think that\u0027s what I\u0027d do if I\u0027d offended my ladylove. Of course, I suppose when a man spends half his existence as an animal, you can\u0027t really expect him not to act like one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI halted and turned on Dorian. \"Stop it. Just stop it, okay? Stop trying to poison me against him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need me to do what he\u0027s already done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Dorian. I\u0027m serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started walking again, but it was me who brought up the subject again after several minutes of silence. \"You knew. You knew Maiwenn was pregnant and didn\u0027t tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t my secret to tell. Besides, I got in trouble the last time I spoke badly of her. You accused me of trying to turn you against her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure this is really the same thing. We\u0027re talking about Kiyo now. Last time it was about Maiwenn wanting to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you don\u0027t think they\u0027re the same thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped walking. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiyo is her friend, formerly her lover, and now the father of her child. He stands firmly with her against Storm King\u0027s invasion. Yet, where would he stand if it came to a choice between you or her? What if Maiwenn decided you were too great a threat? What would he do? What would he do if you accidentally got pregnant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill ran through me at his words. I abruptly turned away and barely recognized my own voice when I spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk about this anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his hands in a pacifying gesture, face calm and affable. \"I honestly intended no harm. Pick another topic. We\u0027ll discuss anything you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t really feel like talking anymore, so the rest of the walk proceeded in silence. When we finally entered the park, the sun was well into its descent. We still had plenty of light and set out to pick a good place to work. We ended up following one of the less traveled trails and then deviated from it into a semi-treed area. We had nothing even close to dense forest coverage, but rock outcroppings, some scraggly pines, and distance from the path promised relative privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe routine proved to be the same. Dorian had me sit on the ground, leaning against a rock. He had another stash of those silk cords and again wrapped them around me. The rock didn\u0027t make a suitable attachment, so he simply let my hands rest in my lap and bound them together at the wrist. Naturally, he did his usual artistic weave on them, intricately wrapping red and blue cords together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he moved on to wrapping the cords around my chest and arms, his eyes flicked to mine and then back to his handiwork. \"You aren\u0027t really going to stay mad at me for the rest of the day, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Of course you are. You\u0027re also a terrible liar. Lean forward, please.\" I did, letting him tie the knots behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t like you playing games, that\u0027s all. I don\u0027t trust them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And pray, what games am I playing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even know half the time. Gentry games, I guess. You speak the truth, but it always has an ulterior motive behind it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned me gently back against the rock and crouched on his knees to look me in the face. \"Ah, but I do speak the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just can\u0027t tell what you want sometimes, Dorian. What your plans are. You\u0027re hard to read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat delighted smile of his spread over his face. \"I\u0027m hard to read? This from the woman who alternately hates and fucks Otherworldly denizens? The same woman who claims not to trust me even while I tie her up, putting her completely at my mercy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiggled in my bonds. \"Well, I trust you with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed a hard kiss against my lips. It startled me, but I couldn\u0027t do anything about it. This man, this gentry - the one who could be either helping me or using me - had me trapped. I couldn\u0027t do anything except let him keep kissing me. The realization triggered a response in me that was quite startling, considering my issues with control and helplessness. It made me feel vulnerable...and excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head away as much as I could, attempting to break off the kiss. \"Stop that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back on his heels. \"Just making a point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you weren\u0027t. You were just trying to kiss me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes, you\u0027ve got me there. But the fact remains: Tied up or free, you can trust me. I do nothing that I don\u0027t firmly believe is in the interest of your well-being. The same holds true for casual comments about your love life. Now then.\" He stood up. \"Shall we commence this lesson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No blindfold?\" I asked, still a little shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not needed. You know where the water is. Or you will in just a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe produced the canteen I\u0027d brought along and took off its lid. Searching the area, he found a large boulder, reaching almost to his shoulders. He set the open canteen on top of it and then selected a spot for himself near some scrubby bushes where he had a clear vantage of me and the canteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel the water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make sure of it. If you accidentally reach one of the trees and end up calling its water, you\u0027ll kill the poor thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI extended my senses, considering what he said. After a few moments, I felt certain I had the water sources all differentiated. \"No, I\u0027ve got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then. Call it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I supposed to make the canteen rise or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You have no connection to it. But you do connect with the water. You feel it. You touch it with your mind. Now coax it to come to you, to come out of its container. You\u0027ve already done it with storm systems. The trick now is doing it on a small, specific level. Forget about your body - it\u0027s useless to you now. This is all in your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all the instruction I get, coach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretched out, rolling onto his side to get comfortable. For someone who took such care with his clothes, he seemed nonchalant about getting them dirty. I supposed laundry was a small concern when you had a full staff to take care of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, I turned back to the canteen. What I attempted seemed ludicrous - but, then, so had feeling the water in the first place. So, I followed what he said as best I could. My grip on the water was so tight, I might as well have held it in my hand already. But no matter how hard my concentration focused, I couldn\u0027t make the water move. It reminded me of the wind. I could feel it but not control it. Well, actually, if my training progressed, I might actually be able to control it some day. But the analogy stood, nonetheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime dragged. Extensively. I tried and tried to order the water around, but it refused to obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore time passed. It crawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally decided it was a good thing the cords covered my watch because I\u0027d be pissed off if I discovered how much time had elapsed. Hours had slipped by; I felt certain of it. The light had grown dimmer and dimmer. Looking over at Dorian, I swore he was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said. No response. \"Hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened one eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not getting anywhere with this. We should call it a night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up. \"Giving up already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Already? It\u0027s been like two hours. Probably three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miracles don\u0027t happen overnight. These things take time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much time? I\u0027m starting to wonder if you made this magic rule just to procrastinate on getting Jasmine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. You can believe that if it makes it easier for you. The truth - if you trust me enough to hear it - is that this is for your own protection. In a perfect world, we would go in and extract the girl quietly. In the real world, we will likely fight Aeson\u0027s guards and Aeson himself. I would prefer we both walk out of this alive. You didn\u0027t fare so well last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is going to take forever. This training.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I was being whiny and petulant, but my back hurt, and mosquitoes had come out. At least in identifying the water source, I\u0027d been able to take guesses. Here I could do nothing more than just wait and stare. If nothing happened, nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I told him. \"I\u0027m just tired, that\u0027s all. Didn\u0027t mean to bitch you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed untroubled by my reaction, just like always. Indeed, I could see his face regarding me kindly in the twilight. \"No problem at all. Let\u0027s go, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked over to the canteen and recapped it. Closing my eyes, I leaned my head back against the rock to wait for him to release me. As I did, I felt something cool and wet, like mist, spread out behind my back and neck. To my new water senses, it didn\u0027t feel...right. Moments later, before I could ponder the difference, the mist coalesced into slimy skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dori - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy scream was cut off by cold, clawed hands. One covered my mouth, and the other gripped my throat. Dorian had spun around before my cry, making me think he\u0027d sensed something before I had. He leaped toward me, but four wet, human forms materialized in the air before him, blocking his way. Nixies. Water spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo were male; two were female. Legends whispered they could shape-shift into more beautiful forms, but here they appeared drab. Clammy skin, mottled and gray. Clothes sodden and dripping. Seaweedlike hair hanging down. The one holding me pushed me down flat to the ground, all the better to cut off my oxygen that much faster. Water dripped onto me from her hair, and her eyes gleamed a sickly green in the waning light. She hissed with pleasure and pressed harder while I frantically assessed my options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished the assessment pretty quickly because I had no options. I was fully armed but unable to reach anything because of Dorian\u0027s fucking bondage fetish. Covering my mouth stopped me from summoning a minion. The world flickered with starbursts as my air disappeared. My lungs and throat heaved, trying desperately to latch onto something. Her claws dug into the tender flesh of my neck, and I half-wondered if she\u0027d rip it out rather than wait for suffocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy only hope was Dorian, but he wouldn\u0027t get to me anytime soon, not with his own army of -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery stone and pebble in the area suddenly lifted off the ground. Shortly thereafter, the really large stones and boulders followed suit. Those big ones exploded, fracturing into thousands of tiny shards. All those little pieces of rock rose higher, joining each other, slowing rotating in a clockwise manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy captor\u0027s grip had lessened slightly, probably from surprise. It didn\u0027t return my air, but I twisted my head enough to see Dorian standing with his arms raised up like some sort of symphony conductor. Above him, that cyclone of sharp rocks spun faster and faster, a blur to the eye. Then, as though giving the song\u0027s grand finale, he brought his arms down sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd down came the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA portion of that maelstrom swooped and soared, the primitive predecessors of bullets. At first their movements seemed chaotic, and I feared falling into their path. But it turned out every rock had its own plan, its own target. Those sharp pieces honed down on the nixie holding me, piercing and slicing with a fierce precision. She opened her mouth in a silent scream as blood splashed onto me, and her torn body collapsed in a bloody, wet pile. I twisted out from under her, taking in big gulping breaths of air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond her, Dorian gave another downward motion, urging his orchestra to its next climactic moment. The rocks swooped into another nixie, cutting it to pieces. Then another...and another...until the nixies were nothing but ribbons of blood and gore. Their task complete, the rocks gently fell to the earth, as soft and placid as drops of rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire counterattack had taken less than a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, Dorian knelt by my side, helping me sit up as I gasped my way back to life. \"Easy, easy,\" he warned. Blood covered both of us. \"Small breaths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Untie me! Get me out of this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the silver athame from my belt. In moments, he sliced open the cords, freeing my arms and hands. I jerked away, my adrenaline still surging. He reached for me, but I flailed against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you! You almost got me killed!\" I yelled, hearing the hysteria in my voice. \"You almost got me killed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my upper arms with a solid strength, pulling me to him and forcing me to stillness. \"Eugenie, calm down. Eugenie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook me - hard - where I still struggled, and I halted abruptly, quelled by the harsh sound of his voice and ferocity of his grasp. I could no longer find the silly, languid gentry king. There was a stranger holding me, his face hard and commanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think I\u0027d let anything happen to you?\" he demanded, almost shouting. \"Do you think I\u0027d let anything harm you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, still in pain from the nixie\u0027s claws on my throat, and found my body shaking. His grip was so tight, I might as well have been tied up again. He scared me, having turned into someone else. Someone powerful and awe-inspiring. Looking into his eyes and seeing the sweat on his face, I realized fear had touched more than just me. He was scared too, not for himself, but for what had almost happened to me. Something inside me eased up, and I nearly slumped into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe what you did,\" I whispered. I killed all the time without much thought or effort, but this...this had been something else entirely. And he wasn\u0027t even at full strength in this world. \"You slaughtered them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did what I had to do.\" The heat in his voice had faded, replaced with a deadly calm. \"And you\u0027ll be able to do the same someday.\" One of his hands released me and moved to my head, smoothing my hair back. He pressed our bodies together and rested his cheek against mine so his soft words could spill into my ear. \"You will surpass me, Eugenie. Your power will be so great, none will stand against you. Armies and kingdoms will fall, and they will bow down before you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself trembling again, feeling the same fear and excitement that had filled me during our last kiss. Only this time, I didn\u0027t know if my feelings came from his body\u0027s proximity...or the promise of power he offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-born-dark-swan-1/page-22.html","bookId":2038,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:34:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:34:10 PM"}
