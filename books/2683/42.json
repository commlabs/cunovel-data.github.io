Remember now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause, freaked. \"Gosh. Lauren Hynde. Whoa...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know who I am now?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh baby, I\u0027m really...\" Stumped, I admit, \"You know, they say Klonopin causes short-term memory loss, so-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we start with this: I\u0027m Chloe\u0027s friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah,\" I say, trying to get comfortable. \"We were just talking about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm.\" She starts moving down an aisle, running her hand along the rim of the CD racks, moving away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow. \"Yeah, it was a totally nice, um, chat, y\u0027know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just, y\u0027know, positive things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe keeps walking and I hang back, taking my sunglasses off to check the body beneath the open coat: thin with full br**sts, long and shapely legs, short blond hair, everything else-eyes, teeth, lips, whatever-equally nice. I catch up, keep moving with her, casually swinging the basket of CDs at my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you remember me from Camden?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah,\" she says half-scornfully. \"I remember you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, did you act this way at college or am I acting different?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops moving and turns to face me. \"You really don\u0027t remember who I am, do you, Victor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes I do. You\u0027re Lauren Hynde.\" I pause. \"But y\u0027know, I was away a lot and Klonopin causes long-term memory loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it caused short-term memory loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See-I already can\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god, forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s about to turn away when I ask, \"Am I the same?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks me over carefully. \"Pretty much, I guess.\" She focuses on my head, scanning my face. \"Well, I don\u0027t think you had those sideburns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn opening that I leap into. \"Learn to love the sideburns, baby. They\u0027re your best friends. Pet the sideburns.\" I lean in, offer my profile, purring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just looks at me like I\u0027ve lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What is it?\" I ask. \"Pet the sideburns, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pet the sideburns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People worship the sideburns, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know people who worship hair?\" she asks, semi-appalled. \"You know people who want to look twenty forever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wave a fly away. I move into another mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s going oft, Lauren Hynde? God you look great. What\u0027s the story? Where\u0027ve you been?\" Maybe I ask this with the wrong tone, because she segues into the inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ran into Chloe at Patricia Field\u0027s last week,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patricia Field\u0027s apartment?\" I ask, impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she says, looking at me strangely. \"Her store, dummy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. That\u0027s cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause, during which various girls pass by. A couple of them say hi to me but I casually ignore them. Lauren eyes them skeptically, troubled, which is a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, I\u0027m unsure of what we were talking about-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy beeper goes off. I check the number: Alison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s that?\" Lauren asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, y\u0027know, probably just another call about unionizing male models.\" I shrug, then add, after a pause, \"I\u0027m a model.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unionizing male models?\" She starts walking away again, which only makes me want to follow her more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say that like it\u0027s a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you need committed people to form a union, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, no dark sarcasm in the classroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is ridiculous,\" she says. \"I\u0027ve gotta go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m having lunch with someone.\" Her hand is actually trembling as she runs it through her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she asks back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baxter Priestly, actually, if you must know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh great,\" I groan. \"Who is this little shit?
