She paused for a moment in front of Elise. “You may feel like an intruder, Fürstin, but realize this: I am trusting you with the one person I treasure most in this world. Stop forcing yourself to prove your worth, and you will find peace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gabrielle!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Gabrielle said, hustling back into the castle. Her cat leaped into her arms and the duo disappeared inside. Literately. When they entered they castle threshold they disappeared like a wisp of smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Consider it later,” Elise reminded herself as a servant pulled a horse up to the flock of swans. When Elise saw the horse, she swore several times, making her assistant swan keepers/servants stared wide eyed at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Falk’s horse, a spirited beast that shied easily and ran like hellhounds chased him on his mild days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething deep in the castle roared. “No other choice,” Elise grimly said, throwing herself into the saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse shied, but Elise clamped herself to its back like a flea. “Go, go, fly, brothers!” Elise urged as the horse ran straight into the swan flock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swans beat their wings and clumsily took flight. They fought their way into the air, crashing into each other like drunken sailors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise heeled Falk’s horse, and the beast took off, careening out of Castle Brandis and entering the city. “Look out!” Elise shouted as they galloped down city streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen, women, and children leaped out of the way, and Elise didn’t try to slow the horse down. Instead, she cast nervous glances to the sky, watching for the flock of swans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the capital, bearing west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Elise cleared the gates, she loosened the reins. Falk’s horse threw himself into a frenzied gallop. Elise tangled one hand in his mane and clamped onto the saddle with her other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe land to the west of Brandis was, mercifully, free of trees. It made it easier to watch her brothers, but it also made Elise an open target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter ten minutes of flying, several of the white swans started to sink. Their flight was labored, and they strained their graceful necks forward when they pumped their wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalk’s horse had worked up a sweat, so Elise pulled him back into a trot. They lagged behind the swans, which flew closer and closer to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the first swan crash-landed—rolling when he failed to slow down before touching the ground—Elise slide off the horse’s back and led him up to the flock as the rest of the swans tried landing, having roughly the same amount of success as the first swan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to keep moving. If you can’t fly, you have to walk,” Elise said, nudging the swans forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swans walked more gracefully than they flew, although the pace left much to be desired. They almost glided when they walked, their backs and shoulders barely moving up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Faster than this, brothers. Please, if you can understand me, walk faster,” Elise said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t walk faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise clamped down on the knot in her throat and the tears stinging her eyes. “Come on, birds,” Elise said as she used herself and the horse to force the swans to march forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir black webbed feet padded the ground as they picked up their pace, occasionally stopping to hiss at Elise as she rushed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter five to ten minutes of waddling, Elise glanced back at Castle Brandis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black cloud hung around the tallest tower of the palace. There were flashes of red light that occasionally lit up the innards of the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fly, brothers. FLY,” Elise shouted, throwing herself on Falk’s horse before directing the animal to plow through the flock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe birds resentfully took to the air, hissing and clicking at Elise as they took off, clumsily pumping their wings to gain altitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise again clamped onto the horse, her muscles protesting with the stiffness and tension she held the position in. She risked a glance over her shoulder and wished she hadn’t. The cloud left Castle Brandis and was creeping in their direction. Instead of floating like a normal cloud, the black fog bobbed like a cork on rough waters. It rolled downwards before winding up, cresting like an ocean wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA forest was within sight. If Elise could reach it, with her brothers, before the cloud found them they might have a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t!” Elise shouted when one of the birds started to sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swan hastily pumped its wings, knocking into one of the other swans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise’s foster brothers squabbled in the air as Elise and the horse thundered along the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cloud was maybe two to three stone throws away when Elise and the swans reached the edge of the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swans dropped like rocks, shaking dust from their white feathers when they stood and beat their wings. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wild-swans-timeless-fairy-tales-2/page-18.html","bookId":1807,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM"}
