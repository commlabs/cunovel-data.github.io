As St. Ungulant preached to any who would listen, there were plus points in being a madman.

Steam poured out of its funnel. Urn must have got it working again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stupid!

Listen to me, my innocent little priest. Sometimes there has to be a war. Things go too far for words. There\u0027s . . . other forces. Now . . . go back to your people. Maybe we\u0027ll both be alive when all this is over and then we can talk. Fight first, talk after. That\u0027s how it works, boy. That\u0027s history. Now, go back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI. Shall I Smite Them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIl.

Brutha looked at it through a mist of despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn\u0027t I say I\u0027d go down there alone?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimony, who was leaning against the Turtle, gave him a grim smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did it work?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think . . . it didn\u0027t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew it. Sorry you had to find out. Things have a way of wanting to happen, see? Sometimes you get people facing off and . . . that\u0027s it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if only people would-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. You could use that as a commandment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a clanging noise, and a hatch opened on the side of the Turtle. Urn emerged, backward, holding a spanner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this thing?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s a machine for fighting,” said Simony. “The Turtle Moves, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For fighting Ephebians?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrn turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ve built this . . . this thing . . . to fight Ephebians?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well . . . no . . . no,” said Urn, looking bewildered. “We\u0027re fighting Ephebians?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone,” said Simony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I never . . .

You know, I used to think I was stupid, and then I met philosophers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimony broke the silence by patting Brutha on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will all work out,” he said. “We won\u0027t lose. After all,” he smiled encouragingly, “we have God on our side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha turned. His fist shot out. It wasn\u0027t a scientific blow, but it was hard enough to spin Simony around. He clutched his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that for? Isn\u0027t this what you wanted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We get the gods we deserve,” said Brutha, “and I think we don\u0027t deserve any. Stupid. Stupid.

He reached the path that led up to the cliffs, and did not even turn to look at the battlelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren\u0027t you going to watch the battle? I need someone to watch the battle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidactylos was sitting on a rock, his hands folded on his stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, hello,” said Brutha, bitterly. “Welcome to Omnia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It helps if you\u0027re philosophical about it,” said Didactylos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But there\u0027s no reason to fight!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes there is.

Many systems of government follow the same broad lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey play games. They tend to be very simple games, because gods are easily bored by complicated things.
