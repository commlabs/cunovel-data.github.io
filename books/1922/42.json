He was as confused and torn about what was happening between us as I was, and I knew how easy it was to fall into established patterns. After all, hadn\u0027t I just fallen into one of my own by bailing? I\u0027d spent enough years in therapy to know better than to wound and run when I was hurting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeartsick, I stepped into an Italian bistro and took a table. I ordered a glass of shiraz and a pizza margherita, hoping wine and food would calm the vibrating anxiety inside me so that I could think properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the waiter returned with my wine, I gulped down half the glass without really tasting it. I missed Gideon already, missed the playful happy mood he\u0027d been in when I left. His scent was all over me - the smell of his skin and hot, grinding sex. My eyes stung and I let a few tears slide down my face, despite being in a very public, very busy restaurant. My food came and I picked at it. It tasted like cardboard, although I doubted that had anything to do with the chef or the venue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling over the chair where I\u0027d set my bag, I dug out my new smartphone with the intention of leaving a message with Dr. Travis\u0027s answering service. He\u0027d suggested we have video chat appointments until I found a new therapist in New York and I decided to take him up on that offer. That\u0027s when I noticed the twenty-one missed calls from Gideon and a text; I f**ked up again. Don\u0027t break up with me. Talk to me. Pls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears welled again. I held the phone to my heart, at a loss for what to do. I couldn\u0027t get the images of Gideon and other women out of my mind. I couldn\u0027t stop picturing him f**king the hell out of another woman on that same bed, using toys on her, driving her crazy, taking his pleasure from her body...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was irrational and pointless to think of such things, and it made me feel petty and small and physically sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI startled when the phone vibrated against me, nearly dropping it. Nursing my misery, I debating letting it go to voice mail because I could see on the screen that it was Gideon - plus he was the only one who had the number - but I couldn\u0027t ignore it, because he was clearly frantic. As much as I\u0027d wanted to wound him earlier, I couldn\u0027t stand to do it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello.\" My voice didn\u0027t sound like mine, clogged as it was with tears and emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva! Thank God.\" Gideon sounded so anxious. \"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking around, I didn\u0027t see anything that would tell me the name of the restaurant. \"I don\u0027t know. I...I\u0027m sorry, Gideon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Eva. Don\u0027t. It\u0027s my fault. I need to find you. Can you describe where you\u0027re at? Did you walk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I walked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know which exit you took. Which way did you head?\" He was breathing quickly and I could hear the sounds of traffic and car horns in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you turn any corners after that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so. I don\u0027t know.\" I looked around for a server I could ask. \"I\u0027m in a restaurant. Italian. There\u0027s seating on the sidewalk...and a wrought iron fence. French doors...Jesus, Gideon, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe appeared, silhouetted in the entrance with the phone held to his ear. I knew him immediately, watched as he froze when he saw me seated against the wall toward the back. Shoving the phone into the pocket of jeans he\u0027d had stored at the hotel, he strode past the hostess who\u0027d starting speaking to him and headed straight for me. I barely managed to get to my feet before he hauled me against him and embraced me tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God.\" He shook slightly and buried his face in my neck. \"Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged him back. He was fresh from a shower, making me achingly aware of my need for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be here,\" he said hoarsely, pulling back to cup my face in his hands. \"I can\u0027t be in public right now. Will you come home with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething on my face must have betrayed my lingering wariness, because he pressed his lips to my forehead and murmured, \"It won\u0027t be like the hotel, I promise. My mother\u0027s the only woman who\u0027s ever been to my place, aside from the housekeeper and staff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is stupid,\" I muttered. \"I\u0027m being stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He brushed the hair back from my face and bent closer to whisper in my ear. \"If you\u0027d taken me to a place you reserved for f**king other men, I would\u0027ve lost it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter returned and we pulled apart. \"Should I get you a menu, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That won\u0027t be necessary.\" Gideon dug his wallet out of his back pocket and handed over his credit card. \"We\u0027re leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took a cab to Gideon\u0027s place and he held on to my hand the entire time. I shouldn\u0027t have been so nervous riding a private elevator up to a penthouse apartment on Fifth Avenue. The sight of high ceilings and prewar architecture wasn\u0027t new to me, and really, it was all to be expected when dating a man who seemed to own damn near everything. And the coveted view of Central Park...well, of course he\u0027d have one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Gideon\u0027s tension was palpable, and it made me realize that this was a big deal to him. When the elevator opened directly into his apartment\u0027s marbled entry foyer, his grip on my hand tightened before he released me. He unlocked the double-door entrance to usher me inside, and I could feel his anxiety as he watched for my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon\u0027s home was as beautiful as the man himself. It was so very different from his office, which was sleek, modern, and cool. His private space was warm and sumptuous, filled with antiques and art anchored by gorgeous Aubusson rugs laid over gleaming hardwood floors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s...amazing,\" I said softly, feeling privileged to see it. It was a glimpse into the private Gideon I was desperate to know and it was stunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in.\" He tugged me deeper into the apartment. \"I want you to sleep here tonight.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-42.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
