I’ll just stick with tequila.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe orders our drinks, and then we slam them back and head for the dance floor. We dance in the low lighting, making the occasional trip back to the bar for more shots until we’re hot, sweaty, exhausted, and ready to go home. I feel good, not just because I’m buzzed, but because I had fun, even though I’m scared of getting married, worried about writing vows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we push through the crowd, heading for the exit, we collect our jackets from the chair. We slip them on as we push out the door and the ice-cold air stings at my bare legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s run,” I tell Lila and she laughs as we take off, staggering and slipping in the ice as we run toward the Chevelle parked beneath the lamppost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait.” Lila suddenly slams to a stop when we’re almost to the car. She looks back at the club with a torn expression on her face. “Maybe we should go back inside where it’s warm and call the guys to come get us. We said we wouldn’t drive drunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the sea of alcohol sloshing around in my head, I realize that we indeed shouldn’t be driving since everything looks a little distorted and standing seems complex. “Yeah, good idea.” I start to turn around to head back when a blue Camaro drives into the parking lot and parks between us and the door to the club, blocking our path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have got to be shitting me,” I mutter as the window rolls down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMikey sticks his head out as a cloud of smoke rushes from the open window. The last time I saw him I was throwing a milkshake into his window and then he tried to chase us down. Knowing Mikey, I’m guessing he’s probably still holding a grudge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ella, what’s wrong?” Lila asks tracking my line of sight as a smile creeps up on Mikey’s face. “Who is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, well, if it isn’t the town rebel.” He continues smiling as he opens his door and hops out. He’s about average height for a guy, which makes me in heels as tall as him, but my weight is no match for his. His black hair blends with the night, his nose is crooked, probably because someone clocked him, and he has a barbed-wire tattoo curving around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis boots stomp against the icy parking lot as he strides over to us with a smirk on his face. “So is that Gregory idiot with you, because I’ve been dying to kick his ass too for that shake stunt you two pulled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Lila asks way too loud and I shoot her a look over my shoulder, warning her to keep her mouth shut. Then I glance over at Mikey’s car, noting that there’s someone else in the passenger seat, a guy I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mikey slows to a stop in front of us, he measures Lila up with a sly look on his face. “Are you his girl or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whose girl?” Lila plays dumb, shielding herself by stepping behind me. She’s scared, her erratic breathing showing through the fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMikey looks her over for a little bit longer and then focuses on me. I don’t like how he’s looking at me, not like I’m Ella the girl who could hang tight with the guys, even if he didn’t like me. He’s looking at me like I’m a girl, because I’m dressed like one and I suddenly regret wearing the damn dress and fucking heels. “Ella, I know you’re not stupid,” he says, inching closer. “I know you know that around here people just don’t get away with throwing shakes in cars. They have to pay—things have to be even.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes and cross my arms over my chest. “Just like I know that no one around here respects you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscles in his neck tighten as he steps into the light from the lamppost. I’m growing a little nervous. Even though Mikey has always tried to seem tough, it was all an act and most of us knew that he was a lot of talk. But this Mikey looks different than the one I used to know. More ragged, rough, intense, and less cowardly. His eyes are sunken in and red and I wonder if he’s gotten into drugs, but it doesn’t really surprise me if he has. It happens sometimes in this town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch your fucking mouth,” Mikey cautions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila captures my arm, her fingers trembling as she whispers, “Maybe I should call or text Micha and Ethan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and hiss, “No way. Then they’ll just end up in a fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila glances at Mikey. “I think we might end up in a fight if we don’t get them here,” she whispers nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, we’re fine,” I reassure her, even though I’m not so sure myself. “Just go to the car and wait for me.” I turn around and target my eyes on Mikey, attempting to look tougher than I feel as Lila backs toward the Chevelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cracks his knuckles and neck, like it proves he’s tough. “You think you can frighten me with a look?” He spans his arms out to the side at the empty parking lot. “You got no one around to protect your ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat feisty, fighting girl that I keep shoved down inside pushes her way out and I step forward so we’re close. “And that’s okay.” I span my hands out to the side and glance around, mockingly imitating his move, ignoring the fact that I know things are going to get ugly. There’s nothing I can do about it. I could run, but then he’d just chase me. “Since I don’t see any threat around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vein bulges in his neck and he starts to pace to the side while the other guy in the car climbs out. He’s tall and bulky with cropped hair and arms the size of my legs. I try to calculate how fast I can run to the car in heels, and if I make it to the car, can I drive fast enough to get away because I know he’s going to chase me down whether on foot or in a vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, now you’re not so cocky,” Mikey says with a smirk when I don’t respond. I hate to back down because it would mean living through hell for almost forever, since no one in Star Grove can seem to forget, but at the same time this isn’t my home. I might be here for holidays if that, so in the end, does it even matter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSucking in all of my stubbornness, I put my hands up and step back, putting distance between us. “Fine, you win,” I say through gritted teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No fucking way.” He counters my step back, narrowing the distances between us. “You insulted me and ruined the leather in my car. You don’t just walk away. The question is, how are you going to pay? I mean, I could just make you pay to get it reupholstered.” His eyes scroll up my body suggestively. “Although, there might be something else you can give me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help it. I burst out laughing, which probably isn’t the best thing to do but I’m drunk and not thinking rationally. Big guy starts rushing for me as I back away with my hand over my stomach, my laughter echoing around us. But he slips and eats it, falling flat on his back and I laugh harder and Mikey’s face heats with anger. He snatches my arm and jerks me forward, his fingers pressing against my skin and I wince as I stumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck off,” I say, yanking my arm back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers dig tighter as he wrenches me forward, opening his mouth to say something, but I bring my knee up and slam it in his manly parts. I’m not sure how much force is behind the blow since I’m intoxicated and having a hard time keeping my balance, but it seems to do the job and he frees me from his hold, clutching his junk as his face contorts in pain. I’m about to turn and run when he lifts his arm and strikes me across the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ears ring and I see spots as I clutch my cheek and blink. “You fucking asshole!” I shout, pissed off. Some girls would have cried, but the pain only makes me want to get him back. I see the big guy walking toward us as Mikey lifts his hand to hit me again. I bring back my own hand and slam my fist into his cheek. It’s not the first time I’ve hit someone and I’m pretty sure it won’t be my last, but no matter how many times I punch someone in the face, it still hurts my God damn hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both cry out in pain, Mikey cupping his jaw where I clocked him while I shake out my hand as I scramble away from him, ready to bolt for the car. But then a group of guys and girls exit the bar, creating a lot of noise and making it so there are now witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the guys gives a questioning look in our direction as he lights up a cigarette and I seize the opportunity to hurry over to the Chevelle and climb in with Lila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes are huge and dotted with tears and her arms are wrapped around herself. “Oh my God, Ella. That was—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Star Grove,” I tell her then add, “Lock your door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe obeys as I lock mine, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMikey goes up to one of the guys who just walked out and they exchange a hand shake while big guy stares me down with his arms folded over his chest. I reach for my phone inside my pocket, debating who to call. I know that if I call Micha he’s going to come here and if Mikey’s still here then there’s a good chance a fight’s going to go down and that’s the last thing I want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already called them the second that asshole came after you,” Lila tells me. “They were at a pub a few blocks over. They’re headed here right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit, Lila, now they’re going to come here ready to throw punches.” I glance in the rearview mirror, wincing as I touch my red, puffy cheekbone. “I think it’s going to bruise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila frowns. “Great, now you’ll have a giant bruise in all of your wedding pictures.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What pictures?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ones Caroline’s going to take.” She slaps her hand over her mouth. “Oh shit, I wasn’t supposed to tell you that.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ever-after-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-4/page-22.html","bookId":1972,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:59 AM"}
