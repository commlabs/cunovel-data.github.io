It was then that he knew what he had to do. There was no other way to save Lorraine. No other way to stop Carlos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready he could feel his strength leaving him. Carlos had the momentum, the stamina…the hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack acted quickly—out of need and determination. Out of love. He reached for Carlos and with his last reservoir of strength propelled them both toward the ledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos threw out his arms in a desperate effort to save himself, but it was too late. Both men teetered there for a moment and then they went over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing Jack heard as he tumbled over the cliff’s edge was Lorraine’s horrified scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mexican Department of Rescue worked feverishly for the next few hours. Several emergency technicians had been lowered carefully down the side of the cliff and they were now examining the bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could have survived a fall like that. Lorraine had known it the moment she saw the two men sprawled on the shore below. Carlos had struck the rocks and his body lay there, twisted and broken. Jack—her heart stopped beating every time she glanced over the edge—lay on the riverbank, faceup. Lorraine fell to her knees, her pain too much to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she’d seen Jack and Carlos go over the cliff, she’d run into the middle of the highway, nearly getting hit by a fast-moving car. Thankfully, the young couple spoke enough English to understand that there’d been a terrible accident. They were the ones who’d contacted the authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss, miss, we need you to answer questions.” The policeman, whose name tag identified him as Officer de Oro, hunkered down where she knelt. His voice was gentle, concerned. She didn’t mean to ignore him, but his English was difficult to understand. “Can you talk now? Please,” he continued. “There are many questions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to know if he’s alive. I love him.” Her voice cracked and she refused to move away from the cliff edge, refused to stop gazing down at Jack. Illogically she thought that her love would somehow help him if he’d managed to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one could live after such a fall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew it without his saying so and merely shook her head. Officer de Oro’s words underscored her worst fears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorraine didn’t know where she could possibly start. “I want my father,” she whispered brokenly, and gave him Thomas’s name. “I need my father. Could I call him, please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, we’ll arrange that later,” the policeman said. “Who is the dead man on the other side of the road?” he asked urgently. “Can you tell us that much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jason Applebee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“American?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “He’s the man who stole the Kukulcan Star.” Her answer generated an immediate response. Officer de Oro leaped up and called over another policeman. They spoke in hushed tones before the second man hurried to the radio in the patrol car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He no longer has the Star,” Lorraine said in a weak voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who does?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Department of Antiquities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you be sure?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I gave it to them this morning.” Was it only this morning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have the name of the person you gave it to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Marcus Molino.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left her to speak to the second officer again. She noticed that the activity far below had increased, and now a member of the rescue squad raced over to speak to the policemen. He was in radio contact with the people working below. Lorraine desperately wanted to understand what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me,” she said, turning to Officer de Oro when he hurried back to her side. “What did he say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The man on the rocks is dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos was dead, but she felt no sense of exhilaration. She hardly even felt relief. Instead, she experienced a deep sadness—because she realized the next news she heard would be of Jack’s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d died for her. He’d given up his life to save her. He loved her. Neither of them had spoken the words; neither had found the courage to actually say them. But Jack had loved her. And she loved him, more than she’d ever known she was capable of loving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was she going to do? How could she resume her life without him? Right now, it didn’t seem possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the radio spoke to the other police officer again. A flurry of activity followed, with ropes and stretchers being assembled and instructions shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s happening?” she asked, hope filling her heart. She struggled to her feet. “Tell me, tell me.” She gripped the police officer by the arm and wouldn’t let go until he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The second man is alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nearly passed out with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But barely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we must get him to the hospital! As soon as possible. Please, please hurry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack was alive. There was a chance. It bubbled up inside her, this surge of sudden unexpected promise. It was all she could do not to hug the man who’d delivered the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ambulance was already there. The man from the rescue squad tried to steer her away from the cliff to have her injuries treated, but she wouldn’t leave. Not until she heard the final word on Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s alive!” She wept openly at the news. “Alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss, miss, now you see the doctor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not until Jack is brought up from the cliff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, miss—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll answer all your questions later,” she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her gaze trained on Jack, who was being brought up the face of the cliff by perhaps half a dozen men below, as many above, all working together. It astonished her that such a difficult rescue could even be accomplished. She was careful to stay out of everyone’s way. The task seemed to take hours of coordinated effort; in actuality it was less than forty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the men carrying Jack reached the top, he was hurried into the waiting ambulance. The rescue team, their faces red with exertion, stepped back from the vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore anyone could protest, Lorraine climbed into the back of the ambulance with the medical technician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside, Lorraine got her first look at Jack. As a nurse practitioner she’d worked with accident victims before, but this was the worst she’d ever seen. She was appalled by the extent of his injuries. It was a miracle he wasn’t dead. She felt for the pulse in his neck, which was almost too faint to register. His internal injuries had to be massive, and he’d obviously broken a number of bones. Most likely he’d received a spinal injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe medical technician worked frantically, getting Jack hooked up to an IV and combating the effects of shock. Lorraine simply watched, holding Jack’s limp hand. Watched and prayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe siren began to wail as they started down the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next two days were a blur in Lorraine’s mind. Jack was taken almost immediately into surgery. His injuries proved as extensive as she’d feared, with plenty of room for complications and problems. She refused to leave his bedside, even when her father appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Thomas Dancy took one look at her, she could see he was badly shaken. Both her eyes had been blackened, her nose broken, and the gash in the back of her head had needed fifteen stitches. Funny how she hadn’t felt a thing, not one second of pain, from the moment Jack went over the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery ounce of energy she had she gave to Jack. All her strength, her will, everything she had to give. He had to stay alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Raine?” Her father stood by the hospital bed where Jack remained unconscious, attached to various monitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell into his arms, desperately needing his support. “I love him so much.” She understood now that she’d never really been in love. What she and Gary had was more friendship than passion. They were friends and companions, fond of each other but not in love. In many ways Gary had been her mother’s choice rather than her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you tell me what happened?” Thomas asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not now.” Others assumed she was fragile, that her state of mind had been compromised by her ordeal. Perhaps they were right; she was no longer a good judge of such things. Not that it mattered. What was important was being with Jack. She thought of nothing and no one else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Raine,” her father urged. “Come to the hotel. Sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” She shook her head. “I never told him,” she said, glancing away from Jack to briefly meet her father’s eyes. “I won’t leave him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He loves you, too?” her father asked in a hesitant voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes,” she whispered, knowing she could never explain in words the special relationship they’d shared. She’d never doubted or questioned Jack’s love, just as he’d never doubted hers for him. It was something neither of them could or would say. For Jack, love was an emotion he couldn’t afford to express to a woman he assumed was married. As for herself, she’d gambled, certain she’d have time enough to tell him the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he died now, they both lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father sat with her. After the first barrage of concerned questions, he’d asked no more, and she appreciated that. It was as if he understood she had to see this to the end. Whatever that end might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hospital was quiet. Night settled around her as she stayed at Jack’s bedside, alone now. She held his hand in hers and pressed her lips to the inside of his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once you’re out of here,” she told him, “we’ll—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t allowed to finish. His heart monitor started to blare, a piercing alarm that shattered the night and brought hospital staff running. A glance at the electronic readout showed one long straight line. Cardiac arrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary Franklin had decided he would refuse Marjorie’s letter of resignation. This wasn’t a personal decision, he convinced himself, but one he’d made out of concern for the company. After months of training, Med-X had invested a lot of money in Marjorie Ellis, and it would be a detriment to the organization if she left now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he’d suspected, he found her letter on his desk Monday morning. Knowing exactly what he intended to do, Gary grabbed it and walked briskly to her office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie looked up in surprise when he entered and closed the door. “I can’t accept this,” he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t or won’t?” she challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both.” He gave her the company line, explaining that Med-X would lose a substantial sum of money if she resigned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I’ll train my replacement before I go,” she offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t force me to continue working here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a point. “No, but I’d consider it a personal favor if you didn’t leave the company in a bind. Also, you’re working out beautifully here and we’d hate to lose you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie sagged in her chair. He noted that she’d already loaded half the contents of her drawers into a cardboard box. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sooner-the-better-deliverance-company-3/page-32.html","bookId":2350,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:10 AM"}
