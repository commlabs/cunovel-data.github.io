Nor did Solomon\u0027s great captains please her. They were not fighters; they were strategists. They played with companies as the Persians played chess with pawns. Her own men were her ideal of soldiers, copper-colored, muscled like panthers; they would crash into an opposing army like their native lightning, or they would die doggedly, their backs to the wall, their heads broken, the blood streaming into their eyes.... Nor did all the magnificence of the king\u0027s house please her.... There was too much, too quickly acquired, and jumbled, no composition. The Egyptians had more magnificent things, and grouped them better. Her eyes flickered from the hall to the pale young king on his throne. Beside him, standing, was Nathan, the principal officer, and the king\u0027s friend, a great frame of a man, fanatical.

Behind her stood her fighting men, in exact ranks, rather contemptuous. Around the hall the men of Judah and Israel fluttered. Winked at, nudged one another. \"From Abyssinia she comes, to ask him questions. See what a king we have! A great people, we!\" It was so like a showman with a marvel to exhibit! \"Ask him, ask him anything you like. Go on. Ask him.\" The cadaverous prophet! The white, young king.
