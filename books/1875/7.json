{"id":83022,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003e~MARI~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love this. It\u0027s a rush, so much more than I thought it would be. Standing on stage, feeling the lights on my skin. There\u0027s no way to describe it. Add to the fact that I\u0027m Trystan\u0027s co-star and it feels like a dream. Everything about him is contagious. He\u0027s dazzling on stage. He connects with me, calls to me, like we\u0027re two ends of the same string. I feel him tugging by just listening to his voice. It\u0027s magic and it\u0027s all Trystan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to run and throw my arms around his neck when we take a break. I want to have that comfortable feeling of being close to him, but I can\u0027t. It\u0027s easier this way, I keep telling myself. Katie will have a stroke and I really don\u0027t need more crap from Seth or Brie right now. It\u0027s better that no one knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk at Trystan. He returns the look with his blue eyes sparkling, before I run down the staircase on the side of the stage and up an aisle. I need a drink. I don\u0027t know how Trystan does it, especially since I know his throat is still sore from last night, but he\u0027s talking like nothing ever happened. It makes me wonder how many times he came in to school broken and battered and I didn\u0027t notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat smile of his hides so much pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking hard, I push through the doors and smack into Brie. She\u0027s instantly irritated. \"Watch where you\u0027re going, heifer.\" Brie shakes her head and her golden hair settles onto her shoulders before she shoves past me and into the auditorium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance after her, wondering what she\u0027s doing here. I decide not to overreact. She\u0027s not a threat. Her part was given to me. It\u0027s not like Tucker will just hand it back. I turn and walk the few paces to the water fountain and drink. The water cools my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walk back into the theater, I stand at the back half-wall, draping my arms on it. It\u0027s right when you walk in and separates the seats from the back aisle and the doors. Brie is a couple rows in front of me. She\u0027s slouched in a seat, but when they mess up the lights and blind everyone, Trystan turns around. For a moment, there\u0027s a halo of golden light around him. I smile. He looks like his video. My eyes drift to Brie. I wonder if she notices. If she does, she doesn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later Seth settles on the wall next to me. His voice is low, his lips barely moving, \"What\u0027s the tramp doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but I don\u0027t like it. She\u0027s messed with Trystan enough to last a lifetime. I wish she\u0027d fall down a hole or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth turns his face toward me and lifts a brow. \"Is that venom from Little Goodie Two Shoes? I\u0027m impressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not unjustified.\" I watch Trystan dangling his legs off the side of the stage. I watch Brie watching him. It makes me nervous. He has enough pain in his life. He doesn\u0027t need anything else to go wrong. \"She\u0027s got Trystan in her crosshairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and looks back at his friend. Seth\u0027s expression softens and he sighs. \"You care about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to dignify that with a response,\" I say, tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying, if you do - help me keep an eye on that one. I got his back for most of the day, but when he\u0027s in here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at Seth. He\u0027s staring at Trystan unblinking. I wonder if he knows. Instead of asking, I lower my gaze and nod. \"Done.\" Before Seth can say anything else and ruin my new, higher opinion of him, I walk back toward the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrie stands at the same time and smiles at me. It\u0027s one of those smiles that\u0027s good and pure, but when it\u0027s coming from someone like her, you know it\u0027s an evil omen. I narrow my eyes into slits as I pass her. She\u0027s trying to spook me. What could Brie possibly do to make life worse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker claps his large hands and thunder booms through the empty room. \"Back on stage. Let\u0027s repeat the end of that last scene so the lighting guys can get their glitch fixed. Come on! Let\u0027s go!\" He waives his arm toward the stage in a sweeping motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb the stairs and go back to the wing opposite Trystan. My stomach does a free fall when I see him. In the shadows, across the stage, Trystan looks up at me through his dark hair. He winks and I feel the need to giggle hysterically. I hear my cue and walk on stage. We run the scene two more times until lights and sound are at one hundred percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker is pleased. Instead of pinching his nose, he\u0027s smiling at us. He stands at the edge of the stage. \"You guys should be proud. You worked hard and it\u0027s obvious. Mari, thank you for stepping in at the last second. You are a perfect fit for this part. I hope to see you in more productions next year.\" I nod and smile awkwardly. Everyone looks at me. Trystan is standing next to me and bumps my shoulder with his. It attracts Tucker\u0027s attention. \"And you, Scott. Try to refrain from doing anything stupid. We need you here, in one piece, tomorrow night.\" He rubs his palms together. \"All right! Get out of here. See everyone back tomorrow night at 5:00pm. Don\u0027t be late!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan and I walk away from each other. I glance at him over my shoulder briefly. He\u0027s laughing, talking to Sophie about something. God, could she flirt with him more? Just as I\u0027m thinking it, Trystan turns back and grins at me. I smile, and roll my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I collect my stuff from backstage, I realize that I forgot a book and head back to my locker. The hallways are empty and the lights are off. I\u0027m not supposed to be wandering the halls. I stop in front of my locker and rest my head on the metal, wondering how to help Trystan. I wish I could snap my fingers and make everything better for both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you holding up the wall with that pretty head of yours?\" Trystan says softly. I turn my face and glance down the hall. He\u0027s standing with his hands in his pockets a few lockers down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and straighten. \"Someone has to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks towards me, and his smile slips off his lips. Trystan is serious and that makes me more nervous than anything else. \"Thank you. For not saying anything about last night. I know you\u0027re hurt.\" He\u0027s actually talking about it. When I tried to ask him this morning, he wasn\u0027t ready. But he is now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re hurt. I wish I knew. I wish you\u0027d told me.\" I can\u0027t look at him. Guilt is swallowing me whole. I\u0027m the crappiest friend alive. I had no idea, none at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was nothing you could have done. Mari, this shit is normal. The cops don\u0027t even come anymore. I\u0027m lucky they didn\u0027t toss me in jail last night. I\u0027m eighteen. That arrest would have been permanent. I got lucky this time. There can\u0027t be a next time.\" He\u0027s next to me. His voice is soft, his breath is in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he wants me to turn to look at him, but I can\u0027t. Something is strangling me from the inside. I want to fix this. I know I can help him, at least a little bit. I know he can\u0027t go home anymore. I know he has no clothes. These are things I can offer. Before I even realize what I\u0027m saying, the words are out of my mouth. \"Then, stay with me. Hide out at my house until you graduate.\" I glance at him from the corner of my eye. My heart is beating too hard, too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. \"Your dad hates me - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad\u0027s never home. Last night after everything that happened, he didn\u0027t even call to see if I was all right. He stayed and worked his entire shift. The only thing he cares about is work and my mother.\" Trystan\u0027s eyes search my face. I turn toward him and press my back into the lockers. A sad smile lines my lips. Glancing at his chest, I say, \"I shouldn\u0027t complain. Compared to you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. Dark hair falls in his eyes. Trystan\u0027s hands land on my shoulders. \"Don\u0027t say that. Compared to me, you have your own hell. Compared to me, you\u0027re in just as much pain. I see it, Mari. It\u0027s written on your face and chiseled into your heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan\u0027s eyes lower for a moment. His hand slips across my cheek, leaving a warm trail on my cool skin. \"I wish I could take it away,\" he breathes. \"I wish they\u0027d see how wonderful and special and amazing you are. I don\u0027t know how your parents can\u0027t see that. They must be blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You outshine the sun, Mari. And I\u0027m not just saying that. It\u0027s true. When I look at you...\" he breathes hard and rests his head against mine. \"I see everything I ever wanted and more.\" By the time he finishes, his voice is a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t look at his eyes. I\u0027ll fall apart. Moving slowly, Trystan brushes his lips across my cheek. Every part of me reacts to his touch, to him. I\u0027m breathing too hard. It\u0027s too hot. Trystan pulls back. There\u0027s a breath between us and no more. My heart hammers inside of me. We\u0027re like two magnets, slightly separated, pulling toward each other. When I lift my gaze to meet his, I melt. My lips part and I breathe. Trystan lowers his lashes and watches my mouth. I\u0027m falling. I\u0027m lost in his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan is about to kiss me when a jarring voice slams through the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no. Not this shit again. Scott, you said you were over this.\" Seth walks toward us. His boots echo up and down the hall. He\u0027s as graceful as a gorilla with concrete sneakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan gives me a look that says he\u0027s sorry and a million other things. Before Seth gets closer, he leans in and whispers in my ear, \"I\u0027ll come. After seven?\" I nod. Trystan\u0027s eyes meet mine and the only thing I want is his arms around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winks at me and turns away. Trystan is all swagger and charm. He struts away saying, \"You know how much I like to tease her.\" He looks over his shoulder at me. I play back and give him a pointed expression. Trystan laughs and grabs Seth\u0027s shoulders, pulling him away from me. \"Come on. Let\u0027s grab dinner. I\u0027m starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth looks at Trystan and then back at me, saying, \"We had an understanding Jennings and this isn\u0027t part of it.\" Seth gives me a hostile look and points his finger at me. \"You\u0027re back on my shit list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was never off your shit list,\" I huff and slam my locker door. I walk down the hall and shove past them, adding, \"And I don\u0027t really care if I\u0027m on your list or not, Seth. Have fun making out with yourself, Sexbot.\" I feel their eyes on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is flying, soaring so high, so fast. Trystan said yes. He\u0027ll stay over. Nothing could ruin this night. Nothing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-4/page-7.html","bookId":1875,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:39 PM"}
