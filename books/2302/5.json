Even if she wrote the story, most people wouldn’t believe her. The war between the Vampires and the Werewolves had ended eighteen years ago. Mortals being what they were, they had quickly brushed aside what they couldn’t explain once the conflict was over. Since that time, the Supernatural creatures had been keeping a low profile. But it would only take one sensational story to bring the hunters out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” he said, “do we have a deal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Savanah glanced around the club. Did he mean to kiss her here, in front of all these people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll have to go outside,” he said. “For the kiss, and for the transformation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where outside?” she asked suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “The parking lot out back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about it a moment. It was against her better judgment to be alone in the dark with this man, but she was a woman and a reporter and her curiosity would not be denied. “All right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told herself she had nothing to worry about as she followed him out of the club. There were people on the street, and she had a healthy set of lungs if he tried anything funny, not to mention a can of pepper spray in her handbag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parking lot wasn’t as dark as she expected, thanks to a full moon and the floodlight affixed to one corner of the club’s roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRane stopped between two cars, which would afford them a degree of privacy from anyone driving by on the street or walking down the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavanah looked up at him, her heart pounding like a drum. Why had she agreed to this? If she screamed, would anyone hear her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRane lifted one brow. “Have you changed your mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had, but she didn’t want to admit it, didn’t want him to think she was a coward, so she shook her head. “No, have you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a chance.” He moved toward her, his heated gaze fixed on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to back up, to run away, but she seemed rooted to the spot, unable to move, unable to tear her gaze from his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Savanah.” Murmuring her name, he reached for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart was beating so fast, Savanah thought she might faint. She couldn’t stifle a gasp when his arm circled her waist and drew her close. She could feel the latent strength of him, knew that he could crush her with no effort at all. Never in her life had she felt so helpless, so vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, hardly daring to breathe. The rest of the world faded away until all she saw, all she knew, was this man holding her close, his breath fanning her cheek as he bent his head toward hers. He was too near, his presence too overpowering. She started to say she had changed her mind, but it was too late. His mouth captured hers in a kiss that left no room for coherent thought, no room for anything beyond the wave of sensual heat that unleashed a familiar tingling in the pit of her stomach and threatened to turn her blood to liquid fire. For a moment, she stared into the depths of his eyes, and then, with a sigh, she closed her eyes and surrendered to his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost, she thought, she was lost in a churning sea of ecstasy. A dim part of her mind set off warning bells. If his kiss was this arousing, she would be wise to avoid anything more intimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took her several moments to realize the kiss had ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs sanity returned, she glared at him, annoyed by the smug look in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arm tightened around her waist. “Are you ready?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. “Ready for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly. “I thought you wanted to see me perform.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Oh, yes, of course. Are you going to do it now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slammed her fist against his shoulder. It was like hitting a block wall. “Get your mind out of the gutter,” she said irritably, “and do your trick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin widened. His teeth were very white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop that! You know what I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleasing his hold on her, he took a step back. There was a tremor in the air, a rush of Supernatural power as Rane’s body shimmered, and suddenly he was gone and a large black wolf stood in his place, staring up at her out of Rane’s deep black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavanah shook her head. She glanced around the parking lot, looking for Rane, looking for something, anything, that would explain what she had seen. But there was no one else there, no accomplice lurking in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back at the wolf. It was sitting on its haunches now, grinning a wolfish grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling foolish, she whispered his name. “Rane?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the wolf wagged its tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took several steps backward. “It can’t be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet even as Savanah told herself that what she was seeing was impossible, bits and pieces of ancient folklore and mythology surfaced in her mind. In her senior year in high school, she had done a paper on shape-shifters for her English class. She had found the subject so fascinating, she had researched it far more than was necessary for one paper. In British folklore, fairies, witches and wizards were all known to have the ability to change shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Norse mythology, both Loki and Odin had been shape-shifters. Buddhist folklore featured stories of thenaga, snakes which could take on human form. There were numerous tales of Werewolves, humans compelled to turn into wolves when the moon was full. One of the most highly debated themes in shape-shifting was whether it was voluntary or induced by outside influences. Circe had transformed those who intruded on her island into swine. Some Indian shamans were believed to be able to take on the form of animals. Then there was Savanah’s favorite fairy tale,Beauty and the Beast, in which the prince had been cursed by an enchantress and turned into a beast, only to be saved by Beauty’s love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavanah shook her head. Werewolves and curses and old Norse gods were all just stories and legends, but the wolf looking up at her through Rane’s eyes was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tensed as the wolf stood and padded toward her, insinuating its head under her hand, pressing its body against her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes, it was very real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the wolf’s body shimmered and Rane stood before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA memory from her childhood rose from the misty corners of her mind. She had been six or seven at the time, feigning sleep on the sofa, when she overheard her parents talking about the Werewolves that were terrorizing the countryside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling light-headed, Savanah stared at Rane. Werewolf, she thought. She had kissed a Werewolf, and liked it. It was her last thought before everything went black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering an oath, Rane caught her before she hit the blacktop. He supposed he really couldn’t blame her for fainting. She had thought his transformation on stage was a trick, an illusion. Sometimes the truth was more than the mortal mind could handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCradling her to his chest, he debated what to do with her. He could wait until she regained consciousness and take her back into the club, he could drop her off at her place, or he could take her home with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was smart, he would bid the lovely Miss Gentry farewell and never see her again. But he was tired of being smart, and tired of being alone. He would be in Kelton for another two weeks. What better way to spend his free time than getting better acquainted with the beautiful woman in his arms?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his mind made up, he picked up her evening bag and shoved it into his back pocket, and then, using his preternatural powers, he took her home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it wasn’t really his home, just a small, nondescript house he had rented during his stay in Kelton. Truth be told, he didn’t have a place to call his own. No strings, no roots, nothing to tie him down. Like the wind, he was footloose and fancy-free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd damned tired of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the house in a matter of moments. A thought opened the front door, another lit the candles on the mantel and brought the banked fire in the hearth to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRane glanced around the room, wondering what Savanah would think of it when she woke. It wasn’t much to look at—just a square room with beige walls, brown tweed carpeting, and mismatched furniture. There were no pictures on the walls, no mementos, nothing of a personal nature save for a program from the Kelton Performing Arts Center. Call it vanity, but he had a collection of programs from the various venues where he had performed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered Savanah onto the fake leather couch, tossed her handbag on the mantel, then stood there, gazing down at her. Why had he brought her here? She would be repulsed if she knew what he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore softly as a decidedly jealous inner voice reminded him that Kathy hadn’t been repulsed by his brother, Raphael. His mother hadn’t been disgusted by his father’s true nature, nor had Grandmother Brenna been repulsed by Grandfather Roshan. True, the females in the family might have had some problems in the beginnings of their various relationships, but sexual attraction hadn’t been one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttraction. Rane grunted softly. He was definitely captivated by Savanah Gentry. And she was equally fascinated by him. If she was agreeable, they could spend a pleasurable two weeks together before he moved on. If not…his gaze lingered on the hollow of her throat. If not, bringing her here would not be a total loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed the hair away from her neck, his nostrils flaring at the scent of her blood. His fangs lengthened as he bent over her. He would treat himself to a taste of her life’s blood now. Later, if things went awry between them, he would wipe his memory from her mind and send her on her way, none the wiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavanah woke with a start. Sensing something amiss, she didn’t open her eyes immediately. Where was she? The last thing she remembered…Oh, Lord, the last thing she remembered was watching Santoro the Magnificent transform into a large black wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she in the wolf’s den? Opening her eyes just a crack, she found herself staring up at an unfamiliar ceiling. Fear made her heart race as she sat up, her gaze darting from left to right. She frowned as she took in the unfamiliar surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feeling better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, she glanced over her shoulder. He was standing behind the sofa, a glass of water in his hand. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-pleasure-children-of-the-night-4/page-5.html","bookId":2302,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}
