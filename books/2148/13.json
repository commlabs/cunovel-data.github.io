I was dying to grab his hand when I saw him by his locker, like I had when we were skating, but I didn\u0027t possess the courage. Instead, I just daydreamed about him throughout each class and wrote his name in every one of my notebooks\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;in an out-of-the-way spot so my friends couldn\u0027t see. After school I was at Ivy\u0027s, working on our English essays, when my cell phone rang. It wasn\u0027t a ring tone I was familiar with\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not Abby\u0027s, Nash\u0027s, or my parents\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Frank Sinatra\u0027s voice singing \"Fly Me to the Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is that?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon\u0027s name appeared. How could that be? Then it hit me; he must have added his name to my contact list when he found my phone in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swept up the phone and covered it with my sleeve before Ivy had a chance to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank kept singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better answer it and tell them they have the wrong number. Otherwise, they\u0027ll keep calling.\" My phone number was one digit off from a local radio station\u0027s. I\u0027d been receiving calls from listeners requesting songs or dialing in for a contest, but I\u0027d been too lazy to change my number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to talk to Brandon so badly. I was dancing on the inside. I quickly answered before he hung up. \"Hello?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all gone,\" he said in a deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The brownies? They\u0027re all gone. Even the crumbs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s a wrong number,\" I whispered. The lie jumped out of my mouth before I had the chance to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only you\u0027d answer them!\" Ivy shouted. \"Tell them they might have won if they dialed the right number for a change!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to give you back the pan. And your scarf,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused. What did that mean? A date?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they asking?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or... I can sell them on eBay,\" he teased. \"I\u0027m sure they would get a lot since they belong to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you laughing at them? Are they requesting a song?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to the game tonight?\" Brandon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you asking them questions?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined Brandon approaching me at the game with my mom\u0027s brownie pan and my scarf. The ref would whistle and the game would stop. The players and fans would leer in horror. Ivy and Abby would fold their arms in disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I have work to do,\" he finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them to get back to their job before their boss notices they\u0027re listening to the radio instead of working,\" Ivy said. \"You don\u0027t have to be so polite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a lot of upkeep around here and I help out my grandparents,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, I thought. That was kind of like when I volunteered at the nursing home. Brandon was putting his grandparents\u0027 needs in front of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But feel free to swing by here if you get a chance,\" he continued. \"I\u0027ll be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If not, I\u0027ll get them to you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to hang up. I wanted to talk to him forever. Even with Ivy in the room and my juggling antics, I was so happy to have Brandon on the phone. There was so much I wanted to know about him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;so many things I couldn\u0027t ask now. And the one question that burned inside of me\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what was it like to be kissed by him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate you calling,\" I finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough is enough.\" She grabbed the phone. \"Would you like me to call your cell phone and request a song? Never call this number again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you should have said from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next few hours, I tried my best to focus on my essay about werewolves. But I couldn\u0027t help but let my thoughts wander to the wolves I\u0027d met a few days ago, and how I was lucky even to be able to finish a complete sentence, all because of Brandon\u0027s heroic nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the Heidi Rosen fiasco at Nash\u0027s party, he and I were \"off.\" However, that didn\u0027t keep my friends from dragging me to the basketball game and expecting reconciliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a lot of reasons to like Nash. He was handsome, athletic, and popular. He had enough money to do whatever a girl dreamed of\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;except he\u0027d only do it if it was his dream, too. But instead of planning a possible reunion, my mind was focused on Brandon working at his house while all of us cheered for the Wolverines. I was so drawn to Brandon, I could think of nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should have a hockey team,\" I said to Ivy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have enough problems raising funds to maintain football and basketball,\" she replied. \"Now you want to build a hockey rink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not everyone likes those sports,\" I defended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious?\" Ivy asked. \"Who do you know in this town that doesn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get that idea?\" Abby asked. \"I\u0027d like to play hockey. Only I\u0027d want a pink uniform.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, Nash made a great three-point shot. The crowd rose to their feet and cheered, but I didn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you tonight?\" Abby said. \"It\u0027s like you\u0027re not really here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, I was thinking about being somewhere else\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;somewhere that didn\u0027t have cheerleaders and screaming fans. Brandon\u0027s house wasn\u0027t too far away from school, and I figured it wouldn\u0027t hurt anyone if I just popped over and retrieved my things. I\u0027d be back before the game was even over. My friends wouldn\u0027t miss me. The game was so riveting to them, it didn\u0027t matter who was sitting by them. Additionally, Brandon had wanted to return my items to me tonight, and if I hadn\u0027t already had plans, I might be there helping him out. Since Ivy hung up on Brandon, I was convinced he\u0027d never call again. If I missed this chance, I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d ever get another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go,\" I said to Ivy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean? Nash is tearing up the court. You can\u0027t miss it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to be somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where else could you be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back soon. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could say another word, I was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove to Riverside. Normally, I was a pragmatic and practical person. Now I had to follow my heart. All I knew was that I needed to see Brandon and I couldn\u0027t fight it any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I didn\u0027t need directions to Brandon\u0027s house. The first time I drove there, it was daylight. With a cloudy night and freezing temperatures, the full moon only shone every now and then. In Riverside there weren\u0027t streetlights illuminating the way, only white or yellow lines and reflective tape against the guardrails. I wasn\u0027t really used to these more rural roads, especially at night, and the trees were spooky when the headlights hit them. My heart began to race. What if I got a flat tire? How would I explain my location to my parents? And on this lonely road, would my family find me before a wayward stranger did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I pulled into the private drive, I got cold feet\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what was I doing here to begin with? I shouldn\u0027t have left the comfort of my friends on the right side of town for the unknown adventures on the wrong one. At this moment, there was nothing to keep me at the gymnasium. Instead I was drawn toward Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy headlights shone on Brandon\u0027s Jeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathless, I knocked on the front door. The dog barked, but no one answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to the back of the house. There was a small outbuilding the size of a two-car garage with a light shining from the window. I peered in, expecting it to be filled with tools, an old car, and a riding lawn mower. Instead there was a single bed, dresser, and TV. In the corner were a hockey stick and helmet and the pair of skates Brandon used yesterday. My scarf, pan, and card were sitting on the dresser. I felt warmth spread through me, knowing my things meant enough to him to have them displayed. I noticed some other things: a small wooden desk with a lit lamp and a laptop, a few bottles of medicine and bandages for his hand, stacks of books on wolves, deer, and other wild animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the hilltop I could hear the faint sound of chopping. I followed the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon?\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scaled the hill and was almost out of breath when I reached the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon, in his brown leather jacket, was doing his best to chop wood. He struggled because of his wounded hand. He swore under his breath and shook out his hand in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he caught sight of me. Startled, he jumped. \"I didn\u0027t see you there,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to scare you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027m glad you came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hurt your hand again - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it\u0027s nothing. I\u0027m really surprised to see you,\" he said. \"I guess that scarf is really important to you. To leave the game...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah,\" I said. \"The scarf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re wearing another one,\" he said, pointing to my green-and-white-striped one. \"How many do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer, I just stood nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get your things for you. I just have to adjust this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stacked the broken pieces of wood with his good hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t care about the scarf. I only cared about him. I wanted Brandon to touch me so badly and I wanted to touch him, too\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;to feel his embrace and lips against mine. I wasn\u0027t about to make the first move, and neither was he apparently. It wasn\u0027t my personality to be so romantically forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need help?\" I finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you sit down. It will just be a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the chopping log.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he stalling so that I\u0027d have to stay with him in the woods longer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my shoulder. If something didn\u0027t happen soon, I was going to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tension,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you have to be tense about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, everything, I guess. School. Tests. Boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys?\" he said. \"Ah... that is stressful. Here, let me,\" he said, and came around behind me. \"Your scarf is in the way. Do you mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peeled away my scarf and pressed his hand against my skin. My flesh tingled in his warm, strong hand. I was so in heaven, finally having Brandon being so close to me. Before I knew it, I felt his lips against my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so overwhelmed I was afraid I\u0027d fall off the chopping block and melt into the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Brandon stood in front of me and extended his good hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at him, his royal blue eyes shining down at me. I took his hand, stood, and he drew me close to him. Even through our heavy coats, I could feel the heat from our bodies pressed together. Overhead the clouds drifted apart, exposing a perfectly full moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon glimmered above us, magically illuminating us. When I\u0027d looked at a moon like this before, it had always been when I\u0027d felt alone\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;now it seemed to be smiling at me, as I was finally under its romantic glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered Dr. Meadows warning me about the full moon. Beware of a kiss under the full moon. It will change your life forever. She had been right about the snow, the woods, howling, and an outsider. But what was the chance that she was correct about the rest? And what did it mean, really? I was so attracted to Brandon, I didn\u0027t know what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Is something wrong?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, just something someone said. About the moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s beautiful, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gently glided my hair away from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been wanting to do this since I first saw you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then he leaned into me and did what I\u0027d been dying for him to do for so long. Since he first looked at me in Mrs. Clark\u0027s class, passed me in the hallways, and saved me in the woods. Brandon kissed me. His lips were so tender I thought I was in a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like nothing I\u0027d ever experienced before. Deeper and more soulful than when I kissed Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething truly special had happened to me after seventeen years of living in Legend\u0027s Run. I\u0027d fallen in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began giggling with delight as Brandon wrapped his arms around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s so funny?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m just so happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in heaven in Brandon\u0027s strong arms. I didn\u0027t want to go back to the game. I didn\u0027t want this moment to ever end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caressed my cheek, and we kissed again so passionately I thought I\u0027d gone to heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned my head against his chest and he stroked his fingers through my hair. I could feel his heart pounding as fast as a bullet train. I gazed up and saw he wore a soft smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe full moon shone strong. He continued to stroke my hair and then kissed my neck and ears. My body tingled as his lips tickled my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kissed again, but suddenly he drew away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have to leave,\" I said, referring to the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon didn\u0027t answer. Instead, he released me from his embrace and stepped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" I said. \"I won\u0027t go. Not if you don\u0027t want me to. At least not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that...\" Brandon turned pale. \"I feel odd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should sit down,\" I said, pointing to the tree stump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it\u0027s something different. I feel really hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because you are,\" I said, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m burning up,\" he said, and took off his coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur kisses had heated me up, too, but I wasn\u0027t ready to throw my coat to the side just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon ripped off his long-sleeved knit shirt and dropped it in the snow. He pulled off his undershirt and threw it at his feet. \"I feel really weird,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not sure you should be around me. I think something\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt awful, too. We had just shared the best kiss of my life and now Brandon was acting strangely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fog from his warm breath seemed to be heavier and thicker than mine. I wasn\u0027t sure what was happening. \"Maybe you\u0027ve come down with something,\" I offered. \"There\u0027s always some flu going around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicked off his boots and yanked off his socks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Brandon was far from focused on me. His brow furrowed and his gaze showed concern. This was no seduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally looked at me. Brandon was standing in thirty-degree weather in several inches of snow in just his jeans. He was barefoot and shirtless. And he wasn\u0027t shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest was smooth and his arms were pale and lean. His chest heaved in and out rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have a fever. But then you\u0027d be shivering,\" I said, bewildered. \"Let\u0027s go inside. Maybe your grandparents can help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;they\u0027re not home. Besides, I don\u0027t think I should move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon started to shake. It was then I saw it. His royal blue eyes were a searing gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t believe my own eyes! I was stunned. How could his eyes change color? And why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I began to shake. What was happening to Brandon? I was scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon doubled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he did have the flu, but his symptoms were coming on so strong and so quickly, I wasn\u0027t sure what kind of flu it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon pulled himself over to a tree and leaned his back against it. I tried to follow, but he shooed me away. I wanted to respect his privacy, but I was really starting to worry. I cared for Brandon so deeply and was torn apart seeing him in distress. Since he wasn\u0027t going to leave the hilltop, I\u0027d have to get someone to come to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m calling the police. You need a doctor,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon didn\u0027t say a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tree blocked my view of Brandon. It was dark except for the strong moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon,\" I said, \"what\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Celeste. You have to leave.\" Brandon\u0027s voice was tormented and serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t want to leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please... go. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more Brandon pushed me away, the more I wanted to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m calling nine-one-one,\" I said as a threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please leave, Celeste,\" he repeated. His voice was so deep, almost animal-like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept hoping that at any moment Brandon would jump out and say \"Gotcha!\" like the millions of times Nash pranked me and our friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t and I was truly frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I called. \"You\u0027re scaring me! I\u0027m going back to the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that\u0027s... a great... idea.\" His voice was now shallow and breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI retreated. I was torn. If this was a cruel joke, I didn\u0027t want to be its target. His brilliant blue eyes had changed to gray. It couldn\u0027t be possible. But if it was, then something was dreadfully wrong with Brandon and leaving him up there alone on the hilltop wasn\u0027t the responsible thing to do. He hadn\u0027t run away when I needed help. As scared as I was, I wasn\u0027t about to desert him in his time of crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting help,\" I called to him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he stepped out from behind the tree. Brandon\u0027s short, wavy brown hair was now savagely wild and shoulder-length. His normally clean-shaven face sported a goatee. His once-smooth chest was now lined with a thin layer of hair. His stomach was as ripped as an Olympic swimmer\u0027s, and his biceps were cut like a triathlete\u0027s. His eyes were a gorgeous gray. He was breathing heavy, as if he\u0027d run a marathon. Brandon had fangs like a wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped dialing. I could barely breathe. It couldn\u0027t be...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon continued to stare at me intensely, as if he wasn\u0027t sure what had just happened himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon! You look like a werewolf!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was sullen. He examined his arms and felt his stubble and goatee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon glared at me with the frailty of a human and the intensity of an animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inched away. I was frightened and freaked out. Why was he acting this way? A moment ago, I\u0027d been on the other end of his irresistible lips. And now he was acting like a creature I\u0027d never seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was afraid of him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;of the situation\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;of being alone in the woods. The same person who\u0027d saved me from a pack of wolves was now staring at me with their steady gray eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsure of what he\u0027d do next, I didn\u0027t break his mesmerizing gaze. I gently and quietly took a giant step backward. Unfortunately, my boot landed on a branch instead of solid ground. It cracked underneath my pressure, causing my foot to slip and I fell down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I looked up, Brandon was standing over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - \" I cried, putting my hand out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was frightened and began to shake. He looked like he could rip me to shreds. But Brandon appeared confused by my fear. His intense expression softened as if he was as surprised as I was at his strange condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he retreated into the shadows and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, I heard a fierce howl, like that of a lone wolf. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-13.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
