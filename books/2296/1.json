The owner\u0027s main claim to fame was his boast that, inside the largest of its three rather shabby-looking tents, he had the body of a genuine Transylvanian vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa paid the wizened ticket-taker six-fifty and then, bypassing the usual carnival rides and games, entered the large blue-and-white-striped sideshow tent along with the other hardy souls who had ventured out in the rain on this cool and windy Halloween evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wandered from one attraction to the other, pausing to look at the bearded lady, at a two-headed man who was so obviously a fake it was laughable. Moving on, she saw a sad-faced giant clad in a leopard-skin costume that reminded her of Fred Flintstone. There was a morose-looking dwarf, a man who had skin like that of a reptile, a diminutive woman who was covered from head to foot with psychedelic tattoos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was thick with the scent of rain-damp clothing, cotton candy and buttered popcorn, mustard and onions. A vendor wearing a yellow apron was calling, \"Get your hot dogs! Get \u0027em while they\u0027re hot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa stopped when she came to a smaller tent set up within the big one. A hand-lettered sign read\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCOUNT ALEXI KRISTOV\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOLDEST VAMPIRE IN EXISTENCE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa felt a sudden chill skitter down her spine as she stepped into the small tent. Good special effects, she mused. She glanced over her shoulder, expecting to see some sort of fan, but saw nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she saw the coffin. It was the old-fashioned kind, bigger at the top than at the bottom. Dull black in color, it rested on a raised wooden dais in the center of the sawdust-strewn floor. The closed lid was covered with a large spray of fake, bloodred roses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were perhaps a dozen other people in the tent. They stood in a loose semicircle around the casket, talking in hushed whispers. A little girl tugged on her mother\u0027s hand, begging to go on a pony ride. Two teenage boys stood together, teasing a pretty teenage girl by making jokes about the undead and creatures of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd fell silent as a tall, cadaver-thin man dressed in a dark brown suit and old-fashioned cravat entered the tent and took his place at the head of the coffin. He stood there, his pale hands folded, his expression somber, while the lights dimmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome,\" the man said, executing a courtly bow. \"I am Silvano.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke with a heavy accent, though Marisa could not place it. Hungarian, perhaps, or Russian?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you are about to see may shock you, but, be assured, it is quite real. Hundreds of years ago, Count Alexi Kristov was a ruthless monster, a scourge who decimated many small villages in my native Romania. In his time, he preyed on my family, devouring them one by one until my ancestors were almost completely destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa took a step forward, drawn in by the man\u0027s words. She had never been one to believe in ghosts or goblins. She wasn\u0027t afraid of the dark. She didn\u0027t believe in witches or warlocks or vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something in this man\u0027s voice, his words, made her believe. She felt the hair rise along her arms as Silvano took a deep breath and began to speak again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over a hundred years ago, one of my ancestors discovered the count\u0027s resting place. He rendered the vampire helpless by binding him with silver chains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery slowly, Silvano removed the plastic roses from the top of the coffin. He hesitated, for dramatic effect, Marisa surmised, and then, with a flourish, lifted the lid, which was lined with white satin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Though he looks dead,\" Silvano went on, his tone somber, \"I can assure you that Count Alexi Kristov is very much alive. A century without nourishment has rendered him helpless and virtually powerless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilvano extended his hand in invitation. \"Please, do not be afraid to come forward for a closer look. There is no danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa hung back until everyone else had taken a good look at the count, and then, on legs that suddenly felt like limp spaghetti, she climbed the two steps up to the dais and looked down into the casket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed of the coffin was lined with the same white satin that lined the lid. A silver cross, perhaps a foot tall, was secured to the foot of the coffin. Similar crosses were placed on either side of the vampire\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire, attired in an old-fashioned shiny black suit, was laid out with his arms at his sides. She thought it odd that his hands were tightly clenched. A thick silver chain was wrapped around his body from his chest to his ankles. His skin, which was almost as white as the satin beneath him, was drawn paper-thin over his skull-like head. Pale brown lashes lay against his sunken cheeks. His hair was long and limp, the color a dull reddish brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe definitely looked dead. A long time dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling Silvano\u0027s gaze, Marisa looked up. \"Why didn\u0027t your ancestors kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They felt death would be too merciful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merciful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\" Silvano gestured at the vampire. \"How can I explain it? He is very much alive. Without human blood to sustain him, he is in constant torment.\" A smile that was not really a smile twisted Silvano\u0027s thin lips. \"He cannot escape the chains. The crosses render him powerless. His soul is trapped within this body. This dead body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa shivered as she looked at the vampire again. Almost, Silvano had her believing the vampire was real. But, of course, it was just some extremely skinny man and some impressive stage makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the vampire\u0027s chest, silently counting the seconds. One minute passed. Two. The man never took a breath. Three minutes. Four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold chill ran up her spine. Maybe it really was a corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilvano turned away as a pretty girl wearing a short red skirt, a white off-the-shoulder blouse, black net stockings, and ballerina slippers called his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa watched Silvano leave the tent with the girl. Glancing around, she saw that everyone else had left, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart pounding with trepidation, she realized she was alone with the vampire. She stared at the body. Maybe it wasn\u0027t human at all. Maybe it was made of wax, like the figures at the Movieland Wax Museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed with relief. That was it, of course. Why hadn\u0027t she thought of that before? It was just an elaborate hoax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over her shoulder. There was no one in sight. Feeling foolish, she ran her fingertips over the links of the chains. They felt real, solid. A small fortune in silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, unable to resist the temptation, she touched the vampire\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t made of wax. The skin was cold. Smooth and dry, it reminded her of ancient parchment. She gasped as the papery skin grew warm beneath her fingertips. And then, very slowly, the skeletal fingers of the vampire\u0027s left hand uncurled and spread out to lie flat against the smooth satin lining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shriek, Marisa jumped away from the coffin. She tripped as she stumbled backward, cried out as she tumbled down the steps. She scraped her leg on the rough wood, landed in the sawdust on her hands and knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaken, she glanced over her shoulder, at worst expecting to see the vampire climbing out of the coffin, its fangs bared in a hideous grin, at best expecting to see an ordinary man sitting up, laughing uproariously because he had scared her out of ten years of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all was quiet within the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeathly quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa scrambled to her feet, wincing as she did so. Looking down, she saw blood dripping from a shallow laceration just above her right ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling a handkerchief from her purse, she mopped up the blood; then, with a grimace, she tossed the hanky in a trash can and hurried out of the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood. Warm and sweet and fresh. The scent of it filled the air, teasing his nostrils, tantalizing his senses, awakening a thirst that had lain dormant for a hundred years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman\u0027s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand tingled as he remembered the touch of her hand, her fingers warm and soft, the throb of her pulse beckoning him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fought through layers of blackness, a century of darkness, all his senses honed on the irresistible scent of the woman\u0027s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flexed his hands, his shoulders, licked his lips as the Hunger roared to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an effort, he opened his eyes. A cry of outrage rumbled deep in his throat when he saw the crosses. Three of them, all silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the return of awareness came pain\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the pain of the silver chains that bound him, the raging Hunger that had not been fed for a hundred years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the pain and the Hunger, he reached deep inside himself, calling on the strength of a thousand years...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa came awake with the sound of her own screams ringing in her ears. Breathing heavily, she switched on the bedside lamp and glanced around, relieved to find herself safe at home, in her own bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand went to her neck, her fingers anxiously probing the skin beneath her left ear. There didn\u0027t seem to be any bite marks. There was no blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dream,\" she murmured, \"it was only a dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it had seemed so real. The creature bending over the bed, his gray eyes glowing an unholy red in the darkness, his hands like claws as they clamped over her shoulders to hold her in place, his long reddish brown hair brushing against her cheek as he leaned over her, his fangs poised at her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo real, she thought, so real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving the light on, she drew the covers up to her chin, afraid to close her eyes, afraid to go back to sleep for fear the nightmare would find her again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shades-of-gray-vampire-trilogy-1/page-1.html","bookId":2296,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:06 PM"}
