This time, however, the Matron and I agreed. Mortal Sword, from the visions Gu’Rull has given me, I do not think the Grey Helms accept your command.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler snorted. ‘Pious bores – I’m glad of that, truth be told. Oh, Krughava looked to be capable and all that, but I tell you, all that Wolf-worshipping made me uneasy.’ Noting her raised brow he shrugged and said, ‘Aye, I went and picked my own god of war, so it’s a bit much to be going on about the Perish. The thing is, Kalyth, it makes sense for a soldier to choose a god of war. It doesn’t make sense when a god of war makes soldiers of an entire people. It’s the wrong way round, right? Well, there’s something skewed about it – though I can’t really tell you why I feel that way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So they are free to do as they please?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I suppose so. I don’t know much about this Tanakalian, except that he’d have done well in the Malazan court, if there’s any truth to the story of how he usurped Krughava. People like that, Kalyth, I don’t trust. It’s what got me in so much trouble all those years ago. Anyway, if Tanakalian wants to take his Perish right up the arsehole of the Forkrul Assail, well, he’s welcome to light his own torch and go to it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What are your thoughts on the Letherii prince, Mortal Sword?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Him I like. Aranict, too. Solid people, those two. From what I heard back in Letherii, before his brother took the throne, Brys was some kind of special bodyguard to the Letherii emperor. Unmatched with the sword. That tells me more about him than you think.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In what way?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Anyone who has mastered a weapon – truly mastered it – is a humble man or woman. More than that, I know how he thinks, and something of what he sees. The way his brain works. And it seems that making him a prince hasn’t changed him any. So, Kalyth, worry not about the Letherii. Come the day, they’ll be there.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Leaving only the Bolkando—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She defers to Brys, I think. She doesn’t want to, but that’s just how it is. Besides,’ Gesler added, ‘she has red hair.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth frowned. ‘I don’t understand.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Me and Stormy, we’re Falari. Plenty of red-haired people in Falar. So, I’ll tell you what Abrastal is like. Deadly temper, glowing-hot iron, but being a mother she’s learned the wisdom of knowing what’s in her control and what isn’t. She doesn’t like it but she lives with it. Likes her sex, too, but prone to jealousy – and all of that bluster, why, it’s all for show. Inside, she’s just looking for a man like me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped. ‘But she’s married! And to a king!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler grinned. ‘Was just seeing if you were still listening, Destriant. Saw your attention drifting there.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A Hunter found me – you’re closed off and Stormy is sleeping. A rider was seen, out from close to the Perish camp, riding into the Glass Desert.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Any more detail than that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You can see what the Hunter saw, Mortal Sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Right, I can, can’t I?’ He concentrated for a moment, and then swore under his breath. ‘Krughava.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To the Adjunct, I’d wager.
