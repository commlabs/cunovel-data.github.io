Sergeant Finnigan says as how he thinks it\u0027s them Mammyluks as there\u0027s been such talk about.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The deuce he does!\" exclaimed Holroyd. \"Whereabouts is this djerm? On our side of the river?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, your honour; \u0027twas nigh that chapel-looking place on the river bank.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Chapel-looking place! You mean the mosque, I suppose,\" said Holroyd, smiling. \"Come, Tom, we\u0027ll go and see for ourselves. Take charge until I return, Sergeant Bullen, and be well on the alert.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We hastened to the outpost, where we found Sergeant Finnigan with his men ready for any emergency. Close to the river bank, within four hundred paces of the outpost, stood a small mosque, its slender crescent-crowned minaret shooting up gracefully from amid the dark foliage by which it was surrounded.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very cautiously we made our way down the sand-hills.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s a jham yonder, sorr,\" said Sergeant Finnigan, a fine old fellow, who had put Charlie Holroyd through his facings when he first joined the 35th, and had been my father\u0027s orderly in days of yore. \"A jham, your honour, full of Mammyluks, I\u0027m afther thinkin\u0027.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t see her, Finnigan,\" rejoined Holroyd, looking in the direction pointed out. \"Where is she?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The clump of trees hides her, sorr,\" answered the sergeant; \"but she\u0027s there shure enough. Does your honour think they\u0027re the Mammyluks?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We\u0027ll hope so, Finnigan, but I have my doubts,\" said Holroyd. \"Tom,\" he added, after a moment\u0027s hesitation, \"let you and I creep down nearer the river, and have a look at this mysterious craft. We must discover whether she\u0027s a friend or foe.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Very cautiously we made our way down the sand-hills, moving directly towards the mosque for the first hundred yards, then edging away to the left until we had a full view of the river.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This is what we saw. Just below the mosque were some fishermen\u0027s huts, and a small wooden pier, or wharf, projecting into the Nile. Within a couple of oars\u0027 length of the wharf lay, not one, but two large djerms, both filled with armed men. By the bright light of the moon we could discern them as clearly as in daytime.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My companion had with him a small field-glass, through which he carefully examined the djerms—or rather their occupants.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, are they the Mamelukes?\" I whispered impatiently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Egad! they\u0027re not,\" was the reply. \"They are Albanians, without doubt, and therefore enemies. Look for yourself, and you will see their kilts, or petticoats.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I took the glass, and saw at once that Holroyd was right; there was no mistaking the Albanian costume.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There are between two and three hundred of them,\" said Holroyd, as I returned the telescope. \"I must report this at once, Tom.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We hurried back to the piquet, and Corporal Jones was sent off to warn Colonel Macleod of the proximity of a large body of the enemy; while another man took a message to Cantillon to advance nearer to the sand-hills, and be on the qui vive in case of a sudden attack.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not that I think they\u0027ll trouble us yet awhile,\" observed Holroyd; \"so, with the exception of advancing our support, I shall keep to our present position until I receive further orders.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Corporal Jones made good use of his legs, for scarcely half-an-hour elapsed before he returned to the outpost.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Please, your honour,\" said he, saluting his captain, \"the answer is \u0027All right.\u0027\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right!\" exclaimed Holroyd, his face darkening; \"is that all Colonel Macleod said to you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is all, sir,\" was the reply. \"I gave the colonel your message, just as your honour gave it to me, neither more nor less. \u0027Tell Capt\u0027n Holroyd it\u0027s all right,\u0027 says he. I saluted, and waited a moment, thinkin\u0027 as how he\u0027d say something more, or may-be ask me some questions; but the colonel just waves me away, and says, \u0027D\u0027ye hear me, corp\u0027ril?—tell your orficer it\u0027s all right.\u0027 So I comes back as quick as I could, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Holroyd and I stared at one another in astonishment. That Corporal Jones had delivered the report and brought back the reply correctly we did not for a moment doubt; for Jones was a steady, intelligent man, and thoroughly trustworthy, or he would not have been a light company corporal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What shall you do, Charlie?\" I asked in an undertone. \"There must be some mistake.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A very serious mistake, I should say,\" he rejoined. Then turning to the corporal, he inquired if Colonel Macleod was in the village.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir,\" answered Jones; \"the colonel\u0027s over yonder—away to our right rear. There\u0027s a young orficer with a few men of Rolle\u0027s in the village,\" he added.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Holroyd thought for a few minutes, and then taking me aside, said, \"I must let them know in El Hamet the state of affairs, so that they may be prepared in the event of a sudden attack. Do you, Tom, hurry back to the village and warn the senior officer. Tell him that the enemy evidently mean mischief, and that I advise him to look out for squalls. On your way you can inform Cantillon of the situation, and say that he must be ready to support us the moment he hears a shot fired.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I started off on my errand, and warned both Paddy Cantillon and the officer at El Hamet—a young ensign of De Rolle\u0027s, Schmidt by name—that they must be prepared for any emergency. On regaining the piquet, I found that several more djerms had dropped down the Nile, and were lying off the little wharf. Holroyd had therefore sent a written report to Colonel Macleod, calling his attention to the gravity of the situation and requesting instructions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Corporal Jones was again the messenger, and his face was a study when he returned, and reported that the only answer vouchsafed by the colonel was \"Very well.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You told him that I awaited instructions?\" said Holroyd, looking very incensed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I did, sir; but the colonel only said \u0027Very well\u0027; not another word, good, bad, or indifferent, your honour.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Tom, this is too grave a contingency to be trifled with,\" said my captain, taking me aside; \"and as Macleod has sent me no orders, I must act on my own responsibility. I fear that our force is so scattered that it would be a dangerous matter to bring it together again; knowing this, Macleod is probably unwilling to try the experiment, and so has contented himself with sending a report to General Stewart of the enemy\u0027s proximity. But,\" he continued, \"I am not going to run the risk of being cut off in such an exposed position as this, and therefore I shall warn the officer at El Hamet to put the village into as good a state of defence as time will allow, and we will cover him while so employed. We shall then have something like a post to fall back on, if driven in; for we ought to be able to make a very fair fight of it in the village. Give me a leaf out of your note-book, Tom—I suppose that young fellow understands English?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He speaks it fairly well,\" I answered, handing him a pencil and a piece of paper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Holroyd wrote his note and despatched it to the village; then we once more took our station with the advanced outpost, in order to observe the first hostile movement that might be made. Towards morning a thick fog came on, completely hiding the mosque and river from our view; indeed we could not see anything fifty yards before us, and had to trust entirely to our ears.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I need hardly add that not one of us closed his eyes that night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3135/86191.html","bookId":889,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:58:33 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:58:33 AM"}
