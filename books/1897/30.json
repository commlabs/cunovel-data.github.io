His knuckles go white. I grit my teeth and make myself look at him because that\u0027s what he wants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not going to work,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe releases the books. I clutch them to my chest and let him be the one who moves on. He passes me, close. I can smell him and for a second I think I\u0027m in his bedroom again and his hand is trailing my cheek, my neck. In his bedroom where he kisses me and I sort of forget everything that came before it and everything that will have to come after. In his bedroom where I enjoy every single clumsy kiss and it surprises me, how I feel about it. Him. By the time we finish, it\u0027s not that I\u0027m--I mean, I don\u0027t know what I am, so we do it again and later I realize it wasn\u0027t that I was happy, it was that I wasn\u0027t heavy, that there were these brief moments where the thing I make sure I live with wasn\u0027t in every breath in and out. And that scares me because it\u0027s not supposed to be that easy. Because that\u0027s wrong. I\u0027m supposed to be paying for this for the rest of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that\u0027s right. \"I don\u0027t want to see this shrink,\" I announce. \"I won\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinnertime. Dad\u0027s at one end of the table, Mom at the other. My declaration causes Mom to stop sipping her drink and Dad sets his fork down and rests his chin in his hands. Their eyes meet and they have a telepathic conversation about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear every word and I don\u0027t like what they\u0027re saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s going to the shrink, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she\u0027s going to the shrink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re good parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they both look at me like I\u0027m--I don\u0027t like the way they look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad sighs and picks up his fork again. \"You have to see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see Grey. I see Grey once a week. That\u0027s enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She says you\u0027re uncooperative,\" Mom says. \"She says you never talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not seeing a shrink. I\u0027m not. I don\u0027t--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name is Georgina Bellamy,\" Dad interrupts gently. \"She\u0027s an excellent psychiatrist. She specializes in talking to teenagers who need help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need help.\" They don\u0027t say anything. I push my plate away and cross my arms. \"I\u0027m not going. I\u0027m not going to say it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should\u0027ve done it sooner,\" Mom says to Dad, like I\u0027m not even in the room. \"The first time she got in trouble after--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll hate you for it,\" I say over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad turns to me. \"If that\u0027s what it takes to get you back--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please. That\u0027s so pathetic. This is pathetic. Is this because of... is this because of what I--\" Calm down, Parker; calm down. Calm. \"Is this about Bailey? Because I didn\u0027t want him to die; I just said that--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gets really quiet. And then Mom speaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, after we buried Bailey, I came in and I thought--I don\u0027t even know you anymore. I don\u0027t even know my own daughter. You\u0027re not the same, Parker.\" She starts to cry. \"You\u0027re not the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to bed,\" I say, standing. I have had enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Dad stands, too. He stands between me and my only way out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should just give up,\" I tell him, but it comes out sounding like a plea and he looks so worried from behind his glasses I want to break something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he makes his way over to me and wraps me up into this hug and I feel myself go rigid. I let my arms hang at my sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say that,\" he says. \"Don\u0027t even think it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is unbelievable. They still have hope for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have done something wrong if they still have hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my locker and stare at the bottle of Jack resting on the top shelf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels like it\u0027s been there forever, and every time I retrieve my books I\u0027m always a little surprised no one\u0027s noticed the attractive, almost demure square bottle full of pale amber liquid, half-hidden by the black label with boastful white lettering I\u0027ve never read beyond the name. All I need to know is how hard it messes you up, and Jack Daniel\u0027s has a tendency to do that like nothing else. I was a vodka girl before, because it was easier to hide in school and didn\u0027t make me as sick, but Becky obviously wanted to see me fall on my face when she gave me that paper bag in the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd today I am going to make her a very happy girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach for the bottle at the same time a low rumble of sound travels through the hallway the way a ripple crosses a pond before hitting the bank and going back in on itself. I feel this disturbance--this strange interruption of peace--in the pit of my stomach when I think I hear a name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forget about the bottle and follow the undercurrent of sound. The people I pass look at me like they know something, but how can they know anything? It\u0027s too early in the morning to know anything. An invisible thread leads me down the hall and around the corner where a group of people are clustered around a sobbing girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get closer. It\u0027s Becky. She\u0027s the one crying. She\u0027s consoled by Chris, who stands at her right side, and Jake is at her left, looking out of place and awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I walk right past them, but Chris calls me back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backtrack slowly and face them, not just the three of them, but three plus an audience, because I don\u0027t deserve less. I clench my hands into fists, digging my nails in, and wait for one or all of them to speak. Becky stops crying long enough to raise her head from Chris\u0027s shoulder, and get ready for it, Parker, because this is it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe party starts at eight, but I show up early so Chris and I can have sex. We go to his bedroom. He kisses me and I kiss him back and then, I don\u0027t know, I kind of seize up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flops back on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should loosen the fuck up every once in a while; the world wouldn\u0027t stop. No one would die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe come downstairs looking like two people who\u0027ve spent the last thirty minutes having sex. Chris gets to work on the tunes and I wind my way through the house and spot Evan in the kitchen kissing Jenny Morse. I clear my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker,\" Evan says nervously. He runs a hand over his prickly black hair and holds out a bottle of vodka and a shot glass. \"Uh--shot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny flees from the room. I take the bottle and the glass and move to the kitchen counter, pour a shot and knock it back. Then another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvan watches. Hesitates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to tell her, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave him there. When I step into the foyer the music is going proper, really loud. The party has begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifty minutes later too much vodka is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are!\" Chris yells. I turn really slowly and after a second the rest of the room turns with me. \"I\u0027ve been looking for you. Let\u0027s go outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go without me. I\u0027m going to stay... here.\" He grins. \"Come on; the fresh air will make you feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him drag me outside. I look up. The sun gets in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything goes white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God, it\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m flat on my back. Perfectly manicured blades of grass press into my legs, hands and neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sooner you make a mistake and learn to live with it, the better. You\u0027re not responsible for everything. You can\u0027t control the way things end up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evan\u0027s cheating on you with Jenny Morse. They\u0027re fucking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden I\u0027m being jerked upright. My stomach lurches. I try to tell whomever it is to stop and leave me alone, but I can\u0027t move my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker, sit up. You can\u0027t stay on your back because if you get sick--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope she chokes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice, Evan. Would you just leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until you talk to me about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I talk to you about this now, I\u0027ll just say something that you really won\u0027t like--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I wake up, I\u0027m still drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumble through the kitchen, head outside and throw up in some bushes until there\u0027s nothing left in my stomach to throw up. When it\u0027s over, I spot Jessie by the pool, laughing it up with some guy I don\u0027t know. He looks older than us and she\u0027s in full party mode, probably buzzed, and the way she leans into him is wrong because it\u0027s how she leans into a guy when she wants to fuck him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink. I\u0027m on the lawn. I blink again and Jessie is making out with a new mystery guy, different from the last one. I blink again and Evan\u0027s screaming at both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink again and I\u0027m in front of the drinks table set out on the lawn. I go straight for the bowl of punch, fill a cup with shaking hands, drink it, then another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, a voice behind me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone spiked that, like, an hour ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop the cup and moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Jessie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was crying her eyes out. She said she was going to run away.\" Becky looks up at me and smiles. \"Nice going, Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did she go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky points in the direction of the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t feel my feet, but I soldier on. The farther I get from the house, the louder the music sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris\u0027s parties are the best except when they\u0027re not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-five steps into the woods, and my head is barely attached to my neck, but there\u0027s something I have to fix, so I keep moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few more steps. I hear something and I stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can make out two shapes in the darkness, on the ground. On a bed of pine needles. My heart sinks. I inch forward and hold my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie\u0027s fucking him. Except that\u0027s not what it is at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathe in. The air is stagnant from all the people wandering around the property dancing, drinking, smoking. These dirty scents mingle with the damp summer air and fresh-cut grass and there\u0027s Jessie and that guy, this clean-cut frat boy with an ugly mouth and dead eyes, and she\u0027s crying and it\u0027s not sex; it\u0027s a rape. He forces her to her feet and drags her away and I\u0027m alone and then Chris is taking me back inside. And the next night I\u0027m sick and Mrs. Wellington calls and asks us if we\u0027ve seen Jessie, if she\u0027s with us, and I don\u0027t say anything and when she becomes a missing person and the police start asking questions I tell them I don\u0027t know anything and everyone vouches for me because I was drunk and stupid and when I find her bracelet in the woods two weeks later I think it\u0027s there for me because I killed her and I take it and I wear it so I never forget even though I\u0027ll never forget and I never say a word to anyone because if I hadn\u0027t said anything in the first place none of this would have-- \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-30.html","bookId":1897,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM"}
