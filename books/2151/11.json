Afraid I may go into shock if it was missing again. Even though it had happened before, it wasn\u0027t any less scary now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least this time I came prepared in the clothing department. I had strapped on three tops, and two skirts weighed down by a million shells. One top and one skirt safely made it through the transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething seemed different about the time of day, however. The moon was much higher in the sky. That\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarthkids were draped on the pier and clustered on the beach like stars in a midnight sky. Hundreds of kids talking, singing, dancing, running wild. How was I ever supposed to find Spencer in this crowd?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spotted a girl in dark clothes that I thought I recognized from Seaside High. \"Have you seen Spencer?\" I asked, tapping her on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spencer who?\" she answered, turning around. Only it wasn\u0027t a girl in dark clothes, after all. It was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen Spencer?\" I asked a clean-cut man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that his name?\" the man answered, relieved. \"He\u0027s been sitting over there with my wife. Totally whining, looking everywhere for you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eagerly followed the man. But sitting next to his girlfriend wasn\u0027t my Earthlove. It was a dog!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen Spencer? He\u0027s not an animal, he goes to Seaside High,\" I asked a teenaged couple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all animals at Seaside,\" the girl answered, as her athletic boyfriend grabbed her. \"Get off already,\" the girl said playfully to her snuggling mate as they walked on. \"Seaside has its own section,\" she called back, pointing to the hill. \"Most of the kids from school are up there - the snacks are free!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed out into the sea of teenagers, and then to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrightly colored lanterns hung over Seaside\u0027s entrance, between the trees and around the statues, with a spectacular view of the ocean below. Gutsy dancers bopped on the lawn around the flagpole. A makeshift tiki hut housed a snack bar, and speakers hung from the palm trees cranking out top-forty tunes from the master DJ on the pier as we awaited the annual fireworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I feared the only thing exploding was my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChainsaw approached with Robin, who was decked out in a tight red dress and hipster boots. Radical for her, as she normally hid her body beneath dark cloaks from medieval times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, eat this!\" Chain said, tossing me a bag of chips. \"You need some nourishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You\u0027re not attractive when you\u0027re depressed,\" Robin teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you believe the way she looks?\" Chainsaw whispered, sitting next to her. \"Like we had a total babe underneath our noses all along!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah - we did.\" I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be a stellar - \" Chainsaw started. He stared past me, suddenly silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have the fireworks started?\" I asked, not wanting to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have for you!\" he answered. \"Dude, turn around!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too tired for one of your jokes,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChain grabbed my jaw and turned my head toward the tiki hut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lilly - standing only a few feet away. In all her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lilly,\" I exclaimed, overjoyed and confused. \"Lilly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned toward me, and smiled radiantly when she recognized me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spencer!\" she said breathlessly, running toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the necklace out to her, but she shook her head and hugged me hard. I wasn\u0027t about to let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you,\" Lilly said, looking up. Her words rained magic on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where did you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not talk now,\" she said, placing her salty finger on my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some people who touch you and you know they are yours - or if not, they should be. Not as a possession, but as an extension of yourself. Adding, enhancing, liberating the real you with their touch, their aura, their spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had already left me twice. But for some reason she kept coming back. Whoever she really was, at least she was with me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilly grabbed my hand and pulled me underneath the stars and stripes. We held each other close while the DJ played \"Baby, It\u0027s You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- not that I had done much slow dancing in my fifteen years. But this dance was different. Although I didn\u0027t know much about Lilly, I felt I knew everything. It was as if I could feel her soul press through her body into mine as we held each other tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly a rocket shot into the air, and a explosion of red showered down, reaching over the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The city of Seaside and KGMS Radio proudly present Seaside\u0027s tenth annual Festival of Fireworks,\" the DJ\u0027s voice blared through our radios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" I said, grabbing her hand. Our hands fit so nicely together, as if they were made for the sole purpose of binding us. We raced down to the crowded beachfront and found an empty spot on the rocks jutting out from the pier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChainsaw and Robin followed and we all lay back, staring at the confetti-colored night sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch,\" Lilly said suddenly, pulling at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at that!\" she said, pointing up to a burst of golden sprinkling dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stroked her silky hair. The beauty of the fireworks didn\u0027t compare to the beauty beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly she sat up, clenching her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you\u0027re all right?\" I asked, worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just something I ate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to take you home?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am home.\" She smiled, resting her head on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a runaway?\" I asked, concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not running away. I\u0027m running to . . . We\u0027re connected, you and I,\" she said, looking up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My life hasn\u0027t been the same ever since you saved me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither has mine. The rhythm of the sea is different. I feel a peaceful surf when we\u0027re together and a storm inside my heart when we\u0027re apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilly spoke so poetically!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to tell her how much she meant to me, but I felt she already knew. This was good, because suddenly Chainsaw and Robin returned, invading our love space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If this doesn\u0027t settle your stomach, we\u0027ll try something else,\" Chainsaw said, plopping down a two-liter of Coke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened it for her. She drank the whole two-liter in one gulp!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, girl!\" Chainsaw exclaimed. \"You drink like a fish!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lilly!\" a voice shouted. \"Lilly! Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no!\" Lilly exclaimed, as if she were seeing a ghost. \"I can\u0027t believe it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was frustrated and angry. I imagined her going to the spooky Underworld by herself, handing over her savings to Madame Pearl, waking up terrified on the beach, nearly trampled by throngs of Earthees. Finless, friendless, lost without her family or Tide. Crawling and stumbling her way amongst lower life forms in pursuit of a rebellious teenager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at the sky, Wave!\" I exclaimed. \"Fireworks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a friend of yours?\" Spencer asked, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wave, you shouldn\u0027t have come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go!\" she demanded, taking my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaverly crouched in front of me, blocking my gaze with her own. \"Swear on Bubbles\u0027 life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into her furious eyes, but then turned back to the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so! You\u0027re not coming back - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I whispered. \"I\u0027m not coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI surprised myself with my decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lilly, what\u0027s going on?\" Spencer demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean he doesn\u0027t know?\" Waverly realized, shocked, suddenly rising to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where her real home is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped up and covered Waverly\u0027s mouth with my hand, but she pushed me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to know, too,\" Chain interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I felt a sharp pain in my side. \"I need to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to leave me?\" Wave asked, exasperated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed at the electric colors reaching through the sky like the legs of an octopus. \"But I don\u0027t want to go - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you thought about your parents? Bubbles? The ocean?\" she continued, grabbing my free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bubbles?\" Chainsaw wondered. \"Is she cute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waverly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dolphin?\" Chainsaw asked curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaverly grabbed my arm and began dragging me toward the water. \"Think now, act later! You haven\u0027t changed,\" Wave said, out of breath. \"Boy, are these legs awkward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at a confused Spencer, who was standing with his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean I haven\u0027t changed?\" I asked, impressed by her sudden energy and passion. I didn\u0027t resist her desperate grip but hoped to reason with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think now, act later,\" she repeated. \"You haven\u0027t grown up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel something I\u0027ve never felt before, something that was missing in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still a little girl, Waterlilly! Impulsive, irresponsible, immature!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words stung me like a man-of-war. I thought my decision to stay on earth meant that I was growing up. Was it instead a sign that I hadn\u0027t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt another sharp pain and doubled over. Purple particles rose over the pier and flickered throughout the sky. I turned around and found Spencer standing behind me. His eyes looked lost. \"I have to go,\" I said reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you just got here. Here, I\u0027ll take you home.\" He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caressed his hand as my eyes welled with tears. But Waverly\u0027s grasp was stronger and she pulled me away, leading me underneath the pier, away from the crowd toward the end of the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next moment seemed to last a lifetime, and yet there wasn\u0027t even time to say good-bye. I wanted to hold Spencer, to kiss him, to see the fireworks forever reflected in his eyes. I wanted to explain everything, to give him the answers he deserved, to tell him that I loved him. But Waverly\u0027s words echoed in my mind. How long had I known him? Even though my heart answered \"forever,\" my head answered \"only two days.\" I\u0027d breathed water all my life but only air for such a short time. It was like a dream. Hadn\u0027t I always acted immaturely, selfishly, spontaneously? It was irrational to think I could leave my world for his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shooting pain in my side wasn\u0027t as sharp as the pain exploding in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lilly!\" I shouted. \"Lilly! Where are you?\" I cried against the blasting music but it was futile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared out to sea with a sinking feeling. \"Lilly!\" I called again. \"Lilly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Waverly\u0027s head popped above the surface, and then, a moment later, much to my relief, so did Lilly\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant she was treading water below me, next to the jutting rock beneath my feet. She swam so - Lilly. From head to toe, or should I say fin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reality hit me harder than my surfboard had the other day. She was beautiful, yes, even more beautiful in the water, but instead of legs she had the tail of a sparkling green fish. What I thought had been a hallucination the first time I saw her turned out to be fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis couldn\u0027t be. I was in love with a . . . mermaid? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/teenage-mermaid/page-11.html","bookId":2151,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:09 PM"}
