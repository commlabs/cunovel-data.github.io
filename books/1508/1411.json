A living Empyrean could conceal their own aura and also keep their battle spirit hidden within their spiritual sea, dormant until it was activated. For instance, Empyrean Divine Dream could appear like a completely ordinary mortal woman if she so chose.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut for an Empyrean that died, everything would return to nature.

This pagoda was eight stories high. In Buddhism, the most basic function of a Buddhist pagoda was a grave. It was used to bury the remains of the preeminent monks and their relics.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe doors to this pagoda began to open.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming deeply bowed before entering the pagoda.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLooking all around, at the center of this pagoda was a relic. This relic was flat and wide, shaped like an oval. This relic was extremely different from what Lin Ming imagined relics to look like.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe remains of an eminent monk were normally buried in a chamber beneath the pagoda. But, this relic was actually placed in the center of the ground floor hall, revealed to the world without any jade box sealing it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLooking down, there were a stone tablet beneath this relic with some words inscribed upon it. “Benevolent King, born 800 million years after the great calamity. He managed Mount Potala, and possessed an Empyrean cultivation. He became a monk at six years of age. His talent was extraordinary and his memory was wonderful. He studied the 300 Buddhist scriptures, and before 20 years of age, he did not practice martial arts at all, but fully invested himself in comprehending the dharma of Buddhism. The light of awakening came down to him and Benevolent King’s body was reborn through nirvana, and from that point on he condensed a Buddha body. That is the stage of Life Destruction…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming read this description, he was incomparably astonished. The stone tablet recorded that Benevolent King didn’t study any martial arts cultivation method before he was 20 years old, and only meditated on the Buddhist scriptures. Even so, after that, his mortal body was reborn through nirvana, condensing into a Buddha body. That was the same stage as Life Destruction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf this was true, then the path of Buddhism was far too mysterious and miraculous.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFurther down, the stone tablet recorded the various achievements of Benevolent King. In addition, at the very bottom there was a brief string of words, “If I can preach to the infallible, then after I perish within my fires, let my tongue remain forever.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese several words seemed gentle and quiet, like an ordinary sentence, but they actually emitted a deep and powerful momentum. Just by looking at them one felt the impulse to pray in worship and accept a baptism of Buddhism with all their heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sort of feeling was only comparable to what Lin Ming had felt when he read the words that Empyrean Primordius left behind in the Eternal Demon Abyss. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The masterless rivers of star in the endless cosmos, I shall rewrite the infinite history!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“These words should be Benevolent King’s own. And from their meaning, they should also be his last words.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming thought. The meaning behind these words was that if the teachings he passed on were without mistake, then once his mortal body perished and he burned away in the fires, let his tongue not be burnt to nothing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe flames that Mount Potala used to cremate their eminent monks were not normal fire, but divine fire composed of the complete nine level Concepts of the Fire Laws. Normally, once an essence gathering system martial artist died, their origin energy would dissipate, leaving behind a spirit body that simply wasn’t able to withstand the blaze of this divine fire. But, these eminent monks were actually able to leave behind relics through the flames.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming thought of this, his mind stirred. He looked up towards the relic at the center of the pagoda. Looking closer, this flat relic actually resembled a tongue.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“When Benevolent King died, his tongue was actually left remaining and turned into a relic. Really, his words came true…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming looked at this relic, his heart was shaken. It was unknown just what boundary this eminent monk had reached in his life; it should have been a level even higher than Great Limitless Buddha.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming continued to look. He discovered that behind this stone tablet was also a section of scriptures.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese scriptures were not martial arts heart mantras, but pure Buddhist passages. Lin Ming held a heart of reverent awe as he read this passage from beginning to end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn calming the mind, one could also further their understanding of Concepts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming stayed at the Irreproachable Stupa of Benevolent King for three whole days. Then, he left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe moved towards the next Irreproachable Stupa.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis Irreproachable Stupa also had a stone tablet. The words carved upon it were, “Jiu Moye. He was born one billion and 80 million years after the great calamity. He shaved his head, undergoing tonsure at three years of age…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“…He died one billion and 90 million years after the great calamity. After his death, his ashes were divided into 48,000 parts, each integrated into the bricks of this Buddhist pagoda, becoming one with the Irreproachable Stupa. This pagoda is spiritual; without anyone refining it, it became an Empyrean spirit treasure…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming read onwards. Grandmaster Jiu Moye had also left behind his last words. “To respect all life, my heart shines as bright as a mirror. When my body returns to the earth, give my heart to all living creatures.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese last words also gave Lin Ming some enlightenments. When Grandmaster Jiu Moye’s mortal body was burned away, his heart that was as bright and clear as a mirror was left behind for all living creatures. His achievements were no worse than those of Benevolent King’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe stayed in Jiu Moye’s Irreproachable Stupa for another three full days.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe continued to the next Irreproachable Stupa. As time passed, Lin Ming looked at the life history of these eminent Buddhist monks, experiencing their life and accepting a baptism of their will.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDuring this period of time, Lin Ming’s cultivation didn’t rise by much. But, his soul actually went through a subtle transformation, and the grandmist battle spirit within him also became increasingly blue…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………..\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was enlightening himself within the Irreproachable Stupas, there was actually a storm of blood and slaughter occurring on the Bright Luster Great World, with countless deaths and battles.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany heroic young elites flocked towards the Bright Luster Great World to temper themselves on that battlefield of slaughter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere were some people that made breakthroughs at the precipice of life and death, their cultivation rapidly rising.

It had to be known that on the Bright Luster Great World, the highest cultivation martial artists on the battlefield were Holy Lords. In other words, it would be extremely difficult for Imperial Prince Naqi to meet an opponent who could threaten his life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany missions that were aimed specifically at him failed, one after another.

And, this Naqi is also the direct disciple of the saint race’s True Divinity powerhouse, the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign.
