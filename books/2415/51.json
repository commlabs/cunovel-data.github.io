She knows where we’re going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?!” Sinskey’s voice rose in alarm. “I thought you said you didn’t have a chance to tell Sienna what you’d figured out! You said all you told her is that you were in the wrong country!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s true,” Langdon said, “but she knew we were looking for the tomb of Enrico Dandolo. A quick Web search can tell her where that is. And once she finds Dandolo’s tomb … the dissolving canister can’t be far away. The poem said to follow the sounds of trickling water to the sunken palace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it!” Brüder erupted, and stormed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’ll never beat us there,” the provost said. “We have a head start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey sighed heavily. “I wouldn’t be so sure. Our transport is slow, and it appears Sienna Brooks is extremely resourceful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs The Mendacium docked, Langdon found himself staring uneasily at the cumbersome C-130 on the runway. It barely looked airworthy and had no windows. I’ve been on this thing already? Langdon didn’t remember a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether it was because of the movement of the docking boat, or growing reservations about the claustrophobic aircraft, Langdon didn’t know, but he was suddenly hit by an upsurge of nausea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Sinskey. “I’m not sure I feel well enough to fly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re fine,” she said. “You’ve been through the wringer today, and of course, you’ve got the toxins in your body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Toxins?” Langdon took a wavering step backward. “What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey glanced away, clearly having said more than she intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Professor, I’m sorry. Unfortunately, I’ve just learned that your medical condition is a bit more complicated than a simple head wound.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt a spike of fear as he pictured the black flesh on Ferris’s chest when the man collapsed in the basilica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong with me?” Langdon demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinskey hesitated, as if uncertain how to proceed. “Let’s get you onto the plane first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 81\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocated just east of the spectacular Frari church, the Atelier Pietro Longhi has always been one of Venice’s premier providers of historical costumes, wigs, and accessories. Its client list includes film companies and theatrical troupes, as well as influential members of the public who rely on the staff’s expertise to dress them for Carnevale’s most extravagant balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk was just about to lock up for the evening when the door jingled loudly. He glanced up to see an attractive woman with a blond ponytail come bursting in. She was breathless, as if she’d been running for miles. She hurried to the counter, her brown eyes wild and desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to speak to Giorgio Venci,” she had said, panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t we all, the clerk thought. But nobody gets to see the wizard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiorgio Venci—the atelier’s chief designer—worked his magic from behind the curtain, speaking to clients very rarely and never without an appointment. As a man of great wealth and influence, Giorgio was allowed certain eccentricities, including his passion for solitude. He dined privately, flew privately, and constantly complained about the rising number of tourists in Venice. He was not one who liked company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” the clerk said with a practiced smile. “I’m afraid Signor Venci is not here. Perhaps I can help you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Giorgio’s here,” she declared. “His flat is upstairs. I saw his light on. I’m a friend. It’s an emergency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a burning intensity about the woman. A friend? she claims. “Might I tell Giorgio your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman took a scrap of paper off the counter and jotted down a series of letters and numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just give him this,” she said, handing the clerk the paper. “And please hurry. I don’t have much time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk hesitantly carried the paper upstairs and laid it on the long altering table, where Giorgio was hunched intently at his sewing machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Signore,” he whispered. “Someone is here to see you. She says it’s an emergency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout breaking off from his work or looking up, the man reached out with one hand and took the paper, reading the text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sewing machine rattled to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Send her up immediately,” Giorgio commanded as he tore the paper into tiny shreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 82\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive C-130 transport plane was still ascending as it banked southeast, thundering out across the Adriatic. On board, Robert Langdon was feeling simultaneously cramped and adrift—oppressed by the absence of windows in the aircraft and bewildered by all of the unanswered questions swirling around in his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour medical condition, Sinskey had told him, is a bit more complicated than a simple head wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon’s pulse quickened at the thought of what she might tell him, and yet at the moment she was busy discussing containment strategies with the SRS team. Brüder was on the phone nearby, speaking with government agencies about Sienna Brooks, following up on everyone’s attempts to locate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was still trying to make sense of the claim that she was intricately involved in all of this. As the plane leveled out from its ascent, the small man who called himself the provost walked across the cabin and sat down opposite Langdon. He steepled his fingers beneath his chin and pursed his lips. “Dr. Sinskey asked me to fill you in … make an attempt to bring clarity to your situation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon wondered what this man could possibly say to make any of this confusion even remotely clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As I began to say earlier,” the provost said, “much of this started after my agent Vayentha pulled you in prematurely. We had no idea how much progress you had made on Dr. Sinskey’s behalf, or how much you had shared with her. But we were afraid if she learned the location of the project our client had hired us to protect, she was going to confiscate or destroy it. We had to find it before she did, and so we needed you to work on our behalf … rather than on Sinskey’s.” The provost paused, tapping his fingertips together. “Unfortunately, we had already shown our cards … and you most certainly did not trust us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you shot me in the head?” Langdon replied angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We came up with a plan to make you trust us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt lost. “How do you make someone trust you … after you’ve kidnapped and interrogated him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man shifted uncomfortably now. “Professor, are you familiar with the family of chemicals known as benzodiazepines?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are a breed of pharmaceutical that are used for, among other things, the treatment of post-traumatic stress. As you may know, when someone endures a horrific event like a car accident or a sexual assault, the long-term memories can be permanently debilitating. Through the use of benzodiazepines, neuroscientists are now able to treat post-traumatic stress, as it were, before it happens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon listened in silence, unable to imagine where this conversation might be going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When new memories are formed,” the provost continued, “those events are stored in your short-term memory for about forty-eight hours before they migrate to your long-term memory. Using new blends of benzodiazepines, one can easily refresh the short-term memory … essentially deleting its content before those recent memories migrate, so to speak, into long-term memories. A victim of assault, for example, if administered a benzodiazepine within a few hours after the attack, can have those memories expunged forever, and the trauma never becomes part of her psyche. The only downside is that she loses all recollection of several days of her life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stared at the tiny man in disbelief. “You gave me amnesia!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe provost let out an apologetic sigh. “I’m afraid so. Chemically induced. Very safe. But yes, a deletion of your short-term memory.” He paused. “While you were out, you mumbled something about a plague, which we assumed was on account of your viewing the projector images. We never imagined that Zobrist had created a real plague.” He paused. “You also kept mumbling a phrase that sounded to us like ‘Very sorry. Very sorry.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVasari. It must have been all he had figured out about the projector at that point. Cerca trova. “But … I thought my amnesia was caused by my head wound. Somebody shot me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe provost shook his head. “Nobody shot you, Professor. There was no head wound.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?!” Langdon’s fingers groped instinctively for the stitches and the swollen injury on the back of his head. “Then what the hell is this!” He raised his hair to reveal the shaved area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Part of the illusion. We made a small incision in your scalp and then immediately closed it up with stitches. You had to believe you had been attacked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t a bullet wound?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you woke up,” the provost said, “we wanted you to believe that people were trying to kill you … that you were in peril.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People were trying to kill me!” Langdon shouted, his outburst drawing gazes from elsewhere in the plane. “I saw the hospital’s doctor—Dr. Marconi—gunned down in cold blood!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what you saw,” the provost said evenly, “but that’s not what happened. Vayentha worked for me. She had a superb skill set for this kind of work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Killing people?” Langdon demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” the provost said calmly. “Pretending to kill people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stared at the man for a long moment, picturing the gray-bearded doctor with the bushy eyebrows who had collapsed on the floor, blood gushing from his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vayentha’s gun was loaded with blanks,” the provost said. “It triggered a radio-controlled squib that detonated a blood pack on Dr. Marconi’s chest. He is fine, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon closed his eyes, dumbstruck by what he was hearing. “And the … hospital room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A quickly improvised set,” the provost said. “Professor, I know this is all very difficult to absorb. We were working quickly, and you were groggy, so it didn’t need to be perfect. When you woke up, you saw what we wanted you to see—hospital props, a few actors, and a choreographed attack scene.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was reeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is what my company does,” the provost said. “We’re very good at creating illusions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Sienna?” Langdon asked, rubbing his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I needed to make a judgment call, and I chose to work with her. My priority was to protect my client’s project from Dr. Sinskey, and Sienna and I shared that desire. To gain your trust, Sienna saved you from the assassin and helped you escape into a rear alleyway. The waiting taxi was also ours, with another radio-controlled squib on the rear windshield to create the final effect as you fled. The taxi took you to an apartment that we had hastily put together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna’s meager apartment, Langdon thought, now understanding why it looked like it had been furnished from a yard sale. And it also explained the convenient coincidence of Sienna’s “neighbor” having clothing that fit him perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire thing had been staged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the desperate phone call from Sienna’s friend at the hospital had been phony. Sienna, eez Danikova!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you phoned the U.S. Consulate,” the provost said, “you phoned a number that Sienna looked up for you. It was a number that rang on The Mendacium.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never reached the consulate …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay where you are, the fake consulate employee had urged him. I’ll send someone for you right away. Then, when Vayentha showed up, Sienna had conveniently spotted her across the street and connected the dots. Robert, your own government is trying to kill you! You can’t involve any authorities! Your only hope is to figure out what that projector means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe provost and his mysterious organization—whatever the hell it was—had effectively retasked Langdon to stop working for Sinskey and start working for them. Their illusion was complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna played me perfectly, he thought, feeling more sad than angry. He had grown fond of her in the short time they’d been together. Most troubling to Langdon was the distressing question of how a soul as bright and warm as Sienna’s could give itself over entirely to Zobrist’s maniacal solution for overpopulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell you without a doubt, Sienna had said to him earlier, that without some kind of drastic change, the end of our species is coming … The mathematics is indisputable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the articles about Sienna?” Langdon asked, recalling the Shakespeare playbill and the pieces about her staggeringly high IQ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Authentic,” the provost replied. “The best illusions involve as much of the real world as possible. We didn’t have much time to set up, and so Sienna’s computer and real-world personal files were almost all we had to work with. You were never really intended to see any of that unless you began doubting her authenticity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nor use her computer,” Langdon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, that was where we lost control. Sienna never expected Sinskey’s SRS team to find the apartment, so when the soldiers moved in, Sienna panicked and had to improvise. She fled on the moped with you, trying to keep the illusion alive. As the entire mission unraveled, I had no choice but to disavow Vayentha, although she broke protocol and pursued you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She almost killed me,” Langdon said, recounting for the provost the showdown in the attic of the Palazzo Vecchio, when Vayentha raised her handgun and aimed point-blank at Langdon’s chest. This will only hurt for an instant … but it’s my only choice. Sienna had then darted out and pushed her over the railing, where Vayentha plunged to her death. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inferno-robert-langdon-4/page-51.html","bookId":2415,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:25 AM"}
