A large dairy truck was pulled up to a loading dock, and kitchen staff was unloading cartons of milk. We had been waiting here for five minutes. Connor glanced at his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Why are we here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re complying with the Supreme Court, kōhai.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the loading dock, a woman in a business suit came out, looked around, and waved. Connor waved back. She disappeared again. Connor got out his billfold and took out a couple of twenties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the first things I learned as a detective,\" Connor said, \"is that hotel staff can be extremely helpful. Particularly since the police have so many restrictions these days. We can\u0027t go into a hotel room without a warrant. If we did, whatever we found in a search would be inadmissible, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the maids can go in. Valet and housekeeping and room service can go in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve learned to maintain contacts at all the big hotels.\" He opened the door. \"I\u0027ll only be a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the loading dock and waited. I tapped the steering wheel with my hands, The words came into my head:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI changed my mind, this love is fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoodness, gracious, great balls of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the loading dock, a maid in uniform came out, and talked to Connor briefly. He took notes. She held something golden in the palm of her hand. He didn\u0027t touch it, he just looked at it, and nodded. She slipped it back in her pocket. Then he gave her money. She went away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou shake my nerves and you rattle my brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo much love drives a man insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou broke my will, but what a thrill -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA valet came out onto the loading dock, carrying a man\u0027s blue suit on a hanger. Connor asked a question, and the valet looked at his watch before he answered. Then Connor crouched down and peered closely at the lower edges of the suit coat. He opened the jacket and examined the trousers on the hanger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe valet took away the first suit, and brought a second one out onto the dock. This one was a blue pinstripe suit. Connor repeated his inspection. He seemed to find something on the coat, and scraped it carefully into a small glassine bag. Then he paid the valet and walked back to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Checking Senator Rowe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Checking a number of things,\" he said. \"But, yes, Senator Rowe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rowe\u0027s aide had white panties in his pocket last night. But Cheryl was wearing black panties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true,\" Connor said. \"But I think we are making progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027ve you got in the bag?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the little glassine bag out, and held it to the light. I saw small dark strands through the plastic. \"Carpet fibers, I think. Dark, like the carpet at the Nakamoto conference room. Have to check with the lab to be sure. Meanwhile, we have another problem to solve. Start the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darley-Higgins. The company that owns MicroCon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the lobby beside the receptionist, a workman was mounting large gold letters on the wall:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarley-Higgins Inc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath that it read EXCELLENCE IN MANAGEMENT. More workmen were laying carpet in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe showed our badges and asked to see the head of Darley-Higgins, Arthur Greiman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe receptionist had a Southern accent and an upturned nose. \"Mr. Greiman is in meetings all day. Is he expecting you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re here about the MicroCon sale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you want Mr. Enders, our vice-president for publicity. He speaks to people about MicroCon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat down on a couch in the reception area. On a couch across the room sat a pretty woman in a tight skirt. She had a roll of blueprints under her arm. The workmen continued to hammer. I said, \"I thought the company was in financial trouble. Why\u0027re they redecorating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor shrugged,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secretary answered the phone, routing the calls. \"Darley-Higgins, one moment, please. Darley-Higgins... Oh, please hold, Senator... Darley-Higgins, yes, thank you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up a brochure from the coffee table. It was the annual report of Darley-Higgins Management Group, with offices in Atlanta, Dallas, Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. I found a picture of Arthur Greiman. He looked happy and self-satisfied. The report included an essay signed by him entitled, \"A Commitment to Excellence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secretary said to us, \"Mr. Enders will be right with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, two men in business suits walked out into the hallway. The woman with the blueprints stood. She said, \"Hello, Mr. Greiman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Beverly,\" the older man said. \"I\u0027ll be with you in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor stood up, too. The secretary immediately said, \"Mr. Greiman, these men - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute,\" Greiman said. He turned to the man with him, who was younger, in his early thirties. \"Just make sure you get it straight with Roger,\" Greiman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger man was shaking his head. \"He won\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know he won\u0027t. But tell him anyway. Six million four in direct compensation for the CEO is the minimum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Arthur - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, Arthur,\" the younger man said, smoothing his tie. He lowered his voice. \"But the board may balk at raising you above six when company earnings are down so much - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not talking about earnings,\" Greiman said. \"We\u0027re talking about compensation. It has nothing to do with earnings. The board has to match current compensation levels for chief executives. If Roger can\u0027t bring the board into line on this, I\u0027m going to cancel the March meeting and ask for changes. You tell him that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I will, Arthur, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do it. Call me tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, Arthur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shook hands. The younger man walked off unhappily. The receptionist said, \"Mr. Greiman, these gentlemen - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreiman turned to us. Connor said, \"Mr. Greiman, we\u0027d like to speak to you for a minute about MicroCon.\" And he turned slightly aside, and showed his badge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreiman exploded in rage. \"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake. Not again. This is goddamned harassment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harassment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you call it? I\u0027ve had senatorial staffers here, I\u0027ve had the F.B.I. here. Now I have the L.A. police? We\u0027re not criminals. We own a company and we have the right to sell it. Where is Louis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe receptionist said, \"Mr. Enders is coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said calmly, \"Mr. Greiman, I\u0027m sorry to disturb you. We have only one question. It\u0027ll just take a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreiman glowered. \"What\u0027s your question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many bidders were there for MicroCon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s none of your business,\" he said. \"Anyway, our agreement with Akai stipulates that we can\u0027t discuss the sale publicly in any way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"Was there more than one bidder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, you have questions, you talk to Enders. I\u0027m busy.\" He turned to the woman with blueprints. \"Beverly? What have you got for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a revised layout for the boardroom, Mr. Greiman, and tile samples for the washroom. A very nice gray I think you\u0027ll like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, good.\" He led her down the hallway away from us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor watched them go, and then abruptly turned toward the elevator. \"Come on, kōhai. Let\u0027s get some fresh air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does it matter if there were other bidders?\" I said, when we were back in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It goes back to the original question we had,\" Connor said. \"Who wants to embarrass Nakamoto? We know the sale of MicroCon has strategic significance. That\u0027s why Congress is upset. But that almost certainly means other parties are upset, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Japan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who will know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Akai.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Japanese receptionist tittered when she saw Connor\u0027s badge. Connor said, \"We would like to see Mr. Yoshida.\" Yoshida was the head of the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment, please.\" She got up and hurried away, almost running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAkai Ceramics was located on the fifth floor of a bland office-block in El Segundo. The decor was spare and industrial-looking. From the reception area, we could see into a large space, which was not partitioned: lots of metal desks and people at the phones. The soft click of word processors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the office. \"Pretty bare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All business,\" Connor said, nodding. \"In Japan, ostentation is frowned on. It means you are not serious. When old Mr. Matsushita was the head of the third biggest company in Japan, he still took the regular commercial jet between his head offices in Osaka and Tokyo. He was the head of a fifty-billion-dollar company. But no private jets for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we waited, I looked at the people working at the desks. A handful were Japanese. Most were Caucasian. Everyone wore blue suits. There were almost no women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Japan,\" Connor said, \"if a company is doing poorly, the first thing that happens is the executives cut their own salaries. They feel responsible for the success of the company, and they expect their own fortunes to rise and fall as the company succeeds or fails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman came back, and sat at her desk without speaking. Almost immediately, a Japanese man wearing a blue suit came toward us. He had gray hair, horn-rimmed glasses, and a solemn manner. He said, \"Good morning. I am Mr. Yoshida.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor made the introductions. We all bowed and exchanged business cards. Mr. Yoshida took each card with both hands, bowing each time, formally. We did the same. I noticed that Connor did not speak Japanese to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoshida led us to his office. It had windows looking toward the airport. The furnishings were austere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like coffee, or tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you,\" Connor said. \"We are here in an official capacity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" He gestured for us to sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would like to talk to you about the purchase of MicroCon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes. A troubling matter. But I am not aware that it should involve the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps it doesn\u0027t,\" Connor said. \"Can you tell us about the sale, or is the agreement sealed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Yoshida looked surprised. \"Sealed? Not at all. It is all very open, and has been from the beginning. We were approached by Mr. Kobayashi, representing Darley-Higgins in Tokyo, in September of last year. That was the first we learned the company was for sale. Frankly, we were surprised that it would be offered. We began negotiations in early October. The negotiating teams had the basis of a rough agreement by mid-November. We proceeded to the final stage of negotiations. But then the Congress raised objections, on November sixteenth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"You said you were surprised that the company would be offered for sale?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Yoshida spread his hands on his desk and spoke slowly. \"We understood that MicroCon was a government-owned company. It had been financed in part by funds from the American government. Thirteen percent of capitalization, if I remember. In Japan, that would make it a government-owned company. So naturally we were cautious to enter into negotiations. We do not want to offend. But we received assurance from our representatives in Washington there would be no objection to the purchase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now there are difficulties, as we feared. I think now we make a cause for Americans. In Washington, some people are upset. We do not wish this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t expect Washington would make objections?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Yoshida gave a diffident shrug. \"The two countries are different. In Japan we know what to expect. Here, there is always an individual who may have another opinion, and speak it. But Akai Ceramics does not wish a high profile. It is awkward now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor nodded sympathetically. \"It sounds as if you want to withdraw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many in the home office criticize me, for not knowing what would happen. But I tell them, it is impossible to know. Washington has no firm policy. It changes every day, according to the politics.\" He smiled and added. \"Or, I would say, that is how it seems to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you expect the sale to go forward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This I cannot say. Perhaps the criticism from Washington will be too much. And you know the Tokyo government wants to be friends with America. They give pressure on business, not to make purchases that will upset America. Rockefeller Center and Universal Studios, these purchases that make criticism for us. We are told to be yōjinbukai. It means...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Discreet,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful. Yes. Wary.\" He looked at Connor. \"You speak Japanese?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoshida nodded. For a moment he seemed to consider switching to Japanese, but did not. \"We wish to have friendly relations,\" he said. \"These criticisms of us, we feel they are not fair. The Darley-Higgins company has many financial difficulties. Perhaps bad management, perhaps some other reason. I cannot say. But that is not our fault. We are not responsible for that. And we did not seek MicroCon. It was offered to us. Now we are criticized for trying to help.\" He sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, a big jet took off from the airport. The windows rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"And the other bidders for MicroCon? When did they drop out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Yoshida frowned. \"There were no other bidders. The company was privately offered. Darley-Higgins did not wish to make known their financial difficulties. So we cooperated with them. But now... the press makes many distortions about us. We feel very... kizu tsuita. Wounded?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"That is how we feel. I hope you understand my poor English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. In fact, for the next minute or so, nobody said anything. Connor sat facing Yoshida. I sat beside Connor. Another jet took off, and the windows vibrated again. Still nobody spoke. Yoshida gave a long sigh. Connor nodded. Yoshida shifted in his chair, and folded his hands over his belly. Connor sighed, and grunted. Yoshida sighed. Both men seemed to be entirely focused. Something was taking place, but I was not clear what. I decided it must be this unspoken intuition. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-28.html","bookId":2407,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM"}
