Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio shook his head. “You\u0027re so damn bullheaded.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, so? It\u0027s a family trait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sharp, nervous laugh, Sergio nodded. “True. True.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive to her grandmother\u0027s home was not too long. The old family homestead was nestled close to DeLeon. The house was at least one hundred years old. Grandmama\u0027s family had come from a small town on the border and moved North when she was a little girl. Amaliya\u0027s grandfather was from Abilene and he had fallen for her grandmother at first sight, or so the story went. Her mother\u0027s family had been suspicious of the German immigrant at first, but finally let them marry in what Grandmama called a “big Mexican Catholic wedding.” Together they had Mae, Susan and Marlena, Amaliya\u0027s mother. Susan was Sergio\u0027s mother and she had died young, too. Only Mae seemed to have their grandmother\u0027s longevity built into her DNA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, Amaliya wondered how long she would have lived if not for being killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was immaculate and most of the windows were lit up. The light pouring out of the windows illuminated the well-tended yard full of statues and beautiful flowerbeds. Behind the house was a garden full of vegetables and some fruit trees. Her grandmother\u0027s huge statue of the Virgin Mary standing near the fence made Amaliya\u0027s eyes burn and she turned away sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had not considered how very Catholic her grandmother was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, we just tell Grandmama that you were upset by what happened at the campus and that you are heading out on the road to recover, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. But I\u0027m sure the cops will make it out here eventually or at least call to question her, don\u0027t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No clue. They haven\u0027t talked to me. Evidently, they just talked to your Dad and our cousin-whore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He likes to forget that Mom\u0027s side of the family exists, except for Mae and Kelly Ann.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s cause he\u0027s an ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio drove the truck up the driveway. He parked it under the carport that had been added to the old house twenty years before. Their grandmother\u0027s Lincoln was tucked away in the garage that was built off to the side. She rarely drove it anymore. Their tiny little grandmother could barely see over the steering wheel, let alone maneuver a car as big as a boat. She still kept it gassed up, the registration current, got it inspected yearly, and did all the regular maintenance on it right on time. Which was ironic, considering she never drove it except to back it out of the driveway, then pull right back in. To keep the engine fresh, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blue light in the front window showed that she was still up and watching her late night shows. Probably with a bowl of popcorn sprinkled with chili with a dash of lime spritzed on top, and an ice tea, decaf of course, at her side on an end table loaded down with photos, mementos and little knickknacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding out of the truck, Amaliya looked at Sergio as he got her bag out of the back. She wanted to tell him the whole truth, but even she was having trouble believing it. Ignoring the Virgin statue with all her might, she prepared herself for what lay inside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio unlocked the front door and pushed it open. “Grandmama, Amaliya is here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can hear you. I\u0027m not deaf,” came her grandmother\u0027s accented voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya suddenly wanted to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping onto the front porch, she steeled herself. She moved forward and found she couldn\u0027t enter the house. Startled, she tried to step over the threshold, but could not push her way in. It was as if an invisible wall was in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” Sergio said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come in, come in,” her grandmother said, waving to her from her lounge chair in the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unseen wall was gone abruptly and Amaliya stepped into the house, feeling a little shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStruggling to get out of her chair, Grandmama slapped away Sergio\u0027s attempt to help her up. “Come here and hug me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya deftly avoided the shrine to the Holy Trinity and the Virgin Mary in the front hall and rushed to her grandmother. Her skin was pricking and she felt nauseous for the split second she was within a few feet of the holy relics. Reaching her grandmother, she flung her arms around the tiny little woman with the black hair shot through with silver and the keen hazel eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSqueezing her tight, her grandmother gave her several hard kisses on the cheek, then drew back to look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re too thin,” she decided. “And I don\u0027t like your hair black. I liked it blond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergio began to laugh and set the bag down on a chair. “Nice welcome, Grandmama.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up, you,” the old woman said with a twinkle in her eye, then drew Amaliya down to kiss her cheek again. “Are you sick? You\u0027re very cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had food poisoning,” Amaliya lied quickly as she remember what Sergio said about her grandmother preparing food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh. It\u0027s that horrible fast food.” Grandmama headed toward the brightly lit kitchen. She was clad in jeans and a t-shirt with the Texas flag on it. “I made good food. Good healthy food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tamales aren\u0027t healthy, Grandmama,” Sergio corrected her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who told you to lip off,” came the sharp reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya and Sergio looked at each other and giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the old woman into the very clean and tidy kitchen, Amaliya sighed at the delicious smells in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got spicy chicken tacos, pork tamales, the rice is ready and the beans almost are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya grinned as she watched her grandmother at the stove, stirring the big pot of beans, and trying to reach to the back to pick up the skillet full of Mexican rice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll get that,” Sergio offered quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, nieto,” she answered, surprising her grandchildren. She usually denied help. She pointed to the counter. “Right there.” Throwing down a pan holder for Sergio to set the hot skillet on, she turned and uncovered a bowl with fresh tortilla dough in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ll eat this and feel much better,” her Grandmama assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya sighed and wished desperately that she could eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith utter sadness shot through with a strange joy, she watched her grandmother\u0027s tiny hand roll, pound, and flatten out a fresh tortilla before throwing it onto the griddle to cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA weird sort of silence filled the room as Amaliya and Sergio watched the old lady deftly make tortillas. Her wrinkled fingers easily plucked the tortillas up off the griddle and flipped them until they were perfectly done. Soon a whole stack of the fluffy white tortillas was wrapped in a fresh kitchen towel and put on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the way it had always been when she visited her grandmother. She would sit in silence as her grandmother putzed around cooking a feast for her, then as soon as the elder woman sat down, the conversation would start as they ate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShowing how well trained he was, Sergio pulled out a couple of glass bottles of soda from the refrigerator and popped them open. Her grandmother had a fetish for the Coca Cola from across the border and Sergio or Felipe would bring her milk cartons full of the refillable glass bottles. They also brought other exotic flavors that Amaliya was never particularly fond of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They still make it with real sugar. Not corn syrup like here,” Sergio said, handing Amaliya a bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn\u0027t know that.” She took a small swig and nodded to him. “Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large photo of their German emigree grandfather and his tiny Mexican bride loomed over the table and it made Amaliya feel watched over. She felt relatively safe and comfortable at last except for one thing. It was hard to feel better when her skin was crawling because of the religious artifacts strewn around the house. It made her feel like there were ants under her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding into the chair across from her, Sergio nursed his own soda. Their grandmother finished warming up all the food and began to carry it to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, now you eat and feel better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge plate filled with food was set down before Amaliya. The smell was amazing, but she didn\u0027t feel hunger. She wasn\u0027t even sure if she could eat it. She picked up a fork and poked gingerly at the steaming pile of ranchero beans. Across from her, Sergio ate with relish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully sitting down, favoring her arthritic hip, her grandmother gave her a thoughtful look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya hesitated and raised the fork, one bean stuck firmly to the tines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandmama, this is good,” Sergio said, scooping up a bunch of rice and beans and part of a piece of chicken with a bit of tortilla. He shoved the whole thing into his mouth with relish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grandmother\u0027s eyes were quite intent as they gazed at her granddaughter. “Amaliya, eat. You look pale and your skin feels cold. You need nourishment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHesitantly, Amaliya pushed the fork into her mouth, and the bean settled onto her tongue. Very slowly, she shifted it between her teeth and chewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grandmother smiled with satisfaction. “You need to eat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya nodded and swallowed. At least she tried to. The bean refused to go down. The more she tried to swallow, the more she gagged. Finally, she gulped as hard as she could and immediately began to cough. The chewed bean hurtled out of her throat and hit the wall. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-18.html","bookId":2616,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM"}
