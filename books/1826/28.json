He’s an ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about your sister? Do you get along with Eileen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik looked a little put off by the question at first. He paused for a moment and then said, “She and I went our separate ways years ago. She was pretty awful to our mother.” He shook his head. “I’ll never forgive her for that . . . even though my father has,” he added as an afterthought. Straightening in the chair, he sounded authoritative. “Tell me what this is all about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do I start?” she asked Finn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about your first day on the job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, okay,” she said, and began to describe her nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik blanched several times and muttered profanities; however, he didn’t seem to have trouble believing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Peyton finished telling about her encounters with Drew, she was trembling. She stood up and reached for her bottle of water. Opening it, she took a sip and would have gone back to her chair if Finn hadn’t grabbed her hand and forced her to sit beside him. He seemed to know she needed to borrow some of his strength right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parsons followed her when she left Dalton,” Finn said and told Erik about the bullet holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik opened his mouth to argue and stopped when he realized their claim was plausible. “I wouldn’t put anything past Parsons. He’s a bully and a parasite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twice now someone’s taken shots at Peyton. Twice,” Finn repeated angrily. “And I’ve got four strong suspects.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour? Peyton thought. Where did he come up with that number? She turned to ask him, but he put his hand on hers and gently squeezed, and she knew that meant “Ask me later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you listen to the recording now,” Finn suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since you have headphones, I won’t have to put it on speaker and listen to it again,” Peyton told him, silently adding, Thank God. Hearing Drew’s voice made her nerves screech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled up the recording on her cell phone and handed it to him. Erik plugged the cord in, adjusted his headphones over his ears, and pressed play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color slowly drained from Erik’s face. A few minutes later, his cheeks flushed, and Peyton surmised that he was hearing the terrible things Drew had said about his mother. By the time the recording ended, Erik looked as though he’d aged ten years. His brow wrinkled into deep furrows and his lips disappeared into a razor-thin line. He gave the phone back to Peyton and removed his headphones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has my father heard this?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your sister guards him like a rottweiler. No one can get near him. He’s been shut off from hearing anything negative.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik rubbed his forehead. “The trip to Europe to visit all the places my mother loved . . . that was all a sham, wasn’t it? To get back in Dad’s good graces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton didn’t say anything, and for the next ten minutes, Erik railed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to do about all this?” Finn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer was immediate. “Kick him out. Eileen, too. My father’s wanted me to take a more active role in the company, and now that I’m almost finished with grad school, I can do that,” he said with resolve. “I’ll talk to him. We drive to the cemetery together whenever I come home. It helps him, I think.” His voice was tinged with sadness when he added, “He misses her, and so do I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped his finger on Peyton’s phone and said, “Will you send that recording to me?” He gave her his number, and seconds later the recording was delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll make Dad listen to this while we’re at the cemetery. That’s about the only time we’re alone. Eileen never wants to go with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drew thinks he’s going to be named CEO by your father at the memorial for your mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik shook his head. “No, that’s changed. Dad called me yesterday and told me he’s making the announcement on Friday. He said Drew talked him into moving it up. He didn’t want company business to take away from the tribute to my mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s less than a week away,” she said. “How are you going to kick him out once he’s put in charge? You better figure out a way to do it before then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His appointment is temporary,” he explained. “Dad wants me to get in a couple of years learning how all the departments are run before I take over. He doesn’t want a son-in-law to reign over the family business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drew will never give it up to you,” she said. “Why wasn’t Eileen offered the job?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t want it,” he answered. “She wanted Drew to run the company. She’d be a disaster anyway. The way she treats everyone . . . At times she’s insufferable,” he said, and then with a weary sigh, he added, “But she loves her husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a twisted love,” she snapped. “You just heard the recording, for God’s sake. You know Drew is a sexual deviant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard the rumors,” he said. “I just didn’t . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Find out if they were true? Are you really that dense?” Peyton asked. She didn’t want to sound so unsympathetic, but she was determined to make him understand the consequences of leaving Drew at the helm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not dense,” Finn corrected. “You just didn’t want to know, did you, Erik?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t make excuses. “No, I guess I didn’t. I knew he was a womanizer, and I knew Eileen didn’t care how many other women he had.” Without missing a beat, he asked Peyton, “Are you going to sue? You’ve got a hell of a case if you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d been sitting on the edge of the sofa. She fell back against Finn and said, “That depends on you and your father. Get Drew out of the company and put the reason why he was fired in his file. I want his past to follow him. And one more thing, Erik . . . I’m putting you on notice. You’ve been told; you have the recording; and if you don’t do anything about Drew, eventually one of his victims will report him for assault, and I’ll make sure everyone knows you were aware of his perversion. You let him go unchecked, he’ll destroy your company. You better do the right thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve given me a lot to think about,” he said as he stood and reached for his backpack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until then, Finn had appeared to be very laid-back, but in a heartbeat that changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit down. We aren’t finished here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was like acid to Erik. He visibly flinched before quickly dropping into the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn leaned forward with his arms braced on his knees and stared at Erik. He wanted to make him squirm, and he accomplished his goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How often do Drew and his friends go hunting?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question surprised Erik. “I don’t know. They used to go a couple of times a year, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton wondered what Finn was up to. Drew said he didn’t go hunting; he went fishing. Wasn’t that what he had told them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do they keep their rifles?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you want to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do they keep their rifles?” he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They always borrowed my dad’s guns. When Dad was younger he liked to go hunting. He took me once. I hated the cold and never went again. He has a pretty big collection of rifles. Some of them are really valuable. That’s why he always insisted Drew bring them back the minute he returned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik looked stunned, suddenly realizing where Finn was leading. “Do you think Drew used . . .” The magnitude of the situation was finally sinking in. He turned to Peyton. “He was going to kill you,” he whispered. “He was willing to go that far for a what? A stupid job?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The money and the power,” Finn said. “I want those weapons. Are you going to help me get them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded. “Tell me what to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou scared the bejesus out of him,” Peyton told Finn. “Poor Erik was shaking when he left us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. He needs to be scared. If he messes up, if he says anything to anyone before his father can act, what do you think will happen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinn was pulling Peyton along to the gate for their flight back to Florida.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll try to stop him from making trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a pleasant way of saying he’ll kill him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t know—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, come on. You made a recording, and he sent someone to kill you. Of course he’ll silence Erik. Probably make it look like an accident. Do you have any idea how much money is at stake here? Hell yes, he’ll kill him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sound so blasé about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed a smile. “How do you want me to sound?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Maybe concerned.” At the very least, she thought. His attitude was a little too cynical for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly stopped and put his hands on her shoulders. Looking deeply into her eyes, he became very serious. “You’re my priority. Agents Hutton and Lane will be back in Dalton before Erik gets home. He’ll be their priority. Don’t worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back in Dalton? They’ve been there before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, they interviewed Parsons and several others.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did they do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After I saw the bullet holes near your gas tank, I called them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boarding announcement for their flight interrupted their talk. She was weary now; the anxiety and stress of meeting with Erik and worry about his reaction had exhausted her. She just wanted to close her eyes and try to decompress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFat chance of that happening. She kept telling herself that she had done what she could, and now it was up to Randolph and his son. If Erik did what he promised, she could finally move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn’t be moving forward with Finn, though. He had made it perfectly clear he had never wanted nor intended to reconnect with her, and she was pretty sure his feelings hadn’t changed. It wasn’t until they were in the car and on their way across the bridge to Bishop’s Cove that she got up the nerve to broach the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When this is over, if I want to see you again, do I have to buy a gun and shoot my car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over at her and, frowning, said, “You know if you’re ever in trouble, I’ll come help you. All you have to do is call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no, that was never going to happen, she vowed. She wasn’t ever going to call him again, no matter what the reason. If he didn’t want her in his life, she wouldn’t try to change his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of them said another word until they were parked in front of her condominium. Just as she reached for the door handle, he put his hand on her arm to stop her and said, “I really screwed up with you. I never should have touched you. This can’t go anywhere, and I know that . . . and you were a virgin, which I just didn’t figure. I should have left you alone . . . If I were to continue this, before you know it, you’d get your heart broken. I don’t want to hurt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How would I get my heart broken?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was desperately trying to hold on to her temper. Had Finn not looked and sounded so tormented, she would have let him have it. She would have shouted, “Now you say something? After how many times you made love to me? Now you decide it shouldn’t have happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Answer my question,” she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You might fall in love with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at that moment that she realized just how clueless Finn MacBain was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, now I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that sounded arrogant. It’s just that—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand,” she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got out of the car before he could come around and open the door for her. She didn’t run inside but waited and walked with him so that he wouldn’t know how upset she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and I want different things. I’m eight years older than you, and I don’t ever want to get married. That’s not going to change,” he stressed. “But you’re young, and you probably want it all. A husband and kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, she asked, “How do you know what I want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a loving heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that code for naive? she wondered. “And you don’t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not pessimistic like I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed him the key and let him unlock the door. “You’re saying that I still believe in love and happily-ever-after, and you’ve figured out that it’s all nonsense. See? I get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t argue with her. It was after midnight, and she was exhausted. “I’m going to take a shower and go to bed. Good night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later she was standing under the shower letting the hot water ease some of the knots in her muscles. She wondered how long it was going to take for her to get rid of her anger and frustration and feel the hurt of his rejection. She wasn’t a child; she knew what she was doing when she went to bed with him, and she wasn’t sorry it had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished he didn’t have regrets. It is what it is. That was what her father always said to her when he couldn’t come up with a logical explanation as to why something bad had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind wouldn’t calm. After she turned off the lights and got into bed, she replayed their conversation. He told her he never should have touched her. Just what every girl wants to hear. And marriage wasn’t for him. She laid that decision at Danielle’s feet. He had wanted to marry her until she cheated on him. He must have been devastated by her betrayal. It was all about trust, Peyton concluded. Finn had obviously decided that the only way to protect his heart was not to trust any woman. Did he still love Danielle? The possibility made her feel sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe week ahead was going to be difficult, and she didn’t have time to feel sorry for herself. A single tear slipped down her cheek. It was all she would allow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver breakfast Sunday morning Finn told Peyton he would be leaving early Monday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ronan and I have to be in Seattle for a meeting before we go back to D.C., but you’ll be all right. Christopher has hired two men from one of the best security firms in the country. I’ve checked them out, and they’re excellent at what they do. They’ll keep you safe.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hotshot-buchanan-renard-11/page-28.html","bookId":1826,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:40 PM"}
