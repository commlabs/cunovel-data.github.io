He shoveled the faux eggs into his mouth, trying not to grin. Sitting at his left around the galley table, Amos ate with lip-smacking enthusiasm. To Holden\u0027s right, Alex pushed the limp eggs around on his plate with a piece of equally fake toast. Across the table, Naomi sipped a cup of tea and looked at him from under her hair. He stifled the urge to wink at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d talked about how to break the news to the crew but hadn\u0027t come to any consensus. Holden hated to hide anything. Keeping it secret made it seem dirty or shameful. His parents had raised him to believe that sex was something you did in private not because it was embarrassing, but because it was intimate. With five fathers and three mothers, the sleeping arrangements were always complex at his house, but the discussions about who was bedding with whom were never hidden from him. It left him with a strong aversion to hiding his own activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi, on the other hand, thought they shouldn\u0027t do anything to upset the fragile equilibrium they\u0027d found, and Holden trusted her instincts. She had an insight into group dynamics that he often lacked. So, for now, he was following her lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, it would have felt like boasting, and that would have been rude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping his voice neutral and professional, he said, \"Naomi, can you pass the pepper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmos\u0027 head snapped up, and he dropped his fork on the table with a loud clatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit, you guys are doing it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um,\" Holden said. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something\u0027s been screwy ever since we got back on the Roci, but I couldn\u0027t figure. But that\u0027s it! You guys are finally playing hide the weasel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden blinked twice at the big mechanic, unsure of what to say. He glanced at Naomi for support, but her head was down, and her hair completely covered her face. Her shoulders were shaking in silent laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Cap,\" Amos said, a grin on his wide face. \"It fucking took you long enough. If she\u0027d been throwing herself at me like that, I\u0027d have been neck deep in that shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh,\" Alex said, looking shocked enough that it was clear he hadn\u0027t shared Amos\u0027 insights. \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi stopped laughing and wiped tears away from the corners of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Busted,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look. Guys, it\u0027s important that you know this doesn\u0027t affect our - \" Holden said, but Amos cut him off with a snort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Alex,\" Amos said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo,\" Alex replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"XO boning the captain going to make you a really shitty pilot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t believe it will,\" Alex said with a grin, exaggerating his drawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, oddly enough, I don\u0027t feel the need to be a lousy mechanic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden tried again. \"I think it\u0027s important that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cap\u0027n?\" Amos continued, ignoring him. \"Consider that no one gives a fuck, it won\u0027t stop us from doing our jobs, and just enjoy it, since we\u0027ll probably all be dead in a few days anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi started laughing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" she said. \"I mean, everyone knows I\u0027m only doing it to get a promotion. Oh, wait, right. Already the second-in-command. Hey, can I be captain now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Holden said, laughing. \"It\u0027s a shit job. I\u0027d never ask you to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi grinned and shrugged. See? I\u0027m not always right. Holden glanced at Alex, who was looking at him with genuine affection, clearly happy about the idea of him and Naomi together. Everything seemed right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEros spun like a potato-shaped top, its thick skin of rock hiding the horrors inside. Alex brought them in close to do a thorough scan of the station. The asteroid swelled on Holden\u0027s screen until it looked close enough to touch. At the other ops station, Naomi swept the surface with ladar, looking for anything that might pose a danger to the Tycho freighter crews, still a few days behind. On Holden\u0027s tactical display, the UNN science ship continued to flare in a braking maneuver toward Eros, its escort right beside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still not talking, huh?\" Holden asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi shook her head, then tapped on her screen and sent the comm\u0027s monitoring information to his workstation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope,\" she said. \"But they see us. They\u0027ve been bouncing radar off of us for a couple hours now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden tapped his fingers on the arm of his chair and thought about the choices. It was possible that the hull modifications Tycho had made to the Roci were fooling the Earth corvette\u0027s recognition software. They might just ignore the Roci, thinking she was a Belter gas runner that happened to be hanging around. But the Roci was running without a transponder, which made her illegal no matter what hull configuration she was showing. That the corvette wasn\u0027t trying to warn off a ship that was running dark made him nervous. The Belt and the inner planets were in a shooting war. A Belter ship with no identification was hanging around Eros while two Earth ships flew toward it. No way any captain with half a brain would just ignore them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corvette\u0027s silence meant something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naomi, I have a feeling that corvette is going to try and blow us up,\" Holden said with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what I\u0027d do,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden tapped one last complicated rhythm on his chair, then put his headset on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, I guess I make the first overture, then,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot wishing to make their conversation public, Holden targeted the Earther corvette with the Rocinante\u0027s laser array and signaled a generic linkup request. After a few seconds, the link established light went green, and his earplugs began to hiss with faint background static. Holden waited, but the UN ship offered no greeting. They wanted him to speak first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flicked off his mic, switching to the shipwide comm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, get us moving. One g for now. If I can\u0027t bluff this guy, it\u0027ll be a shooting match. Be ready to open her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger,\" drawled Alex. \"Goin\u0027 on the juice, just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden glanced over at Naomi\u0027s station, but she\u0027d already switched to her tactical screen and had the Roci plotting firing solutions and jamming tactics on the two approaching ships. Naomi had been in only one battle, but she was reacting now like a seasoned veteran. He smiled at her back, then turned around before she had time to realize he was staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amos?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Locked down and shipshape down here, Cap. The Roci\u0027s pawing at the turf. Let\u0027s go kick some ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s hope we don\u0027t have to, Holden thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his mic back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Captain James Holden of the Rocinante, calling the captain of the approaching United Nations Navy corvette, call sign unknown. Please respond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a static-filled pause, followed by \"Rocinante. Leave our flight path immediately. If you do not begin moving away from Eros at best possible speed, you will be fired upon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was young. An aging corvette with the tedious task of following an asteroid-mapping ship around wouldn\u0027t be a much sought after command. The captain was probably a lieutenant without patrons or prospects. He\u0027d be inexperienced, but he might see a confrontation as an opportunity to prove himself to his superiors. And that made the next few moments treacherous to navigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" said Holden. \"Still don\u0027t know your call sign, or your name. But I can\u0027t do what you want. In fact, I can\u0027t let anyone land on Eros. I\u0027m going to need you to stop approaching the station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rocinante, I don\u0027t think you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden took control of the Roci\u0027s targeting system and began painting the approaching corvette with its targeting laser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me explain what\u0027s happening here,\" he said. \"Right now, you\u0027re looking at your sensors, and you\u0027re seeing what looks like a thrown-together gas freighter that\u0027s giving your ship-recognition software fits. And all of a sudden, meaning right now, it\u0027s painting you with a state-of-the-art target-acquisition system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t lie. I know that\u0027s what\u0027s happening. So here\u0027s the deal. Despite how it looks, my ship is newer, faster, tougher, and better armed than yours. The only way for me to really prove that is to open fire, and I\u0027m hoping not to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you threatening me, Rocinante?\" the young voice on Holden\u0027s headset said, its tone hitting just the right notes of arrogance and disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You? No,\" said Holden. \"I\u0027m threatening the big, fat, slow-moving, and unarmed ship you\u0027re supposed to be protecting. You keep flying toward Eros, and I will unload everything I\u0027ve got at it. I guarantee we will blow that flying science lab out of the sky. Now, it\u0027s possible you might get us while we do it, but by then your mission is screwed anyway, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line went silent again, only the hiss of background radiation letting him know his headset hadn\u0027t died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his answer came, it came on the shipwide comms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex said, \"They\u0027re stoppin\u0027, Captain. They just started hard brakin\u0027. Tracking says they\u0027ll be relative stopped about two million klicks out. Want me to keep flyin\u0027 toward \u0027em?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, bring us back to our stationary position over Eros,\" Holden replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naomi,\" Holden said, spinning his chair around to face her. \"Are they doing anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I can see through the clutter of their exhaust. But they could be tightbeaming messages the other direction and we\u0027d never know,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden flipped the shipwide comm off. He scratched his head for a minute, then unbuckled his restraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we stopped them for now. I\u0027m going to hit the head and then grab a drink. Want anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not wrong, you know,\" Naomi said later that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden was floating in zero g on the ops deck, his station a few feet away. He\u0027d turned down the deck lights, and the cabin was as dim as a moonlit night. Alex and Amos were sleeping two decks below. They might as well have been a million light-years away. Naomi was floating near her own station, two meters away, her hair unbound and drifting around her like a black cloud. The panel behind her lit her face in profile: the long forehead, flat nose, large lips. He could tell that her eyes were closed. He felt like they were the only two people in the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s not wrong?\" he said, just to be saying something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miller,\" she replied as though it were obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi laughed, then swatted with one hand to rotate her body and face him in the air. Her eyes were open now, though with the panel lights behind her, they were visible only as black pools in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been thinking about Miller,\" she said. \"I treated him badly on Tycho. Ignored him because you were angry. I owed him better than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He saved your life on Eros.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden snorted, but she kept going anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you were in the navy,\" she finally said, \"what were you supposed to do when someone went crazy on the ship? Started doing things that endangered everyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking they were talking about Miller, Holden said, \"You restrain him and remove him as a danger to the ship and crew. But Fred didn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi cut him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it\u0027s wartime?\" she said. \"The middle of a battle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he can\u0027t be easily restrained, the chief of the watch has an obligation to protect the ship and crew by whatever means necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even shooting him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s the only way to do it,\" Holden replied. \"Sure. But it would only be in the most pressing circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi nodded with her hand, sending her body slowly twisting the other way. She stopped her motion with one unconscious gesture. Holden was pretty good in zero g, but he\u0027d never be that good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Belt is a network,\" Naomi said. \"It\u0027s like one big distributed ship. We have nodes that make air, or water, or power, or structural materials. Those nodes may be separated by millions of kilometers of space, but that doesn\u0027t make them any less interconnected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see where this is going,\" Holden said with a sigh. \"Dresden was a madman on the ship, Miller shot him to protect the rest of us. He gave me that speech back on Tycho. Didn\u0027t buy it then either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" Holden said. \"Dresden wasn\u0027t an immediate threat. He was just an evil little man in an expensive suit. He didn\u0027t have a gun in his hand, or his finger on a bomb trigger. And I will never trust a man who believes he has the right to unilaterally execute people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden put his foot against the bulkhead and tapped off just hard enough to float a few feet closer to Naomi, close enough to see her eyes, read her reaction to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that science ship starts flying toward Eros again, I will throw every torpedo we have at it, and tell myself I was protecting the rest of the solar system from what\u0027s on Eros. But I won\u0027t just start shooting at it now, on the idea that it might decide to head to Eros again, because that\u0027s murder. What Miller did was murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi smiled at him, then grabbed his flight suit and pulled him close enough for a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might be the best person I know. But you\u0027re totally uncompromising on what you think is right, and that\u0027s what you hate about Miller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"He\u0027s totally uncompromising too, but he has different ideas on how things work. You hate that. To Miller, Dresden was an active threat to the ship. Every second he stayed alive endangered everyone else around him. To Miller, it was self-defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s wrong. The man was helpless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man talked the UN Navy into giving his company state-of-the-art ships,\" she said. \"He talked his company into murdering a million and a half people. Everything Miller said about why the protomolecule is better off with us was just as true about Dresden. How long is he in an OPA lockup before he finds the jailer who can be bought?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a prisoner,\" Holden said, feeing the argument slipping away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a monster with power, access, and allies who would have paid any price to keep his science project going,\" Naomi said. \"And I\u0027m telling you as a Belter, Miller wasn\u0027t wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden didn\u0027t answer; he just continued to float next to Naomi, keeping himself in her orbit. Was he angrier about the killing of Dresden or about Miller\u0027s making a decision that disagreed with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Miller had known. When Holden had told him to find his own ride back to Tycho, he\u0027d seen it in the detective\u0027s sad basset hound face. Miller had known it was coming, and had made no attempt to fight or argue. That meant that Miller had made his choice fully cognizant of the cost and ready to pay it. That meant something. Holden wasn\u0027t sure exactly what, but something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red telltale began flashing on the wall, and Naomi\u0027s panel woke up and began throwing data onto the screen. She pulled herself down to it using the back of her chair, then tapped out several quick commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The corvette or science ship must have called for help,\" Naomi said, pointing at her screen. \"We\u0027ve got ships on their way from all over the system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many are coming?\" Holden asked, trying to get a better look at her screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi made a small sound in the back of her throat, halfway between a chuckle and a cough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At a guess?
