That makes certain features very predictable, which in turn makes my job easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston Yarwood and Oliver Crump wandered into the kitchen just as Jonas launched into a fine monologue on the differences between the architecture of Milan and Florence in the sixteenth century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The great Florentine palazzos became models for the other city-states,\" Jonas continued as everyone nodded knowledgeably. \"Everybody who was anybody wanted a big house just like the Palazzo Medici or the Palazzo Rucellai. You can see the influence even in this old pile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity studied her lover discreetly as she sipped coffee. No doubt about it, it was getting hard to tell where the bull stopped and the scholar stepped in. Jonas was really getting into this, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her own enthusiasm was rapidly waning. She remembered Digby Hazelhurst\u0027s body hidden in the stone passage and shuddered. At first, hunting for the treasure had seemed like a nice sideline to the consulting assignment. But now she was not so sure. The only positive aspect of the situation that she could see this morning was that Jonas was genuinely interested in the project—and anything that gave Jonas a long-range career interest was not to be discarded lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlade Spencer did not show up until midway through breakfast. When he did appear, he looked so terrible that no one said a word. He ate very little and retired to the salon before the meal was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity took his wretched silence as a hopeful sign. Perhaps he wasn\u0027t planning to sue, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid our friend Slade really tied one on last night,\" Preston remarked. \"Pity. The man can\u0027t hold his liquor, apparently. I\u0027m not at all sure we should have invited him along, Elyssa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyssa smiled gently. \"He\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver Crump said nothing, but his eyes were narrowed as he watched Spencer leave the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas, Preston Yarwood, and the Warwicks got up to begin exploring the west wing as soon as Maggie cleared the dishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to come with us?\" Jonas asked in surprise when Verity announced she was going to read instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\" She held up her cane. \"I think I\u0027d better stay off my ankle. It\u0027s not feeling so hot today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrump pushed his wire-rimmed glasses more firmly up on his nose and peered at her ankle. Then, without a word, he got up and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyssa shook her head at his departing figure. \"He\u0027s not much of a conversationalist, I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, let\u0027s be on our way,\" Doug said. He took charge of the small party and led them out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity wandered into the salon with a book she had brought along on the trip and found Slade Spencer standing near the liquor cabinet. From the doorway she watched him tap two tablets out of a bottle he carried in his shirt pocket. He popped the pills into his mouth and chased them down with a long gulp of whiskey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up as she came into the room, but his eyes didn\u0027t quite meet hers. His hands shook a little as he replaced the pill bottle in his shirt pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about last night,\" he said. \"Guess I made a real ass of myself, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s forget it, shall we?\" Verity said quickly. \"You\u0027d just had a bit too much to drink, and Jonas is not the most understanding of men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be glad to forget the whole damn night.\" Spencer rubbed his jaw. \"Don\u0027t remember much about it anyway, except that Quarrel\u0027s got a mean right hook. But I gotta admit I deserved it. I completely misread the situation, and I apologize. If it\u0027s any consolation to you, I feel like shit this morning. Worst damn hangover I ever had in my life, and I\u0027ve had some humdingers. Too bad I didn\u0027t stay in the fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrowning in the rain would have been more pleasant than waking up this morning.\" He flopped down in a tatty armchair and picked up a year-old magazine that was lying nearby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity took a seat near the window, curling her good leg beneath her. Silence descended on the salon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to concentrate on her book, but she found herself gazing out into the overgrown, weed-tangled garden. Her thoughts drifted to the secret within her body. One of these days she was going to have to face facts—she couldn\u0027t live in this self-imposed limbo forever. Her body would get tough any day now and force her to admit that it meant business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a part of her preferred not knowing the truth just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later Verity heard a sound in the doorway. She looked up and smiled at Oliver Crump, who was standing there with an armful of greenery. He was also carrying a pot of steaming water, a bucket, and some towels. He started toward Verity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Oliver. What have you got there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I can make that ankle feel a lot better,\" he announced briskly, kneeling in front of her. \"Let me see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity hesitated and then told herself that there was no harm in letting him look at her throbbing ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to make a poultice for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrump nodded, carefully removing her shoe and sock. His fingers were amazingly gentle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you two will excuse me,\" Slade announced, \"I\u0027m going to go hit Maggie up for another cup of coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrump glanced over his shoulder. \"That man is not well,\" he observed softly. \"But I don\u0027t think he would accept help of any kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity nodded. \"I get the same feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver took a large lemon-colored shard of crystal out of his pocket and handed it to her. \"Here. Hold this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really into crystal therapy?\" Verity asked, examining the shard with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it doesn\u0027t. Depends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" She didn\u0027t, but she felt obliged to say something. \"I understand that a lot of people these days use crystals for various purposes. I don\u0027t know much about them myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one does,\" Oliver Crump said brusquely. \"There are plenty like Elyssa who think they do, but the fact is, very few people have ever figured out how to use crystals and gemstones. Folks have been working with them for thousands of years though, because it\u0027s easy to sense that there\u0027s some power in them. The trick is figuring out how to use that power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do different kinds of crystals have different powers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Theoretically. But like I said, no one really knows too much about them. They have to be properly tuned, or programmed, as they say in the computer business. Sometimes I think I can almost sense how to align the forces inside a crystal, but other times… \" He shrugged and dismissed the subject. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-31.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
