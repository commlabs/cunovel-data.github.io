We climb in, he starts the engine, and then he drives down the highway, heading out of town. We’re in South Caroline right now, so even though it’s February, the air is warm and the humidity makes my skin sticky, especially because we have the windows down. The ocean’s pretty close by, the sand golden, the sky blue, and it makes my hands itch for the pencil and sketchbook Micha has in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he finally stops the car, we’re parked in front of a field covered in luscious grass and bushes. There’s also this lofty tree in the center, by itself, some of the branches stretching toward the sky and others drooping toward the ground. It kind of reminds me of the tree back at home for some reason and it dawns on me why he might have brought me here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicha grins as he slips the keys out of the ignition. “So when you said you wanted to come on the road with me, you said you’d love to spend your time drawing things that mean something to you, along with that tree I always used to climb up to get to you. Well, since that very meaningful tree is far, far away right now, I thought maybe you could draw this.” He gestures at the field. “I found this field the other day when I was driving back from practice, searching for something that you could draw because I know you’ve been wanting to do a meaningful landscape drawing. The tree kind of reminded me of the one back home, at least I think so, but then again I’m no artist.” He pauses, waiting eagerly for my response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I might have fallen in love with him even more. I didn’t think that was possible, but every day the love I have for Micha grows stronger, especially when he does stuff like this for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean over the console toward him. “I love you,” I say, unable to help myself. “And I love the tree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you, too,” he says and then he kisses me. By the time we stop for air, we’re both breathless and I’ve managed to climb over the console and onto his lap and his shirt’s unbuttoned… I don’t even know how it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands are under my dress, grabbing at my flesh as he stares at me a little dazed. “So are you going to draw the tree?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, but after I draw you first,” I say. “Because you mean more to me than anything else in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But don’t you have a ton of drawings of me already?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but I don’t have one with you sitting under this tree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to be tired of drawing me, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “No way. I will never get tired of you. Ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No matter how many times you say that, I will never get tired of hearing it,” he admits, and then a thoughtful expression rises on his face “So me under the tree, huh? That’s your meaningful drawing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it is,” I say, and then we kiss for a little bit longer before we climb out of the car and walk toward the tree, happy, peaceful, and content as we live out our forever just how we want to—together. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ever-after-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-4/page-36.html","bookId":1972,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:59 AM"}
