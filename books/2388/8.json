That’s how I got into your room, too. I camped out here for a couple hours and took a nap.” She grabbed Z-J’s bag and a couple of other duffels from inside the closet. “Anyway, I’ll let you get some rest now. Sorry I freaked you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait!” Emily caught her arm before she could go. “D-do you want to stay here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan froze, halfway standing. “For the night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For … maybe longer than the night,” Emily blurted. “I have a feeling my roommate isn’t going to sleep here much. There’s a spare bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan squinted. “Why would you do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily traced her finger over the threads on the comforter. She’d surprised herself by asking, but maybe it wasn’t such a bad idea. She felt sorry for Jordan, definitely, but she was also lonely being in the room by herself. Besides, Emily found it almost impossible to take her eyes off Jordan’s high cheekbones, her kissable lips—in a platonic way, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cheeks flushed, and she was suddenly afraid Jordan could read her thoughts. “We can’t have you sleeping on a chaise by the pool.” She patted the bed next to hers. “It’s yours if you want it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan nodded slowly. “I’d love that, if you’re sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure,” Emily said, and then, because she thought it sounded buddy-buddy, added, “roomie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan held her gaze. “Roomie,” she repeated, as if it were an antiquated word she’d never heard before. Then she stood up, walked toward Emily, and gave her a huge hug. “Thank you so much. This is wonderful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily remained as stiff as she could, though she wanted to bury her face in Jordan’s neck and inhale the sweet scent of her skin. “You’re welcome so much,” she said back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut really, it was Jordan she should have been thanking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSPENCER’S LAST-DITCH EFFORT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Spencer and her roommate, Kirsten Cullen, stepped out of their room and started toward the elevators. The air smelled of lingering shampoo from people’s bathrooms; bacon, eggs, and coffee from the restaurant; and sunscreen. The turquoise sky and navy-blue sea loomed large out the huge windows at the end of the corridor, and the hallway walls were papered with flyers reminding everyone to sign up for the end-of-cruise talent show. Spencer made a mental note to sign up their hula routine later that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirsten stretched her arms over her head and let out a low moan. “I am so jealous of you for not getting seasick last night. I’m exhausted. I don’t even know if I’ll be able to dive today!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer nudged her playfully. “We’re at sea. Where do you think we’re going to dive?” The two of them were taking scuba, which counted as a class credit, and they were headed for the first lesson, which was taking place in one of the fitness centers. Spencer was overjoyed that she’d been randomly paired with Kirsten, especially hearing about her friends’ matches. Field hockey buddies for years, she and Kirsten had already roomed together when traveling to out-of-state games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is just a getting-to-know-you, everyone-try-on-the-equipment, here-are-some-water-safety-tips kind of thing,” Spencer added knowingly. “I’ve been through plenty of these before.” Spencer had gotten her scuba certification at fourteen; she could probably write the book on scuba safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting off on the top floor, they passed one of the restaurants, which teemed with guys loading their plates at the buffet line, girls whispering at the tables, and kids flirting and gossiping near the espresso bar. Then Spencer spied someone’s tall, straight back in front of the giant aquarium, and she suppressed a nervous squeak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reefer?” she called out, her voice cracking only a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer turned. His whole face lit up when he caught sight of her. This was the first time they’d seen each other on the boat. They’d tried to connect yesterday, but, like Kirsten, Reefer had spent the evening in his room, seasick. “Can I walk you to scuba?” Reefer asked, a little bashfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” Spencer said, trying to temper her smile. She glanced at Kirsten to see if it was okay, but Kirsten had tactfully walked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, and surprise.” Reefer proffered a smoothie from behind his back. “This is for you. It’s banana-papaya.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My favorite,” Spencer breathed, thrilled he’d remembered. She’d mentioned liking those flavors together just once on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir hands touched as she took it from him. Chills zinged up Spencer’s spine. She snuck a peek at Reefer’s face, taking in his chiseled jaw and his amber-colored eyes. This was the first time she’d laid eyes on him since Princeton—since she’d realized she liked him. How could she have not remembered his strong shoulders or how pink and kissable his lips were? Why hadn’t she taken note of the cute freckles on his cheeks? Even his dreadlocks, threadbare hemp sneakers, and oversized tie-dyed shirt were suddenly endearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed a lock of hair behind her ear, feeling the back of her neck redden. “Um, how are you feeling?” she blurted, suddenly needing to fill the silence. “You must have been bummed to miss out on the Welcome Party.” She’d almost been tempted to knock on his cabin door with a glass of ginger ale and some Dramamine, but she’d worried that might seem too forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh, it’s all good,” Reefer said, starting down the hall toward the scuba class. “I watched movies on pay-per-view. Did you get sick? Those waves were pretty vicious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer shook her head. “I’ve never been seasick. I’m used to boats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucky,” Reefer sighed. “Have you been diving for a while?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer nodded. “I’ve been certified for a couple years. I’m hoping to go on some private dives without the rest of the group. I don’t really like diving around a lot of people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer held the door to the stairwell open for her. “Would you mind some company? I mean, I only got certified last year, but I’m a quick learner, I swear. And I bet you’re a pretty good tour guide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer put a finger to her mouth, coyly pretending to contemplate the offer. “But what if I wanted those dives to be private? What do I get in return for bringing you along?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer paused on the staircase, his eyes sparkling playfully. “How about my most cherished 1977 Grateful Dead concert T-shirt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer gave him a skeptical look. “The one you bought off eBay that still smells like pot after all those washings? No thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t smell like pot!” Reefer urged. “It smells fine. I wear it to school all the time and no one questions me, I swear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer secretly felt thrilled at the idea of wearing a T-shirt that Reefer had worn, too. It seemed so … boy-friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d reached the door to the Seahorse Gym, the site of the first scuba class, by then. Elliptical machines, stair climbers, and treadmills lined the window wall, and about thirty folding chairs stood on the mats. Kirsten was in the front row, filing her nails. Quite a few kids grabbed coffee and bagels from a catered tray in the back. Tim, the instructor Spencer had met at the Activity Fair the day before, stood over a couple of cardboard boxes, sorting through oxygen tanks and wetsuits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer faced Reefer again, feeling a tingly, excited rush. Reefer was smiling at her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was suddenly gripped with a wonderful idea. She touched Reefer’s arm. “Let’s ditch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer widened his eyes. “Class?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We both already know how to dive. Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer, clapped a hand over his mouth, feigning shock. “Aren’t you the girl who’s gotten the Perfect Attendance award every year?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer shrugged. “I’m on vacation.” She could just picture it: grabbing Reefer’s hand and pulling him down to one of the lower lounges, which were probably empty at this time of morning, and sitting in a back booth. They’d gossip about people on the boat, plan outings for after their dives, and then their heads would move closer together, and then …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Raif?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was coming from someone inside the classroom. Reefer turned. His eyebrows shot up, and he took a step through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is you!” a girl whooped. “Oh my God!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow!” Reefer said. And then he was hugging her. Really hugging her. Spencer stood in the doorway, feeling like a forgotten child’s toy tossed out a car window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared her throat a little more loudly than she meant to, and Reefer turned around, his dreadlocks bouncing. “Oh, Spencer. Sorry. This is—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Naomi,” Spencer blurted, staring at the girl who had stepped into view. She gave Spencer a haughty, threatening look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Spencer,” Naomi chirped. “You’re taking scuba, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, yeah,” Spencer mumbled, eyeing Naomi’s fingers, which were grazing Reefer’s. She glanced at the door, considering ditching without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut suddenly, it didn’t seem like a very fun idea at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA PARTNER IN CRIME\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat morning, Aria and about thirty other kids stood in the shade of the giant pink waterslide on the top deck of the cruise ship, eagerly awaiting the start of the Eco Scavenger Hunt. The air smelled like wood-floor cleaner, spicy deodorant, and boat fuel that the captain had insisted was totally eco-friendly, though Aria had her doubts. Everyone fanned their faces, applied high-powered sunscreen to ward off the punishing Caribbean sun, and chattered excitedly about what the activity was going to entail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the activity leader got off her cell phone and turned to the group. “Welcome!” she cried, her freckly face breaking into a smile. “My name is Gretchen Vine, and you guys are in for a treat. Think of this hunt like The Amazing Race—we give you clues and cash to get to your destination, and the first group to figure out all the riddles wins.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wins what?” a brunette girl whose string bikini straps peeked out from underneath her shirt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGretchen smiled and unveiled two white gift certificates to the Apple Store, and everyone oohed. “They’re worth a thousand dollars each.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Gretchen passed out little red wallets that said ECO TREASURE HUNT on the front. “Carry your clues in here,” she instructed. “You’ll need to show me what you found at the end of each day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will we get to do any camping? Extreme hikes? Role-playing?” a boy called. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burned-pretty-little-liars-12/page-8.html","bookId":2388,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM"}
