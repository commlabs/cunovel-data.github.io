Spending time with Charlie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. At least he wants to spend time with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin shot her a sharp look. “Was that a dig at me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. “God, Dad, paranoid much? I just meant if it wasn’t for the McKays, I’d never get to see anyone or do anything. It sucks being stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way to get around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever failed—she found a way to poke at him about the fact she still wasn’t driving on her own. He knew better than to take the bait. “How was school this week?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crappy. I got a hundred percent on my math quiz and blew the curve for the rest of the class so my classmates are pissed at me. Which is probably why I’m spending another Friday night alone. Yay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never feel guilty for using your brain, Sierra. I’m proud of you for getting the top grade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you see anyone I know when you were home?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just the people in the office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t even mind listening to Manny complain about the heat and everything else.” She sighed. “Can I go with you next time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know when that’ll be.” He glanced at her again, seeing that brooding look settle on her face. “Back up. Why don’t you have plans for this weekend? Is there something going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides the fact I don’t have any friends except Marin and she’s busy all the time? Besides the fact the weather always sucks so I can’t drive? No. Besides that, everything is awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd…there was the sarcasm. He counted to ten. “But didn’t you just say if not for the McKays—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Read between the lines, Dad,” she snapped. “As much as I try to convince myself everything is fine, it’s not. When you’re gone it just reminds me that I want to go home. I hate it here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated it today. Didn’t mean she’d hate it tomorrow. Or next week. She changed her mind as often as her nail polish color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin parked in front of the house to unload his luggage, which included a token he’d picked up for his daughter. Surly girl would probably throw it at him, so he’d save it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what? You’re not talking to me now?” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s pointless to argue with you, when you’ll pick apart anything I say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because you know I’m right. Not that you ever listen to me.” She scrambled out of the car and…yep. Slammed the door hard enough to rock the entire frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome fucking home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew that. He wouldn’t let her shitty attitude sour the fact he was glad to be home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin left his suitcase in the entryway and hung up his coat. He loosened his tie on his way to the kitchen, searching for Rielle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed open the swinging door and there she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis damn heart skipped a beat. His stomach performed a happy flip. His cock stirred. He needed to wrap himself in her warmth, softness and light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goddamn, Ree, you’re looking mighty tasty today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flashed him an unsure smile. “I thought you’d be here later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t wait to get back.” He stalked her until her back connected with the refrigerator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle’s eyes softened. “Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really.” He pressed his body to hers, curling one hand around her face and the other around her hip. He whispered, “I missed you,” against her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gavin. Wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t.” Then he took her mouth. Kissing her with pent up need, proving his desire for her with every hot and hard stroke of his tongue. Losing himself in the rush of her lithe body arching against his. Filling his senses with her taste, her scent. Swallowing her sexy little I-want-you-now moans that drove him fucking insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bed. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed convincing? Fine. He’d convince the hell out of her. He growled, cranking up the intensity of the next kiss. Sliding his hand into her hair and pulling slightly, angling her head, to dive deeper into the soft draws of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a loud, pointed throat clearing came from behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin froze. Then he lifted his mouth and his gaze collided with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands fell away and he slowly turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blonde amazon version of Rielle gave him a little finger wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. Or was she just giving him the finger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gavin. This is my daughter, Rory,” Rielle said behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d just attacked Rielle in front of her daughter? Classy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. Did Rory know about them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle slipped her arm around his waist and rested her head on his chest. That move shocked the heck out of her daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess that answered that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you two are…dating?” Rory asked incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, we’re involved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you been involved—together, dating, whatever—since he moved in with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Technically, I’m living with him,” Rielle said evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnoyance crossed Rory’s face. Her posture remained belligerent. “Oh, we’re playing the word definition game. Fine. So, technically what you’re really doing is sleeping together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is none of your business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it Sierra’s business? Should I ask her if you two share a bed every night? Or is she in the dark too? Or maybe that’s why she was making you over? So you’d be what he wanted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot believe you just said that. What is your deal, Rory?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My deal? Really, Mom? You don’t understand why I’d be upset that you didn’t tell me you’re having sex with Gavin Daniels? And apparently it’s more than sex? It’s some kind of…relationship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle stiffened, but she didn’t move away from him. “I don’t tell you everything that goes on in my life, Rory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bullshit. That’s because there’s nothing to tell since I’ve never known you to be involved with anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or maybe I don’t tell you because you blab any damn thing that pops into your head, regardless if it’s my personal business,” Rielle shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRory had the grace to look embarrassed, but it didn’t last long. “Ouch. All this secrecy does is make me wonder if you didn’t tell me about you and Gavin because you’re ashamed about what this really is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And of course, you know what it really is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A convenience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin ground his teeth together, understanding how difficult it must be for Rielle to hold her tongue when Sierra got mouthy with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wrong. You want to know why I didn’t tell you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me guess. Because it proves me right? That he’s—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t say it,” Rielle warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like the rest of the McKays,” Rory finished. “He’ll fuck anything that walks like it’s his due and then he’ll walk the fuck away. That’s really the guy you want to have a relationship with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s enough,” Gavin said to Rory. “I don’t know what chip you have on your shoulder about the McKays, and frankly, I don’t give a shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big surprise there,” she interrupted with a sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I do care that you think you can waltz in here and pass judgment on your mother, when to be blunt, you don’t know fuck-all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle didn’t chastise him, nor did she jump in and apologize for his harsh response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is just fucking great. He’s already got you under his thumb.” Rory pushed off the counter. “Screw this. I’m outta here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when Rielle planted all five feet five inches in front of her six foot tall daughter. “Cool off that hot head of yours, Aurora Rose. You don’t get to go off on a tear, do you hear me?” Rielle drilled Rory in the chest with her index finger. “I slaved making your favorite supper at your request, so you damn well better have your butt parked at the dining room table at six-thirty, wearing a goddamned smile.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will it just be you and me? Or will they be here too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Gavin and Sierra will be here, since it’s a family dinner in their house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.” Rory tried to sidestep Rielle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Rielle wouldn’t budge. “You will be here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said I would, all right? Jesus. Move. I gotta get my dog.” Rory all but stomped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin wasn’t aware he held his breath, waiting for the door to slam, until it actually did—with enough force to rattle the dishes in the cupboard. He chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glad someone sees humor in this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe circled his arms around Rielle. “I don’t know whether to be impressed that Rory can slam the door harder than Sierra, or scared my daughter won’t outgrow this stage and she’ll be testing door hinges for the next seven years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle smiled wanly. “It’s been a while since Rory has reminded me of her door-slamming expertise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin ran his hand down her back. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I hate fighting with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Must be the day,” he murmured. “Sierra lit into me the second she got in the car today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wondered what triggered her spectacular door slam. And why she’d ignored me when I called out to her, after we’d had so much fun last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doing what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sierra insisted on making me over. Rory showed up and the two of them conspired against me. They got along surprisingly well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were you expecting Rory this weekend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “She hasn’t gotten around to telling me why she showed up out of the blue, which is probably why she acted so bratty.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14/page-30.html","bookId":2695,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:57 AM"}
