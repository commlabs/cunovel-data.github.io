Their lack of attention seemed… conspicuous, and some instinct told the cowled figure that it was time to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they had passed by, heading up the street westward, the figure stepped out from the shadows, walked swiftly and silently after the two men. He sensed their sudden, heightened awareness-and perhaps something like alarm. Moments before catching up to them, he turned right, into an alley leading north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen paces in, he found a dark recess in which he could bide. He drew back his cloak and cinched it, freeing his and hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen heartbeats passed before he heard their footfalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched them walk past, cautious, both with drawn knives. One whispered something to the other and they hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure allowed his right foot to scrape as he stepped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spun round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Awl’dan cadaran whip was a whisper as it snaked out, the leather-studded with coin-sized, dagger-sharp, overlapping half-moon blades-flickering out in a gleam-ing arc that licked both men across their throats. Blood sprayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched them crumple. The blood flowed freely, more from the man who had been on the left, spreading across the greasy cobbles. Stepping close to the other victim, he unsheathed a knife and plunged it point-first into his throat; then, with practised familiarity, he cut off the man’s face, taking skin, muscle and hair. He repeated the ghastly task with the other man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo fewer agents of the Patriotists to contend with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, they worked in threes, one always at a distance, following the first two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProm the garrison, the first alarms sounded, a shrill collection of bells that trilled out through the dusty air about the buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFolding up his grisly trophies and pushing them beneath a fold in the loose rodara wool shirt that covered his scaled hauberk, the figure set off along the alley, making for the north gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA squad of the city guard appeared at the far mouth, five armoured, helmed Letherii with shortswords and shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon seeing them, the figure sprinted forward, freeing the cadaran whip in his left hand, while in his right hand he shook free the rygtha crescent axe from the over-under strips of rawhide that had held it against his hip. A thick haft, as long as a grown man’s thigh bone, to which each end was affixed a three-quarter-moon iron blade, their planes perpendicular to each other. Cadaran and rygtha ancient weapons of the Awl’dan, their mastery virtually unknown among the tribes for at least a century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe constabulary had, accordingly, never before faced such weapons…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt ten paces from the first three guardsmen, the whip lashed out, a blurred sideways figure-eight that spawned screams and gouts of blood that spilled almost black in the alley’s gloom. Two of the Letherii reeled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lithe, wiry figure closed on the last man in the from row. Right hand slid along the haft to run up against flange beneath the left-side crescent blade, the haf** slapping parallel to the underside of his forearm as he brought the weapon up-blocking a desperate slash from the guard’s shortsword. Then, as the Awl threw his elbow forward, the right-side blade flashed out, cutting at the man’s face, connecting just below the helm’s rim, chopping through the nasal ridge and frontal bone before dipping into the soft matter of his brain. The tapered, sharp crescent blade slid back out with ease, as the Awl slipped past the falling guard, whip returning from an over-the head gather to hiss out, wrapping round the neck of the fourth Letherii-who shrieked, dropping his sword as he scrabbled at the deadly blades-as the Awl dropped into crouch, his right hand sliding the length of the rygtha haf** to abut the flanged base of the right-blade, then slashing out. The fifth guard jerked his shield upward to block, but too late-the blade caught him across the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tug on the whip decapitated the fourth guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Awl released his hold on the cadaran’s handle and gripping the rygtha at both ends, stepped close to slam the haft into the last guard’s throat, crushing the windpipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollecting the whip, he moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA street, the sound of lancers off to the right. The gate, fifty paces to the left, now knotted with guards-heads turning his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raced straight for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtri-Preda Bivatt took personal command of a troop of lancers. Twenty riders at her back, she led her horse at a Canter, following the trail of a bloodbath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two Patriotist agents midway down the alley. Five city guardsmen at the far end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHiding out onto the street, she angled her mount to the left, drawing her longsword as she neared the gate. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-27.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
