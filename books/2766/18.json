You didn\u0027t think you were learning Ml6 rifle safety in the classroom for nothing, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUmm...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I\u0027m a kick-ass Jewish warrior woman. and sometimes I\u0027m not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone is totally surprised when Avi and I catch up to them on the night run. There\u0027s a big bonfire, and everyone is sitting around it. Sergeant B-S walks up to Avi and me and says something in Hebrew, which is obviously about me because Avi gestures to my torn uniform and scraped-up chin when he answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to go back to the base?\" Sergeant B-S asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I have to admit I\u0027m still in some pain, but whatever numbing stuff was on that pad Avi used on my arms has taken the edge off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant B-S nods approvingly. \"Gefen, make sure she gets checked when we get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi salutes the sergeant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bonfire lights up the area and spreads warmth into the cool desert air. I could point out to Sergeant B-S that if my headlight could alert the enemy to our location, a big bonfire would most likely ensure our immediate demise. But whatever. I\u0027m trying to go with the flow here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to sit with me,\" I tell Avi as he hesitates at my side. He\u0027s probably desperate to get away from me and go to his girlfriend. While he was super nice to me when we were alone, it was obviously out of duty. Now that Liron is in sight, he\u0027s surely waiting for me to let him off the hook. \"You should talk to Liron,\" I say. \"There\u0027s an empty spot next to her. She\u0027s probably saving it for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks surprised, but he nods his head and shrugs. \"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. I\u0027ll be fine. Go.\" Ugh. My stomach is tied in knots as he walks away from me. I wish I hadn\u0027t pushed him to go to her, but it\u0027s better than asking him to sit with me and have him reject me... or worse, have him sit next to me but long to be with Liron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find a spot next to Tori.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like crap,\" she tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I\u0027m sure I couldn\u0027t have figured that out on my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your bangs look good, though, thanks to me. Although the only way to hide the nasty cuts on your chin would be to grow a beard. I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll be too hard for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up. \"If I wanted to be insulted, I would have sat next to Nathan. Nice talking to you. Bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" she says, reaching out to grab the side of my pants. \"I was just kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you even know how to be nice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see Tori perfectly in the light of the fire. Her blond hair shines like a halo, and her darker hair underneath looks like a protective shield. She looks up at me and says honesty, \"I used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now I feel sorry for her. Her little sincere comments make her vulnerable, which is something we have in common. I sit back down and stare into the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents thought I\u0027d get over my anger about their divorce if I spent time with kids my own age and my own religion.\" She shakes her head in disgust. \"Parents have no clue what their kids need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa. \"You think that\u0027s bad? I came on this trip to spend time with Avi. Look where that\u0027s gotten me.\" I gesture to Avi, sitting next to Liron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that\u0027s bad? My dad has a new girlfriend,\" Tori blurts out. \"He says he wasn\u0027t dating her before they got divorced, but I\u0027m not stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nothing. My mom dated a new guy every month before my stepfather. She totally had dating ADD. Then she got married and pregnant all in a year. I\u0027m afraid she\u0027ll get parent ADD and not want the kid... or Marc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as we\u0027re playing Whose Life Sucks More?, I can one-up you yet again. My parents just got divorced and my dad already cancels the weekends he\u0027s supposed to have me. My mom hopes he moves away and never comes back so she doesn\u0027t have to deal with him. But that\u0027s not what I want. I just wish... I just wish things could go back to the way they were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaze longingly at Avi. \"I do, too.\" I sigh, resigned to living in the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess groans as she sits down next to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been, Cleo?\" I ask my best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cleo? Wait, what happened to your chin? Did George the Zit spread?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. While you were being carried like Cleopatra on the stretcher, the real wounded--me--finished the run bandaged up like Frankenstein.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well /just puked my guts out. Did you ever realize how much vertigo you can get lying on a stretcher bouncing up and down like a frickin\u0027 basketball? I had a death grip on the sides the entire time. I seriously thought I was gonna bounce right off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda, who I just notice is sitting on the other side of Tori, leans forward. \"I\u0027m sick of hearing you guys be all negative. I want each of you to say something positive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePositive? I point to my gauzed-up forearms, gesture to my bloody chin and then to Avi talking to Liron, and then, as the cherry on top of my miserable life, I lift up my bangs to show off George the Zit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say something, Amy,\" Miranda insists. \"Something positive. I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll make you feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Miranda. I\u0027ve got it.\" I motion the girls to lean in close to hear my positive words. \"At least I\u0027m not dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow\u0027s that for positivity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to admit it does make me feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhysical strength is needed for obstacle courses, but mental strength is needed when being close to your ex-boyfriend\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTori plops herself down on my cot during a fifteen-minute break the next day. \"I hear we\u0027re sleeping in the desert at some point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would we do that when we live in such luxury-right here?\" I gesture at the bulging springs above me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they want to toughen us up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please. I\u0027m tough enough. Any tougher and I\u0027ll grow balls and a hairy chest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if the thought of sleeping in the desert at night isn\u0027t scary enough, Ronit is leading us to the activity Avi warned me about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShooting an M16 rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now we\u0027re all standing in line, waiting to be issued a big rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid of guns,\" I say, but nobody seems to be listening to me. They\u0027re all too excited. I guess it wouldn\u0027t hurt to hold the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to sign for it and check that the serial number of the issued weapon, written next to my name, matches the actual number on the rifle. I can almost feel testicles growing between my legs as it\u0027s handed to me (I\u0027m kidding, of course... about the testicles growing between my legs, not about being handed my very own weapon).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any colors besides black?\" I ask the guy handing out the guns. \"Are you kidding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m kidding. Although I wouldn\u0027t mind a pink one to match my luggage.\" The guy shakes his head and I think he mumbles something like American princess, but I can\u0027t be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should see the American boys in our unit as they\u0027re given their weapons. By the GI Joe expressions on their faces, you\u0027d think they were just handed a Man Badge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll show you mine if you show me yours,\" Nathan jokes when we\u0027re standing under a canopy at the range, waiting for further instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t annoy me, Nathan. I have a gun.\" Of course it\u0027s big and bulky and warm from the summer sun. I sling it over my shoulder, feeling every bit of a soldier now. I definitely look the part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not loaded,\" Nathan responds dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter handing us safety goggles and earmuffs, Sergeant B-S brings out a big box full of metal \"magazines\" and shows us how to insert the empty magazine into the bottom of the rifle. We\u0027ve learned about the parts of the M16 and the different types of bullets in the classroom. Weapons safety has been drilled into my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRules of gun safety in a non-combat environment:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever point the weapon at a person, and always point it in a safe direction\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t put your finger on the trigger until you\u0027re ready to shoot the weapon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep the weapon unloaded until you\u0027re ready to use it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter loading their magazines with bullets and shoving them into their weapons, Avi and Liron lie on their stomachs in front of canvas sandbags, with one leg straight and the other leg bent for support. With their rifles resting on the sandbags, they aim for the paper target in front of them and... bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they get up and we\u0027re ordered into position on the range for dry firing--shooting without bullets, that is--I raise my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimrod comes over to help. \"Amy, what\u0027s the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I can do this. I\u0027m not really a gun person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. \"That\u0027s a good joke. Hey, Gefen! Come here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi jogs over to us. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy here says she\u0027s not a gun person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be shooting a target, Amy. Not people,\" Avi says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I get that, but... I\u0027m afraid of the kickback, or sidekick or whatever you call it, and the noise. I have sensitive ears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s called recoil.\" Nimrod rolls his eyes. \"Gefen, you deal with your girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not dating anymore!\" I call after Nimrod as he hurries off to help someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi lifts the earmuffs off my ears. \"No need to shout. Can we be friends today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I say, putting the earmuffs back in place. \"Friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi crouches. \"Lie down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie on the ground and rest the rifle on the sandbag. Avi checks the weapon, making sure the bullet chamber thingy is empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no recoil in dry firing,\" he assures me. \"Now move the lever from safe to semi. Make sure it\u0027s never on auto or you\u0027ll empty that magazine with one trigger pull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move the toggle to semi. Then I double and triple check it to make sure I didn\u0027t accidentally move it to auto. That would not be fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now settle the hand guard of the weapon into the V between your thumb and forefinger on your non-firing hand.\" He gently takes my knee and slides it up so it\u0027s bent. \"Bending one knee gives you more support. Aim at your target through the sight guide. \"When you\u0027re ready, put your finger on the trigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at him. \"I\u0027m embarrassed to say this, because I really am against killing and guns. But I\u0027m kind of getting a rush from this. I feel powerful with a gun this big in my hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait to say that until after you sleep with it tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soldiers sleep with their gun every night they\u0027re on base or on duty. Come on, stop stalling. Aim at your target, control your breathing, and squeeze the trigger after you exhale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look through the sight thingy, aim at my paper target, and pull the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep dry firing until Sergeant B-S comes around and tells us all to put the rifles on safe mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re told to fill our magazines with ten bullets and push the magazine into the rifle. \"When you\u0027re ready, switch to the semi position and fire one at a time until your magazine is empty,\" Sergeant B-S instructs us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get back in position and line up the sights with my target, but I\u0027m too nervous to shoot. I hear everyone else firing their guns on either side of me. Listen, disasters happen to me wherever I go, and I can\u0027t keep random thoughts from running through my head. What if the M16 misfires? What if the shell of the bullet hits me when it\u0027s ejected and burns my scalp as it lands on my head? What if the recoil dislocates my shoulder? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-18.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
