She leaned against the wall and gasped for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t come closer,\" she begged. \"I\u0027m all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said gravely, \"Is the possibility that humorous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to answer and laughed again. Then, in a whisper, she said, \"Oh, you are an Earthman? How could it ever be me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew him well,\" said Baley. \"You knew his habits. You could have planned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think I would see him? That I would get close enough to bash him over the head with something? You just don\u0027t know anything at all about it, Baley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt himself redden. \"Why couldn\u0027t you get close enough to him, ma\u0027am. You\u0027ve had practice - uh - mingling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One thing leads to another. You seem to be able to stand my presence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At twenty feet,\" she said contemptuously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve just visited a man who nearly collapsed because he had to endure my presence for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa sobered and said, \"A difference in degree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suggest that a difference in degree is all that is necessary. The habit of seeing children makes it possible to endure seeing Delmarre just long enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to point out, Mr. Baley,\" said Klorissa, no longer ap\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epearing the least amused, \"that it doesn\u0027t matter a speck what I can endure. Dr. Delmarre was the finicky one. He was almost as bad as Leebig himself. Almost. Even if I could endure seeing him, he would never endure seeing me. Mrs. Delmarre is the only one he could possibly have allowed within seeing distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Who\u0027s this Leebig you mentioned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa shrugged. \"One of these odd genius types, if you know what I mean. He\u0027s done work with the boss on robots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley checked that off mentally and returned to the matter at hand. He said, \"It could also be said you had a motive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What motive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His death put you in charge of this establishment, gave you position.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You call that a motive? Skies above, who could want this position? Who on Solaria? This is a motive for keeping him alive. It\u0027s a motive for hovering over him and protecting him. You\u0027ll have to do better than that, Earthman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley scratched his neck uncertainly with one finger. He saw the justice of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiorissa said, \"Did you notice my ring, Mr. Baley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment it seemed she was about to strip the glove from her right hand, but she refrained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed it,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know its significance, I suppose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t.\" (He would never have done with ignorance, he thought bitterly.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind a small lecture, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it will help me make sense of this damned world,\" blurted out Baley, \"by all means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skies above!\" Klorissa smiled. \"I suppose we seem to you as Earth would seem to us. Imagine. Say, here\u0027s an empty chamber. Come in here and we\u0027ll sit down - no, the room\u0027s not big enough. Tell you what, though. You take a seat in there and I\u0027ll stand out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped farther down the corridor, giving him space to enter the room, then returned, taking up her stand against the opposite wall at a point from which she could see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley took his seat with only the slightest quiver of chivalry countering it. He thought rebelliously: Why not? Let the Spacer woman stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa folded her muscular arms across her chest and said, \"Gene analysis is the key to our society. We don\u0027t analyze for genes directly, of course. Each gene, however, governs one enzyme, and we can analyze for enzymes. Know the enzymes, know the body chemistry. Know the body chemistry, know the human being. You see all that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand the theory,\" said Baley. \"I don\u0027t know how it\u0027s applied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That part\u0027s done here. Blood samples are taken while the infant is still in the late fetal stage. That gives us our rough first approximation. Ideally, we should catch all mutations at that point and judge whether birth can be risked. In actual fact, we still don\u0027t quite know enough to eliminate all possibility of mistake. Someday, maybe. Anyway, we continue testing after birth; biopsies as well as body fluids. In any case, long before adulthood, we know exactly what our little boys and girls are made of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Sugar and spice... A nonsense phrase went unbidden through Baley\u0027s mind.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wear coded rings to indicate our gene constitution,\" said Klorissa. \"It\u0027s an old custom, a bit of the primitive left behind from the days when Solarians had not yet been weeded eugenically. Nowadays, we\u0027re all healthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"But you still wear yours. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m exceptional,\" she said with an unembarrassed, unblunted pride. \"Dr. Delmarre spent a long time searching for an assistant. He needed someone exceptional. Brains, ingenuity, industry, stability. Most of all, stability. Someone who could learn to mingle with children and not break down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t, could he? Was that a measure of his instability?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiorissa said, \"In a way, it was, but at least it was a desirable type of instability under most circumstances. You wash your hands, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley\u0027s eyes dropped to his hands. They were as clean as need be. \"Yes,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I suppose it\u0027s a measure of instability to feel such revulsion at dirty hands as to be unable to clean an oily mechanism by hand even in an emergency. Still, in the ordinary course of living, the revulsion keeps you clean, which is good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing more. My genic health is the third-highest ever recorded on Solaria, so I wear my ring. It\u0027s a record I enjoy carrying with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I congratulate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You needn\u0027t sneer. It may not be my doing. It may be the blind permutation of parental genes, but it\u0027s a proud thing to own, anyway. And no one would believe me capable of so seriously psychotic an act as murder. Not with my gene make-up. So don\u0027t waste accusations on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley shrugged and said nothing. The woman seemed to confuse gene make-up and evidence and presumably the rest of Solaria would do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiorissa said, \"Do you want to see the youngsters now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridors seemed to go on forever. The building was obviously a tremendous one. Nothing like the huge banks of apartments in the Cities of Earth, of course, but for a single building clinging to the outside skin of a planet it must be a mountainous structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were hundreds of cribs, with pink babies squalling, or sleeping, or feeding. Then there were play rooms for the crawlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not too bad even at this age,\" said Klorissa grudgingly, \"though they take up a tremendous sum of robots. It\u0027s practically a robot per baby till walking age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They sicken if they don\u0027t get individual attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley nodded. \"Yes, I suppose the requirement for affection is something that can\u0027t be done away with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa frowned and said brusquely, \"Babies require attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"I am a little surprised that robots can fulfill the need for affection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled toward him, the distance between them not sufficing to hide her displeasure. \"See here, Baley, if you\u0027re trying to shock me by using unpleasant terms, you won\u0027t succeed. Skies above, don\u0027t be childish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shock you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can use the word too. Affection! Do you want a short word, a good four-letter word. I can say that, too. Love! Love! Now if it\u0027s out of your system, behave yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley did not trouble to dispute the matter of obscenity. He said, \"Can robots really give the necessary attention, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously, or this farm would not be the success it is. They fool with the child. They nuzzle it and snuggle it. The child doesn\u0027t care that it\u0027s only a robot. But then, things grow more difficult between three and ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"During that interval, the children insist on playing with one another. Quite indiscriminately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it you let them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to, but we never forget our obligation to teach them the requirements of adulthood. Each has a separate room that can be closed off. Even from the first, they must sleep alone. We insist on that. And then we have an isolation time every day and that increases with the years. By the time a child reaches ten, he is able to restrict himself to viewing for a week at a time. Of course, the viewing arrangements are elaborate. They can view outdoors, under mobile conditions, and can keep it up all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"I\u0027m surprised you can counter an instinct so thoroughly. You do counter it; I see that. Still, it surprises me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What instinct?\" demanded Klorissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The instinct of gregariousness. There is one. You say yourself that as children they insist on playing with each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa shrugged. \"Do you call that instinct? But then, what if it is? Skies above, a child has an instinctive fear of falling, but adults can be trained to work in high places even where there is constant danger of falling. Haven\u0027t you ever seen gymnastic exhibitions on high wires? There are some worlds where people live in tall buildings. And children have instinctive fear of loud noises, too, but are you afraid of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not within reason,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m willing to bet that Earth people couldn\u0027t sleep if things were really quiet. Skies above, there isn\u0027t an instinct around that can\u0027t give way to a good, persistent education. Not in human beings, where instincts are weak anyway. In fact, if you go about it right, education gets easier with each generation. It\u0027s a matter of evolution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"How is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you see? Each individual repeats his own evolutionary history as he develops. Those fetuses back there have gills and a tail for a time. Can\u0027t skip those steps. The youngster has to go through the social-animal stage in the same way. But just as a fetus can get through in one month a stage that evolution took a hundred million years to get through, so our children can hurry through the social animal stage. Dr. Delmarre was of the opinion that with the generations, we\u0027d get through that stage faster and faster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In three thousand years, he estimated, at the present rate of progress, we\u0027d have children who\u0027d take to viewing at once. The boss had other notions, too. He was interested in improving robots to the point of making them capable of disciplining children without becoming mentally unstable. Why not? Discipline today for a better life tomorrow is a true expression of First Law if robots could only be made to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have such robots been developed yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa shook her head. \"I\u0027m afraid not. Dr. Delmarre and Leebig had been working hard on some experimental models.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Dr. Delmarre have some of the models sent out to his estate? Was he a good enough roboticist to conduct tests himself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes. He tested robots frequently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know that he had a robot with him when he was murdered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been told so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what kind of a model it was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to ask Leebig. As I told you, he\u0027s the roboticist who worked with Dr. Delmarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know nothing about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think of anything, let me know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. And don\u0027t think new robot models are all that Dr. Delmarre was interested in. Dr. Delmarre used to say the time would come when unfertilized ova would be stored in banks at liquid-air temperatures and utilized for artificial insemination. In that way, eugenic principles could be truly applied and we could get rid of the last vestige of any need for seeing. I\u0027m not sure that I quite go along with him so far, but he was a man of advanced notions; a very good Solarian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe added quickly, \"Do you want to go outside? The five through eight group are encouraged to take part in outdoor play and you could see them in action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said cautiously, \"I\u0027ll try that. I may have to come back inside on rather short notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes, I forgot. Maybe you\u0027d rather not go out at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Baley forced a smile. \"I\u0027m trying to grow accustomed to the outdoors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind was hard to bear. It made breathing difficult. It wasn\u0027t cold, in a direct physical sense, but the feel of it, the feel of his clothes moving against his body, gave Baley a kind of chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth chattered when he tried to talk and he had to force his words out in little bits. It hurt his eyes to look so far at a horizon so hazy green and blue and there was only limited relief when he looked at the pathway immediately before his toes. Above all, he avoided looking up at the empty blue, empty, that is, but for the piled-up white of occasional clouds and the glare of the naked sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet he could fight off the urge to run, to return to enclosure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed a tree, following Klorissa by some ten paces, and he reached out a cautious hand to touch it. It was rough and hard to the touch. Frondy leaves moved and rustled overhead, but he did not raise his eyes to look at them. A living tree!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa called out. \"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can see a group of youngsters from here,\" she said. \"They\u0027re involved in some kind of game. The robots organize the games and see to it that the little animals don\u0027t kick each other\u0027s eyes out. With personal presence you can do just that, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley raised his eyes slowly, running his glance along the cement of the pathway out to the grass and down the slope, farther and farther out - very carefully - ready to snap back to his toes if he grew frightened-feeling with his eyes...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were the small figures of boys and girls racing madly about, uncaring that they raced at the very outer rim of a world with nothing but air and space above them. The glitter of an occasional robot moved nimbly among them. The noise of the children was a far off incoherent squeaking in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They love it,\" said Klorissa. \"Pushing and pulling and squab\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebling and falling down and getting up and just generally contacting. Skies above! How do children ever manage to grow up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are those older children doing?\" asked Baley. He pointed at a group of isolated youngsters standing to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re viewing. They\u0027re not in a state of personal presence. By viewing, they can walk together, talk together, race together, play together. Anything except physical contact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do children go when they leave here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To estates of their own. The number of deaths is, on the average, equal to the number of graduations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To their parents\u0027 estates?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skies above, no! It would be an amazing coincidence, wouldn\u0027t it, to have a parent die just as a child is of age. No, the children take any one that falls vacant. I don\u0027t know that any of them would be particularly happy, anyway, living in a mansion that once belonged to their parents, supposing, of course, they knew who their parents were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrows. \"Why should they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t parents visit their children here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a mind you have. Why should they want to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Do you mind if I clear up a point for myself? Is it bad manners to ask a person if they have had children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an intimate question, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hardened. Children are my business. Other people aren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Have you any children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa\u0027s Adam\u0027s apple made a soft but clearly visible motion in her throat as she swallowed. \"I deserve that, I suppose. And you deserve an answer. I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and I have an estate of my own and I would be there but for the emergency here. I\u0027m just not confident of being able to control all the robots if I\u0027m not here in person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away unhappily, and then pointed. \"Now there\u0027s one of them gone tumbling and of course he\u0027s crying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA robot was running with great space devouring strides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiorissa said, \"He\u0027ll be picked up and cuddled and if there\u0027s any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereal damage, I\u0027ll be called in.\" She added nervously, \"I hope I don\u0027t have to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley took a deep breath. He noted three trees forming a small triangle fifty feet to the left. He walked in that direction, the grass soft and loathsome under his shoes, disgusting in its softness (like walking through corrupting flesh, and he nearly retched at the thought).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was among them, his back against one trunk. It was almost like being surrounded by imperfect walls. The sun was only a wavering series of glitters through the leaves, so disconnected as almost to be robbed of horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa faced him from the path, then slowly shortened the distance by half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mind if I stay here awhile?\" asked Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" said Kiorissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Once the youngsters graduate out of the farm, how do you get them to court one another?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Court?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get to know one another,\" said Baley, vaguely wondering how the thought could be expressed safely, \"so they can marry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not their problem,\" said Klorissa. \"They\u0027re matched by gene analysis, usually when they are quite young. That\u0027s the sensible way, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they always willing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To be married? They never are! It\u0027s a very traumatic process. At first they have to grow accustomed to one another, and a little bit of seeing each day, once the initial queasiness is gone, can do wonders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if they just don\u0027t like their partner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? If the gene analysis indicates a partnership what difference does it - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" said Baley hastily. He thought of Earth and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa said, \"Is there anything else you would like to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley wondered if there were anything to be gained from a longer stay. He would not be sorry to be done with Klorissa and fetal engineering so that he might pass on to the next stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had opened his mouth to say as much, when Klorissa called out at some object far off, \"You, child, you there! What are you doing?\" Then, over her shoulder: \"Earthman! Baley! Watch out! Watch out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley scarcely heard her. He responded to the note of urgency in her voice. The nervous effort that held his emotions taut snapped wide and he flamed into panic. All the terror of the open air and the endless vault of heaven broke in upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley gibbered. He heard himself mouth meaningless sounds and felt himself fall to his knees and slowly roll over to his side as though he were watching the process from a distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso from a distance he heard the sighing hum piercing the air above him and ending with a sharp thwack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley closed his eyes and his fingers clutched a thin tree root that skimmed the surface of the ground and his nails burrowed into dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes (it must only have been moments after). Klorissa was scolding sharply at a youngster who remained at a distance. A robot, silent, stood closer to Klorissa. Baley had only time to notice the youngster held a stringed object in his hand before his eyes sheered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing heavily, Baley struggled to his feet. He stared at the shaft of glistening metal that remained in the trunk of the tree against which he had been standing. He pulled at it and it came out readily. It had not penetrated far. He looked at the point but did not touch it. It was blunted, but it would have sufficed to tear his skin had he not dropped when he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him two tries to get his legs moving. He took a step toward Klorissa and called, \"You. Youngster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa turned, her face flushed. She said, \"It was an accident. Are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! What is this thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an arrow. It is fired by a bow, which makes a taut string do the work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like this,\" called the youngster impudently, and he shot another arrow into the air, then burst out laughing. He had light hair and a lithe body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa said, \"You will be disciplined. Now leave!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, wait,\" cried Baley. He rubbed his knee where a rock had caught and bruised him as he had fallen. \"I have some questions. What is your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bik,\" he said carelessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you shoot that arrow at me, Bik?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" said the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you realize you would have hit me if I hadn\u0027t been warned in time to duck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBik shrugged. \"I was aiming to hit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa spoke hurriedly. \"You must let me explain. Archery is an encouraged sport. It is competitive without requiring contact. We have contests among the boys using viewing only. Now I\u0027m afraid some of the boys will aim at robots. It amuses them and it doesn\u0027t hurt the robots. I\u0027m the only adult human on the estate and when the boy saw you, he must have assumed you were a robot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley listened. His mind was clearing, and the natural dourness of his long face intensified. He said, \"Bik, did you think I was a robot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said the youngster. \"You\u0027re an Earthman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Go now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBik turned and raced off whistling. Baley turned to the robot. \"You! How did the youngster know I was an Earthman, or weren\u0027t you with him when he shot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was with him, master. I told him you were an Earthman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you tell him what an Earthman was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is an Earthman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An inferior sort of human that ought not to be allowed on Solaria because he breeds disease, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who told you that, boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot maintained silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Do you know who told you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not, master. It is in my memory store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you told the boy I was a disease breeding inferior and he immediately shot at me. Why didn\u0027t you stop him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have, master. I would not have allowed harm to come to a human, even an Earthman. He moved too quickly and I was not fast enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you thought I was just an Earthman, not completely a human, and hesitated a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was said with quiet calm, but Baley\u0027s lips quirked grimly. The robot might deny it in all faith, but Baley felt that was exactly the factor involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"What were you doing with the boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was carrying his arrows, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I see them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out his hand. The robot approached and delivered a dozen of them. Baley put the original arrow, the one that had hit the tree, carefully at his feet, and looked the others over one by one. He handed them back and lifted the original arrow again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Why did you give this particular arrow to the boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No reason, master. He had asked for an arrow some time earlier and this was the one my hand touched first. He looked about for a target, then noticed you and asked who the strange human was. I explained - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you explained. This arrow you handed him is the only one with gray vanes at the rear. The others have black vanes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot simply stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Did you guide the youngster here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We walked randomly, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman looked through the gap between two trees through which the arrow had hurled itself toward its mark. He said, \"Would it happen, by any chance, that this youngster, Bik, was the best archer you have here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robot bent his head. \"He is the best, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlorissa gaped. \"How did you ever come to guess that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It follows,\" said Baley dryly. \"Now please observe this gray-vaned arrow and the others. The gray-vaned arrow is the only one that seems oily at the point. I\u0027ll risk melodrama, ma\u0027am, by saying that your warning saved my life. This arrow that missed me is poisoned.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-naked-sun-robot-2/page-12.html","bookId":2430,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:06:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:06:46 PM"}
