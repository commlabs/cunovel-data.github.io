Couldn’t find anything else. Here’s what’s sad, really sad. This guy is good. He doesn’t leave evidence. He leaves the bodies in an exposed place-seriously exposed. They’re posed almost as if he’s fooling around, as if he’s using the most bizarre local story. I talked to one of our police behavioral profilers today. He’s convinced that the killer has to be local and uses the scenarios to prove that he’s local, that this is his place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m hoping we find something soon. Before he strikes again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too,” David said. “Well, thanks for letting me pry. I’ll see you tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katie goes back to work,” Liam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be there. Oh, and Sean got home today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He did?” Liam seemed surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Katie knew he was coming. She didn’t know exactly when,” he said dryly, remembering how Sean O’Hara had come upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t think he was expected for another few weeks,” Liam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong with him being home?” David asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing. I was just thinking that it is all so odd. You’re back. Sam Barnard is here. Mike Sanderson has apparently been coming back for years, and now…Sean O’Hara, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it’s the tides,” David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s odd. That’s all-it’s odd. Hey,” Liam said, changing the subject. “If I don’t hear from you during the day, I’ll see you at O’Hara’s tomorrow night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Fantasy Fest starting up,” David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam nodded, and let his head fall to the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid left then, deciding to walk home and see what was going on. There were throngs on the sidewalks everywhere. Music blared from the clubs. He passed the giant effigy of Robert the Doll. It appeared to be anchored at the feet by a large weight, covered by plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman walked by him, snorting. “It smells almost as bad as Bourbon Street!” she told her companions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did smell, David thought. He paused for a moment. It wasn’t bad booze, it wasn’t vomit. There was something dead somewhere. The Keys weren’t immune to rats, and Lord knew, there were roosters everywhere. He couldn’t pinpoint the odor; there was too much perfume in the air, too much smoke from the fellows hanging outside with cigars, and too much alcohol. Someone had just broken a bottle of bourbon somewhere nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept walking. He was outside O’Hara’s when he suddenly heard shouting. Frowning, even though he knew Katie wasn’t working, he felt his heart pound. He rushed in. Clarinda was there; she had just jumped back from a table because the two men who had been seated at it were now standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fellows, you’re going to have to sit, calm down or take it outside or I will call the police!” Clarinda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men was Mike Sanderson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other was Sam Barnard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” David said with deep authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe busboys were backing up. Jon Merrillo was coming around the bar nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you heard Clarinda,” David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam looked at him, and shook his head sadly. “I’m sorry, but screw this!” he said. And he turned on Mike Sanderson with a wicked right hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid dove in, shouting for Clarinda to call the police. He tackled Sam Barnard down while Mike Sanderson made it back to his feet. Sanderson then tried to punch Barnard, but all he managed to do was fall on the man’s abdomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both drunk as skunks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid dragged Sam from beneath Mike, and by then, uniformed cops were spilling in. They dragged up both men, and assured them both they could discuss it all at the station. Clarinda turned to David, thanking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That might have gotten really ugly,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon had joined her by then. “Oh, man, they’re both huge. They could have really torn this place to pieces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so-they’re drunk. They’d have passed out before they’d gotten too many hits in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, thanks. Can I get you anything on the house?” Jon asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Actually, doesn’t need to be on the house. What didn’t we eat last night? I’ll take three of anything different to go,” David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got it,” Jon told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon headed to the kitchen. He helped Clarinda right the chairs that had fallen. The other customers seemed disappointed that the show was over. They had turned back to their own conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I guess it’s good in a way,” Clarinda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That those two got into a fight. That means that they’ll be locked up for the night, and no one will have to be afraid of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Afraid-of Mike Sanderson or Sam Barnard?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s face it, Mike Sanderson seems a little whacko. He’s spent years-with no one knowing it-dressing up like Robert the Doll. And Barnard…well, he was Tanya’s brother. He might be out for some kind of revenge, or God knows, he’s here, and there’s another murder…who knows? Maybe he secretly hated his sister. Maybe he strangled her in a rage. Stranger, more bizarre things have happened in Key West.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a kiss on the cheek. “I’ve got to get back to work. Thank you, David.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she made a face. “Fantasy Fest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, it can be great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you say-that’s because guys love to see women with nothing but paint on their breasts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ouch!” He grinned at her. “Okay, so women see male chests all the time. Sadly, that means the thrill is gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClarinda laughed. “I repeat-” She made a face. “Fantasy Fest!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to the bar to pay for the food, but Jon wouldn’t let him. He thanked him, took his to-go bags and headed back out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. So many sounds and scents in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderlying it all…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the scent of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knock on the door startled Katie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had left the kitchen to curl up on the sofa, the Beckett family book in her hands. Bartholomew was seated on the curve at her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just Beckett,” Bartholomew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t have to get up to answer the door; Sean got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cool. Dinner. I was thinking I’d have to start cooking, since Katie has had her nose in that book all day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie rose slowly, stretching. She saw David and smiled. “It’s shepherd’s pie from O’Hara’s, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good nose,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Katie has amazing senses,” Sean said dryly. “Set her all down in the dining room. I’ll get plates and utensils.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean did so. Katie met David in the hallway. He reached for her, pulling her close, and kissed her lightly on the lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean made a point of clearing his throat. “If you two don’t mind? I’m not quite accustomed to this yet, if you could show a little restraint.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sean, I hardly attacked the man,” Katie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean ignored her, as David opened the bags on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything at the station?” Sean asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told Liam that Katie thinks Danny is dead. He agrees. But Pete is on a tangent, looking for him, convinced that he’s going to find him, and that he either killed the women, or had something to do with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat and passed around the tossed salad and entrées that David had brought. Sean went to the kitchen for beer, while Katie opted for a bottle of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid wound up with a beer and a glass of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, what’s up here?” David asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I slept most of the day. I’m figuring that by tomorrow, I’ll be functioning again,” Sean said. “And, naturally, tomorrow night, I’ll be hanging out at the old family bar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I read that book all day. David, your family was fascinating. You know, your aunts have kept records in it since the nineteen forties. They were children here during the Elena de Hoyos death and reburial. They remember the Otto family-they’re really fascinating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You read the book all day?” David asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “I’m convinced that… Oh, I don’t even know why. But museums preserve the past. That’s why a murderer might leave a body in a museum, right?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean stared at her. “They have to find the guy this time,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They will,” David said. “Someone will. So what else was in the book?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot was written by Craig Beckett, sea captain, a fellow who arrived in the area along with the first American settlers,” Katie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your family showed up around the same time, right?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “Yes, so we’ve always heard. But we don’t have anything like that great book your aunts have preserved so well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘The truth is out there,’” Sean quoted wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what is going on tomorrow, do you know?” David asked Katie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow, for us, it’s business as usual, with three extra servers. The first of the big pirate parties is happening tomorrow, and one of the bars is also throwing something it’s calling the Vampire Bite. I know that Mallory Square is supposed to be crazy, and that a lot of acts from elsewhere have already been out staking their ground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will be a long day,” David said thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I agree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they finished, Sean yawned. Katie told him to go back to bed. He gave her a kiss, bid David good-night and went up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie was going to pick up, but David stopped her. “I’ll take care of it. You were yawning, too, and you have a really long day tomorrow. Go on up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I insist.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-shadow-bone-island-trilogy-1/page-40.html","bookId":2286,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:16 PM"}
