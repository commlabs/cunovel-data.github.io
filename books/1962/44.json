I’ve probably mentioned him before. His name is Barney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaguely Carol did remember either Alex or James mentioning the man, but she couldn’t remember where or when she’d heard it. “How…long will you be gone?” She hated the way her voice fell, the way it made her need for him all too evident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another week at least.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart catapulted to her feet, then gradually righted itself. “A week?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like it any better than you do. I can’t believe how much I miss you. How much I needed to hear your voice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol felt that, too, only she hadn’t been willing to admit it, even to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a slight commotion on Alex’s end of the line and when it cleared, he said, “I’ll try to call you again, but we’re working day and night and this is the first real break I’ve had in three days. I’m glad I got through to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grip tightened on the receiver. “I’m glad, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go. Bye, Carol. I’ll see you Thursday or so of next week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goodbye, Alex…and thanks for phoning.” She was about to hang up when she realized there was something else she had to say. She cried his name, desperate to catch him before he hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here. What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alex,” she said, sighing with relief. “I’ve…I want you to know I…I’ve missed you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of his chuckle was as warm and melodious as a hundred-voice choir. “It’s not much, but it’s something. Keep next Thursday open for me, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got yourself a date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday evening of the following week, Carol was teaching her birthing class. Ten couples were sprawled on big pillows in front of her as she led them through a series of exercises. She enjoyed this work almost as much as she did her daytime job at the hospital. She and Janice Mandle each taught part of the class, with Carol handling the first half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone’s doing exceptionally well tonight,” Carol said, praising the teams. “Okay, partners, I have a question for you. I want you to tell me, in number of seconds, how long you think a typical labor pain lasts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thirty seconds,” one young man shouted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Longer,” Carol said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sixty seconds,” yelled another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ninety?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t sound too sure about that,” Carol said, smiling. “Let’s stick with ninety seconds. That’s a nice round number, although in the final stages of labor it’s not unusual for a contraction to last much longer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pregnant women eyed each other warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, partners, I want you to show me your biceps. Tighten them as hard as you can. Good. Good,” she said, surveying the room, watching as several of the men brought up their fists until the muscles of their upper arms bulged. “Make it as tight and as painful as you can,” she continued. Most of the men were gritting their teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very good,” she went on to say. “Now, hold that until I tell you to relax.” She walked to the other side of the room. “As far back as 1913, some doctors and midwives recognized that fear and tension could interfere with the birthing process. Even then they believed that deep breathing exercises and relaxation could aid labor.” She paused to glance at her watch. “That’s fifteen seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look of astonishment that crossed the men’s faces was downright comical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep those muscles tightly clenched,” Carol instructed. She strolled around the room, chatting amiably as the men held their arms as tight as possible. Some were already showing the strain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thirty seconds,” she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words were followed by a low groan. Carol couldn’t help smiling. She hated to admit how much she enjoyed their discomfort, but this exercise was an excellent illustration of the realities of labor, especially for the men. The smile remained on her lips as the door in the back of the room opened to admit a latecomer. Carol opened her mouth to welcome the person, but the words didn’t reach her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, framed inside the door, stood Alex Preston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol stared at Alex. Alex stared at Carol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room went completely still; the air felt heavy, and the quiet seemed eerie, unnatural. It wasn’t until Carol realized that several taut faces were gazing up at her anxiously that she pulled her attention away from Alex and back to her class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, where were we?” she asked, flustered and nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ninety seconds,” one of the men shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Right.” She glanced at her watch and nodded. “Ninety seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe relief could be felt all the way across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later Carol dismissed everyone for a fifteen-minute break. Janice strolled over to Carol and eyed the back of the room, where Alex was patiently waiting. He was leaning against the back wall, his ankles crossed and his thumbs hooked in the belt loop of his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s gorgeous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol felt too distracted and tongue-tied to respond, although her thoughts had been traveling along those same lines. Alex was the sexiest man Carol had ever known. Unabashedly wonderful, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s…been out of town,” she said, her eyes magnetically drawn to Alex’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanice draped her arm across Carol’s shoulders. “Since your portion of tonight’s class is finished, why don’t you go ahead and leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t.” Carol tore her eyes from Alex long enough to study her co-teacher. They were a team, and although they’d divided the class into two distinct sections, they stayed and lent each other emotional support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you can. I insist. Only…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only what?” Carol pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only promise me that if another gorgeous guy walks in off the street and looks at me like he’s looking at you, you’ll return the favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” Carol answered automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanice’s voice fell to a whisper. “Good. Then we’ll consider this our little secret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol frowned. “I don’t understand—what do you mean, our little secret?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, if my husband found out about this agreement, there could be problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol laughed. Janice was happily married and had been for fifteen years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I were you I wouldn’t be hanging around here talking,” Janice murmured, giving Carol a small shove. “Don’t keep him waiting any longer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay…thanks.” Feeling unaccountably shy, Carol retrieved her purse and her briefcase and walked toward Alex. With each step that drew her nearer, her heart felt lighter. By the time she made her way to the back of the room, she felt nearly airborne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened, his eyes warm and caressing. “Hello.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peter told me you were teaching tonight and where. I hope you don’t mind that I dropped in unexpectedly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t mind.” Mind? Her heart was soaring with gladness. She could’ve flown without an airplane. No, she didn’t mind that he’d dropped in—not in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the longest moment all they did was gaze at each other like starry-eyed lovers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA noise at the front of the room distracted Carol. She glanced over her shoulder and saw several couples watching them with undisguised curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Janice said she’d finish up here, and I could…should leave now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex grinned, and with that, Carol could feel whole sections of the sturdy wall around her heart start to crumble. This man’s smile was nothing short of lethal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remind me to thank her later,” Alex said. He removed the briefcase from her unresisting fingers and opened the door, letting her precede him outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hadn’t taken two steps out the door when Alex paused. Carol felt his hesitation and stopped, turning to face him. That was when she knew Alex was going to kiss her. It didn’t matter that they were standing in front of a public building. It didn’t matter that it was still light enough for any number of passersby to see them. It didn’t matter that they were both respected professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex scooped her into his arms and with a lavish sigh lowered his head and covered her lips in the sweetest, wildest kiss of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve missed you,” he whispered. “The hours felt like years, the days like decades.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol felt tears in the corners of her eyes. She hadn’t thought about how empty her life had felt without him, how bleak and alone she was with him away. Now it poured out of her in a litany of sighs and kisses. “I…I missed you, too—so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years she’d been content in her own secure world, the one she’d created for herself and her son. The borders had been narrow, confining, but she’d made peace with herself and found serenity. Then she’d met Alex, and he’d forced her to notice how cramped and limited her existence was. Not only that, he’d pointed toward the horizon, to a new land of shared dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alex spoke again, his voice was heavy with need. “Come on, let’s get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and followed him to his car, ready to abandon her own with little more than a second thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unlocked the passenger door, then turned to face her. His eyes were dancing with excitement. “Let’s dispense with formalities and elope. Now. Tonight. This minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words hit her hard. She blinked at the unexpectedness of his suggestion, prepared to laugh it off as a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Alex was serious. He looked as shocked as Carol felt, but she noted that the idea had begun to gain momentum. The mischievous spark in his eyes was gone, replaced by a solemn look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you, Carol. I love you so much that my buddy in Texas practically threw me on the plane and told me to get home before I died of it. He said he’d never seen anyone more lovesick and made me promise we’d name one of our children after him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mention of a child was like a right cross to the jaw after his punch to her solar plexus, and she flinched involuntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex set his hands on her shoulders, and a smile touched his eyes and then his mouth. He smiled so endearingly that all of Carol’s arguments fled like dust in a whirlwind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah…my car’s parked over there.” She pointed in the general vicinity of her Ford. Her throat was so tight she could hardly speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and hugged her. “I know this is sudden for you. I’m a fool not to have done it properly. I swear I’ll do it again over champagne and give you a diamond so large you’ll sink in a swimming pool, but I can’t keep the way I feel inside anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alex…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe silenced her with a swift kiss. “Believe me, blurting out a proposal like this is as much of a surprise to me as it is to you. I had no idea I was going to ask you tonight. The entire flight home I was trying to figure out how I could make it as romantic as possible. The last thing I expected to do was impulsively shout it out in a parking lot. But something happened tonight.” He reached for her limp hands and brought them to his lips, then kissed her knuckles with reverence. “When I walked into your class and saw you with all those pregnant women, I was hit with the most powerful shock of my life.” His voice grew quiet. “All of a sudden, my mind conjured up the image of you pregnant with our child, and I swear it was all I could do not to break down and weep.” He paused long enough to run his fingers through his hair. “Children, Carol…our children.” He closed his eyes and sighed deeply. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/right-next-door/page-44.html","bookId":1962,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:09 AM"}
