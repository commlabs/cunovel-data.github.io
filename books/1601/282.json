Why do you mourn, Elayne? I have it all back! My memory has returned\". She laughed. \"It is wonderful! I don’t know how you stood me these last few weeks. I moped worse than a child who’d just broken her favorite bow\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . Oh, Light\". Elayne’s insides told her she’d still lost her Warder, and the pain of the bond breaking was not a rational thing. It didn’t matter that Birgitte stood before her. \"Perhaps I should bond you again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would not work\", Birgitte said, waving her hand with a dismissive gesture. \"Are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing but my pride\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky for you, but luckier that the Horn was blown when it was\". Elayne nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m going to join the other heroes\", Birgitte said. \"You stay here and recover\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Light burn that!\" Elayne said, forcing herself to her feet. \"I’m not bloody staying behind now. The babes are all right. I’m riding\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elayne—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My soldiers think I’m dead\", Elayne said. \"Our lines are breaking, our men dying. They have to see me to know that there is still hope. They won’t know what this mist means. If they have ever needed their queen, this is the moment. Nothing short of the Dark One could stop me from returning now\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirgitte frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’re not my Warder any longer\", Elayne said. \"But you’re still my friend. Will you ride with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stubborn fool\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m not the one who just refused to stay dead. Together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Together\", Birgitte said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha pulled up short, listening to new howls. Those didn’t sound quite like wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tempest at Shayol Ghul continued. She didn’t know which side was winning. Everywhere lay bodies, some ripped apart by wolves, others still smoldering from attacks of the One Power. The storm winds whipped and raged, though no rain fell, and waves of dust and gravel washed across her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel channeling from the Pit of Doom, but it was like a quiet pulse, as opposed to the storm that had been the cleansing. Rand. Was he all right? What was happening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white clouds brought in by the Windfinders churned among the jet black storm clouds above, swirling together in a massive, writhing pattern above the mountain peak. From what she’d heard of the Windfinders—they had withdrawn up Shayol Ghul to a ledge far above the cave entrance, still working the Bowl of Winds—they were at a breaking point. More than two thirds of their numbers had collapsed from exhaustion. Soon, the storm would consume everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha prowled through the maelstrom, seeking the source of those howls. She didn’t have any other channelers with whom to link, now that Rafela had left to join the Dragonsworn’s last stand at the cavern. Out here, in the valley, different groups killed one another, shifting back and forth. Maidens, Wise Ones, siswai’aman, Trollocs, Fades. And wolves; hundreds of them had joined the battle so far. There were also some Domani, Tairens and Dragonsworn—though most of those fought near the path up to Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething hit the ground beside her, crooning, and she lashed out before thinking. The Draghkar burst into flames like a stick dried by a hundred days of sunlight. She took a deep breath, looking around her. Howls. Hundreds upon hundreds of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke into a run toward those howls, crossing the valley floor. As she did so, someone emerged from the dusty shadows, a wiry man with a gray beard and golden eyes. He was accompanied by a small pack of wolves. They glanced at her, then turned back in the direction they’d been going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha stopped. Golden eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ho, he who runs with wolves!\" she called at the man. \"Have you brought Perrin Aybara with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man froze. He acted like a wolf, careful yet dangerous. \"I know of Perrin Aybara\", he called back, \"but he is not with me. He hunts in another place\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha walked closer to the man. He watched her, wary, and several of his wolves growled. It did not seem they trusted her or her kind much more than they trusted Trollocs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These new howls\", she called over the wind, \"they are from your . . . friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\", the man said, eyes growing distant. \"No, not any longer. If you know of women who can channel, Aiel, you should bring them now\". He moved off toward the sounds, his pack running with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha followed him, keeping her distance from those wolves, but trusting their senses above her own. They reached a small rise in the floor of the valley, one that she’d seen Ituralde use on occasion for overseeing the defense of the pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePouring out of the pass were scores of dark shapes. Black wolves, the size of small horses. They loped across the rock, and though they were out of her sight, Aviendha knew they were leaving footprints melted into the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds of wolves attacked the darker shapes, leaping on their backs, but were thrown free. They didn’t seem to be doing much good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the wolves growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darkhounds?\" Aviendha shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\", he called back, bellowing to be heard over the tempest. \"This is the Wild Hunt, the worst of their kind. These cannot fall to mortal weapons. The bites of common wolves will not harm them, not permanently\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do they fight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolfbrother laughed. \"Why do any of us fight? Because we must try to win somehow! Go! Bring Aes Sedai, some of those Asha’man if you can find them! These creatures will roll over your armies as easily as a wave over pebbles!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man took off down the slope, his wolves joining him. She understood why they fought. They might not be able to kill the Darkhounds, but they could slow the creatures. And that was their victory here—buying Rand enough time to do what he needed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, alarmed, running to gather the others. The sensation of a powerful channeler wielding saidar nearby stopped her dead. She spun, looking toward the source of the sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraendal was there, up ahead—just barely visible. She calmly sent deadly weaves at a line of Defenders of the Stone. She had collected a small group of women—Aes Sedai, Wise Ones—and a few guards. The women knelt around her, and had to be feeding her their power, considering the strength of \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-282.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
