Only he would make a gesture like that. Only I would be stupid enough to not go. I kissed him once more, savoring the feel of the playoffs beard and the softness of his lips. My tears crept into our kiss. I sobbed as I left the room. Leaving him for good. I heard him say something but I didn’t wait for the elevator. I pulled my shoes off and ran down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got to the door to the main floor, I put them back on and wiped my face. I took a deep breath and walked out into the lobby. My father saw me, stood and walked from the hotel. Phil gave me a look of remorse. I walked past him and out of the hotel after my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least at home I had more of the little blue pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is your ring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at my mother, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your engagement ring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my hand, \"The Atlantic Ocean.\" I almost laughed when I said it but the blue pill was working. I was almost the woman I had been the week before. The woman my mother was and had been for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled the fake fucking smile I detested, \"Darling, we can\u0027t go throwing forty-thousand-dollar rings into the ocean. What if some poverty-stricken person comes upon it? They\u0027ll pawn it or worse, keep it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted, \"I hope they do find it and pawn it and get a lot of drugs, food, or booze. I hope it means something to someone someday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe maintained the forced smile until Diane stormed in. Mom stood, \"Oh thank God, Diane. How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave my mother a look, \"Leave us please, Mrs. Croix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother ignored the rude tone coming from Diane and took her chance to leave me with someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane did the thing I couldn’t possibly imagine her doing. She walked to me, dropping to her knees and grabbed my hands, \"Run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down on her face. I saw it. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, \"You can\u0027t marry him. Run away and never come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"My dad said he\u0027ll end Mike\u0027s career. I don’t think he has the power, but I bet Phil\u0027s dad does. I have to go through with this for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’re an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Duly noted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, \"Trust me, don\u0027t do this. You are slowly going to die inside and end up sleeping with random bartenders like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced, \"Hottie from Sunday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and sniffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, \"J.D., you do what you have to do to get through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want that. I didn’t want to get through. I didn’t want my life to be about surviving it. I didn’t want to take another blue pill. I never even thought about them with Mike. There in the house, I was almost chopping them up and snorting them in the bathroom. I grabbed one and slipped it between my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sister Brandi came in with a glass of champagne for the three of us. I took mine and swallowed the jagged little pill that made me ‘me’ again. Not the me I wanted to be, but the me I had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi was beaming, \"Did you at least fuck his brains out? Mike France is the hottest piece of ass in the NHL. Tell me you got yourself enough to get you through, with the gift I got you for your bridal shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks blushed before I could say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you did, good girl.\" She shot the champagne down her throat and shuddered, \"How are we doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave Brandi a nervous look. Brandi nodded at her and scowled at me, \"We need to get you the fuck out of here. Dad is a tyrant and the fact he sold you into this bullshit wedding is like some third-world-country craziness. Like did he get cattle for you? No. He got a country club invitation from the blue bloods. Fuck them all.\" She looked at Diane, \"Except you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane snorted, \"My family is the worst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I can\u0027t. They\u0027ll get Mike fired or arrested for drugs, or frame him for something. I was warned. I need a bigger fish than Dad to protect Mike.\" A light came on in my mind. I looked up at my sister, \"Can you stall them? I need to go see Muriel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked an eyebrow, \"Are you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, \"Fine, slip back into charity bitch and drug ho role.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"No, not for that. Just trust me, and cover for me.\" I got up and ran to the back stairs and across the grass. I ran to our backyard neighbor\u0027s house and down the block. I stood on the side of the road and pulled out the new cell phone Phil had gotten me and dialed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get a cab at the corner of Mohawk and Westview in Short Hills?\" I hung up and stood there, waiting and wondering if it would work at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that night when I got back from Muriel\u0027s house, I had a slight pep in my step when I walked into the house. My plan was playing out. Phil walked out of the office, looking exhausted. He glared at me, \"Where were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneered, \"Why? Are you going to beat me if you don’t like the answer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. I could see the regret all over his face. I didn’t care. He could regret all he wanted. He had hit me and that was where I drew the line. I would never let him near me again. He took a step towards me, \"I told you, I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and walked past him to the kitchen. I pulled out a bottle of Chianti from the Italian wine tasting I had been to. I poured it into the decanter and swirled it around. Phil sauntered in after me, leaning against the counter, \"What\u0027s it going to take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up, \"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you to forgive me? What do you need? I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027d do anything to take back the last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, \"It\u0027s only been a week, it\u0027s still pretty fresh. Check back in a decade and see how I am. Say hi to Ashley too. Tell her to ask her mom if we are still on for yoga and let her keep those other heels. I don’t need two pairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clenched his jaw. His blue eyes grew cold, \"You will be a good wife. Do you want our life to be like this? Do you want me to force your devotion to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poured my first glass, \"I wanted it from the start. I never knew I was competing against seniors in high school for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands clenched. I winced, remembering the feel of his hand across my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed at me, \"Your father has Doctor Michaels coming tomorrow. I think he\u0027ll remedy everything for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a sickening twist of a knife in my guts. I didn’t make a move, beyond lifting the glass to my face and smelling the Chianti. Phil patted his hand on the counter, \"See you in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"No thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stormed across the kitchen. I put my glass down and backed away. He grabbed my wrist, pushing me against the fridge, \"We can make this work, Jacqueline. You just have to try to. You have to choose to love me, instead of him. Give me the fair chance to win your heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved him back, \"With this? With anger and rage and cheating and getting my father to drug me? That’s what you think wins me over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped to his knees, \"I don’t know how to love you. I know I don’t deserve you, but I want to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a weird moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my arms around his head and buried his face in my ribs so he couldn’t see the face I was making. It had to be part horror and part disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at me, \"Tell me what to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, meeting his blue gaze head on, \"I don’t know. We pushed it so far, I don’t think we can fix it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"Neither of us comes from failures. We are both bred to be successful and strong. We can do this. Promise me you\u0027ll try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I will.\" It was a lie, but I wanted to sleep without the worry of sleep assault. \"I think we should spend the next two weeks just figuring ourselves out. Sleep separate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up and looked down on me, tilting my chin up, \"I will do anything to win you back,\" he smiled, \"Or win you for the first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and let him walk out of the kitchen. I trembled a little when I lifted the wine to my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow couldn’t come fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat at the makeup table and let my mother ramble on as I dressed for the day. She had been coming over and acting like she gave a rat\u0027s ass about me since I had come back. Two days of hell, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dusted the powder over my face and looked at the faded mark on my cheek. Makeup covered it completely, but the fear of him hitting me again, was always going to be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you see why it\u0027s important to marry well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her in the mirror and smiled the same fake-ass smile she always gave me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and left the room, \"Excellent. We\u0027ll be downstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went and sat on the couch on the far side of my bedroom and waited for Dr. Michaels. He was my father\u0027s solution to everything, from my sister\u0027s morning-after pill to the mental health of the women in our family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, after a few moments he walked in, looking old and creepy as always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you, Jacqueline?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and pointed to the other couch, \"Excellent. How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"Well enough. So let\u0027s talk about the issues you\u0027ve been having.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I am not having any I am aware of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied my face, scrutinizing. After a moment he smiled, patronizingly. \"Are you still taking the medication I prescribed you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you still feel the same anxiety you were before or is it helping?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"It\u0027s helping. What has my father told you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, \"Nothing much. Just that you were under the weather, a little depressed maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my hands in my lap, \"My father is forcing me to marry someone I don’t want to. My fiancé is having affairs with young girls. And even with all of that, I am not depressed. I think that earns me some sort of medal, don’t you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-16.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
