I won\u0027t be long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be in there in two minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That only gives me time to get out of this dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds perfect to me.\" I love teasing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You\u0027ll come in when I tell you I\u0027m ready, and not a minute before.\" She grins before she leans forward and gives me a quick kiss. \"You\u0027re cute when you pout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stick my head inside the door before she closes it. \"Hurry. I\u0027m anxious to make you my wife in all ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hand on my chest and pushes me back. \"Hold your horses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t help it. My horse is trying to get out of the barn. He wants to play with your mare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches down and runs her hand over the crotch of my pants. \"Down, boy!\" That doesn\u0027t encourage him to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step back inside and reach around to smack her on the ass. \"He\u0027s a bad listener, so hurry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost has the door closed when I remember we didn\u0027t make a plan for how I\u0027ll know she\u0027s ready. \"Hey! How will I know when you want me to come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call out for you when I\u0027m ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat plan has all kinds of holes in it. \"What if I don\u0027t hear you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you need to make a plan B? Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I can\u0027t calmly sit here unless I know I\u0027m getting in when it\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. \"Good grief. I\u0027ll open the door if you don\u0027t hear me. I won\u0027t let you sit out here in the cabin by yourself for ten hours if you don\u0027t come when I call for you. Promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slap my palm on the door and growl, \"Hurry. Please,\" as she slides the door closed. I can\u0027t help it. I\u0027ve never been more ready to have her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute passes and it feels like an eternity. I\u0027m watching the time on my phone and I swear the numbers have never moved so slowly. We\u0027re at twelve minutes and I\u0027m restless, so I get up and walk the cabin because I know she\u0027ll call for me any minute now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourteen going on fifteen minutes in, and I finally hear her voice. \"Mr. McLachlan…Come and get me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck! That took long enough, but I know she\u0027ll make it worth my wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slide the door open and she\u0027s stretched across the bed on her side. She\u0027s wearing white bridal lingerie—satin and lace cups conceal her breasts and sheer fabric veils her stomach, but I can still see her next-to-nothing knickers beneath. She rises to her knees and spins around to show me the back—a thong with a large satin bow sitting at the top. She swishes her bottom back and forth, causing the ties of the bow to swing, and looks over her shoulder at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck, no! I love!\" I lock the door behind me and cross the room toward the bed. She turns around and meets me at the edge. I hold her face in my hands and kiss her slowly and gently because I\u0027m about to do something I\u0027ve never done before—make love to my wife. \"You are the most beautiful woman I\u0027ve ever seen. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m lucky enough to call you mine, Mrs. McLachlan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love hearing you call me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, because you\u0027re going to hear it a lot.\" I kiss the side of her face. \"I\u0027m going to say it every day.\" I move toward her neck. \"And you\u0027re going to hear it every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI examine the tie between her breasts. \"What happens if I give this a little tug?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Maybe you should see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grasp the satin between my fingers and pull until the bow is untied and the front of her lingerie falls open. \"Oops. I just made my wife\u0027s clothes fall off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and you thought it\u0027d take tequila to do that,\" she laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mrs. McLachlan. I was never under the impression that tequila was needed for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hands on her hips. \"Are you saying I\u0027m easy?\" she laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m saying you\u0027re always my sure thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push the straps from her shoulders and the barely there top falls to the bed. I cradle her breasts in my hands and rub her nipples with my thumbs. \"I wanted to do this so bad today when I saw the way these looked in your wedding dress. It was torture to not touch you. And then the reception in the wine cave…all I could do was think about hoisting you up on the table and diving head first under your dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubs her thumb over my bottom lip. \"You and that mouth of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You love the things that come out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lower my mouth and take her nipple in between my teeth and run my tongue over the tip. \"Yes, but I like when things go in it and against it too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her a hard suck and break the suction with a loud pop. \"Mrs. McLachlan. You\u0027re a feisty one tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe begins with the top button of my shirt and works her way down. \"You haven\u0027t seen feisty yet. But you\u0027re about to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm…As much as I love your feisty side, I was hoping our first time as husband and wife might be something a little slower. And sweeter. We\u0027ve done almost everything in the book, and I want tonight to be different. I want to make love to my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slows her fingers at work on my buttons. \"Anything you want.\" When she unfastens the last one, she pushes my shirt from my shoulders onto the floor. She puts her palms on my chest and rubs them over my nipples, hardening them. \"You\u0027re beautiful. I hope our babies look like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I hope they look like their mother with her golden-brown eyes.\" I pull her close and press my forehead to hers. \"I mean every word of my vows. Everything I\u0027ve been, I am, or will ever be, I surrender it all to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re surrendering your all to me, and I can\u0027t think of anything more beautiful than that. I once thought of you as my beauty from pain—when I thought I\u0027d never see you again—but you\u0027re something entirely different. You\u0027re my beauty from surrender because that\u0027s what you\u0027re doing—relinquishing the person you once were to give yourself to me wholeheartedly. And I love you so much for it. I couldn\u0027t think of a better gift to give your bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss her mouth slowly. It\u0027s true; I am a different man because of how much I love this woman. She\u0027s my everything and that\u0027s what I plan to give her—everything her heart desires. All she has to do is want something and it will become hers. I have so many wonderful things planned for our future together, and this is only the beginning—today is the start of our happily ever after. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-50.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
