Cam was standing with Meredith who was holding Cam’s hand by the fingers admiring the diamond Leo had slid on earlier that night when he’d asked her to marry him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason they were late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lingerie parties, darlin’,” I heard Leo whisper in my ear, I smiled and turned to face him. “You promised,” he finished when he caught my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed his hand and whispered back, “You happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is, so, yeah,” Leo answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a great freaking answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Love you, babe,” I told him softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lingerie,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gotcha,” I whispered on a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gwen, can I have a moment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo and I both twisted our necks and tipped our heads back to see Troy standing there, his face set, looking unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, squeezed Leo’s hand again and then stood. Troy moved in putting his hand to the small of my back and leading me out of the room. I searched for Hawk as I went so he’d know where I was going and who I was with but I couldn’t find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made it to a hallway and I turned to Troy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Troy, I –”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just wait a second, Gwen, would you?” he asked tersely and I wondered what was on his mind and why he seemed in such a foul mood. Though it wasn’t hard to guess. Hawk was not shy with public displays of affection and this was coupled with him being an alpha male which meant PDA was liberally mixed with possessive branding moves such as curling his arm around the back of my chair while we were seated or running his hand over my ass when he saw a man’s eyes on that ass, shit like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit that I’d noticed, as the night wore on, Troy didn’t like much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turned a corner and both of us stopped dead on the carpet when we saw Hawk, his back to us, about eight feet down the hall. There was one female hand at his bent head, one arm tight around his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in a silent, searing breath and felt my head reel as Troy’s arm curled around my waist and held tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe a nanosecond later Hawk moved, the woman’s arms disappeared and it hit me that he’d set her away and he’d done it roughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the f**k?” he clipped, his voice so harsh, it was acid and it was a wonder the wallpaper didn’t melt off the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I –” a woman replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You told me you wanted to talk about my woman and your man,” Hawk went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I –” she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk cut her off again. “Jesus, f**k, what’s the matter with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I –” she tried yet again and failed yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me one good reason not to go back into that room and tell your man you put your hands and your f**kin’ mouth on me,” Hawk demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He won’t believe you,” she got out and my body froze solid as Troy’s did the same at my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat voice was Troy’s whiney, annoying, grasping girlfriend, Hanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right,” Hawk replied. “He won’t, which, I gotta tell you, woman, sucks because he’s a good man and he could do a lot f**kin’ better than you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to end this for Troy and I had to do it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cabe, honey,” I called and Hawk’s body jerked around to face us. I saw his eyes were narrow, his jaw hard and his gaze slid over me to Troy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna was staring at Troy, her eyes huge, face pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Troy,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you have money for a cab,” Troy replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh…” She took a step forward but I moved into Troy, turning into his side, my arms going around his middle and I pulled him a step back so she stopped. “Troy, it isn’t what –” she tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy interrupted. “Stop, Hanna, it was. Don’t add being a f**king liar to being a f**king slut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna winced. I gave Troy a squeeze. Hawk studied Troy and when no one said anything further, his head turned to Hanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that’s your cue to get the f**k outta here,” he prompted, she looked up at him, her pale face got whiter and she nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she scurried toward Troy and me as I glared sharp, lethal daggers at her, none of which, unfortunately, formed and drew blood. She skirted us because neither Troy nor I moved and she hustled around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk approached, his eyes on Troy and he stopped in front of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he looked down at me and asked softly, “You got this, baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded up at him. He lifted his chin, glanced at Troy and then walked around us on my side, his hand sliding along my hip as he did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee. Total alpha male possessive branding moves even when no one was around to see them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Hawk disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved into Troy’s front, not letting him go and looked into his stony face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do we need beer, tequila or a trip to the firing range?” I asked quietly and Troy’s arm around my waist gave a reflexive squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit, Gwen,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my cheek to his shoulder and held on tighter. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-man-dream-man-1/page-104.html","bookId":1850,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM"}
