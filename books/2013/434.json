Furthermore, I did not hear you knock, yet another sign of your growing insolence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The mob will attack again,’ Tanal said, eyes flicking to Tehol. ‘Before dawn. I thought it best to inform you of our weakened defences. We have but fourteen agents remaining still able to defend us. This time, I fear, they will break through.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fame is murderous,’ Tehol Beddict said through split lips. ‘I hesitate in recommending it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad continued glaring at Tanal for a moment longer, then he said, ‘In the hidden room-yes, you know of it, I’m aware, so I need not provide any more details-in the hidden room, then, Tanal, you will find a large chest filled with coins. Stacked beside it are a few hundred small cloth bags. Gather the wounded and have them fill sacks with coins. Then deliver them to the agents at the walls. They will be their weapons tonight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That could turn on you,’ Tehol observed, beating Tanal Yathvanar to the thought, ‘if they conclude there’s more still inside.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They’ll be too busy fighting each other to conclude anything,’ Karos said dismissively. ‘Now, Tanal, if there is nothing else, go back to your sweet victim, who will no doubt plead desperately for your sordid attention.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanal licked his lips. Was it time? Was he ready?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he saw, in the Invigilator’s eyes, an absolute awareness, chilling Tanal’s bones. He read my mind. He knows my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanal quickly saluted, then hurried from the room. How can 1 defeat such a man? He is ever ten steps ahead of me. Perhaps 1 should wait, until the troubles have passed, then make my move when he relaxes, when he feels most secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had gone to Invictad’s office to confirm that the man remained alone with his puzzle. Whereupon he had planned to head down to the cells and collect Tehol Beddict. Bound, gagged and hooded, up and out into the compound. To appease the mob, to see them away and so save his own life. Instead, the Invigilator had Tehol in his very office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor what? A conversation? An extended gloat? Oh, each time 1 think I know that man…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found an agent and quickly conveyed Invictad’s instruction, as well as directions to the once-hidden room. Then he continued on, only faintly aware of the irony in following the Invigilator’s orders to the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnto a lower level, down another corridor, this one thicker with dust than most of the others, barring where his own boots had scraped an eager path. To the door, where he drew a key and unlocked the latch. Stepping inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I knew you’d be lonely,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lantern’s wick had almost burned down and he went over to the table where it sat. ‘Thirsty? I’m sure you are.’ He glanced over his shoulder and saw her watching him, saw the desire in her eyes. ‘There’s more trouble in the city, Janath. But I will protect you. I will always protect you. You are safe. You do understand that, yes? For ever safe.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, and he saw her spread her legs wider on the bed, then invite him with a thrust of her pelvis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Tanal Yathvanar smiled. He had his perfect woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad regarded Tehol Beddict from above steepled fingers. ‘Very close,’ he said after a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol, who had been staring dazedly at the puzzle box on the desk, stirred slightly then looked up with his mismatched eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very close,’ Karos repeated. ‘The measure of your intelligence, compared with mine. You are, I believe, the closest to my equal of any man I have met.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Really? Thank you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I normally do not express my admiration for intelligence in others. Primarily because I am surrounded by idiots and fools-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Even idiots and fools need supreme leaders,’ Tehol cut in, then smiled, then winced as cuts opened on his lips, then smiled more broadly than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Attempts at humour, alas,’ Karos said with a sigh, ‘poorly disguise the deficiencies of one’s intelligence. Perhaps that alone is what distinguishes the two of us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol’s smile faded and suddenly he looked dismayed. ‘You never attempt humour, Invigilator?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The mind is capable of playing countless games, Tehol Beddict. Some are useful. Others are worthless, a waste of time. Humour is a prime example of the latter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Funny.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Excuse me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, sorry, I was just thinking. Funny.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What is?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You wouldn’t get it, alas.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You actually imagine yourself brighter than me?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-434.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
