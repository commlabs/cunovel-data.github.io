{"id":58297,"no":576,"title":"Vol 19 Chapter 6-1","content":"\u003cp\u003eThis world was an authoritarian world. The fact never changed throughout time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe always screamed for the common good, for justice. Yet, the truth differed. The world remained an authoritarian state in the twenty first century. This kind of things would never change as long as humans were still humans. No matter which era, no matter which civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said, the two questions are whether we have the power to rival God Has 1 and how should we gather the other parts of the Buddha.” Zheng said. “If the Buddha is split into multiple parts, we have to verify how many parts, find out which parties obtained them, and obtained these parts all within seven days. Jonathan said he left the tomb three months ago. Other parties might have entered the tomb during this time. Plus, the Yellow Turbans were chasing him so the tomb could be danger free. Other parties would definitely snatch the rest of the Buddha upon entering the tomb. It possessed an anti-gravity nature after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng twirled his hair and exhaled. “We will split into two groups from now on. The Yellow Turbans only grow stronger with time. So I will stay with the Buddha. Jonathan, Imhotep, Anck-Su-Namun, TengYi, LiuYu, and YanWei go with me to the tomb. The rest stay here on standby. Once we verified the Buddha was split, you have to figure out a way to obtain the other parts. What do you think, Xuan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanWei immediately said, “No. I want to go to the other team!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng frowned. He knew of the conflict between Heng and the woman. It was Heng’s fault and no one had the right to become involved. However, the situation was dire when a team wipe was on the line. He couldn’t let YanWei and Heng stay in the same group. The only danger the first group would face was the Yellow Turbans. Zheng assigned those without power to this group in order to protect them and not weight down the other group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng thought over it for a second and said, “We are in a bonus mission. Don’t drag your personal feelings to the mission. Everyone’s life depends on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanWei returned with a cold laugh. “I don’t want to live anyway. Why should I care about other people’s lives? You can either kill me here or let me go with the other group.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng was frightened from her words. He held her from behind and said in a panic while she struggled. “She’s just blinded by anger. I can guarantee she won’t do anything. Trust me, she won’t cause any trouble for the team, Zheng, Xuan. She doesn’t have the power to cause any troubles. So don’t think of her as a potential issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng looked to Xuan then said to Heng, “Don’t be stupid. I won’t doubt you. I know her situation so you will decide where she goes. You should know the danger that accompanies the respective group.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng hesitated seeing Zheng was accommodating. He could see which group was more dangerous after all this time. Zheng’s group had near zero danger due to him and Imhotep. The second group might have to split up again which further increased their danger level. He actually wished for YanWei to be in the first group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanWei said, “I know you too well. You want me to stay in group one using my safety as the excuse. I don’t even care for my life anymore. What else should I care?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng sighed. He was afraid of YanWei doing something stupid to threaten the team. Zheng would overlook it because of him but Xuan on the other hand…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then… let her come with group two. I will protect her. We won’t weight the team down even at the cost of our lives!” Heng said aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng also sighed. He walked over and patted Heng’s shoulder. “I only fear that you won’t tell us your difficulties even when your life is on the line. Who do you think we are? People that will kill their comrades to get rid of potential troubles? I will leave it for you to decide. Just keep in mind that… team China will not abandon any comrades.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng gave Zheng a grateful look then turned to Xuan. Xuan’s attitude was more worrying than Zheng’s. Heng truly feared that YanWei would accidentally die in this movie under some scheme. He would be forever drown in torment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan handed the map to Zheng then took out several silver plates. “These things can receive signals in a large radius. The plates consume psyche energy to communicate. However, energy consumption for us is five times the normal rate. I stored enough energy for a month’s use. Don’t use it unless it’s something important. We will need one for each person in group two so group one only gets two pieces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan paused as he looked over the team. “That’s basically our situation. You will also take care of the sleeping members. And this…” He took out a pair of glasses that looked the same as the pair he was wearing. They lenses also had no corrections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng received the glasses and asked, “Do you want me to wear these glasses? What for? Or do you want them to become team China’s symbol?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng shivered at the image of everyone in the team wearing the same glasses, staring at each other with emotionless faces, and spitting out logical words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan obviously had no idea what Zheng was thinking and continued. “It’s not for you. When you feel safe enough, put these glasses on YinKong and attach these two electrodes to your temple. That’s basically it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean by basically it!?” Zheng shouted at him. “There’s definitely a trap! Don’t ever think I won’t speak out because of your emotionless face. I have said it time and time again to let me know of any schemes before hand. Don’t make me look like an idiot after the fact every time. I am speaking to you! Turn your head around!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan had turned to the rest of the team already. “We are in group two from now on. The safety of the Buddha head, the sleeping members, and the tomb after obtaining the rest of the Buddha are not our concern. What you need to do is follow my orders. Even if I tell you to die, you must die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Why does this warning feel like… he will actually make us kill ourselves if he had to be done?) Was written on everyone’s face, aside from Zero. Though no one dared to speak out. Heng only wished to sink to the background in silence in case Xuan still held anything against YanWei. He did not want to draw Xuan’s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now… let\u0027s head back to Shanghai.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-5-05\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-6-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-6-01","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
