His face, his posture, his voice...it was like he was a different man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was grateful when my smartphone battery died and the screen abruptly winked off. Gideon wrapped his arms around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yuck,\" I whispered, snuggling carefully into him so I didn\u0027t get makeup on his lapel. \"Majorly creepy. I feel bad for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled harshly. \"That\u0027s Christopher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asshole. That smug look on his face - Ugh.\" I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing his lips to my hair, he murmured, \"I thought Maggie would be safe from him. Our mothers have known each other for years. I forget how much he hates me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered briefly if the nightmares Gideon had were related to Christopher, then I put the thought aside. No way. Gideon was older by several years and tougher all the way around. He\u0027d kick Christopher\u0027s ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thinks I got all the attention when we were younger,\" Gideon said wearily, \"because everyone was worried about how I was handling my father\u0027s suicide. So he wants what\u0027s mine. Everything he can get his hands on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned into him, pushing my arms underneath his jacket to get closer. There was something in his voice that made me hurt for him. His family home was a place he said haunted his nightmares and he was terribly distant from his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d never been loved. It was as simple - and as complicated - as that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gideon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled back to look at him. Reaching up, I traced the bold arch of his brow. \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA violent shudder moved through him, one hard enough to shake me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean to freak you out,\" I reassured him quickly, averting my face to give him some privacy. \"You don\u0027t have to do anything about it. I just didn\u0027t want another minute to go by without you knowing how I feel. You can tuck it away now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his hands gripped my nape, the other dug almost painfully into my waist. Gideon held me there, immobile, locked against him as if I might blow away. His breathing was ragged, his heartbeat pounding. He didn\u0027t say another word the rest of the ride to work, but he didn\u0027t let me go either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI planned on telling him again one day in the future, but as far as first times went, I thought we\u0027d both done okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt ten o\u0027clock sharp, I had two dozen long-stemmed red roses delivered to Gideon\u0027s office with the note: In celebration of red dresses and limo rides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, I received an interoffice envelope with a note card that read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s do that again. Soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt eleven o\u0027clock, I had a black-and-white calla lily arrangement delivered to his office with the note: In honor of black \u0026amp; white garden party dresses and being dragged into libraries...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, I received his reply:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be dragging you to the floor in a minute...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt noon, I went shopping. Ring shopping. I hit six different shops before I found a piece that struck me as being absolutely perfect. Made of platinum engraved and studded with black diamonds, it was an industrial-looking ring that made me think of power and bondage. It was a dominant ring, very bold and masculine. I had to open a new charge account with the store to cover the hefty cost, but I considered the months of payments ahead of me worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Gideon\u0027s office and talked with Scott, who helped me arrange a fifteen-minute window in Gideon\u0027s packed day for me to stop by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you so much for your help, Scott.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very welcome. I\u0027ve enjoyed watching him receive your flowers today. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen him smile like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warm rush of love flowed through me. I wanted to make Gideon happy. As he\u0027d said, I lived for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to work with a smile of my own. At two o\u0027clock, I had a tiger lily arrangement delivered to Gideon\u0027s office followed by a private note sent via interoffice envelope:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn gratitude for all the jungle sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis reply:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkip the Krav Maga. I\u0027ll give you a workout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen three forty rolled around - five minutes before my appointment with Gideon - I got nervous. I stood up from my chair on shaky legs and paced in the elevator on the way up to his floor. Now that the time had come to give him my gift, I worried that maybe he didn\u0027t like rings...after all, he didn\u0027t wear any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it too presumptuous and possessive of me to want him to wear one just because I did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe redheaded receptionist didn\u0027t give me any trouble getting in and when Scott spotted me emerging from the hallway, he stood from his desk and greeted me with a wide grin. When I stepped into Gideon\u0027s office, Scott closed the door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was immediately struck by the lovely fragrance of the flowers and the way they warmed the starkly modern office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon looked up from his monitor, his brows lifting when he saw me. He pushed fluidly to his feet. \"Eva. Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him shift gears from professional to personal, his gaze softening as he looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027s just...\" I took a deep breath and went to him. \"I have something for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More? Did I forget a special occasion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the ring box down in the center of his desk. Then I turned away, feeling queasy. I seriously doubted the wisdom of my impetuous gift. It seemed like a stupid idea now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could I say to absolve him of guilt for not wanting it? As if it wasn\u0027t bad enough I\u0027d dropped the \"L\" bomb on him today; then I had to follow it up with a damned ring. He was probably feeling the ball and chain already, dragging after him as he ran. And the noose tightening -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the ring box snap open and Gideon\u0027s sharply drawn breath. \"Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was dark and dangerous. I turned carefully, wincing at the austerity of his features and the starkness of his gaze. His hands were white-knuckled on the box. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-78.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
