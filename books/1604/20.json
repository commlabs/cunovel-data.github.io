I want to switch hands or just drag mine up and down my pants for a second but I don’t. I wrap my hand around the small hand. I won\u0027t look away. I won\u0027t let it suffer and cry while I hide. I am different now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truck comes to a stop suddenly. We are all jerked forward after getting relaxed in the repetitive motion of the drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMetal scraping along the back of the truck fills the warm silent dark of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swings open filling the huge delivery truck with light. The white light makes my eyes seal instantly. I cover them and brace myself. I squeeze the little hand. I see dark shapes moving around the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out you go bitches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force my eyes open to the light. It takes a second for them to focus. I don’t look at the open door. I turn and look at the little blonde girl who is sobbing silently next to me. She is about ten or eleven. Her hair is matted and dirty. The tears have made lines of clean face in the filth. Her bright blue eyes are filled with terror. I hold her hand. I won\u0027t let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the other women. They range from the young girl next to me to a lady I think is in her thirties. Fat, thin, dirty, clean, tired, crying, frozen, confused. The group is diverse. Except in color. I notice everyone is white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can process this too much, I notice the redhead giving me a death stare from outside of the truck. He grips his rifle and watches me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down as the grin spreads across my face. I feel a nervous giggle about to burst from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerge is standing at the back of the truck. He gives me a look and grabs my ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.\" He drags me from the truck. I drag the little girl with me. She won\u0027t let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see something I haven’t seen in along time. A huge shiny white building stands surrounded by a parking lot with cars parked in between the lines. There are no vines or grass growing up the sides of the building. It\u0027s clean and sparkly like before. The pavement is flat and new. There are no cracks or weeds growing up through it. There are no cars burned out or missing all the parts. The cars are real and whole. They even shine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet hit the ground with a thud. His fingers dig into my shoulders. \"Don’t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little blonde is standing next to me holding my hand. She is hiding in the curves of my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerge digs his gun into my ribs, \"Move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men are jumping into the truck and hauling, screaming and sobbing women from the back where they’ve watched me be dragged. I walk toward the huge building. It\u0027s five stories high and looks very long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl curls into me as Serge jabs me again with the barrel of the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoot him a dirty look. He winks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear screaming in the truck behind me. I look back to see several women walking with us, mostly the young ones. Few guards are with us. The rest are jumping into the back of the truck. My stomach curdles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerge shakes his head, \"Don’t watch.\" He whispers and hits me with the gun again. I can see the regrets in his eyes. Shame crosses his face. He knows I know. He would have been in the back of the truck with the screaming women chosen to stay behind. I can hear the tearing and screaming. It always sounds the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and squeeze the blonde into me. She clutches me tightly. I look around and make sure the other little girls are with us. I think I see them all. I want to take Serge\u0027s gun and kill the guards and save the women in the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead we walk through a door and a blast of frigid air hits me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerge has the gun in my ribs again. I remember the feeling of the cold air. It brings a memory with it. My dad and me at the mall. He hated all the people, but he needed to get some things. I smile and remember the carousel. I\u0027d never seen anything like it. He put a dollar in the machine and I climbed on. The horse had dark golden hair like mine. I gripped it and the machine started. The joy that hangs in the cold air fills me with bravery and courage for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA doctor walks toward me with a white spaceman suit on. He grabs my arm and tries to separate me and the blonde. She screams and I grip her arms. I wish she could have ridden the carousel. She would have liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She stays with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor rolls his eyes behind the plastic and nods, \"Fine. In you go.\" He points to a hallway. I walk down it and am pushed through a door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerge is against me and whispering in my ears, \"I will come for you. Be ready. I will send you a message. I won\u0027t let you die in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off her soldier.\" The doctor sounds funny behind his mask. Serge pushes me one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m gripping the little girl and standing in front of a door. It opens suddenly. A lady in a space suit peers out. She smiles at me with bright pink lipstick behind the plastic, \"Come this way my dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice is sweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance back at Serge and the other girls being led to the hallway where I stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerge turns the corner but steals another glance at me before he vanishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy arm is taken and we are led into a huge room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady bends on a knee to the little blonde hiding in my armpit, \"What\u0027s your name sweetie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blonde shakes her head and nuzzles into me further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the woman and frown, \"She has never seen a space suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady looks up at me confused, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point to her white suite, \"She hasn’t ever seen one of these. She probably doesn’t think you\u0027re human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady laughs, \"You know in ten years of doing this job I never thought about that.\" She looks back down at the little girl, \"Am I scaring you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blonde holds me tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are.\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands and points to the huge white tubes, \"Well we have something for you two to do and then you can be cleared to be around people without the decontamination suits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold the shaking child to me and walk to the tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to step away from her, silent tears are pouring from her bright blue eyes. I look at her, \"Want to get something to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point to the tube, \"When we are done in there and they are sure we aren’t sick they will feed us.\" I say it loud enough that the lady in the space suit, who is now talking to the other woman, looks at me and nods, \"Yup we will get you some food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pry her tiny, balled up hands from my clothes and smile softly. I step into the tube. It powers on and blue lights flash on me. A flat surface comes down on a robotic arm and a face comes on the screen in front of me, \"Please place your hands on the pad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at the little girl and put my hand on the pad. A sharp poke digs into one of my fingers. A red light moves from my fingertips to my wrist and then back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe platform drops away and my hands drops down. The floor starts moving like at the airport, before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly fast moving air blows across me and I move deeper into the tunnel. I get to the other side and it all stops. I step off and another space suit woman comes to me, \"I just need to take you to the sanitation area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point to the little girl, \"I have to wait for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry that\u0027s not allowed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growl, \"I\u0027m waiting.\" She sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shout through, \"See, it doesn’t hurt. It was kind of fun. Just step in. It\u0027s going to be okay. I\u0027m right here waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breath is still slight heaves. She doesn’t make a sound. She puts a shaking hand out and steps onto the platform. She cries harder as the robotic arm comes down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your hand on. I promise it was like a fast little pinch and nothing more. Then you\u0027ll come to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer blue eyes are filled with terror. She shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Do it. They won\u0027t let you come to me if you don\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer left hand hugs herself and her right hand rests on the pad. I see her flinch when the small prick comes. She ducks when the sharp wind hits her and she looks like she might have a heart attack when the floor moves. She has never seen anything. She was in the womb when the world went crazy. Technology is not something us borderlander\u0027s see. Ever. In the borderlands nature has taken things back. This feels like a small corner humans still control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the floor stops moving, she leaps off and is under my armpit again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady laughs, \"Okay you\u0027re both cleared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brings us to a small white room. There is a white table in the middle of the room with nothing else but a door on the far side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please put everything on the table. It will be sanitized and given back to you if it can be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands and waits. I realize she is going to watch us strip naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to have a fit. I want to smash her in the space suit face and run from the room but I look at the little blonde and take a deep breath. I pull my shirt off. I pull off my sports bra and stand with my breasts out, exposed. It is the first time I have ever been naked in front of anyone except my granny and my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember swimming in my underwear and bra with the naked people at the camp and smirk. The little blonde would love it there. The majestic swimming hole would make her happy. I decide she is coming with me when I run. My brain tries to think its usual \u0027look out for number one\u0027 excuses, but I can\u0027t. I think she\u0027s alone in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The jewelry too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at the silver bracelet and necklace my mom wore when she died. I remember my father removing it from her and putting it on me. I feel sick taking it off. When it touches the cold table I feel like I will never see it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod at her and she starts taking her clothes off. We are naked and filthy and both doing our best to cover ourselves. Finally the lady walks to the door and slides a card on her wrist through a slot in the door handle. I need one of those cards. The door opens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now we need to clean you.\" She points into the stainless steel bathroom. The walls are metal, the floors are metal. There are several showerheads along the back wall and a drain in the floor. The little girl grabs my hand seeing it. She doesn’t want to cuddle naked, thank god, but she wants to hold my hand. The water starts by itself, making her jump a little. I smile. I\u0027ve seen a shower before. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-20.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
