I wanted to rip it out of the ground and throw it over theiron gate .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure how I would react to Mr. and Mrs. Sterling now that I knew their true plans for Alexander and the Mansion. I dearly loved them like my own parents, but I was obviously conflicted. I knew they weren\u0027t trying to hurt me and my boyfriend, but their decision was breaking my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited outside the Mansion\u0027s door, barely able to breathe. I knocked several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door finally creaked open and Alexander appeared/ \"They\u0027re out,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. My anxiety flew out of my body like a bat from an attic. I entered the Mansion and gave my boyfriend a big kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t sure if I was going to have to beg them on my hands and knees or just burst out in tears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander gently laughed, but it was apparent by his hollowed cheeks and bloodshot eyes that he hadn\u0027t slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have great news,\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could use some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured out the perfect solution,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" Alexander perked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath, excited by my problem solving. \"You can\u0027t move out of the Mansion if no one buys it.,.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander nodded. \"True...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, we have to make sure no one does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are we going to do that?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad you asked. Gossip runs through this town like a flood. Usually the rumors are about you, your Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,family, or me.

How can we convince people not to buy the Mansion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated to disappoint him. He was so proud of his grandmother\u0027s mansion. Just as I adored it, he obviously did even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been around this town?\" I asked. \"I can\u0027t imagine anyone would be interested in buying the Mansion anyway, with all the rumors surrounding it for years. But now that it\u0027s for sale we can\u0027t take any chances. We have to spread our own. Verify the Mansion is worse than they thought.Bats, mold, or rusty pipes, None of these women would step one of their Prada-wearing feet inside even view it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander\u0027s pale face lit up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if someone from outside of town comes to take a look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have to stop at Mickey\u0027s gas station.

The sight of Alexander and me together on the square was enough to get gossip going, but the fact that they had inside dirt-literally-on the Mansion made every patron\u0027s and salesclerk\u0027s ears perk up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missionaccomplished,\" I said as Alexander and I headed back to the fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey- you got Shirley\u0027s side,\" Becky said, already waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We planned on that,\" I said, nudging her,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My treat.\"Alexander spoke with the same authority as a coach buying his players food after a win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one ever listens to what I say,\" my shy best friend said as we headed into Shirley\u0027s. \"But when we brought up the Mansion and the cracks in the foundation-everyone in the restaurant heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could have been because you were almost screaming,\" Matt said, \"And we didn\u0027t have a reservation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then an elderly couple sitting at a small table sharing a sundae glared back at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman said, \"I think I heard that girl say that mansion has cracks in the foundation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" the man replied. \"I thought he said his girlfriend ran screaming from it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Alexander\u0027s hand an extra squeeze and the thumbs-up to Matt and Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssorted dripping ice creams in tow, Becky drove us to Dullsville\u0027s country club, which was a snobby members-only club sprawled out over several acres. It included indoor and outdoor tennis courts, an eighteen-hole golf course, a gift and pro shop, and a four-star restaurant. Signs about the upcoming Annual Art Auction lined the grass like it waselection day .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll wait here,\" I said to Matt and Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few minutes, members with tennis rackets, golf clubs, and yoga mats were coming out of the club- returning from workouts like it was their job. When it quieted down, a couple carrying boxes filled with pottery struggled to open the front door. Alexander jumped out of the truck and opened the clubhouse door for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is as close as I could get without a white shirt,\" he said when he got back into the truck. We held hands with crossed fingers until Becky and Matt returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I got home, word had traveled so quickly about the undesirable money pit on Benson Hill that my parents had already heard the news and were greatly concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t return to the Mansion.\" My mother confronted me as I started for the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard the walls could fall down at any minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you didn\u0027t believe in gossip. Besides, who told you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter,\" she began, then shouted,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the game\u0027s almost over-\"he hollered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul, this is important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad reluctantly joined us, clutching the remote like it was a lifeline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about Raven visiting the Mansion,\" my mom said. \"I think until Alexander moves, it is best they spend time over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t ban me from the Mansion!\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea my plan would work so well. But now it was working against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That house is in dire straits,\" my mom went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it was pretty sound. It was old and dusty, but I think it was as sturdy as a castle,\" my dad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See!\" I pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there were bats,\" my mom argued. \"You both saw them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I love bats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are flying rodents,\" she challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents both looked at me curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah, can we discuss this later?\" my dad suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, those are just rumors.
