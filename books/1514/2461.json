Nonetheless, this matter had clearly caused a huge commotion within the tribe. As a result, the security of the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe also became extremely tight.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSome of the elites of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, even formed small investigation units to comb the area within a five hundred kilometre radius of their tribe. Following which, anything that came into contact with the demonic aura was completely exterminated. Clearly, they were greatly shocked by the Eternal Illusion Demon Flower seeds that were buried in the mountains. After all, this crisis had almost severely damaged their Celestial Demon Marten tribe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter a couple of days’ time, the top experts from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, who were undergoing a cultivation seclusion in the Heavenly Cave, all began to awaken. Then, they were all shocked and terrified when they learnt about the crisis, as well as the trap placed in the Heavenly Cave. After all, if not for Lin Dong, it was likely that most of them would have died.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe upper echelon of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe were undoubtedly extremely furious over this matter. Hence, it was likely that things would not end well for Hao Jiuyou. However, Lin Dong did not care about this. As he sustained terrible internal injuries, he had to recuperate for a total of ten days in the Celestial Demon Marten tribe, before he was able to return to his usual form.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong clearly played an important role during this crisis. If he had not snuck into the Heavenly Cave and rescued the Celestial Demon Marten tribe leader, and if he had not risked his life to delay Hao Jiuyou after no one else in the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe was available after being trapped by the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers, it was likely that the Celestial Demon Marten tribe would have suffered great deaths and huge losses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was precisely because of this, that Lin Dong was able to sense the gratitude and admiration in the eyes of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe members, while he was recuperating within the tribe. The Celestial Demon Marten tribe members were typically proud and arrogant individuals. This was something that one could tell by using Little Marten as an example. Hence, it was no easy task for someone, especially a human, to earn their respect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOf course, this was not merely limited to ordinary tribe members. In fact, even those top experts, who were in a cultivation seclusion within the Heavenly Cave, felt grateful towards him after they learnt that he had snuck into the Heavenly Cave and helped them to remove the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers. As a result, over the next few days, Lin Dong slowly became irritated with their stares. Hence, he eventually chose to seclude himself and recuperate, in order to regain some peace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith the flow of time, the tense atmosphere within the Celestial Demon Marten tribe also began to relax as an increasing number of top experts left their seclusion. After all, the reason why the Celestial Demon Marten tribe was forced into such a sorry state, was because the tribe temporarily lacked powerful individuals. Moreover, with the spy Hao Jiuyou helping them from the inside, it allowed the Yimo to take advantage of them. Nonetheless, having suffered such a huge loss, the Celestial Demon Marten tribe would definitely not make the same mistake again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter the Celestial Demon Marten tribe got serious, the foundation that was only possessed by the four overlord tribes, was completely displayed.

If one was to look down from this place, it would be possible for one to see the entire Celestial Demon Marten tribe. At this moment, not only was the tribe guarding formation activated, but there were also many powerful guards frequently patrolling the sky. However, when those guards saw Lin Dong, who was seated at the edge of the cliff, they would slow down and smilingly cup their hands towards him, before they left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs he stared at the departing guards, Lin Dong smiled as well. Then, he stretched his lazy waist before he looked at the azure sky. Even up till now, the intense battle that took place ten days ago was still playing in his mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Despite having risked it all, I am still unable to kill a genuine Samsara stage expert…”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong lowered his head and looked at his somewhat fair and long hands. Then, he helplessly curled his lips. He had basically unleashed every technique in the fight against Hao Jiuyou. Nonetheless, he was still unable to kill the latter. This caused him to secretly sigh. It seems like there was truly a huge gap between Profound Death stage and Samsara stage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs of now, he was able to pose a threat to a Samsara stage expert. However, he would have difficulties gaining the upper hand if they were to engage in a life and death battle. Moreover, he could not allow the fight to drag on because of his limited strength. That was his fatal weakness.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHence, increasing his own strength was still the best option.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“If it is Yuan Power, it will still be difficult to make up for this huge gap even if I advance to the perfect Profound Death stage… Therefore, I can only turn to Mental Energy.” Lin Dong muttered to himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, Lin Dong was at the peak of the advance Profound Death stage and he was only one step away from the perfect Profound Death stage, However, even if he managed to make this step, it would not grant him the ability to kill a Samsara stage expert.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFortunately, Lin Dong still had another path to choose from.

Not only does he possess the Ancestor Stone, which is ranked second on the Ancient Divine Object Ranking, but he also possess the Primal Dragon Bone. That is something that was only possessed by the fearsome legendary person, who had once unified the entire Demonic Beast World.” Zhu Li looked at Lin Dong, who had disappeared into the Heavenly Cave, before he involuntarily praised.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It seems like Ah Diao has found an extremely good brother.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe leader of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe nodded. Promptly, he narrowed his eyes before he said, “However, he is actually planning to use the Eternal Illusion Demon Flowers to break into the Symbol Grandmaster level. That is something unheard of.

After which, he waved his hand before the experts from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe scattered off and surrounded the cave, ensuring that nothing could get by them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e　　……\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn a quiet cave within the Heavenly Cave, Lin Dong looked at the light curtain rising over the entrance of the cave, before he deeply inhaled a breath of air.
