In the year 1271, a young seventeen-year-old Venetian named Marco Polo left with his father and uncle on a voyage to the palaces of Kublai Khan in China. It was a journey that would last twenty-four years and bring forth stories of the exotic lands that lay to the east of the known world: wondrous tales of endless deserts and jade-rich rivers, of teeming cities and vast sailing fleets, of black stones that burned and money made of paper, of impossible beasts and bizarre plants, of cannibals and mystic shamans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter serving seventeen years in the courts of Kublai Khan, Marco returned to Venice in 1295, where his story was recorded by a French romanticist named Rustichello, in a book titled in Old French, Le Divisament dou Monde (or The Description of the World). The text swept Europe. Even Christopher Columbus carried a copy of Marco\u0027s book on his journey to the New World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there is one story of this journey that Marco refused to ever tell, referring only obliquely to it in his text. When Marco Polo had left China, Kublai Khan had granted the Venetian fourteen immense ships and six hundred men. But when Marco finally reached port after two years at sea, there remained but two ships and only eighteen men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fate of the other ships and men remain a mystery to this day. Was it shipwreck, storms, piracy? He never told. In fact, on his deathbed, when asked to elaborate or recant his story, Marco answered cryptically: \"I have not told half of what I saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pestilence came first to the town of Kaffa on the Black Sea. There the mighty Mongolian Tartars waged siege upon the Italian Genoese, merchants and traders. Plague struck the Mongol armies with burning boils and bloody expulsions. Struck with great malice, the Mongol lords used their siege catapults to cast their diseased dead over the Genoese walls, and spread plague in a litter of bodies and ruin. In the year of the incarnation of the Son of God 1347, the Genoese fled under sail in twelve galleys back to Italy, to the port of Messina, bringing the Black Death to our shores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Duke M. Giovanni (1356), trans. by Reinhold Sebastien in Il Apocalypse (Milan: A, Mondadori, 1924), 34-35\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy the bubonic plague suddenly arose out of China\u0027s Gobi desert during the Middle Ages and slew a third of the world\u0027s population remains unknown. In fact, no one knows why so many plagues and influenzas of the last century—SARS, the Avian Flu—have arisen out of Asia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what is known with fair certainty: the next great pandemic will arise again out of the East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Compendium of Infectious Diseases, May 2006\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidnight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsland of Sumatra\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoutheast Asia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screams had finally ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve bonfires blazed out in the midnight harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Il dio, li perdona. . .\"his father whispered at his side, but Marco knew the Lord would not forgive them this sin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA handful of men waited beside the two beached longboats, the only witnesses to the funeral pyres out upon the dark lagoon. As the moon had risen, all twelve ships, mighty wooden galleys, had been set to torch with all hands still aboard, both the dead and those cursed few who still lived. The ships\u0027 masts pointed fiery fingers of accusation toward the heavens. Flakes of burning ash rained down upon the beach and those few who bore witness. The night reeked of burned flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twelve ships,\" his uncle Masseo mumbled, clutching the silver crucifix in one fist, \"the same number as the Lord\u0027s Apostles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the screams of the tortured had ended. Only the crackle and low roar of the flames reached the sandy shore now. Marco wanted to turn from the sight. Others were not as stout of heart, and knelt on the sand, backs to the water, faces as pale as bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll were stripped naked. Each had searched his neighbor for any sign of the mark. Even the great Khan\u0027s princess, who stood behind a screen of sail-cloth for modesty, wore only her jeweled headpiece. Marco noted her lithe form through the cloth, lit from behind by the fires. Her maids, naked themselves, had searched their mistress. Her name was Kokejin, the Blue Princess, a maiden of seventeen, the same age as Marco had been when he started the journey from Venice. The Polos had been assigned by the Great Khan to safely deliver her to her betrothed, the Khan of Persia, the grandson of Kublai\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKhan\u0027s brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been in another lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad it been only four months since the first of the galley crew had become sick, showing welts on groin and beneath the arm? The illness spread like burning oil, unmanning the galleys of able men and stranding them here on this island of cannibals and strange beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now drums sounded in the dark jungle. But the savages knew better than to approach the encampment, like the wolf shunning diseased sheep, smelling the rot and corruption. The only signs of their encroachment were the skulls, twined through the eye sockets with vines and hung from tree branches, warding against deeper trespass or foraging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sickness had kept the savages at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the cruel fire the disease was at last vanquished, leaving only this small handful of survivors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose clear of the red welts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven nights ago the remaining sick had been taken in chains to the moored boats, left with water and food. The others remained on shore, wary of any sign among them of fresh affliction. All the while, those banished to the ships called out across the waters, pleading, crying, praying, cursing, and screaming. But the worst was the occasional laughter, bright with madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter to have slit their throats with a kind and swift blade, but all feared touching the blood of the sick. So they had been sent to the boats, imprisoned with the dead already there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen as the sun sank this night, a strange glow appeared in the water, pooled around the keels of two of the boats, spreading like spilled milk upon the still black waters. They had seen the glow before, in the pools and canals beneath the stone towers of the cursed city they had fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disease sought to escape its wooden prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had left them no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boats—all the galleys, except for the one preserved for their departure— had been torched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco\u0027s uncle Masseo moved among the remaining men. He waved for them to again cloak their nakedness, but simple cloth and woven wool could not mask their deeper shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we did . . .\" Marco said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must not speak of it,\" his father said, and held forth a robe toward Marco. \"Breathe a word of pestilence and all lands will shun us. No port will let us enter their waters. But now we\u0027ve burned away the last of the disease with a cleansing fire, from our fleet, from the waters. We have only to return home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Marco slipped the robe over his head, his father noted what the son had drawn earlier in the sand with a stick. With a tightening of his lips, his father quickly ground it away under a heel and stared up at his son. A beseeching look fixed upon his visage. \"Never, Marco .. . never . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the memory could not be so easily ground away. He had served the Great Khan, as scholar, emissary, even cartographer, mapping his many conquered kingdoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father spoke again. \"None must ever know what we found ... it is cursed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco nodded and did not comment on what he had drawn. He only whispered. \"Citta dei Morti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father\u0027s countenance, already pale, blanched further. But Marco knew it wasn\u0027t just plague that frightened his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swear to me, Marco,\" he insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco glanced up into the lined face of his father. He had aged as much during these past four months as he had during the decades spent with the Khan in Shangdu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swear to me on your mother\u0027s blessed spirit that you\u0027ll never speak again of what we found, what we did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand gripped his shoulder, squeezing to the bone. \"Swear to me, my son. For your own sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized the terror reflected in his fire-lit eyes . . . and the pleading. Marco could not refuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will keep silent,\" he finally promised. \"To my deathbed and beyond. I so swear, Father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco\u0027s uncle finally joined them, overhearing the younger man\u0027s oath. \"We should never have trespassed there, Niccol6,\" he scolded his brother, but his accusing words were truly intended for Marco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled between the three, heavy with shared secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis uncle was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco pictured the river delta from four months back. The black stream had emptied into the sea, fringed by heavy leaf and vine. They had only sought to renew their stores of fresh water while repairs were made to two ships. They should never have ventured farther, but Marco had heard stories of a great city beyond the low mountains. And as ten days were set for repairs, he had ventured with twoscore of the Khan\u0027s men to climb the low mountains and see what lay beyond. From a crest, Marco had spotted a stone tower deep within the forest, thrusting high, brilliant in the dawn\u0027s light. It drew him like a beacon, ever curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the silence as they hiked through the forest toward the tower should have warned him. There had been no drums, like now. No birdcalls, no scream of monkeys. The city of the dead had simply waited for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a dreadful mistake to trespass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it cost them more than just blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three stared out as the galleys smoldered down to the waterlines. One of the masts toppled like a felled tree. Two decades ago, father, son, and uncle had left Italian soil, under the seal of Pope Gregory X, to venture forth into the Mongol lands, all the way to the Khan\u0027s palaces and gardens in Shangdu, where they had roosted far too long, like caged partridges. As favorites of the court, the three Polos had found themselves trapped—not by chains, but by the Khan\u0027s immense and smothering friendship, unable to leave without insulting their benefactor. So at long last, they thought themselves lucky to be returning home to Venice, released from service to the great Kublai Khan to act as escorts for the lady Kokejin to her Persian betrothed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould that their fleet had never left Shangdu . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sun will rise soon,\" his father said. \"Let us be gone. It is time we went home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if we reach those blessed shores, what do we tell Teobaldo?\" Masseo asked, using the original name of the man, once a friend and advocate of the Polo family, now styled as Pope Gregory X. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-1.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
