He understands his business well. You heard what he said about his nephew?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is his sister’s son—a boy of about your own age. I think he is making a mistake in leaving the factory, and going into the office. He will have little to do, and that not of a character to give him knowledge of business.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Still, if he takes lessons in bookkeeping——”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Jennings smiled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The boy will never make a bookkeeper,” he said. “His reason for desiring the change is because he is indolent. The world has no room for lazy people.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wonder, sir, that you have had a chance to find him out.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Little things betray a boy’s nature, or a man’s, for that matter. When I have visited the workroom I have noticed Leonard, and formed my conclusions. He is not a boy whom I would select for my service, but I have taken him as a favor to his uncle. I presume he is without means, and it is desirable that he should pay his uncle something in return for the home which he gives him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much do you pay him, sir, if it is not a secret?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, no; he receives five dollars a week to begin with. I will pay him the same in the office. And that reminds me; how would you like to have a situation in the factory? Would you like to take Leonard’s place?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir, if you think I would do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I feel quite sure of it. Have you ever done any manual labor?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose you have always been to school.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are a gentleman’s son,” proceeded Mr. Jennings, eying Carl attentively. “How will it suit you to become a working boy?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall like it,” answered Carl, promptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don’t be too sure! You can tell better after a week in the factory. Those in my employ work ten hours a day. Leonard Craig doesn’t like it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All I ask, Mr. Jennings, is that you give me a trial.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is fair,” responded the little man, looking pleased. “I will tell you now that, not knowing of any vacancy in the factory, I had intended to give you the place in the office which Mr. Gibbon has asked for his nephew. It would have been a good deal easier work.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall be quite satisfied to take my place in the factory.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come in, then, and see your future scene of employment.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They entered a large room, occupying nearly an entire floor of the building. Part of the space was filled by machinery. The number employed Carl estimated roughly at twenty-five.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Quite near the door was a boy, who bore some personal resemblance to the bookkeeper. Carl concluded that it must be Leonard Craig. The boy looked round as Mr. Jennings entered, and eyed Carl sharply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How are you getting on, Leonard?” Mr. Jennings asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Pretty well, sir; but the machinery makes my head ache.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your uncle tells me that your employment does not agree with you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir; I don’t think it does.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He would like to have you in the office with him. Would you like it, also?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir,” answered Leonard, eagerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well. You may report for duty at the office to-morrow morning. This boy will take your place here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Leonard eyed Carl curiously, not cordially.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope you’ll like it,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think I shall.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You two boys must get acquainted,” said Mr. Jennings. “Leonard, this is Carl Crawford.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Glad to know you,” said Leonard, coldly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t think I shall like that boy,” thought Carl, as he followed Mr. Jennings to another part of the room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2963/81558.html","bookId":388,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 4:08:52 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 4:08:52 AM"}
