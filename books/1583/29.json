Just who had threatened her? The legitimate humanists or one of the rebellious ones? “Do you agree to my terms?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye. I’ll do your biddin’,” he finally said. “On one condition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What type of condition?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll give you control of this. But if the situation turns nasty or looks dangerous, then you’ll shut your pretty little mouth and listen to me.” Lena opened her mouth to protest, but he pressed his forefinger against her lips, halting the stream of words. “No,” he said firmly. “It ain’t up for negotiation. Any sign of danger and I’m in charge, you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breath parted around his finger. Will’s gaze dropped as though he felt it in other places and suddenly she did too. The heat of it made her squirm, her insides tying themselves into knots. The thought of tying herself to him, letting him dog her footsteps, was suddenly an unbearable agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a necessary one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a step back, Lena put herself beyond reach of his hands—those treacherous, tempting hands—and smoothed her skirts. The simple action washed the emotion from her thoughts, and most likely her face. She had no choice in this matter. If she didn’t agree he would only find another way to hobble her. At least this way she would be in control. Most of the time. “You’re as stubborn as a bull,” she muttered. “Fine. I agree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you break your word you’ll regret it,” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMutiny flared. “I already do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree exhausting hours later Will handed her up into the steam carriage she’d arrived in. Lena settled against the plush velvet seats, barely noticing the steady jostle of the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHovering outside the carriage, he cast a swift glance around at the darkening streets. “Here,” he said, tugging a small paper-wrapped package from his waistcoat. “I didn’t just buy you the pistol.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena stared at the box in her gloved hands. Will wiped his hands on his trousers and shoved them deep into his pockets. The action only strained the material over his thighs, something she tried not to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” she asked, rattling the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTugging at the brown string that tied the package, she couldn’t ignore his sudden tension. He leaned against the carriage, one hand on the open door as he watched her play with the strings. She had some mind to draw the moment out, to watch his unease grow, but there was no point. Those were the type of games she’d played with him as a foolish young girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTearing apart the paper, she unearthed a small red velvet box. A gold crown was embossed in the material. She knew exactly where it had come from. Most young ladies did. “Will?” she said breathlessly. “I told you I couldn’t accept personal items.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis warm hands slid over hers, forcing the box apart. “Consider it practical then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last dying ray of sunlight gleamed through a blood red ruby. She almost snapped the box closed. Almost. “I never asked you what you were doing in a jeweler’s.” She shook her head. “I can’t. It’s too beautiful. Too expensive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill fetched it out, the simple gold band tumbling into his hand. Engraved filigreed thorns wrapped around the ruby, holding it in place. “See here?” He flicked one of the thorns and it sprang out, surprisingly sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out to test it with her finger and he snatched her hand away. “It’s a poison ring, Lena. Took me ages to find a jeweler who had one.” Leaning close, he glanced at the driver and whispered in her ear. “Full of a hemlock concoction that’ll incapacitate a blue blood for a few minutes. How long depends on how old he is, how much the cravin’ virus has overtaken him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was giving her so much more than a ring. Another weapon. Another means to defend herself. Lena swallowed hard, staring at his face as he demonstrated how the ring would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This must have cost a fortune.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill shrugged. “I don’t spend much. Never ’ave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will, I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased the thorn back into its slot, then closed her fingers over it. That stubborn look she was starting to know so well crept over his face. “It ain’t open to discussion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that how you think you’re going to stop me from arguing from now on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rare smile softened his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena sighed. “Fine. I’ll take it.” Slipping her glove off, she slid the beautiful ring over her finger. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saves me from worryin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena stared into the ruby’s facets. He wouldn’t worry if he didn’t care, would he? Her blood heated at the thought. Don’t. She clenched her fist, hiding the ring from sight. Don’t think this is any more than it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaking a hand through his hair, he looked around. “About last night—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warmth drained out of her face. “No,” she snapped. “You made it quite clear what last night was about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lena, I need to explain—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to hear it.” She turned away, shoulders stiff and face frozen as she smoothed her skirts. “I understand that I made a fool of myself. It won’t happen again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lena, you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A gentleman would keep his mouth shut now,” she reminded him, falling back on her lecture tone. Anything to hold herself together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill stared at her, his gaze an intimate touch she refused to meet. “Very well,” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should be going. It’s growing late. And there’s that dinner I must attend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re goin’ out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Briefly. Then I’ll get back to work on Mr. Mandeville’s commission. I need to finish the interior clockwork of the transformational. I’m so very close. There’s no need for you to check on me tonight. I promise I won’t get into any trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered her words for a long moment. Then reached inside his pocket again. “I want you to keep this on you at all times,” he said, pulling out a whistle. It hung on a fine gold chain and he slipped it over her head, then tucked it into the bodice of her dress as though he barely noticed the shuddering intake of her breath “It makes a sound you won’t ’ear, but it’ll alert any blue bloods—or me—in the vicinity if you need help.” Stepping back, he shut the carriage door and nodded at the driver. “I’ll call on you tomorrow before the…the…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The balloon launch,” she reminded him. “In Hyde Park. With the Scandinavians.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.” Will grimaced. “We don’t have to go up in one of them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Afraid of heights too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m goin’ to ignore that.” He let go of the carriage and stepped back, shooting her a direct look—and a reminder. “No trouble tonight, Lena.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would I get into trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a bloody magnet for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ruby. He’d bought her a ruby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena held her bare hand out. She couldn’t stop looking at it, watching the play of light through the polished gem. It was the size of her littlest fingernail. She’d seen bigger. A dozen times over in the Echelon, where they liked to drape their thralls in jewels to indicate the status of their masters. But for Will to have bought her something like this made it more precious than the largest diamond in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing her eyes, she leaned her head back against the seat. What was she going to do? How could she keep her heart safely locked away when he did things like this for her? For it was becoming dangerously apparent that her feelings for him were growing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDabbing at the perspiration across her brow, she sighed. From the pounding in her head, she was in for a good cup of willow bark tea when she got home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden jolt threw her across the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena snatched at the carriage strap and glanced out the window. They’d stopped. The driver was one of Leo’s men, well skilled in the use of the horseless steam-driven carriages. Though they’d barely left Whitechapel behind, the roads weren’t bad and nobody would dare attack her this close to Blade’s turf. Every man and woman in the rookery knew who the gilded hawk on the carriage belonged to. Blade had declared Leo safe passage to his realm. The cost of crossing his word was death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coachman?” she called as the carriage careened to a halt. “Henry?” There was no sign of the footman riding on back as she glanced out the window. “What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence greeted her. Considering it was early evening, the streets were frightfully deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the shadows of a nearby alley, a lambent blue eye suddenly lit up. Lena shrank back into the carriage as a shadow detached itself from the rest. It rose to a height of nearly six feet, then suddenly unfolded itself further until it stood almost eight or nine feet. The eerie gaslit blue of its eye was reminiscent of a metaljacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no metaljacket had ever stood so tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocking the carriage door, she looked around for something—anything—with which to defend herself. Only a few forlorn cushions greeted her gaze. Will had taken the pistol back, determined to improve it for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe metal creature stepped out of the alley, moving in large, jerking strides. It was a metaljacket, the overlapping plates of its chest and abdomen gleaming with cold steel. The head was square, crowned with a demonic steel helm. A thin slit of glass in its throat was the only sign of any weakness, and behind the glass were a pair of eyes. Human eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting its massive fist, it swung a blow toward her. Lena shrieked and dove across the seat as glass from the window sprayed throughout the carriage. She tore the other door open and fell onto the cobbles, collapsing in a puddle of yellow skirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething tugged in her hair. Reaching up, she found the fine gold chain and followed it to the whistle Will had hung around her neck. Hydraulic hoses hissed behind her and the carriage shuddered. Lena stuck the whistle in her mouth and blew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sound. Nothing but steel screeching as the carriage slowly tipped on its edge, the monstrous creature trying to turn it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing her skirts, she bolted out of the way. The carriage smashed onto the cobbles, exactly where she’d just been kneeling. Gasping for breath, she darted forward blindly and crashed into something solid and warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands caught her by the arms. Lena jerked back instinctively and tore free from a man’s grip. A leering face came into view. He towered over her, wearing little more than a rough worker’s jerkin and tight leather pants. A seeming arsenal of metal hung at his belt. She didn’t take the time to look. Instead she turned and bolted back the way she’d come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen were everywhere. Ducking under snatching hands, she ran through a gauntlet of ragged, mismatched bandits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSound whirred behind her. “I’ve got ’er.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena screamed as something wrapped around her ankles. Pitching forward onto her face, she hit the cobbles hard. Pain tore through her lip and her lungs shrank to a quarter of their size. For a moment she couldn’t breathe. There was a great, gaping vacuum in her chest and she sucked and sucked for air but none came. Then suddenly her lungs expanded and she dragged in a huge, rasping breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt all the way through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slow step of a pair of boots sounded on the cobbles behind her as someone made their way toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We oughta hurry, Mendici.” A young boy, by the sound of him. “Can’t keep the streets clear forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ain’t nobody gonna cry hue, Jeremy.” The giant laughed. “Not in these parts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena’s gaze fell on the whistle, lying on the ground in front of her. She snatched for it but a boot came out of nowhere and ground it beneath his heel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant smiled at her. “Well, ain’t you a pretty little puss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to scramble to her hands and knees. Her skirts were wrapped firmly around her ankles by a weighted rope and she got nowhere for her efforts. Behind her a heavy metal boot stepped forward, hydraulics hissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rollins,” the giant gestured. “Pick her up and let’s get movin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’d she mean with that whistle?” A young lad with dirty cheeks came into view, his eyes darting nervously. “Weren’t no noise from it.” He looked at her. “What’d you mean with that whistle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLicking the blood from her split lip, she summoned a smile. She could barely see for the throbbing of her head. “You’re in trouble now.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heart-of-iron-london-steampunk-2/page-29.html","bookId":1583,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:15:32 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:15:32 AM"}
