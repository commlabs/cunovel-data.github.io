She\u0027d affected him in an inescapable way since the minute he\u0027d first seen her standing in his office doorway. Married at the time, he\u0027d convinced himself that he likedTaylorbecause she was a good kid and a hard worker. Now, there was no Bonnie, and he\u0027d seenTaylorwith her blouse stuck to breasts that were definitely those of a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your brother?\" He tried to lead his mind down less inflammatory paths, but all the while he was thinking that maybe it was time he gave his instincts what they\u0027d always craved. A long, slow taste of sweet littleTaylor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick\u0027s on a wilderness camp with his class, in Riverhead forest, just out of the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat explained why she was out so late, as she organized her life around Nick\u0027s needs. He\u0027d only met her brother twice, once during a barbeque for employees\u0027 families and again when he\u0027d unexpectedly neededTaylorto come into work on a Saturday and she hadn\u0027t been able to find a sitter. However,Taylor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027s daily reports\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; glowing updates more like a mother would give of her firstborn, than a sister of her brother\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; had made him feel like he knew the boy intimately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still temping with the same agency?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve asked for you when I needed a temp.\" Each time, the hapless replacement had had to bear the brunt of his unreasonable temper at her absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She turned a little toward him. \"I didn\u0027t know.\" A pause. \"I don\u0027t work in the film industry anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not film?\" Had she been avoiding him, he thought with a flare of anger that was rooted in possessiveness that he\u0027d never consciously acknowledged. Until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the kind of environment I want to be in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStopping at a red light, he faced her. \"Environment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, her cheeks a little pink. \"Excess, glamour, money, money, money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d always known that she\u0027d fight against coming into his world. \"What about art?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it?\" she scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and accelerated with care when the light turned green. \"PoorTaylor. Disillusioned so young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t patronize me.\" The order was sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been the only one of his secretaries who\u0027d given him backchat. He\u0027d offered her a permanent position after her contract ended, but she\u0027d been adamant in her desire to leave. He\u0027d wanted her more than he\u0027d craved anything in his life, but honor had forced him to let her go, before he stole both her youth and her innocence. Yet, he\u0027d kept waiting for her to walk back through the door. The memory made his voice curt. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"What can I say? For a kid, you\u0027re very cynical.\" At thirty-two, he was only eight years her senior, but in his heart, he was decades too old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor\u0027s temper started to simmer. Why didJacksonalways treat her like a child? \"I\u0027m not a kid!\" Her feelings around him were definitely those of an adult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis big body tended to do things to her insides that scared her, because she had no idea what to do to feed those wild, hot feelings. With her history, she could never, ever allow herself to love a man, but the minute she\u0027d met JacksonSantorini , she\u0027d learned that she couldn\u0027t stop herself from lusting after this particular male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep chuckle heated both her cheeks and her temper. \"Next to me, you\u0027re a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crap.\" She was so furious that she could barely get the single word out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crap?\" He was laughing at her again, in that superior masculine way of his that made herwant to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Age makes no difference to the person you become once you\u0027re an adult.\" She needed him to accept her as a woman, though she shied away from the implications of that need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it does.\" His response was infuriatingly calm. \"More experience, more life lived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More years doesn\u0027t necessarily mean more experience!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sardonic look dared her to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did, goaded beyond endurance. \"I\u0027m bringing up a child. Can you say the same?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" His response was so cold that the inside of the car suddenly felt like a freezer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear that she\u0027d offended him deeply with her careless words. Not for the first time, she wondered if his childless marriage had been his choice. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said quietly, \"I shouldn\u0027t have said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true.\" An emotionless response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip, debating whether to continue. \"Yes. But so soon afterBonnie\u0027s death ... I shouldn\u0027t have said it. I wasn\u0027t thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her own emotional anguish over the possibility of losing custody of Nick to her stepfather,Lance, that had made her so reckless. Even tonight\u0027s desperate attempt to forget her fears for a few hours had ended in a nightmare. Except for being picked up byJackson, her day had been sheer hell. And now, she\u0027d made him angry. Somehow, that was the worst feeling of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been twelve months since Bonnie overdosed.\"Jacksonknew his voice was hard, but so had been surviving the losses a year ago. \"You know our marriage was finished long before then. Hell, the whole world knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d been married, but not to each other. He\u0027d had his work and for a brief glittering moment of pure happiness,Taylor\u0027s smile. Bonnie had had drugs. They hadn\u0027t even slept together for over two years, except for that one fateful time four months before her death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been so lovely that day, a shimmering memory of the girl he\u0027d wed, before news of her father\u0027s death had stolen her joy. He\u0027d long since learned that that girl had been a mirage, but when she\u0027d turned to him for comfort, he hadn\u0027t been able to deny her. Not when grief had ripped apart the mask of sophistication that had become her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they\u0027d created a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhom Bonnie had murdered when she\u0027d taken her life with a cocktail of drugs. If she hadn\u0027t, he might have been a parent, too, able to refuteTaylor\u0027s claim. He could still feel the knives that had sliced through his soul when the autopsy had revealed her to be pregnant. Further tests had proven that the child had been his flesh and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, even that incredible grief hadn\u0027t compared to his rage at discovering that Bonnie had known of the tiny life growing inside of her. She\u0027d known that his child was in her womb when she\u0027d taken her final lover, and she\u0027d known that his child was in her womb when she\u0027d ingested the fatal drug cocktail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment of understanding, hate had spread through his body like a virus, decimating his ability to feel tender emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" She could be nice sometimes,\"Taylorsaid, betraying the soft heart behind that tough exterior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When she wasn\u0027t drugged to the gills.\" He knew too much about the kind of pain \"nice\" Bonnie could inflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder why she did all those things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew she was talking about the drugs and that final affair, unearthed by the press and gleefully announced to the world. What would she say if he told her thatBonnie\u0027s famous lover had been the last in a string of men?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d stopped touching Bonnie as soon as he\u0027d discovered the infidelities. His love for her had died long before. After a lonely, barren childhood, her joyful charm had drawn him, only to teach him an even deeper sense of isolation. They hadn\u0027t shared a bed again, except for that day four months before her death. After hours spent at work inTaylor\u0027s company, aching for things he had no right to demand, his defenses had been at an all-time low. Seeing Bonnie smile after weeks of depression, he\u0027d desperately wanted to believe that they could salvage their marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the forgotten child of an impulsive celebrity union, he\u0027d promised himself that he would not repeat the cycle of divorce and remarriage that characterized his parents, and which had already spread to his three younger half siblings. Even the youngest, Valetta, had a broken marriage under her belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriven by that promise, he\u0027d kept trying to glue together his andBonnie\u0027s shattered relationship. He\u0027d even letTaylorgo without a single touch, stifling the hungry need her presence always aroused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even his most precious vows had a breaking point\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; he hated Bonnie for teaching him that lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final straw had come the day she\u0027d flaunted her faithlessness, meeting her newest lover in a place haunted by the paparazzi. That humiliating betrayal had forever severed any remaining loyalty he\u0027d had toward the girl he\u0027d married, and he\u0027d immediately filed for divorce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still remembered her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh please,\" she\u0027d mocked, cocktail in hand. It had been barely10:00 a.m.\"As if you\u0027ve been faithful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tragedy was,he had. The only infidelity he could be accused of was of the mind. In his bleakest moments, he hadn\u0027t been able to stop thinking aboutTaylor, but he would\u0027ve never touched her while a wedding band encircled his finger. Never . She deserved better than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he\u0027d walked out on Bonnie, a cautious hope had taken root in his heart. Once the divorce was final, he\u0027d intended to seek outTaylorand see if someone so young and untouched could find something to love in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen all of his dreams had crumbled to dust.Bonnie\u0027s death hadn\u0027t shocked him; she\u0027d been trying to kill herself for years. It was discovering the murder of his child that had destroyed his hope. He\u0027d been bleeding too badly to do anything but merely function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor\u0027s voice broke into the nightmarish memories. \"I mean, Bonnie had beauty, talent, wealth and you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was missing in her life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson\u0027s heart slammed hard into his rib cage at her befuddled tone. \"Maybe I\u0027m not such a prize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re incredibly loyal and generous. Your protectiveness might annoy your wife but she\u0027d know it sprang from deep caring. That would make it bearable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer naive belief in his goodness rocked him to the deepest recesses of his misbegotten soul. \"I wish you were a reporter.\" They\u0027d savaged him afterBonnie\u0027s last affair, taken his humiliation and broadcast it to the world. JacksonSantorini\u0027s private pain sold a lot of papers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-to-pleasure/page-2.html","bookId":1881,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:23 PM"}
