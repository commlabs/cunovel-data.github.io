Is Alex home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rhys is here with me. We\u0027re coming over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy glanced over her shoulder at Alex, who was still engrossed in the news. Lowering her voice, she said, \"Rhys is coming here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that going to be a problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for me, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be there in about twenty minutes,\" Erik said, and hung up. They could have been there in moments, but Erik wanted to give Daisy time to prepare Alex for their visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was that?\" Alex asked as she disconnected the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik.\" She debated whether to tell him Rhys was also coming and decided against it. \"He\u0027ll be here in a little while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy fought down a rising sense of panic as the minutes ticked past. She told herself there was nothing to be afraid of. Erik wouldn\u0027t bring Rhys to her house if there was any danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they coming here?\" Rhys asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik slipped his phone into his pocket. \"No, we\u0027re going there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys lifted one brow in obvious consternation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter? Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re afraid of meeting with Alex and his sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be an idiot. But if either of them tries anything, the deal\u0027s off and they\u0027re dead.\" Rhys drummed his fingers on the arm of the sofa. \"So, who do you think it is? Some stupid mortal, or one of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting back in his chair, Erik stretched his legs out in front of him. \"I don\u0027t know, but my money\u0027s on one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would a mortal offer a reward to have you destroyed? Most mortals don\u0027t even know you exist. A hunter would do it on his own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but the government isn\u0027t offering hunters two hundred grand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik grunted softly. Fifty years ago, the government had offered a thousand-dollar reward for every vampire destroyed. Those had been dangerous times. More than one Goth had been killed by mistake. As more and more innocents were killed, the government\u0027s reward had dropped to five hundred dollars, and then two hundred and fifty. When people decided two-fifty wasn\u0027t worth dying for, the frenzy to hunt vampires had dwindled until only dedicated hunters remained. Now there was more money to be made by selling vampire blood than by destroying them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" he said, rising. \"It\u0027s time to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys stood beside Erik on the O\u0027Donnells\u0027 front porch. Thrusting his hands into his pants pockets, he took a deep breath as two familiar scents reached his nostrils. Scents he remembered all too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Behave yourself,\" Erik admonished, and knocked on the door. From inside, he heard Daisy telling Alex that Rhys was also coming, and Alex\u0027s stunned silence in reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, Daisy opened the door, a tentative smile on her face. Clad in a pale yellow sweater and a pair of faded jeans, she looked as lovely and fresh as the flower she had been named after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, he forgot everything else as the memory of the hours they had spent together at the hotel flashed through his mind. Erik had never been one for wishful thinking, but at the moment, he wished he could sweep Daisy into his arms and carry her back to that suite in the hotel. The flush that rose in Daisy\u0027s cheeks told him she was remembering it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in,\" Daisy said, and then she saw Rhys, who was standing slightly behind Erik, his long legs slightly spread, his arms crossed over his chest. Attired all in black, he looked both forbidding and formidable. \"Come in,\" she said again, and hoped she wasn\u0027t making a horrible mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik and Rhys followed her into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex had gained his feet and now stood in front of the sofa, a wooden stake tightly clasped in one hand. He glared at Erik. \"What\u0027s he doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, both of you,\" Erik said, glancing from Erik to Daisy. \"He\u0027s just here to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right.\" Alex moved up beside Daisy, then took another step forward, putting himself between Daisy and Rhys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik\u0027s gaze met Daisy\u0027s. \"Do you trust me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Stepping around Alex, she put her hand in Erik\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik glanced at Daisy\u0027s brother, who stood there glowering at him. \"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as far as I can throw you,\" Alex retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCostain\u0027s amused laughter washed over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex glared at him. \"What\u0027s so funny, bloodsucker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy, hunter,\" Rhys said. \"The fact that you\u0027re still breathing should prove you\u0027re in no danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right, you know,\" Daisy said. \"Come on, Alex, let\u0027s all sit down and see what he has to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tension in the room was palpable as Alex resumed his seat on the sofa. His gaze never strayed from Costain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy sat beside her brother, her hands folded tightly in her lap. Despite her outward calm, she was trembling inside. The combined power of Erik and Rhys danced over her skin like static electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik sat on the arm of the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an effort to put Daisy and Alex at ease, Rhys moved to the far side of the room, where he stood with his arms crossed over his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex and Rhys eyed each other warily as Erik outlined his plan. \"It\u0027s pretty simple, really. Alex, you\u0027ll e-mail your contact and tell them you\u0027ve destroyed Rhys and you want to set up a time to collect the reward...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not gonna take my word for it,\" Alex said, crossing his arms over his chest. \"What are you planning to use for bait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fireplace ashes,\" Erik replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might work,\" Alex said. \"But not for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik shrugged. \"By the time he realizes it\u0027s a trap, we\u0027ll have him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys glanced from Erik to Alex. \"Just remember, he\u0027s mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy would have objected, but the hard edge in Costain\u0027s voice and the predatory gleam in his hooded gaze brooked no argument, and neither Erik nor Alex offered any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what do you say, Alex?\" Erik asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex blew out a sigh. \"I\u0027m in, but I\u0027m sure gonna miss that two hundred grand,\" he said glumly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys grinned at him. \"If this works, I\u0027ll make good on the reward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hell!\" Alex exclaimed. \"Let\u0027s do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took only minutes for Alex to sign on to Daisy\u0027s computer. Rhys, Daisy, and Erik stood in a semicircle behind his chair as he opened his e-mail program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis message was short and to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave destroyed Costain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProof is in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere and when can we meet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex hit Send, then sat back in the chair, his elbows resting on the arms, his gaze focused on the screen. \"All we have to do now is wait for a reply.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik looked at Rhys. \"You\u0027ll have to lay low until we hear something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I hadn\u0027t thought about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can stay here.\" Daisy glared at Alex, silencing the argument she saw in his eyes. \"No one will think to look for you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" Rhys grinned at Erik. \"I guess I owe you an apology. Remind me to say I\u0027m sorry in a hundred years or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. And now. if you two don\u0027t mind, I\u0027d like to spend a little time alone with Daisy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind,\" Rhys said with a leer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex pushed away from the desk and stood up, his hands clenched at his sides. \"Well, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not up to you,\" Erik retorted. Taking Daisy\u0027s hand in his, he gave it a squeeze. \"What do you say, darlin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say, let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Daisy,\" Alex muttered, \"I don\u0027t like you going off with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex glared at Erik, then stomped out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy smiled tentatively at Rhys. \"Make yourself at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember,\" Erik warned, \"you can\u0027t let anyone know where you are. And you can\u0027t leave here until this is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah,\" Costain muttered irritably. \"But if we don\u0027t hear something soon...\" He looked at Daisy, his gaze lingering on the pulse throbbing in the hollow of her throat. \"I\u0027ll need something to nibble on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy blew out a sigh. \"How long do you think it will be before Alex gets an answer to his e-mail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know, and right now, I don\u0027t care.\" Lowering his head, he brushed a kiss across Daisy\u0027s lips. \"Where would you like to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care. Anyplace where we can be alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, Erik wrapped Daisy in his embrace and then, with an effort of will, he transported the two of them to the balcony of Costain\u0027s primary lair. A wave of his hand unlocked the French doors and he ushered her inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we?\" Daisy wandered around the room, thinking she had never seen anything so luxurious. The carpet beneath her feet must have been two inches deep. The furniture was butter-soft black leather. The fireplace was white marble veined with gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Costain\u0027s place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not serious?\" She glanced at the statue of a golden-haired Madonna standing in one corner, thinking such a thing was an odd decorating choice for a vampire\u0027s lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik shrugged. \"He won\u0027t be using it tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" Her protest died in her throat when she spied the painting hanging over the fireplace. \"Is that a genuine Matisse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded. Rhys was quite the collector. The floors below were filled with antiques and original masters from the last four centuries, along with Persian carpets and dozens of artifacts that were presumed lost or destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it your friend is pretty well off financially.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it\u0027s not surprising. He\u0027s had a long time to save his money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik chuckled as he drew her into his arms. \"Do you want to talk about Rhys all night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you have in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giving you a tour of the place,\" he said with a wicked grin. \"Starting here, and ending in the bedroom.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-43.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
