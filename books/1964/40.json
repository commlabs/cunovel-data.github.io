She needed privacy in order to analyze her feelings, but at the same time, she didn’t want Chase to leave, because once he did, she’d be forced to confront her weakness for Tony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric came into the kitchen, munching loudly on a cookie. “Lesley’s the best cook I ever met,” he announced, looking proud to be her neighbor. His jeans had large rips in the knees and his T-shirt was badly stained, but his cheerful expression was infectious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A better cook than Mom,” Kevin agreed, rubbing his forearm over his mouth to remove any crumbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even Dr. Seuss is a better cook than Mom. Remember the time she made us green eggs and ham for breakfast? Except they weren’t supposed to be.” Both boys laughed and grabbed another cookie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say, you two ever been fishing?” Chase asked unexpectedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.” They gazed up at Chase with wide, eager eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was planning to ask Lesley to go fishing tomorrow and I thought it might be fun if you two came along. You think you could talk your mom into letting you join us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll ask,” Eric said, racing from the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to ask,” Kevin shouted, running after his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley made a pot of coffee. She wasn’t gullible; she knew exactly why Chase had included the boys. He wanted to see her again and knew she wouldn’t refuse him if it meant disappointing her ragamuffin neighbors. She said as much when she brought two mugs of coffee to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What would you do if I said I couldn’t go with you?” she asked, sitting across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe healing calm she’d experienced earlier with Chase on Mount Rainier had been shattered by Tony’s call. She hadn’t realized how frail that newfound peace had been or how easily it could be destroyed. She hated the fact that Tony continued to wield such power over her, especially when she felt she’d made strides in letting go of her love for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The boys and I’d miss you,” Chase said after a moment, “but I’d never disappoint those two. Every boy should go fishing at some point in his life. I’d like it if you’d come, but I’ll understand if you’d prefer to stay home.” He sipped his coffee and seemed to be waiting for a response from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it be all right if I let you know in the morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door flew open and Eric and Kevin shot into the room like bullets, breathless with excitement. “Mom said we could go! But she needs to know how much money we need and what we should bring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell her you don’t need a dime and all you have to bring is an extra set of clothes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six sounds good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the morning?” Kevin’s eyes rounded with dismay. “We don’t usually get up before nine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to catch trout, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll be ready,” Eric said, elbowing his brother in the ribs. “Isn’t that right, Kevin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ow. Yeah, we’ll be ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Then I’ll see you boys bright and early tomorrow morning.” Chase ushered them to the door, while Lesley sat at the table, hiding her amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Chase returned, he surprised her by taking one last sip of his coffee and carrying the mug to her sink. He came back to the table, placed his hand on her shoulder and kissed her cheek. “I’ll talk to you later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re leaving?” Suddenly it became vital that he stay because once he left, she feared the temptation to return Tony’s call would be too strong to control, too easy to rationalize. Standing abruptly, she folded her arms and stared up at him, struggling with herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t want me to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged and finally admitted the truth. “I…want you to help me understand why Tony would phone me out of the blue like this. I want you to help me figure out what I should do, but more importantly, I need you to remind me how wrong it would be to call him. I can’t—won’t—betray my own principles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” Chase said, sounding genuinely regretful. “Those are things you’ve got to figure out on your own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll give you a call in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t you going to kiss me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated and desire was clear on his face. “I’d like nothing better, but I don’t think I should.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” She moved closer, so close she could feel his breath against her face, so close that all she needed to do was ease forward and her lips would meet his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think it’d be a good idea just now.” His voice was low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you to kiss me,” she said, pressing her palms against his shirt and waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish…” she continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breathing was erratic, but so was her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you wish?” His mouth wandered to her neck and she sighed at the feel of his lips against her skin. She angled her head back, revealing her eagerness for his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You already know what I want,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe planted slow kisses on her throat, pausing to moisten the hollow with the tip of his tongue. Shivers of awareness rippled down her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth sought his and he kissed her, his lips soft and undemanding. She slipped her arms around his neck and nestled into his arms, needing the security of his touch to ground her in reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he kissed her again, she moaned, lifting her hand to the back of his head, urging him closer. “Oh, Chase,” she breathed once the kiss had ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his head and touched her forehead with his lips. “A man could get used to hearing a woman say his name like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Her response sounded inane, but conversation was beyond her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marry me, Lesley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe risked a glance at his face and felt emotion well up in her throat. Blinking rapidly, she managed to hold the tears at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” he said. “We’ll do this your way, in increments. Will you join the boys and me in the morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was hoping you would.” He kissed the tip of her nose. “I have to leave now. Trust me, I’d much rather stay, but I can’t and we both know why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley did know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t fair to use Chase as a shield against Tony. She would have to stand alone, make her own decisions, and Chase understood that more clearly than she had herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll see you at six in the morning,” he whispered, and released her. As if he couldn’t wait that long to kiss her again, he lowered his mouth to hers, kissed her longingly, then slowly turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the front door closing followed seconds later, and Lesley stood in the middle of her kitchen with the phone just inches away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A trout can sure put up a big fight,” Eric said with a satisfied look in his brother’s direction after he’d caught his first fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of them were standing on the banks of Green River, their lines dangling in the water. Through pure luck, Eric had managed to catch the first trout. While Chase helped the boy remove the squirming fish from the line and rebait his hook, Lesley whispered reassurances to Kevin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, you’ll snag one, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what if I don’t?” Kevin asked, hanging his head. “Eric always gets everything first just ’cause he’s older. It isn’t fair. It just isn’t fair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sooner were the words out of his mouth than his line dipped with such force that he nearly lost his fishing rod. His triumphant gaze flew to Lesley. “I’ve got one!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase immediately went over to the younger boy, coaxing him as he had Eric, tutoring him until the boy had reeled in the trout and Chase was able to take the good-size fish from the hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is mine bigger than Eric’s?” Kevin demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll have to check that for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup, mine’s bigger,” Kevin announced a moment later with a smug look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley found the younger boy’s conviction amusing, but said nothing. To prove his point, Kevin held up both fish and asked Lesley to judge, but it was impossible to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spent most of the morning fishing, until both boys had reached their limit. Although Chase had brought Lesley a fishing rod, she didn’t do much fishing herself. Twice she got a fish on the line, but both times she let the boys reel them in for her. Chase did the same, letting the boys experience the thrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy eleven o’clock, all four were famished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s have trout for lunch,” Chase suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought Lesley made sandwiches,” Kevin said, eyeing the fish suspiciously. “I don’t like fish, unless it’s fish and chips, and then I’ll eat it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because you’ve never had anyone cook trout the way the Indians do.” Chase explained a method of slow cooking, wrapping the fish in leaves and mud and burying them in the coals, which had even Lesley’s mouth watering in anticipation. He also explained the importance of never allowing the fish they’d caught to go to waste. The boys nodded solemnly as if they understood the wisdom of his words. By then, Lesley guessed, they both thought Chase walked on water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to need your help,” he said, instructing the boys to gather kindling for the fire. “Then you can help me clean the trout.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t need me for this, will you?” Lesley asked hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Women are afraid of guts,” Eric explained for Chase’s benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They go all weird over that kind of stuff. Mom’s the same way. One time, the neighbor’s cat, a black one named Midnight…you know Midnight, don’t you, Lesley?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Midnight brought a dead bird into the yard and Mom started going all weird and yelling. We thought someone was trying to murder her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought Dad was back,” Eric inserted, and Chase’s eyes connected briefly with Lesley’s and for an instant fire leapt into his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, Mom asked Kevin and me to bury it. I don’t think she’s ever forgiven Midnight, either. She gives him mean looks whenever he comes to visit and shoos him away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the boys were discussing a woman’s aversion to the sight of blood, Lesley brought out the plastic tablecloth and spread it over a picnic table close to where they’d parked the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s another thing,” Eric said knowingly, motioning toward her. “A woman wants to make everything fancy. Real men don’t eat on a tablecloth. Kevin and I never would if it wasn’t for Mom and Lesley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t forget Grandma,” Kevin said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-40.html","bookId":1964,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM"}
