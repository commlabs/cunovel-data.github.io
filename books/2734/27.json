Again? Why doesn’t he just do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because if you do it, he cannot be blamed. It won’t be a coup. And he’ll just take right over. Everyone’s allegiance will be to him. Cartels, my girl, are archaic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t call me that,” I hissed at her. “I am not your girl. I cannot put up with any more of your lies. Everything you’ve ever told me is a lie. You’re just like him.” Whether I meant Travis or Javier by that it didn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to go, now,” Camden said louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, the building rumbled and shook slightly, the light bulb swaying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell was that?” I asked, automatically looking to my mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked bewildered. “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Javier,” Camden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother’s mouth dropped open. “Javier is here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He brought us here,” I told her. “How else would have we found you? How else would he have insured that I would keep going after Gus?” My voice cracked over his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He ditched us in the jungle on the way here,” Camden filled in. “Obviously knowing we would keep coming. I guess he was waiting for us to make the first move. Either he’s gotten impatient or they somehow know we’re down here with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, fuck this,” I said and quickly took my lock-picking tools to the cage she was being kept in. Once I had gotten that open, I crawled in beside her and got her handcuffs off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her raw wrists and looked at me proudly. “I taught you well. You always were the best at picking locks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lip automatically curled. “You shouldn’t be proud at me for being a con artist, for being like you. You should be proud that I’m bothering to get you out of here after everything you’ve done to me.” I grabbed her by her arm and pulled her up and out of the cage, ignoring the look on her face, like I’d slapped her. “Can you walk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed hard but nodded. “Yes. I’ve only been in there for a few days. I … I talked back to him the other night and …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my hand. “I don’t want to hear it.” I looked at Camden. “You’ll take care of her okay?” Before he could answer, I snatched the other gun from his pocket and ran toward the stairs just as I heard gunfire breaking out upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellie!” Camden screamed at me, full-on horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I kept running, gun in each hand, taking the stairs two by two to the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting Gus back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was going to make everyone pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slammed the door open into the hall and was surprised to already see a guard running toward me. I quickly raised my gun and shot him in the head before he had a chance to aim at me. Then I kicked the door back shut, my gun already pointed straight forward and saw Dom at the opposite end of the hallway. I figured the guard was running toward someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDom froze where he was, his gun also drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you fucking move!” I screamed at him. “Don’t you fucking move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his credit, Dom stayed put. I had a feeling it’s because he wasn’t allowed to kill me. I was going to have to make that work in my favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran down the hall toward him but when I crossed the foyer I was met with glass breaking and bullets riddling the walls. I kept running, noticing there was fire coming up from behind where Dom was, filling the end of the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped in front of him and immediately pistol whipped him across his nose. He cried out, grabbing his face and dropping his gun. I scooped it up, sticking it in my boots. Now I had three guns. I had a feeling I could never have enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore bullets and shots came from the foyer. I quickly grabbed Dom and swung him around the corner into the laundry room, shutting the door behind us. I slammed his head against the door, stuck the end of my gun against his temple, and yelled, “Talk! Tell me every fucking thing you know or I will kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me in utter fear, at my eyes which must have shown the rage that was flowing through me. What had Javier said earlier about depravity? Well he must have known I had that in spades, just waiting for the right moment for me to snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I had snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talk!” I screamed again, my spit flying into his bloody face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were set up,” he said, panicking. “From the start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You fuck! And you said you liked me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked several times. “I do like you. But I love my family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the gun harder into his head. “What was the plan? Where is Gus?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were supposed to be a diversion. You’d kill Travis and we’d swoop in, secure the compound. I don’t know where Gus is, I don’t. Javier said he was being kept somewhere for future use. I don’t know what that means. He’s alive, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take me to Javier,” I told him, pulling him off the door and jamming the gun into his lower back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over his shoulder. “He’s in a firefight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said, “Derek and Este are in a firefight. Javier is somewhere else, biding his time. Waiting for me. Take me to him. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, I have a wife and child,” he pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t kill you if you do as I say,” I told him, meaning it, too. I didn’t want to kill Dom but I was realizing I was prepared to if absolutely necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t but Javier will,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s your problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother explosion rocked the house, this time from the opposite wing. We stumbled a bit and Dom went for his gun but I had my gun back on him in no time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so,” I said. I nodded at the door I had broken into last night, the one leading to the backyard. “Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kicked open the door and hoped that Camden and my mother were somewhere safe. “Who is setting off the explosions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Derek,” he said. “Improvised Explosive Devices.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he accidently kills Camden or my mother, everyone here dies, including you. Tell him to rein it in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t–”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you’re communicating to each other, do it now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDom sighed and pressed the Bluetooth device in his ear while I did a quick scan of the area. I could see the pool glistening in the distance, a single body floating in it. Several statues on the grounds were cracked or knocked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Derek,” Dom said. “Stop the explosions and hold. Take out only Travis’s men. If you see McQueen or any of the Watts, do not shoot, do not engage. We need them alive. Copy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDom nodded at whatever Derek said in his ear. “Okay,” he said to me. “He’s been called off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucky you,” I said. “Where’s Javier?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darted to the pool house, a small cottage with a single darkened window that was open a crack. Just enough space for a gun to fit through. Of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s not going to kill me, right?” I asked Dom as I readied myself to run across the lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Javier? No. We were ordered not to kill you or Camden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How nice. The bombs don’t really help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We didn’t know where you were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, here I am.” I looked around me then nodded at the cottage. “I’ll try and cover us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started running for it, both Dom and I running as fast as we could, knowing there was a lot of ground between the main house and the pool house. We were only a few yards away when bullets started whizzing past us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and looked up at the roof of the house to see a sniper up there, taking shots at us as we ran. I aimed both guns at the roof and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy aim was terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t hit the sniper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, the sniper hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy leg exploded in pain and I stumbled to the ground as the bullet seared through my calf. The cherry blossoms offered no defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cried out, my gun falling away from my hands, and tried to crawl toward it. I barely managed to get it and quickly rolled on to my back aiming the gun at the roof when the sniper was hit before I could even pull the trigger. He stumbled backward and then slid off the room to his death on the hot patio below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around to look at Dom who had been brought down to the ground with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow appeared overhead. I looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavier was standing over me, blocking out the sun, a rifle in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Camden still alive?” he asked me in a strangely hopeful voice, as if Camden mattered to him more at the moment than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed my gun straight up at him, my hand shaking from the bursts of pain that rocked my body in pure agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. But you won’t be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You going to pull the trigger, angel?” he asked. “After I just saved your life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinded my teeth together in nauseating anger. “You lied to me. You lied to me.” I tried in vain to keep my hand steady. “You lied about Gus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, eyes glowing with madness. “I did lie. You wouldn’t have come here otherwise. You would have never fulfilled your destiny. To kill the man who ruined so many of our lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was done. So fucking done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me where Gus is or I’ll blow your fucking brains out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have it in you, angel. You’re too good for that now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was no longer a matter of good or bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was all grey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHazy, fuzzy grey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chamber clicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd though Javier’s face was shadowed from the sun, I saw something in his eyes that I had never seen before. Absolute disbelief. Absolute shock. Absolute … fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I felt relief that he was still standing there, alive. I did have it in me to kill him, that dark part of me that wanted him dead. But now I had nothing to regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whimpered and rolled over, grasping my leg as another wave of pain rolled through while he stood there above me, in the middle of a firefight, absolutely dumbfounded by what had just happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the ground around us erupted in another spray of bullets. I screamed and quickly rolled over, trying to get out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Javier turned and ran back toward the pool house, toward safety, leaving me there on the grass, bleeding, while the bullets came closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving me alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving me to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I had pulled the trigger first. The honeymoon really was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled over onto my stomach, avoiding getting too close to Dom who lay dead beside me, and watched as he ran, wondering if there was a point in me crawling after him. I wondered how long I had before I died. I wondered if I’d ever see Camden again. I wondered if my life made a difference to anyone out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just wanted another chance at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother chance to be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScars and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while I was lying on the grass, my leg bleeding out, soaking my jeans, I heard a few more pops of bullets go out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJavier was running into the pool house when he was struck in the back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bold-tricks-the-artists-trilogy-3/page-27.html","bookId":2734,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:05 PM"}
