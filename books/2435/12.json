He hadn\u0027t dreamed. His daytime thoughts went on going even when he lay there with his eyes shut for hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d wondered what happened to you when you didn\u0027t dream for days. Hallucinations while you were walking around?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, though, he was definitely drifting when he felt the touch on his ankle. A smooth, rubbery feeling. For a moment he was paralyzed, and a moment was all it took. The rubbery feeling wound its way up his leg, his stomach, his chest. It tightened like a living rope, cutting off his breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach\u0027s eyes flew open, and he saw clearly the head of the snake staring into his face. Its eyes were two dots of shining light; its mouth was open so wide it looked as if its jaw were dislocated. As if it were going to eat him. Out of that gaping mouth came an endless menacing hisssssssss....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to move, Zach stared up at the swaying shape. Then, somehow, his perspective changed. His eyes ached from staring, but he couldn\u0027t see the snake\u0027s head anymore. The two dots of light looked more like two of the glow-in-the-dark stars he\u0027d stuck on his ceiling when he was eight-he\u0027d scraped most of them off when his father yelled, but a few remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t hear the hiss now, either. Only the shhshhshhshh of the air-conditioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms and legs were tangled up in the bedclothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, he thought, and kicked the sheet and blanket off. He got up and turned on the light. Now he knew what happened when you went for days without dreaming. Of course there was no snake in his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing he wanted to do was lie down again, though. Might as well go out to the garage. Even if he couldn\u0027t work, it might take his mind off things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he got to the garage, the snake was waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t like a real snake. It was a surrealist painter\u0027s idea of a snake-swirls of darkness that bunched and surged in a snakelike motion. Blue-white light connecting murky segments of body. A sort of combination between a snake and a lightning bolt in a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came toward him with the blind hunching of a tomato worm. It was at least ten feet long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could get it over into the corner, Zach thought, his mind cold and clear ... He glanced at the corner\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the garage where his 6x6 SLR stood on a tripod. If he could get it over there, he was almost sure he could get a picture of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t stupid. He saw the danger he was in. But the idea of photographing this thing-seeing what it would look like on film-drove every other thought out of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time he\u0027d cared about getting a picture since the day of the Game. All at once his artist\u0027s block disappeared, his creativity came rushing back. This was real unreality. It might be unsafe, but it was strangely beautiful, too. It was Art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was desperate to capture it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTry the 35 millimeter first, his mind told him. It\u0027s closer. Eyes fixed on the wonderfully artistic monster, he reached for the camera on the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clock in Dee\u0027s jeep said 5:45. More than an hour later than it had been in Jenny\u0027s dream of Michael\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God, we\u0027re going to be too late,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was her fault. She hadn\u0027t woken up in time. Even with Julian\u0027s warning, she hadn\u0027t woken up in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry up, Dee! Hurry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrees were silhouetted against a flamingo dawn when they reached Zach\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go through the garage,\" Tom said as they all jumped out of the jeep. \"Last time I was here, the door was unlocked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach wouldn\u0027t be so stupid tonight, Jenny thought, but there was no time to argue. She was following the others at a run to the side door of the garage. The door opened under Tom\u0027s hand, and they all burst inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garage light was on. There was a sharp, strange smell to the air. A dark circle of soot on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn its center was a paper doll with gray eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was too late,\" Jenny said stupidly, looking down at the paper-doll Zach she was holding. It stared back at her, the fine lines of its face shaded by Zach\u0027s artist\u0027s hand. The penciled eyes seemed vaguely surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee was rubbing the soot between her fingers. Tom was standing in front of the corner where Zach\u0027s camera and a tungsten floodlamp lay knocked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a fight,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael just licked his lips and shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His parents must not have heard anything,\" Jenny said slowly, after a moment. \"Or they\u0027d be down here. So we\u0027d better write them a note-from Zach, saying that he\u0027s gone to school already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael\u0027s voice was subdued. \"You\u0027re crazy. We can\u0027t keep this up. Eventually some of your parents are going to talk to each other-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What good is it going to do my aunt and uncle to know Zach\u0027s gone? What can they do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put us in orange coveralls,\" Dee said from the floor. \"Too many disappearances,\" she added succinctly. \"If we lose any more friends, we\u0027re going to jail. Now, come on, stop talking, and let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny crept into the house and wrote the note before they left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the car Tom said, \"I don\u0027t see how we can go to school ourselves. Not and stick together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll have to take the day off,\" Dee said. \"Gosh, too bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael looked at her balefully from the front passenger seat. \"You\u0027re enjoying this, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a distinctly uncivilized smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to figure out where the base is,\" Jenny was saying in the back seat. She\u0027d controlled herself very well this time, she thought: no screaming or crying even when she saw the paper doll of Zach. But the rasping feeling of guilt was still with her. \"I haven\u0027t been very good at figuring out the clues so far,\" she said, keeping her voice level so the others wouldn\u0027t think she was drowning in self-pity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Julian wants it that way,\" Dee said. Jenny had told them about the dream-leaving out the kiss-on the drive to Zach\u0027s house. \"He\u0027s not playing this Game straight. We got the first clue in plenty of time, but it was too hard. The second clue was dead easy, but there wasn\u0027t time to do anything about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have woken up sooner,\" Jenny said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, Tom started to reach for her, and Jenny saw his face, all planes and shadows in the early morning light. Tom Locke even looked good at the crack of dawn; he woke up looking that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom\u0027s hand dropped back to his side. Jenny knew what it was without asking. She was sitting on his right in the car, and her left hand, with the ring, was in between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked out the window fiercely and pretended she didn\u0027t mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, there\u0027s one reason I did want to go to school today,\" she said. \"To try and find out about Eric-the guy Audrey was with. See if he\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could probably call his house and ask. I know him a little,\" Tom said, to show he was still talking to her, even if he wouldn\u0027t touch her. Oh, we\u0027re terribly courteous, Jenny thought. For all the good that does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can call from the apartment,\" Michael said. \"We should probably get some food first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I tell you what let\u0027s do,\" Dee said, her voice excited. \"Ixt\u0027s go see Aba.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This early?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not everybody sleeps like you, Mikey. Besides, she\u0027ll give us breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the back seat Jenny leaned forward. A heavy weight seemed to have lifted from her chest, at least for the moment. \"You\u0027re right,\" she said to Dee. \"Let\u0027s go see Aba. Maybe she knows what we should do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAba lived in a house beside Dee\u0027s mother\u0027s house. The two buildings were on the same property, but Aba\u0027s house had a distinctly different character. Dee and her friends always called it the Art Pavilion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne entire wing was devoted to Aba\u0027s craft, centering around the studio where she did her sculpting. The large, airy room was all soaring asymmetrical walls and skylights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAba was at work when the children came in, taking moist gray clay from a bowl and slapping it on a wire armature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it going to be?\" Dee asked, coming up behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning,\" Aba said firmly, and when they\u0027d all said good morning, she said, \"A bust ofNeetu Badhu, your mother\u0027s manicurist. She has a very interesting face, and she\u0027s due here at seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027d better hurry,\" Dee said. \"Is it okay if we use your phone? And get some breakfast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are caramel rolls in the kitchen,\" Aba said, \"Get them-and then come back and tell me why you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the others went to the kitchen, Tom got on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric\u0027s okay,\" he said when he hung up. \"He was home from school today, but there\u0027s nothing really wrong with him. The police are interested in talking with anybody who saw the attack, though-which means Audrey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael stopped eating his roll. \"Which means they might be trying to track her down,\" he said. \"Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it, Mikey,\" Dee said comfortingly. \"You\u0027ll probably be next, so you won\u0027t be here when our Great Deception comes crashing down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dee,\" Aba said, \"have you been telling lies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. Our whole life these last few days has been a tissue of fibs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAba shook her head and wiped her clay-smeared hands on her denim smock. \"Now,\" she said to the group, \"tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they did. They told her the truth about what had been happening since they\u0027d been released from the police station; how they\u0027d been looking for the paper house, how they\u0027d found it, what Julian had said to Jenny about the new Game. And what had happened to Zach and Audrey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAba listened to it all, her beautiful old face grave and attentive. When seven o\u0027clock came, she sent the manicurist away, covered the bust with a wet cloth, and kept listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they finished, she sat quietly for a moment. fenny half expected her to say something about how wrong it was to deceive their parents-Aba was an adult, after all. She half expected Aba to say that Dee couldn\u0027t stay with the rest of them because it was too dangerous. And, although she didn\u0027t expect it, she wished passionately that Aba would say, \"Here\u0027s the answer,\" and solve all their problems for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAba did none of these things. Instead, after several minutes of quiet sitting, she said, \"You know, last light I dreamed a Hausa story my mother used to tell me, It\u0027s been a long, long time since I thought of that story. I wonder if I didn\u0027t dream it for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Maybe I was meant to tell it to you.\" She sat back and thought for a moment, then began, \"The story is about a boy and a girl who were in love. But one day, as they were sitting on their mat together, Iblis came along and cut off the boy\u0027s head and killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iblis?\" The name sounded vaguely familiar to Jenny. \"Who\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms,\" Aba said gravely, \"is the prince of darkness, the prince of the aljunnu- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The genies,\" Dee said, her eyes flashing at Jenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Aba said. \"But in our folklore the aljunnu were not kind genies. They were powerful and evil pits, and Iblis was their leader. My mother never told me why he cut the boy\u0027s head off-but then Iblis always liked to do evil and mischief; maybe he had to particular reason. In any case, Iblis killed the boy, and the girl could do nothing but sit on the mat and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecry. After a while the boy\u0027s parents came along, and when they saw what had happened, they began to cry, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Iblis came back. He waved his hand, and the ground rocked. In front of the boy there appeared a river of fire, a river of water, and a river of cobras. And Iblis turned to the boy\u0027s mother and said, \"If you would like to bring your son back to life, all you have to do is swim through the three rivers to get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right,\" Michael muttered almost inaudibly. Aba smiled at him and went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" she said, \"the boy\u0027s mother was afraid. She turned to her husband, but he was just as frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the girl jumped up. \u0027I\u0027ll do it,\u0027 she said. Naturally, she was terribly afraid, but her love for the boy was stronger than her fear. Without another word the girl dived into the river of fire. The ire burned her, of course-my mother always said \u0027the fire burned her like fire\u0027-but she swam through it and leaped into the river of water. And the water choked her-like water-but the girl struggled through it and fell into the river of snakes. And the snakes struck at her-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-like snakes-\" Dee put in, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-but the girl managed to stumble through them, and the next thing she knew she had reached the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as she touched him, the boy\u0027s head flew to his shoulders and he jumped up, alive and well. Iblis left, cursing, to do his mischief in some other part of the world. And I suppose the boy and the girl got married, although I don\u0027t really remember what my mother said about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Aba said, looking around at them. \"That\u0027s the story as my mother told it to me. I don\u0027t know what meaning it has for you-maybe none. But you\u0027ve heard it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it just means that love can be stronger than fear,\" Jenny said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it means you can\u0027t trust your parents,\" Michael said, absolutely deadpan, and Aba laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like Jenny\u0027s interpretation better. But as I said, there may be no meaning. Or possibly it\u0027s just a story about the relative powers of good and evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked up quickly. \"Do you believe in good and evil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. Very strongly. And I believe that evil sometimes has to be fought-personally. Hand to hand. If you care enough to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael stirred. \"You know what they say about kids our age. That we don\u0027t care about right or wrong or anything. That we don\u0027t even care about the future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, like the Baby Busters,\" Dee said, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw, we\u0027re too young even to be Baby Busters. We\u0027re the Busted Babies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny spoke seriously. \"It\u0027s not true. We do care. You care, Michael, more than just about anybody I\u0027ve ever known. You pretend you don\u0027t, but you do. And that\u0027s why Audrey loves-\" She stopped because Michael was looking away, his sarcastic spaniel eyes filmed over. \"We\u0027re going to find Audrey,\" she said, her own throat tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Michael said and rubbed at the bridge of his nose with his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could help,\" Aba said. \"But I\u0027m an old woman. My fighting days are over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, mine aren\u0027t,\" Dee said, raising a slim arm to examine the hard muscle under velvet skin. \"Mine are just starting.\" Aba looked at her and smiled slightly. For years she and Dee had fought about Dee preferring kung fu to college and insisting that she didn\u0027t want to do anything brainy like her mother or arty like her grandmother. But just then Jenny knew Aba was proud of her warrior granddaughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s our fight anyway,\" Jenny said. \"He wont let anyone else into the Game. The original players, he said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Aba said, looking directly at her, \"that if anyone can find your friends, it will be you, Jenny.\" Her eyes were very gentle and very sad; they reminded Jenny of pictures of Albert Einstein. At that moment Jenny thought that Aba really was more beautiful than Dee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try,\" Jenny said. As the old woman turned away, Jenny just caught the murmured words, \"But I wonder what the cost will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore they left, Aba let them raid the kitchen. They took cottage cheese and cold chicken breasts; cereal and microwave brownies and grapes and pippin apples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way back they stopped by Audrey\u0027s house and picked up Audrey\u0027s car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael\u0027s living room was beginning to look like the aftermath of a very long party, Jenny thought as they walked into the apartment. The furniture had been pushed to the extreme edges of the room to make room for the mattresses and sleeping bags on the floor. The plaid couch was a nest of rumpled blankets. Empty Coke cans were scattered everywhere, and most flat surfaces were crowded with books or clothes or stacks of dirty dishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Dee said, coming in from the kitchen with Michael. \"Now what about that base?\" She sat down on a footstool with a bowl of cottage cheese and chopped apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have enough information,\" Jenny said. \"He hasn\u0027t told me enough.\" Every time she said he, Tom walled up. There was no help for it, just as there was no help for the shining thing on her finger. It caught every glint of the spring sunlight coming in Michael\u0027s front window, and she swore she could feel the words on the inside of the band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been trying to think,\" she said, \"about abandoned buildings or things-places around here he might hold them. But that doesn\u0027t seem right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In mysteries,\" Michael said thoughtfully, \"things are always hidden in the least likely place. Or the most obvious place-because you always think that\u0027s the least likely. I guess it couldn\u0027t be the paper house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was trashed,\" Jenny said. \"I don\u0027t think it would hold anything. Besides, how could we get in on our own? It was Julian who brought us in last time.\" She knew, somehow, that Julian\u0027s base wasn\u0027t in the paper house. And she knew something else: Julian wouldn\u0027t find the Game amusing unless there was a chance of them finding the base. He would put it somewhere they could get to-if they were smart enough to figure out where to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess the More Games store is too obvious,\" Michael murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too obvious and gone,\" said Jenny. \"It\u0027s just a mural now. No, Julian would put it somewhere clever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Tom?\" Dee said. \"You have an idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom was wearing the look he wore mostly these days-one of abstraction. Just now he also seemed disturbed. He got up and walked toward the kitchen, fingers in his back pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think you know something ...\" Dee said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Nothing.\" Tom shook his head and sat back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, let\u0027s go back to the beginning,\" Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it didn\u0027t help. They talked uselessly through the morning and most of the afternoon, until an elderly woman came and rang the doorbell, demanding that Michael move Audrey\u0027s car because it was in her parking space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee went down with him. Tom paced the hallway slowly while Jenny sat on the couch staring aimlessly out the window. They were stuck, no closer to figuring out where the base was than they had been two days ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was tired. She let her eyelids shut, seeing the golden afternoon sunlight on her closed lids. Then suddenly the light went dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s eyes flew open. Although it had been a bright, cloudless day, there was some sort of mist coating the window. Preventing her from seeing out. Jenny stared at it, pulse quickening, then she drew in her breath and leaned closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t mist-that would have been strange enough. But it was something stranger than that. It was ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTouched by the Frost King, Jenny\u0027s mother used to say back in Pennsylvania when the windows iced up like that. Jenny hadn\u0027t seen it since she was five years old. In those days she\u0027d loved to trace things in the frost with the warmth of her finger... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was appearing on the window as if traced by an unseen finger. A letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny couldn\u0027t breathe. Her mouth opened to call for Tom, but no sound came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI. T. T.L.E....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle. The letters appeared slowly as if a fingertip were tracing them on the icy window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM. I. S. S. M. U. F. F. E. T. S. A. T... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny watched, scalp crawling. She couldn\u0027t seem to make herself move. It was too strange, to be sitting here in daylight and seeing something that simply couldn\u0027t happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0. N. A. T. U. F. F. E. T. E. A. T. I. N. G. H. E. R....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s me, Jenny thought, gripped by an irrational certainty. This time it\u0027s me he\u0027s after. I\u0027m Miss Muffet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC. U. R. D. S. A. N. D. W. H. E. Y. A. L. O. N. G....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill unable to move, Jenny\u0027s eyes shifted upward. A spider. She was afraid of spiders, and crickets, and all crawly, jumpy things. She expected to see a thread descending from the ceiling, but there was nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC. A. M. E. A. S.

Audrey\u0027s car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom,\" she whispered. And then suddenly she was moving, tearing her eyes from the letters that were still appearing. \"Tom, come here. Tom!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she ran she almost fell over the footstool where Dee had been sitting earlier. Eating cottage cheese, small curd.
