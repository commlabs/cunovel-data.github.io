{"id":97833,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have much time to ask Dee about this other brother in English AP because I was late getting to class. And I was still too hurt to broach the topic with her. I couldn\u0027t believe they had another brother and never once mentioned him. Or mention their parents, their significant others, or what they do when they take off for a day or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he\u0027d disappeared? Died? My heart ached for them even though they obviously hadn\u0027t told me everything. I knew what it was like to lose someone. On top of all of that, there was something just flat-out odd about the fact that two different families with triplets moved to the same small town in a matter of days, but Dee had said the Thompsons were friends of the family. Maybe it was planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter class, Dee was waylaid by Ash and a golden-haired boy who looked as though he could be a model. It took no stretch of the imagination to figure out that was one of her brothers. And when they\u0027d left her, all Dee said was to meet together at lunch before we had to rush off to our next classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBio was my next class, and Lesa was in that one. She sat at the table in front of me, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your first day going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Normal.\" Normal with the exception of everything I\u0027d learned. \"Yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boring and long already,\" she replied. \"I can\u0027t wait for this school year to be over. I\u0027m ready to get the hell out of Dodge, move to a normal town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A normal town?\" I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesa leaned back, placing her arms on my table. \"This town is the epicenter of weirdness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the people here, well, they don\u0027t act right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA three-fingered hillbilly danced in my head, but somehow I doubted that was what she meant. \"Dee said some of the people around here weren\u0027t friendly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snickered. \"She\u0027d say that.\" I frowned. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" Her eyes widened, and she shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean that as a bad thing, but some of the kids here and the folks in town aren\u0027t friendly toward her and the others like her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Others like her,\" I said slowly. \"I\u0027m not sure what that means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me either.\" Lesa shrugged. \"Like I said, people are weird around here. The town is weird. People are always claiming to see men in black running around - like black suits, not the actors. I think they\u0027re government. I\u0027ve actually seen them myself. Then there\u0027s the other things people claim to see.\" I remembered the guy at the grocery store. \"Like what?\" Grinning, Lesa glanced toward the front of the room. The teacher hadn\u0027t arrived yet. She scooted even closer and lowered her voice to a whisper. \"Okay, this is going to sound insane and let\u0027s get one thing straight. I don\u0027t believe any of this crap, okay?\" This sounded juicy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dark eyes twinkled. \"People around here have claimed that they\u0027ve seen these forms of light up near Seneca Rocks. Like these... people-shaped things of light. Some believe they\u0027re ghosts or aliens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aliens?\" I busted out laughing, drawing a few stares. \"I\u0027m sorry, but seriously?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously,\" she repeated, grinning. \"I don\u0027t believe it, but we actually get traffic around here from people looking for evidence. I kid you not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re like Point Pleasant around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, you\u0027re going to have to fill me in on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever heard of the Mothman?\" When she saw my look, she laughed. \"It\u0027s another crazy thing about this flying giant dragonfly that warns people before something bad happens. Up in Point Pleasant, some have reported seeing it before the bridge collapsed and killed a bunch of people. And days before that, they said they saw men in suits hanging around.\" I opened my mouth to respond, but our teacher walked in. At first, I didn\u0027t recognize him. His light brown hair was styled back from his forehead. His polo was pressed, nothing like the worn shirt and jeans I\u0027d last seen him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew was Mr. Garrison, my bio teacher - the same guy who\u0027d been at Daemon\u0027s house when we returned from the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked papers off his desk and looked up, his gaze scanning the class. His eyes landed on me, and I felt the blood drain from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" whispered Lesa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Garrison held my gaze a second longer and then looked away. I let out the breath I was holding. \"Yeah,\" I whispered, swallowing thickly. \"I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back in my chair, staring ahead blankly while Mr. Garrison launched right into class, going over our course material and labs we\u0027d be participating in. The obligatory animal autopsy was scheduled, much to my dismay. The idea of cutting into animals, dead or not, gave me the creeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not as badly as the creeps Mr. Garrison gave me. Throughout class, I\u0027d feel his concentrated gaze on me, and it was as if he was seeing right through me. What the hell was going on around here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe school cafeteria was near the gymnasium, a long and rectangular space that smelled of overcooked food and disinfectant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYum. White tables filled the room and most of them were already occupied by the time I got there. Standing in line, I recognized Carissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, spotted me, and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spaghetti on the menu, or at least what they consider spaghetti.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrimacing, I plopped some on my tray. \"It doesn\u0027t look too bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not after you\u0027ve seen the meatloaf.\" She added noodles to her plate, along with a side of salad. Then she picked up her drink. \"I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChocolate milk and spaghetti do not go together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they don\u0027t.\" I giggled, grabbing a bottle of water. \"Do they allow anyone off campus to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but they don\u0027t stop us when we do.\" Carissa handed a few dollars to the lunch lady, then turned to me. \"You have anyone to sit with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForking over cash, I nodded. \"Yeah, I\u0027m sitting with Dee. You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up. Carissa stared at me, openmouthed. \"I\u0027m sitting with Dee. I\u0027m sure you can sit - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I can\u0027t.\" Carissa grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched a brow. \"Really? Why? Are they social lepers or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed her glasses up her nose as she rolled her eyes. \"No. They\u0027re pretty cool and all, but the last girl to do so, like, disappeared.\" Knots formed in my stomach as I let out a nervous laugh. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said solemnly. \"She disappeared around the same time their brother did.\" I couldn\u0027t believe it. What else was I going to find out? Aliens? Men in black? The Mothman? That the tooth fairy was real?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarissa glanced over at a table full of friends. A few seats were open. \"Her name was Bethany Williams. She transferred to this school in the middle of her sophomore year, a little after they got here.\" She tipped her head to the back of the cafeteria. \"And she struck up a relationship with Dawson, and they both disappeared around the start of junior year.\" Why did that name sound familiar? Did it matter? There was so much I didn\u0027t know about Dee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, do you want to sit with us?\" Carissa asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, feeling bad for turning down her offer. \"I promised Dee I would sit with her today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarissa relented with a weak smile. \"Well, then maybe tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I smiled. \"Tomorrow, definitely.\" Readjusting my book bag, I took my plate of food toward the back of the cafeteria. I saw Dee immediately. She was chatting with one of the Thompson brothers while she twisted her midnight hair around her finger. Across from the one golden-haired god was another with his back to me, half sitting on the table. I wondered which one was her \u0027kind of\u0027 boyfriend. The table was full, except for two open spaces. All guys except Dee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I saw Ash\u0027s ultra shiny cap of blonde hair from behind the boy on the table. Oddly enough, she was sitting higher than everyone else. A moment later I realized why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sitting on Daemon\u0027s lap. Her arms were draped around his neck, and I watched her press her chest right up against him, smiling at what he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn\u0027t he tried to kiss me on the porch? I was pretty sure I hadn\u0027t imagined that. Daemon was a douchebag to the highest order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katy!\" Dee exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone at the table looked up. Even the one twin turned in his seat. His sky blue eyes widened upon seeing me. The other twin sat back, folding his arms. The scowl on his face was a work of art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit,\" Dee said, smacking the top of the table across from her. \"We were talking about - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Ash said. Her red painted lips twisted into a pout. \"You did not invite her to sit with us? Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knots returned in full force, rendering me speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Ash,\" grumbled the twin that had turned around. \"You\u0027re going to make a scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to make anything happen.\" Her arm around Daemon\u0027s neck tightened. \"She doesn\u0027t need to sit with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee sighed. \"Ash, stop being a bitch. She\u0027s not trying to steal Daemon from you.\" My cheeks flamed as I stood there awkwardly. Anger rolled off Ash in waves, spreading across the table, smacking into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m worried about.\" Ash snickered, her gaze drifting over me as her lip curled. \"For real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longer I stood there, the stupider I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes bounced from Dee to Daemon, but he was looking over Ash\u0027s shoulder, his jaw working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just sit,\" Dee said, motioning me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll get over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to put my plate down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon whispered, and Ash smacked his arm. Not lightly either. He pressed his cheek into her neck, and that dark and unwanted feeling sprung up deep inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dragged my eyes away from them, focusing on Dee. \"I don\u0027t know if I should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t,\" Ash snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Dee said, and then to me she said sweetly, \"I\u0027m sorry I know such hideous bitches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost smiled, but there was a burning in my chest that was spreading up my throat, down my back. \"Are you sure?\" I heard myself say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon lifted his head from Ash\u0027s neck long enough to rake a long, confusing look over me. \"I think it\u0027s obvious if you\u0027re wanted here or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daemon,\" hissed Dee, her cheeks red. She turned to me, tears in her eyes. \"He\u0027s not being serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you being serious, Daemon?\" Ash turned in his lap, head cocked to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart was already pounding in my chest when his eyes met mine. His were sheltered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually I was being serious.\" He leaned over the table, staring up at me through thick lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not wanted here.\" Dee spoke again, but I was beyond hearing. My face felt like it was on fire. People around us were starting to stare. One of the Thompson boys was smirking while the other looked as though he wanted to crawl underneath the table for me. The rest of the kids at the table were staring at their plates. One of them snickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never been more humiliated in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon turned away, staring over Ash\u0027s shoulder again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run along,\" Ash said, flicking her long, slender fingers at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the faces staring up at me, a mixture of pity and secondhand embarrassment, threw me back three years. To the first day I\u0027d returned to school after my dad had died. I broke down in English class, crying when I learned we\u0027d be reading A Tale of Two Cities, my dad\u0027s favorite story. Everyone had stared at me. Some felt bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers looked embarrassed for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt reminded me of the same looks the police and the nurses had given me at the hospital the night I\u0027d been attacked, reminding me of how helpless I\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d hated those looks then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I hated them now. There was no excuse for what I did next except that I wanted to -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneeded to...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands clenching the edges of the plastic tray, I leaned over the table and turned my plate upside down over Daemon\u0027s and Ash\u0027s heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChunks of noodles and spaghetti sauce fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the red gunk hit Ash and the noodles covered Daemon\u0027s broad shoulder. One long, stringy noodle slid over Daemon\u0027s ear and hung there, flopping around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an audible gasp that rang out through the surrounding tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee smacked a hand over her mouth, her eyes wide and full of barely restrained laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrieking, Ash leaped from Daemon\u0027s lap, her hands out to her sides, palms up. One would think I dumped blood on her considering the horrified look on her face. \"You...you...\" she sputtered, wiping the back of her hand down her sauce-stained cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon plucked a noodle off his ear and seemed to inspect it before he dropped them on the table. Then he did the oddest thing of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really laughed - a deep, stomach rumbling kind of laughter that reached his minty eyes and warmed them, causing them to sparkle like his sister\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh lowered her hands, balling them into fists. \"I will end you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon jumped up, throwing his arm around the girl\u0027s tiny waist. Whatever amusement he felt was long gone. \"Calm down,\" he ordered softly. \"I mean it. Calm down.\" She pulled against Daemon but didn\u0027t make it far. \"I swear to all the stars and suns, I will destroy you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean? Are you watching too many cartoons again?\" I was so over this bitch. I tested the weight of my arm in the splint and seriously thought about hitting someone for the first time in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second, I swore her eyes started to glow a bright amber from behind her irises. And then Mr. Garrison was suddenly there, standing at the edge of our table. \"I believe that\u0027s enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a switch being thrown, Ash sat down in her own seat. The edge on her rage dissipated as she eyed me and grabbed a fistful of napkins off the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon slowly picked a clump of long noodle off his shoulder and dropped them on the plate without speaking. I kept expecting him to explode on me, but like his sister, it looked as if he were trying not to laugh again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you should find another place to eat,\" Mr. Garrison said, voice low enough that only the people at our table could hear. \"Do so now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned, I grabbed my book bag and waited for him to tell me to see the principal or for other teachers in the room to intervene but that never came. Mr. Garrison stared at me. He waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it struck me. He was waiting for me to leave. Like the rest of them were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding numbly, I turned around and walked out of the cafeteria. Eyes followed me, but I kept it together. I didn\u0027t break when I heard Dee call out my name. And I didn\u0027t break when I passed a dumbfounded-looking Lesa and Carissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t going to break. Not anymore. I was tired of this shit with Daemon\u0027s, well, whatever she was. I hadn\u0027t done a single thing for her to treat me this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was done with being pushover Katy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsidian-lux-1/page-12.html","bookId":2165,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:30 PM"}
