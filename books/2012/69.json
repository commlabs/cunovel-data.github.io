Pressures descended upon him, seeking to crack his bones. Torrid winds clawed at him, hungry to shred his soul. But he had walked here of his own accord. In his heart, such savage challenge as to face down the Abyss itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll is not bound to fate. It must not be .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll is not carved in stone, buried deep and for ever beyond mortal sight .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must be more. In all the worlds, the solid laws are a prison – and I will see us freed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had met Chaos with fury in his being, a bristling armour of rage proof against all it flung at him. He had walked into the maelstrom seas of madness, and held tight to his own sanity. And then, at last, he had stood, unbowed, alone, and argued against the universe itself. The laws that were lies, the proofs that were false. Stone a hand could pass through. Water that could be breathed. Air as impenetrable as a wall. Fire to quench the deadliest thirst. Light that blinded, darkness that revealed. The beast within that was the heart of dignity, the sentient self that was purest savagery. In life the secret codes of death. In death the seeds of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had spoken with the elemental forces of nature. Argued without relent. He had defended his right to an existence torn loose from these dread, unknowable horrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor his efforts, the blind uncertainty of Chaos had besieged him. How long? Centuries? Millennia? Now he knelt, battered, his armour shattered, wounds bleeding. And still it assailed him, sought to tear him apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fissure that erupted from him first emerged from the centre of his head, a blast of argent fire in which he heard manic laughter. With terrible ripping sounds, the rent worked its way down his body, unfolding his throat, peeling back each side. His breastbone cracked in two, ribs bursting free. His stomach opened, spilling bitter fluids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was nothing. For how long, he never knew. When cognizance returned to him, he was standing where he had stood before, and before him two naked figures knelt, heads bowed. A man, a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy children, born of anguish and need. My ever facile twins. My wretched faces of freedom. Chaos answers with its most delicious joke. Pull and prod, you godlings, you will never know what I lost in making you, this vicious bargain with uncertainty .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will give you worlds. Yet not one shall be your home. You are cursed to wander through them, trapped in your eternal games. Lord and Lady of Chance. In the language of the Azathanai, Oponn .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy children, you shall never forgive me. Nor do I deserve forgiveness. The laws are not what they seem. Order is an illusion. It hides its lies in your very eyes, deceiving all they see. Because to see is to change that which is seen .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, none of us will ever see true. We cannot. It is impossible. I give you a life without answers, my children. Walk the realms, spread the word in your illimitable way, Oponn. Some will welcome you. Others will not. And that, dear ones, is the joke on them. And on us .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a thought .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow see what it made .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is this senility?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cavern shed its fluids, an incessant trickle and drizzle. The air stank of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSechul Lath glanced over. ‘You spoke, Errastas?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You were far away. Memories haunting you, Setch?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat on boulders, the two of them, the plumes of their breaths drifting like smoke. From somewhere in the cavern’s depths came the sound of rushing water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hardly. After all, as you are ever quick to point out, I am a man of modest achievements.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not a man. A god. Making your pathetic deeds even more embarrassing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ Sechul Lath agreed, nodding. ‘I have many regrets.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Only fools know regret,’ Errastas said, only to undermine his assertion as he unconsciously reached up towards his gaping eye socket. The brush of his fingers, the flinch of muscles in his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHiding a smile, Sechul Lath looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilmandaros still sat hunched, almost folded over, in the dripping blood rain of the Otataral Dragon. When exhaustion took her, the period of recovery could be long, interminably so in the eyes of the Errant. Even worse, she was not yet done with this. Lifting his gaze, Sechul Lath studied the dragon, Korabas. She is the one law amidst the chaos of the Eleint. She is the denial of their power. She is the will set free. It’s not enough to bleed her. She needs to die .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd not even Kilmandaros can do that. Not with this one. At least, not now, while the gate is still sealed. She needs to die, but she must first be freed .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst the madness of such contradictions, I wagered my very life. I walked into the heart of Chaos to challenge the absurdity of existence. And for that, I was torn in two . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-69.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
