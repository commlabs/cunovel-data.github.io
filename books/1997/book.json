Especially when he’s been in love with your cousin for as long as you can remember. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eLana has lived her life in her cousin’s shadow. Ashton always made perfect grades, had tons of friends, and looks model-perfect. And she’s always had Sawyer Vincent—the only boy Lana’s ever wanted—wrapped around her finger. But now things are different. Lana has a chance to make Sawyer see her, and she’s taking it. If only he’d get over Ashton—because Lana is sick of second-best. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSawyer’s heart is broken. He’s lost his best girl to his best friend. And then Lana comes to town. Ashton’s cousin has always been sweet and soft-spoken, but now she’s drop-dead gorgeous as well. Sawyer doesn’t know if Lana can heal his broken heart, but spending time with her might at least make Ashton jealous. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eWhat starts as a carefree fling becomes a lusty game of seduction. Sawyer and Lana may have different motives, but their scintillating hookups are the same kind of steamy. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vincent-brothers-the-vincent-boys-2.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vincent-brothers-the-vincent-boys-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:01 AM"}
