They leaped at the Myrddraal, growling. Ituralde started, spinning, as a man in furs pulled himself up onto the top of the rocky outcrop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTihera stumbled back, calling for their guards. The newcomer in furs leaped for Ituralde and shoved him off the top of the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIturalde did not fight back. Whoever this man was, Ituralde was grateful to him, feeling a moment of victory as he fell. He hadn’t given the order to retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hit the ground not far below, and it knocked the wind out of him. The wolves took his arms in gentle mouths and pulled him off into the darkness as he slowly drifted into unconsciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene sat in the camp as the battle for the border of Kandor continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer army held back the Trollocs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seanchan fought alongside her troops just across the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene herself held a small cup of tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight, it was galling. She was the Amyrlin. But she was drained of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still hadn’t found Gareth Bryne, but that wasn’t unexpected. He moved about. Silviana was hunting him, and should have word soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAes Sedai had been sent to take the wounded to Mayene. The sun drooped low in the sky, like an eyelid that refused to stay open. Egwene’s hands shook as she held her cup. She could still hear the battle. It seemed that the Trollocs would fight into the night, grinding the human armies against the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistant shouts rose like the calls of an angry crowd, but the explosions from the channelers had slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to Gawyn. He didn’t seem tired at all, though he was strangely pale. Egwene sipped her tea and silently cursed him. It was unfair, but she wasn’t concerned with fairness right now. She could grumble at her Warder. That was what they were for, wasn’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA breeze blew through camp. She was a few hundred paces east of the ford, but she smelled blood in the air. Nearby, a squad of archers drew their bows at their commander’s call, launching a volley of arrows. A pair of blackwinged Draghkar plummeted moments later, hitting the ground with dull thuds just beyond camp. More would come, as it grew dark and they had an easier time hiding against the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat. She felt strangely sick thinking about him. He was such a blow-hard. A carouser, leering at every pretty woman he met. Treating her like a painting and not a person. He . . . he . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was Mat. Once, when Egwene had been around thirteen, he’d jumped into the river to save Kiem Lewin from drowning. Of course, she hadn’t been drowning. She’d merely been dunked under the water by a friend, and Mat had come running, throwing himself into the water to help. The men of Emond’s Field had made sport of him for months about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next spring, Mat had pulled Jer al’Hune from the same river, saving the boy’s life. People had stopped making fun of Mat for a while afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was how Mat was. He’d grumbled and muttered all winter about how people made sport of him, insisting that next time, he’d just let them drown. Then the moment he’d seen someone in danger, he’d gone splashing right back in. Egwene could remember gangly Mat stumbling from the river, little Jer clinging to him and gasping, a look of pure terror in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJer had gone down without making a sound. Egwene had never realized that could happen. People who started to drown didn’t yell, or sputter, or call for help. They just slipped under the water, when everything seemed fine and peaceful. Unless Mat was watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came for me in the Stone of Tear,; she thought. Of course, he’d also tried to save her from the Aes Sedai, unwilling to believe she was Amyrlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo which was this? Was she drowning or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow much do you trust Matrim Cauthon? Min had asked. Light. I do trust him. Fool that I am, I do. Mat could be wrong. He often was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when he was right, he saved lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene forced herself to stand. She wavered, and Gawyn came to her side. She patted him on the arm, then stepped away from him. She would not let the army see its Amyrlin so weak that she had to lean against someone for support. \"What reports do we have from the other battlefronts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much, today\", Gawyn said. He frowned. \"In fact, it’s been rather silent\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elayne was supposed to fight at Cairhien\", Egwene said. \"It was an important battle\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She might be too occupied to send word\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to send a messenger by gateway. I need to know how that battle is going\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn nodded, hurrying off. After he was gone, Egwene walked at a steady pace until she found Silviana, who was talking with a pair of Blue sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bryne?\" Egwene asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the mess tent\", Silviana said. \"I only just had word. I sent a runner to tell him to stay put until you arrived\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked over to the tent, the largest shelter in camp by far, and spotted him as she entered. Not eating, but standing beside the cook’s travel table with his maps spread out. The table smelled of onions, which had probably been cut there time and time again. Yukiri had a gateway open in the floor to look down on the battlefield. She closed it as Egwene arrived. They didn’t leave it open long, not with the Sharans watching for it and preparing weaves to send through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene whispered very quietly to Silviana, \"Gather the Hall of the Tower. Bring back any Sitters you can find. Get them all here, to this tent, as soon as you can\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilviana nodded, her face betraying no hint of the confusion she likely felt. She hastened off and Egwene sat down in the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiuan wasn’t there—she was likely helping with Healing again. That was good. Egwene wouldn’t have wanted to attempt this with Siuan glaring at her. As it was, she worried about Gawyn. He loved Bryne like a father, and already his anxiety streamed through their bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have to approach this very delicately, and she didn’t want to start until the Hall had arrived. She couldn’t accuse Bryne, but she couldn’t ignore Mat. He was a scoundrel and a fool, but she trusted him. Light help her, but she did. She’d trust him with her life. And things had been going oddly on the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sitters gathered relatively quickly. They had charge of the war effort, and they met together each evening to get reports and tactical explanations from Bryne and his commanders. Bryne didn’t seem to think it odd that they came to him \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-184.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
