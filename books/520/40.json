Mrs. McBride does want me,\n\u003cbr\u003e really and truly. I\u0027m not the least bit of trouble in the house. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m a help. They don\u0027t take up many servants, and Sallie an I can do lots\n\u003cbr\u003e of useful things. It\u0027s a fine chance for me to learn housekeeping. \n\u003cbr\u003e Every woman ought to understand it, an I only know asylum-keeping.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There aren\u0027t any girls our age at the camp, and Mrs. McBride wants\n\u003cbr\u003e me for a companion for Sallie. We are planning to do a lot of\n\u003cbr\u003e reading together. We are going to read all of the books for next\n\u003cbr\u003e year\u0027s English and sociology. The Professor said it would be a great\n\u003cbr\u003e help if we would get our reading finished in the summer; and it\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e so much easier to remember it if we read together and talk it over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just to live in the same house with Sallie\u0027s mother is an education. \n\u003cbr\u003e She\u0027s the most interesting, entertaining, companionable, charming woman\n\u003cbr\u003e in the world; she knows everything. Think how many summers I\u0027ve\n\u003cbr\u003e spent with Mrs. Lippett and how I\u0027ll appreciate the contrast. \n\u003cbr\u003e You needn\u0027t be afraid that I\u0027ll be crowding them, for their house is\n\u003cbr\u003e made of rubber. When they have a lot of company, they just sprinkle\n\u003cbr\u003e tents about in the woods and turn the boys outside. It\u0027s going to be\n\u003cbr\u003e such a nice, healthy summer exercising out of doors every minute. \n\u003cbr\u003e Jimmie McBride is going to teach me how to ride horseback and paddle\n\u003cbr\u003e a canoe, and how to shoot and--oh, lots of things I ought to know. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s the kind of nice, jolly, care-free time that I\u0027ve never had;\n\u003cbr\u003e and I think every girl deserves it once in her life. Of course I\u0027ll\n\u003cbr\u003e do exactly as you say, but please, PLEASE let me go, Daddy. I\u0027ve never\n\u003cbr\u003e wanted anything so much.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This isn\u0027t Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, writing to you. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s just Judy--a girl.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59762.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
