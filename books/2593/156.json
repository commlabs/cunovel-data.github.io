I break it by asking, \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says nothing for a long time and I look back at my hands, at dried blood, probably from a girl named Suki, beneath the thumbnail. My mother licks her lips tiredly and says, \"I don\u0027t know. I just want to have a nice Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say anything. I\u0027ve spent the last hour studying my hair in the mirror I\u0027ve insisted the hospital keep in my mother\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look unhappy,\" she says suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not,\" I tell her with a brief sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look unhappy,\" she says, more quietly this time. She touches her hair, stark blinding white, again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you do too,\" I say slowly, hoping that she won\u0027t say anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t say anything else. I\u0027m sitting in a chair by the window, and through the bars the lawn outside darkens, a cloud passes over the sun, soon the lawn turns green again. She sits on her bed in a nightgown from Bergdorf\u0027s and slippers by Norma Kamali that I bought her for Christmas last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was the party?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I say, guessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many people were there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forty. Five hundred.\" I shrug. \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe licks her lips again, touches her hair once more. \"What time did you leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember,\" I answer after a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One? Two?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must have been one,\" I say, almost cutting her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She pauses again, straightens her sunglasses, black Ray-Bans I bought her from Bloomingdale\u0027s that cost two hundred dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t very good,\" I say uselessly, looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she asks, curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just wasn\u0027t,\" I say, looking back at my hand, the specks of blood under the nail on my thumb, the photograph of my father, when he was a much younger man, on my mother\u0027s bedside table, next to a photograph of Sean and me when we were both teenagers, wearing tuxedos, neither one of us smiling. In the photograph of my father he\u0027s wearing a six-button double-breasted black sport coat, a white spread-collar cotton shirt, a tie, pocket square, shoes, all by Brooks Brothers. He\u0027s standing next to one of the topiary animals a long time ago at his father\u0027s estate in Connecticut and there\u0027s something the matter with his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Best City for Business\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on a rainy Tuesday morning, after working out at Xclusive, I stop by Paul Owen\u0027s apartment on the Upper East Side. One hundred and sixty-one days have passed since I spent the night in it with the two escort girls. There has been no word of bodies discovered in any of the city\u0027s four newspapers or on the local news; no hints of even a rumor floating around. I\u0027ve gone so far as to ask people - dates, business acquaintances - over dinners, in the halls of Pierce \u0026amp; Pierce, if anyone has heard about two mutilated prostitutes found in Paul Owen\u0027s apartment. But like in some movie, no one has heard anything, has any idea of what I\u0027m talking about. There are other things to worry over: the shocking amount of laxative and speed that the cocaine in Manhattan is now being cut with, Asia in the 1990s, the virtual impossibility of landing an eight o\u0027clock reservation at PR, the new Tony McManus restaurant on Liberty Island, crack. So what I\u0027m assuming is that, essentially, like, no bodies have been found. For all I know, Kimball has moved to London too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building looks different to me as I step out of the taxi, though I can\u0027t figure out why. I still have the keys I stole from Owen the night I killed him and I take them out, now, to open the lobby door but they don\u0027t work, won\u0027t fit properly. Instead, a uniformed doorman who wasn\u0027t here six months ago opens it for me, excusing himself for taking so long. I stand there in the rain, confused, until he ushers me in, merrily asking, with a thick Irish accent, \"Well, are you coming in or staying out - you\u0027re getting soaked.\" I move into the lobby, my umbrella held under one arm, tucking the surgical mask I brought with me to deal with the smell back into my pocket. I\u0027m holding a Walkman, debating what to say, how to phrase it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now what can I do for you sir?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stall - a long, awkward pause - before saying, simply, \"Fourteen-A.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks me over carefully before checking his book, then beams, marking something down. \"Ah, of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs.... Wolfe?\" Weakly, I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. She\u0027s the real estate agent,\" he says, looking up at me. \"You do have an appointment, don\u0027t you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-156.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
