A MYSTERY OF THE PAST.","content":"\"I do not know that I have done just right by telling you this,\" went on Marion. \"Mother may not approve of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am glad you told me. I was bound to find out about it, sooner or later.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is true, Jack. But both mother and I dreaded that time. We were afraid you might turn from us. And we both love you so much!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is kind of you to say that, Marion.\" Jack\u0027s face flushed. \"You couldn\u0027t be nicer if you were my real sister.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And mother loves you so much.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know that, too—otherwise she wouldn\u0027t have taken me in as she did.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What put it in your head to ask me this to-day?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Something St. John Ruthven said to Darcy Gilbert. St. John said I was an upstart, a nobody.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"St. John had better mind his own business! It was not cousinly for him to interfere!\" And Marion\u0027s face flushed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose he doesn\u0027t look at me in the light of a cousin. He considers me an intruder.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, if he won\u0027t count you a cousin he need not count me one either—so there!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you must not hurt yourself by standing up for me,\" cried Jack hastily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will not hurt myself—in the eyes of those whose respect is worth considering. In the eyes of the law you are my real brother, for my parents adopted you. St. John must not forget that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But tell me of the past, Marion. Where did I come from, and how did I get here?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s a long story, Jack. Do you see yonder wreck, on Hemlock Bluff rocks?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To be sure I do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, when that wreck came ashore, between ten and eleven years ago, you had been one of the passengers on the boat.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. I have heard mother tell of it several times. It was a fearful night and Old Ben, he was our slave then, was out on the bluff watching. Presently there was the booming of a signal gun—showing the ship was in distress—and soon the ship came in sight, rocking to and fro, with the wild waves running over her deck. Not a soul was left on board, captain and crew having all gone down in the ocean beyond.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But where did they find me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"On the beach. Old Ben heard a cry of pain and ran in the direction of the sound. Soon he made out the form of a woman, your mother. She had been hurt by being hit with some wreckage. You were in her arms, and as Old Ben came up you cried out: \u0027Jack is hungry. Give Jack some bread and butter, please.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, yes! I remember something of a storm and of the awful waves. But it\u0027s all dreamy-like.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You were only three or four years old, and the exposure nearly cost you your life. Old Ben took you and your mother to the boathouse and then ran up to the plantation for help. Father went back with him, along with half a dozen men, and they brought you and your mother to the house. I remember that time well, for I was nearly seven years old.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But my mother, what of her?\" asked Jack impatiently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Poor dear! she died two days later. The physicians did all they could for her, but the shock had been too great, and she passed away without recovering consciousness.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then she told nothing about me—who I was?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. All she did say while she lived was \u0027Save my husband! Save my darling little Jack.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then my father must have been on the boat with her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And they did not find his body?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, the only bodies recovered were those of sailors.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Didn\u0027t they try to find out who I was?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To be sure, but, although father did his best, he could learn nothing. Your father and mother had taken passage on the ship at the last moment and their names did not appear on the list at the shipping offices, and none of the books belonging to the ship itself were ever recovered.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps they are on the wreck!\" cried Jack, struck by a sudden idea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, the wreck was searched from end to end, and all of value taken away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027d like to row over and look around.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You may do so, Jack. I presume the wreck will have more of an interest than ever for you now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The distance to Hemlock Bluff rocks was a good mile, but Jack soon covered it and, bringing the boat to a safe corner, he assisted Marion out and then leaped out himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This news is enough to make a fellow\u0027s head whirl,\" he observed, as they walked in the direction of the wreck, which lay high up on the beach.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose that is true, Jack. But do not let it worry you. You are as dear to mother and me as if you were one of the family.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I would like to know who I really am.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps time will solve the mystery.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soon the pair were at the wreck, which lay with its bow well up on the rocks and its stern projecting over the sea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was no mean task to reach the deck of the wreck, but Jack was a good climber and soon he was aboard. Then he gave Marion a hand up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The deck of the wreck was much decayed, and they had to be careful how they moved around.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am going below,\" said the youth, after a general look around.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Be careful. Jack, or you may break a limb,\" cautioned Marion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t suppose you care to go down with me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think not—at least, I will wait until you have been down.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soon Jack was crawling down the rotted companion way. At the bottom all was dirty and dark. He pushed open the door, which hung upon one rusty hinge, and peered into the cabin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish I had brought a lantern along,\" he murmured, as he stepped into the compartment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Marion had said, the wreck had been cleared of everything of value. All the furniture was gone and the pantries and staterooms were bare. From the cabin he passed into several of the staterooms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What have you found?\" called Marion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing much.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Any mice down there, or spiders?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"None, so far as I can see.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I\u0027ll come down.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soon Marion was beside Jack, and the pair made a tour of the wreck from bow to stern. Their investigations proved to be highly interesting, and they spent more time below than they had anticipated doing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We must get back, Jack,\" said the girl at last.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, there is no hurry! Mother is not at home,\" answered Jack. It seemed a bit odd to call Mrs. Ruthven mother now that he knew she was not his relative.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So fully another hour was spent below, moving from one part of the big wreck to another. Presently Jack came to a sudden stop and listened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What a queer noise, Marion!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is the wind rising. We had better be getting back, before the bay grows too rough for rowing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack ran up the companion way and Marion after him. To their surprise the sky was overcast, and the wind was whipping the surface of the bay into numerous whitecaps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We must lose no time in getting back!\" cried Jack. \"As it is, the wind will be dead against us!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As quickly as possible he assisted Marion over the side, and then both set off on a run for the little cove where the rowboat had been left tied up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As they gained the boat Jack gave an exclamation of dismay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The oars—they are gone!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was right. Marion had shifted their position before leaving the craft, and bumping against the rocks had sent them adrift.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3023/83621.html","bookId":258,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:58:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:58:47 AM"}
