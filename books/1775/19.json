She pretends to mull it over, musing aloud that it might be boring, but when I say, “Never mind, then,” she quickly agrees to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the stands we run into Peter’s mom and his younger brother, Owen, so we sit with them. He and Kitty proceed to each pretend the other doesn’t exist—he plays games on his phone and she plays games on hers. Owen is tall, but he sits hunched, with his hair in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe chat about my dad and Trina’s engagement for a bit and I tell her some of my ideas for the wedding. She’s nodding along and then she suddenly says, “I hear congratulations are in order for you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused, I say, “What for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“William and Mary!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh! Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you were hoping to go to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUVA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, but this might be for the best anyway.” She gives me a sympathetic smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile back, unsure. Unsure of what, exactly, “for the best” means. Is she glad I’m not going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUVA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith Peter? Does she think this means we’re breaking up now? So all I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esay is, “Williamsburg isn’t really that far from Charlottesville anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer response is, “Hmm, yes, that’s true.” Then Peter scores a point, and we both stand up and cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I sit back down again, Kitty asks me, “Can we get popcorn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” I say, glad to have an excuse to get up. To Peter’s mom and brother I ask, “Do you guys want anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking up, Owen says, “Popcorn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You guys can share,” Peter’s mom says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make my way down the bleachers, and I’m heading for the snack bar when I notice a man, standing off to the side, his arms crossed, watching the game. He is tall; he has nut-brown hair. Handsome. When he turns his head and I see his profile, I know who he is, because I know that face. I know that chin, those eyes. He’s Peter’s dad. It’s like seeing the Ghost of Christmas Future, and I’m frozen in place, transfixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe catches me staring at him, and offers a friendly smile. I feel like I have no choice but to take a step forward and ask, “Excuse me . . . but are you Peter’s dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprised, he nods. “Are you a friend of his?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Lara Jean Covey. His, um, girlfriend.” He looks startled, but then he recovers and extends his hand. I shake it firmly, to give a good impression. “Wow, you look just like him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, and I’m struck anew by how much of him is in Peter. “He looks just like me, you mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh too. “Right. You were here first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is an awkward silence, and then he clears his throat and asks me, “How is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, he’s good. He’s great. Did you hear he’s going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUVA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon a lacrosse scholarship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, smiling. “I heard that from his mom. I’m proud of him. Not that I can take any credit for it—but still. I’m really proud of the kid.” His eyes flicker back to the field, to Peter. “I just wanted to see him play again. I’ve missed it.” He hesitates before saying, “Please don’t mention to Peter that I was here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so taken by surprise, all I can say is, “Oh . . . okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, I appreciate it. It was nice to meet you, Lara Jean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was nice to meet you, too, Mr. Kavinsky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, I go back to the bleachers, and only when I’m halfway up there do I remember I forgot the popcorn, so I have to go back down. When I get back to the snack bar, Peter’s dad is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur team ends up losing, but Peter scores three points and it’s a good game for him. I’m glad his dad got to see him play, but I really wish I didn’t agree to keeping it a secret from Peter. The thought makes my stomach hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the car I’m still thinking about his dad, but then Kitty says, “That was weird what Peter’s mom said about it being a good thing you weren’t going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUVA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, right! You took it that way too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There really wasn’t any other way to take it,” Kitty says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check my side-view mirrors before turning left out of the school parking lot. “I don’t think she meant it in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emean\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eway, exactly. She just doesn’t want to see Peter get hurt, that’s all.” And neither do I, so maybe it’s for the best that I don’t say anything to Peter about seeing his dad tonight. What if he gets excited about his dad coming, and then his dad hurts him again? Abruptly I say, “Do you wanna stop and get frozen yogurts?” and of course Kitty says yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter comes to the house after he showers up, and as soon as I see how happy he is, my mind is made up not to say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re lying on the living room floor doing face sheet masks. If the kids at school could see him now! Through gritted teeth he asks, “What’s this one supposed to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brighten dull skin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twists toward me and croaks, “Hello, Clarice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence of the Lambs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I never saw that. It looked too scary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter sits upright. He’s terrible at sitting still. “We have to watch it right now. This is ridiculous. I can’t be with someone who’s never seen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence of the Lambs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, I’m pretty sure it’s my turn to pick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Covey, come on! It’s a classic,” Peter says, just as his phone buzzes. He answers it, and I hear his mom’s voice on the other line. “Hey Mom . . . I’m at Lara Jean’s. I’ll be home soon. . . . I love you too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he gets off the phone, I say, “Hey, I forgot to tell you this earlier, but at the game tonight, your mom said that maybe it was for the best that I didn’t get into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUVA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sits up and pulls off his face mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, she didn’t say it exactly like that, but I think that’s how she meant it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What were her exact words?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peel off my mask too. “She congratulated me on getting into William and Mary, and then I think she said, ‘I know you were hoping to go to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUVA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, but this might be for the best anyway.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter relaxes. “Oh, she always talks like that. She looks for the bright side in things. She’s like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t seem that way to me, but I don’t push it, because Peter’s very protective of his mom. I guess he’s had to be, since it’s just the three of them. But what if it didn’t have to be? What if Peter has a real chance of having a relationship with his dad? What if tonight is proof? Casually, I ask him, “Hey, how many graduation announcements did you sign up for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten. My family’s small. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just wondering. I signed up for fifty, so my grandma could send some to family in Korea.” I hesitate before asking, “Do you think you’ll send your dad one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns. “No. Why would I?” He picks up his phone. “Let’s see what movies we have left. If\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence of the Lambs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eis off the table, we could watch\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrainspotting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDie Hard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t say anything for a moment, and then I snatch his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ephone out of his hands. “It’s my turn to pick! And I pick . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmélie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor someone who once put up such a fuss about not watching rom coms or foreign films, Peter sure loves\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmélie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s about a French girl who is afraid to live in the world, so she concocts these whimsical fantasies in her head, with lamps that talk and paintings that move, and crepes that look like records. It makes me want to live in Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder what you’d look like with bangs,” Peter muses. “Cute, I bet.” At the end of the movie, when she bakes a plum cake, he turns to me and says, “Do you know how to bake a plum cake? That sounds delicious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, mini plum cakes could be good for the dessert table.” I start researching recipes on my phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just make sure you call me when you do your trial run,” Peter says, yawning. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/always-and-forever-lara-jean-to-all-the-boys-i-ve-loved-before-3/page-19.html","bookId":1775,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
