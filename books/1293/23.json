\u0026nbsp;Eh, but I’m stronger for having Richard’s son beside me. \u0026nbsp;I thought to die captain of my ship many a time. \u0026nbsp;And I think to die master of my own house,” and so, sat chuckling and shaking, his strength leaving him as suddenly as his will had summoned it. \u0026nbsp;He rambled on, “She’s an ill fowl—eh, John? \u0026nbsp;She’s a skeleton held together by her skin—no more. \u0026nbsp;Barwise’s woman,—she’d looks once,—hair black as the storm and eyes as black. \u0026nbsp;She’d wear silks and gold rings. \u0026nbsp;She took a fat picking from my men, when I sailed my ship. \u0026nbsp;She’d a tavern Shadwell way.” \u0026nbsp;He broke off, and looked dully at me. \u0026nbsp;He muttered, “Can you not see, lad, the manner of man I was? \u0026nbsp;Can you not see the wreck I am? \u0026nbsp;How I ruled ’em once and how now that they think me broken—they’d mutiny, they’d rob me; they’d have what they’ll never set their fingers on?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Surely my uncle would discipline them at a word from you. \u0026nbsp;Clear the house of them.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ay, ay, Charles! \u0026nbsp;Charles watches me, as they, and thinks to rob me!” \u0026nbsp;He gasped, and p. 189huddled in his chair; ghastly now, and the sweat beading his brow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I said swiftly, “Shall I ring for Thrale?
