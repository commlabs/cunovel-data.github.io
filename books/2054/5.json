In the last twenty-four hours, I\u0027d had to endure virgins, scary vampires, murder, accusation, and humiliation in front of my favorite author. I really didn\u0027t think coming home to a quiet apartment was too much to ask for. Instead, I found three interlopers. Three interlopers who were also my friends, mind you, but that didn\u0027t change the principle of the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, none of them understood why I was so upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re invading my privacy! And I didn\u0027t murder anybody. Why does everyone keep thinking that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you said yourself you were going to,\" explained Hugh. The imp sprawled on my love seat, his relaxed posture indicating I might actually be the one in his home. \"I heard it from Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross from him, our friend Cody offered me a friendly smile. He was exceptionally young for a vampire and reminded me of the kid brother I\u0027d never had. \"Don\u0027t worry. He had it coming. We stand by you all the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I didn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that our illustrious hostess I hear?\" called Peter from the bathroom. A moment later, he appeared in the hallway. \"You look pretty snazzy for a criminal mastermind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\" My words died on my lips as I caught sight of him. For a moment, all thoughts of murder and apartment intrusion blanked out of my mind. \"For God\u0027s sake, Peter. What happened to your hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe self-consciously ran a hand over the sharp, half-inch spikes covering his head. I couldn\u0027t even imagine how much styling product it must have taken to defy the laws of physics like that. Worse, the tips of the spikes were white-blond, standing out boldly against his normally dark hair color. \"Someone I work with helped me with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who hates you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter scowled. \"You are the most uncharming succubus I\u0027ve ever met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the spikes really, um, emphasize the shape of your eyebrows,\" offered Cody diplomatically. \"They just take... some getting used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. I liked Peter and Cody. They were the only vampires I\u0027d ever been friends with, but that didn\u0027t make them any less trying. Between Peter\u0027s assorted neuroses and Cody\u0027s dogged optimism, I sometimes felt like the straight man -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;er, woman - on a sitcom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of getting used to,\" I muttered, pulling up a bar-stool from my kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re one to talk,\" returned Peter. \"You and your wings and whip getup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dropped, and I turned an incredulous look on Hugh. He hastily shut the Victoria\u0027s Secret catalog he\u0027d been leafing through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Georgina - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you weren\u0027t going to tell! You sealed your lips and everything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, uh... it just sort of slipped out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you really have horns?\" asked Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, that\u0027s it. I want you all out of here now.\" I pointed at the door. \"I\u0027ve been through enough today without you three adding to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t even told us about taking the contract out on Duane.\" Cody\u0027s puppy-dog eyes looked at me pleadingly. \"We\u0027re dying to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Duane\u0027s the one who technically did the dying,\" pointed out Peter in an undertone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch the snide comments,\" warned Hugh. \"You might be next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI half expected steam to pour from my ears. \"For the last time, I did not kill Duane! Jerome believes me, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody looked thoughtful. \"But you did threaten him...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And from what I recall, so have all of you at some time or another. This is just a coincidence. I didn\u0027t have anything to do with it, and...\" Something suddenly occurred to me. \"Why does everyone keep saying things like \u0027arranged his death\u0027 or \u0027got someone to murder him\u0027? Why aren\u0027t you saying that I did it myself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait... you just said you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter rolled his eyes at Cody before facing me, the older vampire\u0027s expression turning serious. Of course, \"serious\" means all sorts of things when paired with a hairstyle like his. \"No one\u0027s saying you did it because you couldn\u0027t have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially in those shoes.\" Hugh nodded toward my heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate your complete lack of faith in my abilities, but isn\u0027t it possible I could have, I don\u0027t know, taken him by surprise? Hypothetically, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter smiled. \"It wouldn\u0027t have mattered. Lesser immortals can\u0027t kill one another.\" Seeing my astonished look, he added, \"How can you not know that? After living as long as you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeasing laced his words. There had always been an unspoken mystery between Peter and me concerning which of us was the oldest of the mortals-turned-immortals in our little circle. Neither of us would openly admit our age, so we\u0027d never really determined who had the most centuries. One night, after a bottle of tequila, we\u0027d started playing a \"Do you remember when...\" sort of game. We\u0027d only gotten back as far as the Industrial Revolution before passing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because no one\u0027s ever tried to kill me. So what, are you saying all those turf wars vampires have are for nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, not for nothing,\" he said. \"We inflict some pretty terrific damage, believe me. But no, no one ever dies. With all the territory disputes, there\u0027d be very few of us left if we could kill each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed silent, turning this revelation over in my head. \"Then how do - \" I suddenly remembered what Jerome had told me. \"They get killed by vampire hunters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the deal with them?\" I asked. \"Jerome wouldn\u0027t elaborate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh was equally interested. \"You mean like that one girl on TV? The hot blonde?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is going to be a long night.\" Peter gave us both scathing looks. \"You all need some serious Vampires 101. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027re going to offer us anything to drink, Georgina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved an impatient hand toward the kitchen. \"Get whatever you want. I want to know about vampire hunters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter sauntered out of my living room, yelping when he nearly tripped over one of the many stacks of books I had sitting around. I made a mental note to buy a new bookshelf. Scowling, he surveyed my nearly empty refrigerator with disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really need to work on your hosting skills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, I keep hearing stories about that other succubus... the one in Missoula. What\u0027s her name again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Donna,\" offered Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Donna. She throws great parties, I hear. Gets them catered. Invites everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you guys want to party with all ten people in Montana, then you\u0027re welcome to move there. Now stop wasting time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring me, Peter eyed the red carnations I\u0027d bought the other night. I\u0027d put them in a vase near the kitchen sink. \"Who sent you flowers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sent yourself flowers?\" asked Cody, his voice quaking with sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I just bought them. It\u0027s not the same. I didn\u0027t - look. Why are we talking about this when there\u0027s an alleged vampire killer on the loose? Are you two in danger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter finally opted for water but tossed beers to Hugh and Cody. \"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We aren\u0027t?\" Cody seemed surprised to learn this. His scant years as a vampire practically made him a baby compared to the rest of us. Peter was teaching him \"the trade,\" so to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampire hunters are simply special mortals born with the ability to inflict real damage to vampires. Mortals in general can\u0027t touch us, of course. Don\u0027t ask me how or why this all works; there\u0027s no system as far as I can tell. Most so-called vampire hunters go through life without even realizing they have this talent. The ones who do sometimes decide to make a career out of it. They pop up like this from time to time, picking off the occasional vampire, making a general nuisance of themselves until some enterprising vampire or demon takes them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Nuisance\u0027?\" asked Cody incredulously. \"Even after Duane? Aren\u0027t you the least bit worried about this person coming after you? After us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Peter. \"I am not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shared Cody\u0027s confusion. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because this person, whoever he or she is, is a total amateur.\" Peter glanced over at Hugh and me. \"What did Jerome say about Duane\u0027s death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeciding I needed a drink myself, I raided my kitchen liquor cabinet and made a vodka gimlet. \"He wanted to know if I did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter made a dismissive gesture. \"No, about how he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh frowned, apparently trying to piece together the logic afoot. \"He said that Duane had been found dead - with a stake through his heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There. You see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter looked at us expectantly. We all looked back, baffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it,\" I finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter sighed, again looking utterly put out. \"If you are a mortal who has the semidivine ability to kill a vampire, it doesn\u0027t fucking matter how you do it. You can use a gun, a knife, a candlestick, or whatever. The stake through the heart thing is hearsay. If a normal mortal does it to a vampire, it won\u0027t do a damned thing except really piss the vampire off. We only hear about it when a vampire hunter does it, so it carries some special superstitious lure, when really, it\u0027s only like that egg thing on the equinoxes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Hugh looked totally lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my eyes. \"I actually know what he\u0027s talking about, as scary as that is to admit. There\u0027s this urban myth that eggs balance on their ends during the equinoxes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u0027t, but the truth is, you\u0027d get the same results any time of the year. People only try it on the equinoxes, however, so that\u0027s all anyone notices.\" I glanced over at Peter. \"Your point is that a vampire hunter could kill a vampire in any number of ways, but because the stake gets all the attention, that\u0027s what has become the accepted method of... \u0027revocation of immortality.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In people\u0027s minds,\" he corrected. \"In reality, it\u0027s a pain in the ass to drive a stake through someone\u0027s heart. A lot easier to shoot them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so you think this hunter is an amateur because...\" Cody trailed off, obviously unconvinced by the compelling egg analogy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because any vampire hunter worth his or her snuff knows that and wouldn\u0027t use a stake. This person\u0027s a total newbie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First,\" I advised Peter, \"don\u0027t say \u0027worth his snuff.\u0027 That expression\u0027s out-of-style and makes you sound dated. Second, maybe this hunter was just trying to be old-school or something. And even if this person is a \u0027newbie,\u0027 does it really matter since they managed to take out Duane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter shrugged. \"He was an arrogant asshole. Vampires can sense vampire hunters at close range. Combined with this one\u0027s inexperience, Duane should have never been taken. He was stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to counter this. I would be among the first to agree that Duane had indeed been both arrogant and an asshole, but stupid he was not. Immortals could not live as long as we did and see as many things as we did without gleaning substantial know-how and street smarts. We grew up quickly, so to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother question moved to the forefront of my reasoning. \"Can these hunters hurt other immortals? Or just vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only vampires, as far as I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething didn\u0027t add up here between Peter\u0027s comments and Jerome\u0027s. I couldn\u0027t quite put my finger on what was bothering me exactly, so I kept my misgivings to myself as the others chatted on. The vampire hunter topic soon became passe, once they\u0027d decided - with some disappointment - I hadn\u0027t contracted anybody. Cody and Hugh also seemed content to buy Peter\u0027s theory that an amateur hunter posed no real threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful, you two,\" I warned the vampires when they were getting ready to leave. \"Newbie or no, Duane is still dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mom,\" answered Peter disinterestedly, putting on his coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Cody a sharp look, and he squirmed a bit. He was easier to manipulate than his mentor. \"I\u0027ll be careful, Georgina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me if anything weird happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, earning an eye roll from Peter. \"Come on,\" said the older vampire. \"Let\u0027s get some dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to smile at that. While vampires getting dinner might have frightened most people, I knew better. Peter and Cody both hated hunting human victims. They did it on occasion but rarely killed when they did. Most of their sustenance came from extra-rare butcher shop purchases. Like me, they were half- assingtheir infernal jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh,\" I said sharply as he was about to follow the vampires out. \"A word, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampires gave Hugh sympathetic looks before leaving. The imp grimaced, closing the door and facing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh, I gave you that key for emergencies - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampire murder doesn\u0027t constitute an emergency?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious! It\u0027s bad enough Jerome and Carter can teleport in here without you deciding to open up my home to God and the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think God was invited tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then, you went and told them about the demon-girl outfit...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh come on,\" he protested. \"That was too good to keep to myself. Besides, they\u0027re our friends. What\u0027s it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It matters because you said you weren\u0027t going to tell,\" I growled. \"What kind of friend are you? Especially after I helped you out last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, Georgina. I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d take it so personally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran a hand through my hair. \"It\u0027s not just that. It\u0027s... I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s this whole business with Duane. I was thinking about what Jerome told me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh waited, giving me time to gather my thoughts, sensing I was about to unleash something. My mind pondered the night\u0027s unfolding as I studied the imp\u0027s large shape beside me. He could be as silly as the vampires sometimes; I didn\u0027t know if I could speak seriously to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh... how do you know if a demon is lying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, then he emitted a soft laugh, recognizing the old joke. \"His lips are moving.\" We leaned against my counter, and he studied me from his greater height. \"Why? Do you think Jerome\u0027s lying to us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do.\" Another pause followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerome told me to be careful, said I could be mistaken for a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told me the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Peter said vampire hunters can\u0027t kill us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever had a stake driven through your heart? It might not kill you, but I bet you wouldn\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough. But Jerome claimed vampire hunters find other vampires by following their prey. That\u0027s bullshit. Cody and Peter are the exception. You know how most vampires are - they don\u0027t hang out with other vampires. Following one generally won\u0027t lead to another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but he said this one was a newbie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerome didn\u0027t say that. That was Peter\u0027s theory based on the stake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh gave a conciliatory grunt. \"Okay. So what do you think is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I just know these stories are contradicting each other. And Carter seemed awfully involved, like he was in on some secret with Jerome. Why should Carter even care? His side should technically approve of someone picking off our people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s an angel. Isn\u0027t he supposed to love everyone, even the damned? Especially when said damned are his drinking buddies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s more here than we\u0027re being told... and Jerome seemed so adamant about me being careful. You too, apparently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stayed quiet a few moments before finally saying, \"You\u0027re a pretty girl, Georgina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started. So much for serious talk. \"Did you drink more than that beer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forget, though,\" he continued, ignoring my question, \"that you\u0027re also a smart one. I work around shallow women so much - suburban housewives wanting smoother skin and bigger breasts - who have no other concerns but their appearances. It\u0027s easy to get caught up in the stereotypes and forget that you have a brain in there too, behind your beautiful face. You see things differently than the rest of us - more clearly, I guess. Sort of a bigger picture kind of thinking. Maybe it\u0027s your age - no offense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did drink too much. Besides, I\u0027m not smart enough to figure out what Jerome isn\u0027t telling us unless... there aren\u0027t really succubus or imp hunters out there, are there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever heard of one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither have I. But I have heard of vampire hunters - independent of pop culture.\" Hugh reached for his cigarettes and changed his mind, remembering I didn\u0027t like smoking in my apartment. \"I don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s going to put a stake through us anytime soon, if that\u0027s what\u0027s bothering you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you do agree we\u0027re being left out of the loop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else do you expect from Jerome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think... I think I\u0027m going to go see Erik.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he still alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last I knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good idea. He knows more about us than we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll let you know what I find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah. I think I\u0027d rather stay ignorant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Where are you off to now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to go put in some after-hours time with one of the new secretaries, if you catch my meaning.\" He grinned, dare I say, impishly. \"Twenty years old, with breasts that defy gravity. I should know. I helped install them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help but laugh, despite the grim atmosphere. Hugh, like the rest of us, had a day job when not furthering the cause of evil and chaos. In his case, the line between occupations was a little thin: he was a plastic surgeon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t compete with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not true. Science can\u0027t duplicate your breasts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Praise from a true connoisseur. Have fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. Watch your back, sweetie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a quick kiss on the forehead and left. I stood there, alone at last, staring idly at my door and wondering what all this meant. Jerome\u0027s warning probably had been overkill, I decided. As Hugh had said, no one had ever heard of imp or succubus hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I clicked my deadbolt and fastened the chain on my door before going to bed. Immortal I might be, but reckless I was not. Well, at least not when it counted. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-blues-georgina-kincaid-1/page-5.html","bookId":2054,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:16 PM"}
