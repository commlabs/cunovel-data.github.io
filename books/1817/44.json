I sighed as Amelia looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is she calling you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably because I blew her off today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? What the hell are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She sent me a text this morning and asked me if we could talk because she told her parents about the baby and they were really upset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So she has to talk to you about it?” Amelia asked with a little bit of an attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, listen. Don’t you worry about Hailey. You know I love you. I’m just trying to be nice, I guess. Which I’m not sure if I should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s going to get the wrong impression, Collin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, if she does, I’ll set her straight. No big deal. Now come on; help me pick out a bed.” I winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bought all the furniture I needed. It was fun shopping with Amelia. She and I had the same taste in furniture. We picked up Thai food on the way back to my apartment and we set a blanket on the floor as we ate with chopsticks out of the carton, talking and laughing about life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead and call Hailey back. Meet with her tomorrow and let her talk. I’m okay with it,” Amelia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure? Because I don’t have to if it’s going to upset you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t upset me. Just do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed my phone and dialed Hailey’s number. She answered on the second ring and we arranged to meet at Starbucks tomorrow morning around ten. I looked at Amelia and smiled. “Can you stay here for a second? I have to run across the hall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” She giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and stepped across the hall to Julia’s apartment. I softly knocked and Jake answered the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, neighbor. What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a couple extra blankets I can borrow for a couple nights? I don’t want to go upstairs and be interrogated by the parents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“HAHA!” Jake laughed. “Sure, we have extra blankets. Come on in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia came walking from the bedroom and smiled when she saw me. Oh my God, did she look huge in her nightgown. But I didn’t dare say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here, handsome?” she asked as she kissed my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your little brother is spending the night at his new pad and he asked to borrow a couple of blankets. I’m thinking he may be having a sleepover.” Jake smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, really? Is that true?” Julia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Amelia is spending the night,” I said as I took the blankets from Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have fun!” Julia said as I opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and smiled at her. “To quote Dad, I fully intend to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia covered her ears. “Stop that! And you better wash those blankets before you give them back!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed as I shut the door, walked over to my place, laid down the blankets in the bedroom, and made sweet love to my girl again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my watch. It was ten fifteen. I sat there with my cup of coffee and looked out the window to see if I could see Hailey walking down the street. I pulled out my phone and sent her a text message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, where are you? I have to get back to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat and waited for another ten minutes and there was no Hailey and no reply text message. I sighed as I got up from the table and my phone began to ring. I thought it was strange that Amelia was calling me during her clinicals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, baby. Is something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Collin, I’m doing clinicals in the Labor and Delivery unit and Hailey is here. I saw her, and her mom asked me to call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She lost the baby. I really think you should come to the hospital.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, baby. I’m on my way. I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too. See you soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man. I couldn’t believe she lost the baby. I drove to the hospital and went up to the Labor and Delivery unit. The nurse at the desk told me which room Hailey was in and, when I went there, Peyton and Henry were in the room with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Collin. You’re so sweet for coming,” Peyton said as she hugged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Collin. Thanks, man,” Henry said as he walked over and shook my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both left the room and I walked over to the side of Hailey’s bed and sat down in the chair. She wouldn’t look at me. She just stared at the blank wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Hailey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” she whispered as she wiped a tear that fell from her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry about the baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not. Why are you here?” she asked as she turned and looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mom asked me to come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s just fucking great. I’m asking you to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I don’t want you here. You’re the last person I want to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really, Hailey? Because yesterday, you wanted to talk,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was then, this is now, and now I don’t want to see you. I needed you when I came back and you turned your back on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting angrier by the minute. I couldn’t yell at her because she had just lost the baby and she was emotional. I got up from the chair and placed my hand on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you feel better, Hailey.” I walked out of the room and saw Amelia down the hall. I walked over to her and grabbed her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you’re busy, so I’ll see you later. Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Are you all right?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m perfectly fine, baby,” I said as I kissed her forehead and went to the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of weeks had passed and Amelia and I spent them going out with friends and organizing all the things my mom bought me for my apartment. I sent Ralph to pick up Amelia from the hospital because I was making dinner for her. I heard the door open and, instantly, I smiled. I wiped my hands on the kitchen towel and walked to the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, baby,” I said as I kissed her. “Did you have a nice ride home with Ralphie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and then let out a giggle. “Be nice. It smells wonderful in here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. How was your day?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was good. How was yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s better now that you’re here.” I smiled as I gripped her hips and kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock at the door and Amelia looked at me. “Are you expecting someone?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-44.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
