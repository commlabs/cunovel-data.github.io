No!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquirming wildly she clawed and bit and tried to scream, but her attempts were drunken and clumsy, her arms flailing, her blows landing in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelp me! Oh, God, please let someone help me! Surely there were people on the street, someone who could see that she was being abducted. She screamed into the leather glove but heard only a muted mewl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bitch,” the woman growled as she twisted her free hand into Holly’s hair, grabbing a thick clump, nearly pulling it out by the roots as she lifted Holly’s head from the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer attacker shifted suddenly. Using her body weight she slammed Holly’s head against the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgony ripped through Holly’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain exploded behind her eyes, nearly blinding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer skin ripped and she began to bleed. Chipped pieces of asphalt clung to her, matted in her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, no! Frantically she tried to peel her assailant from her. Kicking and bucking, scrabbling in the air, she felt woozy, her coordination failing her, the wicked, horrid mass of humanity atop her not budging. Who the hell was this maniac? Why was this happening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelp me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts were ragged. Cut painfully through her gray matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis woman, whoever the hell she was, planned to murder her. Right here in this horrid little parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears ran down her face with the dark realization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake my purse, my phone, my cash, the damned car but please . . . please . . . stop. Let me live . . . oh, Jesus . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t see straight. Her head throbbed. Panic screamed through her body. Why was this happening? Why? Wedged between two cars, where no one could see her, she focused on the sky above, invisible over the weak light from a streetlamp on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop! Help! Someone help me!” she tried to scream, but her voice was muted, little sound escaping as her head was lifted, hairs sticking to the pavement, glued due to her own blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, no. Don’t! Her eyes were wide. Fear curdled deep inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBam!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more her head was smashed against the asphalt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain erupted, sending shock waves through her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a new gash on the back of her head, the blood flowing warm and wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackness threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeverishly, knowing it was a matter of life and death, her life and death, Holly fought to stay conscious. Blood rushed in her ears and fear clutched her heart. Her movements were now sluggish, ungainly, her arms not obeying her brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer attacker leaned closer and in the dim light from a faraway security lamp and the screen of her phone, she caught a glimpse of the fiend atop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn’t be!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllie Kramer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, oh, God, oh, God. Could this deranged woman astride her actually be Allie Kramer? Or . . . God, why did she look so weird and distorted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the crazy thoughts slid through her brain she denied them. No way. Allie was many things, some of them not so nice, but she wasn’t a killer . . . or was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperately Holly blinked, tried to stay aware, felt herself slipping away, the image looking more warped, Allie’s features blurring into a monstrous caricature of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allie?” Holly vainly tried to speak but only managed to mouth the woman’s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman’s face, distorted, filled her vision. This maniac wasn’t Allie Kramer, couldn’t be. Just someone who looked a lot like Allie, who was dressed like Allie, but is really . . . shit, was it Cassie? No. Yes? There was something wrong . . . for the love of Jesus, what the hell was wrong with her face?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new fear curdled through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing all her strength Holly tried to throw herself upward, to buck off her assailant, but her efforts were too feeble. Trying to get her bearings, she stared at her attacker and the weird image in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the woman above her moved, letting go of Holly’s hair, reached behind her, and pulled something from her coat pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pistol?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? No! Oh, God, no. With a supreme effort she tried to wiggle away but it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a second Holly felt the cold muzzle of a gun pressed to her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“NO!” she tried to scream, as the woman pulled the trigger. There was a muffled pffft and then she felt liquid inside as the attacker stepped off her and the lights began to dim. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-74.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
