You\u0027re hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was partway down the stairs before I could stop

wide-toothed comb through my damp hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom had been stocked with my usual toiletries, demonstrating once again how thoughtful and attentive Gideon was, which only emphasized my deficits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was making his life hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all he\u0027d already suffered, my issues were the last thing he needed to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the stairs down to the first floor and found myself unable to join Gideon in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed a minute to pull myself together and put on a happy face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to ruin the weekend for him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped out through the French doors that led to the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roar of the surf and the biting salt spray hit me at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hem of my robe whipped gently in the ocean breeze, cooling me in a way I found invigorating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, I gripped the railing and closed my eyes, trying to find the peace I needed to keep Gideon from worrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy problem was me, and I didn\u0027t want to concern him with something he couldn\u0027t change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly I could make myself a stronger person, and I needed to, if I wanted to make him happy and offer him the security he so desperately wanted from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened behind me, and I took a deep breath before turning to face him with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon came out with two steaming mugs gripped in one hand - one filled with black coffee and the other lightened with half-and- half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it would be made perfectly to my tastes and delicious, because Gideon knew exactly what I liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot because I\u0027d told him, but because he paid attention to everything about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop beating yourself up,\" he ordered sternly, setting the mugs on the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I couldn\u0027t hide my mood from him with just a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw right through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught my face in his hands and glared down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over and done with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached out and ran my fingertips over the place where I\u0027d seen the bruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It needed to happen,\" he said curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up and

no clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a self-centered idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not dealing with it well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate her fucking

dipped his head and sealed his mouth over mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt started softly, sweet and teasing, his tongue stroking across my bottom lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, my tongue flicking out to touch his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his head and licked into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast, shallow licks that stirred a simmering desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached up and slid my fingers into his damp hair, pushing up onto my tiptoes to deepen the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moaned when he sucked on my tongue, leaning heavily against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips moved against mine, growing wetter and hotter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ate at each other, growing wilder by the second until we were fucking each other\u0027s mouths, passionately mating with lips and tongues and tiny bites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was panting with my hunger for him, my lips slanting over his,

hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue was plunging into my mouth, tangling with mine, his quickened breaths mingling with my own and filling my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy senses were drenched in him, in his flavor and scent, my mind spinning as I angled my head, seeking a deeper taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanting to lick deeper, suck

tormented groan, soaking the silk between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cried out, melting and aching, so insanely aroused by the knowledge that I could make him lose control with just a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grip loosened, his lungs heaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your kisses are mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon

climax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe showered and napped the morning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt so good to sleep beside him again, with my head pillowed on his chest, my arm draped over his rock- hard stomach, and my legs tangled with his.When we woke shortly after one in the afternoon, I was starving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe headed down to the kitchen together and I found that I liked the ultra-stark modern look in that space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe watered-glass cabinet doors and granite paired beautifully with the dark hardwood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter yet, the pantry was fully stocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to leave the house for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went the easy route and made sandwiches, which we took into the living room and ate cross-legged on the couch facing each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was halfway through when I caught Gideon watching me with a grin.\"What?\" I asked, around a bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arnoldo\u0027s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s fun watching you eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked so carefree and happy it made my heart hurt.\"How did you find this place?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or how did Scott find it?\" \"I found it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved a potato chip in his mouth and licked the salt from his lips, which I found sexy as
