There wasn\u0027t a scar on your right hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I slowed down the footage on the TV,\" I said. \"When this creature swiped at the camera, there wasn\u0027t a scar.\" I took Brandon\u0027s right palm and showed him. \"See? You have a major one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\" he asked, not convinced by my theory. \"Maybe it disappears when I turn. I don\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I do remember, and it doesn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure? If it wasn\u0027t me, then what was it\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or who? Another werewolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Or maybe it was some kids playing jokes. I don\u0027t know. I just know it wasn\u0027t you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon breathed a sigh of relief. He placed his arm around my shoulder and drew me into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never met anyone like you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sun is setting,\" I warned. \"What do you want to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stay in that box forever. I don\u0027t know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And more important, Celeste, how are we going to be together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s time you go back to the way you were living. Free, like anyone else. Werewolf or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure... I\u0027d rather not take any chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admired Brandon\u0027s values. With everything he had to worry about, the first thing on his mind was the well-being of the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon kissed me tenderly, and I fought off my incredible desire to be locked away all night with him inside his safe house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs another full moon approached, I met Ivy, Abby, their beaux, and Nash at Wings and Things. If I couldn\u0027t be on the end of Brandon\u0027s lips, then at least I would be surrounded by my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I saw,\" Abby insisted to Ivy when I arrived at their table. \"I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t a werewolf,\" Ivy charged. \"Werewolves have hair all over their faces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo they don\u0027t, I wanted to say. Brandon sported a handsome goatee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this one didn\u0027t,\" Abby stated. \"I don\u0027t know why you don\u0027t believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy paused. \"I do. Not that I believe in werewolves, but I believe you saw something,\" she said sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought Ivy had finally realized that the whole werewolf thing was putting a strain on her relationship with Abby. And she was all about keeping us together as a friendly unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been?\" Ivy asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a million things to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see the werewolf on TV?\" Abby asked. My friends were already well into their wings, so I got to pick at their leftovers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Did it look like a hoax to you?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure,\" I said truthfully. I knew it wasn\u0027t Brandon, but I didn\u0027t know if there was someone else turning at nightfall when the full moon had waned. \"I only know it wasn\u0027t any of us, since we\u0027re all here after sunset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still think that Brandon Maddox might have something to do with this,\" Ivy observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby\u0027s face lit up. \"Maybe it is him. Maybe the Legend\u0027s Run Werewolf is Brandon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you,\" Ivy said. \"I saw him stare at those wolves. It wasn\u0027t like anything I\u0027ve seen on Animal Planet. This was like something Dr. Meadows would do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go again,\" Jake said. \"I think you must have a thing for that guy. It\u0027s all you ever talk about... Brandon and the wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027s also saving dogs,\" Abby said. \"If he is a werewolf, he\u0027s a good one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think, Celeste?\" Ivy asked. \"You\u0027re always defending the underdog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you figured it out. Brandon Maddox is a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all laughed, and this time I did, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either way, there is something strange going on and it\u0027s best we all stick together,\" Nash encouraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of that...\" Ivy said, \"we have to go, but Nash can drive you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, Abby, Jake, Dylan, and Ivy rose while Nash remained seated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were driving me home,\" I said under my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way you and Nash can have some alone time now that you guys are back together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back together?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since this werewolf thing, he has really been there for you,\" Ivy said. \"It\u0027s just like old times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends paid the bill, and Nash and I got into his car. He even opened the door for me. The way he was suddenly being a gentleman was endearing. But I felt awkward as he drove me home. Though he was usually self-centered, I knew there was an inner side to him that he didn\u0027t share with other girls. He parked in front of my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste - \" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car was dark, which only added to the appeal of his handsome features. Normally, he would have leaned into me and I would have gotten a melt-worthy kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut since we\u0027d broken up, we hadn\u0027t shared any romantic gestures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" I finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash pulled off his class ring. \"I want you to have this,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was sweet. Nash was attractive, by any girl\u0027s standards. If this had happened a few months ago, I would have taken it without missing a beat. But I wasn\u0027t going to commit to Nash. Even if it were the smart thing to do, even if it didn\u0027t make sense to love a guy who I couldn\u0027t see at night and couldn\u0027t be embraced by in front of my friends by day. But my heart had been taken by such a guy, and I couldn\u0027t go against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out the ring and it shone under the streetlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can try it on,\" he said. \"It may need to be resized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt so bad. Nash was my friend, but I couldn\u0027t give him my heart, and I couldn\u0027t take his ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a part of me that wants this ring, Nash,\" I said. \"I\u0027d be the luckiest girl at school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scooted closer to me and I looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just not - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen this in movies,\" he said. Nash wasn\u0027t used to being turned down. He wasn\u0027t the kind of guy who rejection was likely to happen to. It tore me up inside to be the one who hurt him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;especially since I cared about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not saying I don\u0027t care for you. You know I do,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll just give you some more time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash wasn\u0027t used to losing. He made a point of letting me know the game wasn\u0027t over yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in his frustration, he reached to unzip his duffel bag and threw the ring into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw something dark and hairy coming out of the bag. I screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he said. He jumped back, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a squirrel!\" I pressed my whole body against the passenger-side door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe, too, scooted away. He quickly opened his car door and jumped out. The overhead car light illuminated the inside. Something furry was sticking out of his duffel bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That - \" I said. \"It\u0027s alive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This?\" he said, pointing to the bag. \"It\u0027s nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered into the bag and grabbed the dark fur. He tried to stop my hand, but it was too late. I pulled out a wild wig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an old Halloween costume. Here - \" he said, stuffing it back into his bag. \"Let me walk you to the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash had never walked me to the door before. He just didn\u0027t want me to see the costume inside the duffel bag, but it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out of the car, and he met me on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled sheepishly. \"Me? What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to grin a boyish grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scaring Heidi. And Abby? Being on TV?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he couldn\u0027t tell if I was going to hug him or slug him. I didn\u0027t do either. Instead I just shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did it for you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It brought you to me. We\u0027ve been hanging out together like old times. We\u0027ve been so happy, all of us together. And you and I... It\u0027s just like when we first went out. I told you I\u0027d show you that you needed me, Celeste. I just had to show you how much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was furious. Nash had put the entire town on alert and caused Brandon to be locked away for weeks. But then I realized the lengths to which Nash had gone to get my attention. We were hanging out as a sixsome again. For some reason, I was the only one who saw the fear in Nash\u0027s face and knew that there was another layer to his superjock image. I knew that is why he needed me more than he needed the other girls at school, and I had to admit that it was nice to be needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why couldn\u0027t you have just been thoughtful, Nash?\" I asked. \"That\u0027s all I ever wanted from you. I just wanted you to really be interested in me and the things I care about. You didn\u0027t have to pretend to be a werewolf so you could be the hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my hands in his. \"But it worked, didn\u0027t it? We\u0027re practically back together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could step away, he drew me into him and kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and wiped my mouth off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at the success of his ruse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will remain between the two of us?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no one I want to tell,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my biggest prank yet,\" he said proudly. \"I might want to reveal it myself.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-29.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
