Robby was holding on, gripping me fiercely. I started backing away in the opposite direction of where the thing now stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was shuddering again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst thing I noticed was a large eye, haphazardly placed on top and rolling around in its flat, disc-shaped socket involuntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby: “Dad what is it what is it what is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing stopped in the doorway of the master bedroom—we had traded places—and it began making its mewling sounds again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried hard to stop panicking but I was hyperventilating and my hand holding the flashlight was shaking so badly that I had to use the other hand to steady it and locate the thing in the beam of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI steadied my hand and found it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was standing still. But something inside it was causing the thing to pulsate. It opened its mouth, which was now coated with froth, and rushed toward us again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turned around I dropped the flashlight, causing Robby to shout out in dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the flashlight and trained the beam on the thing, which had stopped moving—seemingly confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Victor’s barking became hysterical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing resumed rushing us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s when I dropped the flashlight again. The bulb cracked, drowning us in darkness as the thing continued rushing toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed Robby’s sweaty hand and ran to his room and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tripped as I fell into the room, hitting my face against the floor. I felt wetness on my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby slammed the door shut and I heard the lock click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up, wavering in the darkness, and wiped the blood from my mouth. I shouted out when Robby steadied me with a frightened hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened closely. It was so dark in the room that we were forced to concentrate on the scratching sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the scratching subsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby’s grip on me loosened. I exhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the relief couldn’t be sustained because there was a cracking noise. It was pushing itself against the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved to the door. Robby was still holding on to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Robby,” I whispered. “Do you have a flashlight in here? Anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Robby immediately let go of me and heard him move in the direction of his closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkness of the room a green light saber appeared. It floated toward me and I took the toy from him. The glow was faint. I aimed the light saber at the door, illuminating it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad,” Robby whispered, his voice shaky. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” (But even as I said this, I knew what it was.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scratching resumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was asking myself: What is it scratching with?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I realized it wasn’t scratching. (I remembered something.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had never been scratching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was gnawing at the door. It was using its mouth. It was using its teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the gnawing stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby and I stared at the door, which was now bathed in green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we watched in horror as the doorknob began to twist back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a sickening flash I understood that it was using its mouth to accomplish this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to remind myself to breathe again when the doorknob rattled violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a snarling sound. It was the noise of frustration. It was the noise of hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it stopped. We could hear the thing dragging itself away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it? What does it want? I don’t understand. How did it get in?” This was Robby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what the hell it is,” I was saying absurdly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it, Dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know I don’t know I don’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Note: This was not technically true.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur moaning was cut off by the sound of Sarah screaming. “Mommy! Mommy! It’s getting me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rushed through the bathroom and into Sarah’s room. In the instant before I grabbed her off the bed I waved the light saber over the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah was backed up against the headboard as the thing attempted to pull itself onto her bed. It had fastened its mouth over one of the bedposts and it was moving frantically and squealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s happening?” Robby was screaming this from inside the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouted out in disgust and grabbed Sarah off the bed. As I carried her toward the bathroom, the thing froze and then leapt onto the floor and I could hear it rushing toward us. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-105.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
