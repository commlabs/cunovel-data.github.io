And really, it only takes a few moments.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly, the fact that we were able to share a bathroom also made sense. Was Nancy hoping that Daemon and I would cave to our wild-monkey lust and bring little Daemon babies into the world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I thought I was going to hurl when she confirmed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After all, we haven’t stopped you from spending a few moments here and there alone, have we?” Her smile officially creeped me out. “And you two are young and so very much in love. I’m sure you’ll make use of your free time sooner or later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Dasher hadn’t mentioned any of this during his sales pitch about protecting the world against an alien invasion or curing diseases. Then again, there were many sides to Daedalus. He had said that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon opened his mouth, no doubt to say something I’d kick him for, but I cut him off. “I have a hard time believing you’ve had that many people who just…well, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, in some cases, the pregnancies were purely accidental. In other instances, we assisted the process.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir came into my body but got stuck in my lungs. “Assisted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not what you think.” She laughed; the sound was shrill and nerve-racking. “There have been volunteers over the years, Luxen and hybrids who understand what Daedalus is truly about. In other cases, we did in vitro fertilization.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knots moved up my throat like bile, which was a bad thing because my mouth was hanging open. Nothing there to stop it from spewing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle in Daemon’s jaw was working overtime, thumping away. “What? Is Daedalus moonlighting as Match.com for Luxen and hybrids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy sent him a dry look, and I couldn’t stop the shudder of revulsion. In vitro meant there had to be a female hybrid to carry the baby. No matter what she said, I doubted all of them were willing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pupils of Daemon’s eyes had started to glow. “How many of them do you have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hundreds,” she repeated. “The younger ones are kept here, and as they grow older, they are moved to different locations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you controlling them? From what it looked like, you barely had any control over Micah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips thinned. “We use trackers that usually keep them where they are supposed to be. However, from time to time, they find ways around them. The ones who aren’t controllable are dealt with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dealt with?” I whispered, horrified at where my imagination took that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The origins are superior in almost every way. They are remarkable, but they can become very dangerous. If they have not assimilated, then they have to be dealt with accordingly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy imagination had been dead-on. “Oh my God…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon slammed his hand down on the table, causing Archer to move forward, hand going to his weapon. “You’re basically creating a race of test-tube babies, and if they’re not acceptable, you kill them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t expect you to understand,” Nancy replied evenly as she stood and moved behind her chair. She gripped the back. “The origins are the perfect species, but like with any race of being or creature, there are…duds. It happens. The positives and potential outweigh the nastier side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. “What exactly is so positive about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Many of our origins have grown up and have assimilated into society. We have trained them so that they will reach the height of success. Each of them has been tailored from birth to assume a certain role. They will become doctors of unequaled abilities, researchers who will unlock the unknown, senators and politicians who are able to see the bigger picture and will bring about social change.” She paused and turned toward where Archer stood. “And some will become soldiers of unprecedented talent, joining the ranks of hybrids and humans, creating an army that will be unstoppable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny hairs on the back of my neck rose as I slowly twisted in my chair. My eyes met Archer’s. His expression was emotionless. “Are you…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Archer?” Nancy said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking his hand off the handle of his gun, he reached up to his left eye with two fingers. He made a pinching motion and a colored contact lens popped out, revealing an iris that was shiny like an amethyst jewel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in a sharp breath. “Holy crapola…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon swore under his breath, and now it made sense why it was only Archer who guarded Daemon and me. If he was anything like Micah, he could handle whatever we threw at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, aren’t you just a special snowflake,” Daemon murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That I am.” Archer’s lips quirked into a half grin. “It’s a secret. We wouldn’t want the other officers or soldiers to be uncomfortable around me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich explained why he hadn’t gone all superhuman on Micah and had shot him with a tranq gun instead. A thousand questions rushed to the tip of my tongue, but I was struck silent by the implications of what and who he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon folded his arms as he focused on Nancy again. “Interesting reveal and all, but I have a bigger question to ask you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spread her arms wide in a welcoming way. “Go ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you determine who brings the babies into the world?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God, my stomach tensed even more, and I bent over, clutching the end of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s simple, actually. Besides the in vitro, we look for Luxen and hybrids like you two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had to get out of there. Sooner, not later. That was all I could think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we were escorted back to our rooms, I looked at Archer a little more differently and a hell of lot more closely. The soldier had always seemed different, but I would’ve never guessed that he was something other than human. I had sensed nothing unusual from him, not a damn thing other than this off vibe, but I did notice that Kat seemed comfortable around him. Other than a few smartass responses, which I of all people couldn’t hold against him, he seemed like a pretty okay guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd frankly, I didn’t care what the hell he was. Knowing that he was something different only meant I needed to watch him more carefully. What did matter was the fact that they were breeding children here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat disturbed the hell out of me, and it also angered me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment the door was shut behind me, I headed for the bathroom. Kat had the same idea. A second later, her door opened, and she walked in, quietly shutting the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was pale. “I want to vomit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, let me get out of the way, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows pinched. “Daemon, they…” She shook her head, eyes wide. “There are no words for this. It’s beyond anything I could’ve imagined.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same here.” I leaned against the sink as she sat on the edge of the closed lid. “Dawson never mentioned anything like that to you, did he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. Dawson rarely spoke about his time with Daedalus, and when he did, he usually told Kat. “No, but he said some of the things were insane. He was probably talking about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I said any more, I shifted without warning to my true form. Sorry, I said when she winced. Luc had warned me that the things here would blow my mind. Speaking of which, notice anything about Archer’s and Micah’s eyes—and who has the same kind? Luc’s got the weird, blurred line effect going on, too. Hell, I should’ve known that kid wasn’t a normal hybrid. He’s an origin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat ran her palms over her thighs. When she was nervous, she was always fidgeting. Normally I found it cute, but I hated the why behind it now. This is beyond us, she said. How many kids do you think they have? How many people are out there in the world, masquerading as normal humans?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that’s no different than us pretending to be normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re not superhumans who can drop a person on the ground by curling our fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was kind of envious of that ability. Yeah, too bad, because that would come in handy when someone is getting on your nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand shot out, smacking my leg. And what the heck was that? She—that evil woman in a pantsuit—didn’t mention anything about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty much all women who wear pantsuits are evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat’s head tipped to the side. Okay. I do have to agree with that, but can we focus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can now that you agree. I reached over and tweaked her nose, which earned me a dirty look. We need to get the hell out of here and quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agree. She knocked my hand away when I went for her nose again. No offense, but I have no desire to be making any weird babies with you right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked on my laugh. You’d be blessed to have a child of mine. Admit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes rolled. Seriously, your ego knows no limit, no matter the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey. I like to be consistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat you are, she said, voice dry in my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as I love the idea of the whole process involved in making a baby with you, it’s not ever going to happen under these circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pretty flush covered her cheeks. Glad we’re on the same page, buddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to get the LH-11 and somehow get in contact with Luc. That sounds impossible to me. Kat’s gaze wandered to the closed door. We don’t even know where it’s kept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing is truly impossible, I reminded her. But I think we do need another plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny ideas? She tugged the elastic band out of her hair and untangled the mass of waves. Maybe we could set the origins loose in the compound. I bet that would cause enough of a distraction. Or maybe you could take on the form of one of the staff here…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were good ideas, but there were problems: I bet Daedalus had defenses in place in case a Luxen morphed into someone else, and how would we get to the other building to let out a bunch of miniature super-soldiers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat turned to me, biting on her lower lip as she reached out. Her fingers snaked through the light and touched my arm. My entire body jerked. In my true form, I was hypersensitive. They weren’t really good ideas, were they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were great ideas, but…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot easily done. She slid her hand up my arm, her head tilting to the side as her gaze wandered over me. My light reflected off her cheeks, giving her a rosy glow. She was beautiful, and I was so, so desperately in love with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chin jerked up, and she sucked in a breath, eyes widening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I may have actually thought that last bit at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou did. A small smile split her lips. I liked hearing it. A lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKneeling down so I was eye level with her, I cupped her cheek. I promise you that this isn’t going to be our future, Kitten. I will give that to you—a normal life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes glistened. I don’t expect a normal life. I just expect a life with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, that did crazy things to my heart. Like it stopped beating for a moment, and I was dead in front of her for a second. Sometimes I don’t think I…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave a shake of my head. Never mind. I lowered my hand and backed up, breaking contact. Luc said he’d know once I got ahold of LH-11. Obviously who he has in here has to be close to us. Anyone you can think of who might be a friendly? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/origin-lux-4/page-24.html","bookId":1664,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:47 PM"}
