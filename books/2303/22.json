{"id":94597,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are those the kind of things that young warlocks do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but it\u0027s what I did.\" Eventually, he had mastered fire, among other things, but on the day he married Abigail, he had put his magick behind him. And then he had been turned and found he possessed supernatural powers he had never dreamed of, inherent vampire magic that didn\u0027t require magical spells or enchantments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here you are, safely home again,\" Erik remarked when they reached her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy nodded. Always her protector, Alex was waiting for her on the front porch. \"About time you got back,\" he said gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, I\u0027m a big girl now. You don\u0027t have to wait up for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" Alex glared at Erik for a long moment, then turned on his heel and went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big brothers,\" Daisy said fondly. \"They can be a pain in the butt sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say so. Can I see you tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know all the reasons why we shouldn\u0027t,\" he said, drawing her into his arms. \"But right now they don\u0027t seem to matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappiness bubbled up inside her at the prospect of being with him again. \"What time?\" It wasn\u0027t the smart answer, it wasn\u0027t the safe answer, but it felt like the right one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever\u0027s good for you,\" he said with a wink. \"I\u0027ve got all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight o\u0027clock?\" She could have Alex fed and settled down by then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I pick you up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll meet you somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the Crypt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" She gazed up at him, her heart pounding with anticipation as he lowered his head to claim her lips with his. She would see him again tomorrow night. She was already counting the hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet dreams, my little flower,\" Alex murmured as he kissed her lightly on the forehead; then, mindful that her brother was watching his every move from the living room window, Erik walked slowly to his car, unlocked the door with the key instead of his preternatural power, and slid behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter starting the car, Erik blew a kiss to Daisy, who was still standing on the front porch. And then he waved to her brother, who glared at him from the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, Erik pulled away from the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, sis,\" Alex called. \"Are you ready to go yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming.\" Daisy checked her pockets and her handbag, making sure she had everything she needed, including her keys. \"What\u0027s the rush?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want somebody else to beat me to that two hundred grand. Here,\" he said, thrusting a can of Scent-B-Gone into her hand, \"spray me, will ya?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy sprayed her brother from head to foot, then held her nose while he returned the favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex grinned at her. \"Sure stinks until it dries, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, Daisy followed Alex out to his car. She had spent the wee small hours of last night and all of this morning trying to talk her brother out of going after Rhys, but to no avail. The two-hundred-thousand-dollar reward drew him like a magnet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to be home early,\" she said, fastening her seat belt. \"I have a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex shook his head as he backed out of the driveway. \"I really don\u0027t like that guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy rolled her eyes. \"Are you still harping on that?\" It was all she\u0027d heard since Erik had brought her home last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d had no intention of going with Alex to look for Rhys, but Alex had asked her to tag along in hopes that her compass would lead him to the vampire he sought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t trust him. If he\u0027s an artist, I\u0027ll eat my Harley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sound of impatience rose in Daisy\u0027s throat. \"He is an artist, you idiot. I have a painting to prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Did you see him paint it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, you\u0027re impossible. Turn right at the next corner.\" She stared out the window, watching as the houses grew farther apart. They were in an older neighborhood now, one that looked like it had once been a pricey part of town. The homes were large, but mostly run-down, the lawns unkempt, the paint faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, he\u0027s an artist,\" Alex said. \"What do you say we ask him to do a family portrait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, next time we\u0027re all in Boston. I\u0027m sure Erik\u0027s got nothing better to do. Turn left at the corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid to put him to the test?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, there\u0027s something about him.\" Alex shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know what it is, but something ain\u0027t right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering, \"Oh, give it up,\" Daisy glanced at her compass. \"Stop here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe needle on her compass shimmered a bright red when Alex braked in front of the last house on the block. There were bars on the windows, a security screen door, and a ferocious-looking mastiff standing stiff-legged behind a wrought-iron fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever lives here doesn\u0027t want any company, that\u0027s for sure,\" Alex muttered, peering through the windshield. \"Wait here, I\u0027m going in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too hot to sit in the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave the engine running. I won\u0027t be long.\" Getting out of the car, Alex slung his kit over his shoulder, then opened the small ice chest stowed on the backseat. Reaching inside, he pulled a large chunk of fresh hamburger out of a plastic bag. \"Pays to be prepared,\" he said with a wink and a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy grinned back at him. It was an old trick, doctoring hamburger with a sedative. She watched Alex toss the meat over the fence. The dog gobbled it down in one swallow; less than a minute later, the animal was out cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex gave her the high sign, vaulted over the fence, and loped up to the front porch. Quick work with a lock pick, and he was inside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy leaned back against the headrest and closed her eyes. What was Erik doing now? She knew he could be awake when the sun was up, though he preferred to take his rest then. She wondered what happened if vampires didn\u0027t sleep during the day. Did they just get cranky? Was it only the very young who were compelled to rest, or was it something they all did? What was it like, to sleep by day and be active only after the sun went down? Did it seem normal to vampires after a time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her head, she stared at the house, then glanced at her watch. How long had Alex been inside? Why hadn\u0027t she paid attention to the time? He should have been back by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing a stake and a bottle of holy water from her bag, she switched off the engine, slipped the holy water and the keys into her pocket, and got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sent a nervous glance at the dog as she opened the gate. It was the biggest mastiff she had ever seen. More like a small horse than a dog. After making sure it was still sleeping deeply, she made her way to the front porch and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of the house was dark. Heavy drapes covered the windows. There were three sofas and several chairs in the living room. The floors were polished hardwood. An ancient-looking leather scabbard hung over a marble fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused a moment, listening, but heard only silence. Taking a deep breath, she counted to ten and then called Alex\u0027s name. When there was no reply, she tiptoed across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver of unease skittered down her spine as she moved deeper into the house. Most lairs were in basements or, occasionally, in a dusty attic. Vampires didn\u0027t seem to be bothered by dirt, dust, or spiderwebs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer footsteps echoed on the hardwood floors as she peered into one room after another. All were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe froze when a muffled cry reached her ears. Alex! Another cry, harsher than the first, set her heart to pounding. Alex was in trouble. All thought for her own safety fled as Daisy pulled the bottle of holy water from her pocket and followed the sound of her brother\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire\u0027s lair was located in what had once been a walk-in pantry that was big enough to have made a fair-sized bedroom. A shiny black coffin sat in the middle of the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy came to an abrupt halt just inside the doorway, her mind barely able to comprehend what she was seeing. Alex was on the floor. Covered in blood, he was trying to fight off the vampire hovering over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalvanized by fear that the vampire would drain her brother dry, or worse, turn him, Daisy uncorked the bottle of holy water and flung it at the back of the vampire\u0027s head. The scent of scorched hair and preternatural flesh immediately stung her nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowling in fury, the vampire spun around to face her, his narrowed eyes as red as hell\u0027s own flames, his fangs dripping with blood. Alex\u0027s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a cry of horror, Daisy grabbed the stake from her pocket, charged forward, and plunged it into the vampire\u0027s chest. Snarling, he took several steps backward, his hands curling around the stake as his curses filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex!\" Sobbing his name, spurred by the need to get the two of them out of there as fast as possible, she dragged her brother to his feet. Sagging under his weight, she somehow managed to get him out of the house and into the passenger seat of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she got behind the wheel, her hands were shaking so badly, it took three tries to get the key into the ignition. Shoving the gearshift into drive, she slammed her foot down on the gas pedal. The car lurched crazily before she got it under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t dare look back, afraid if she did, she would see the vampire coming after them. But that was impossible. She had killed him. Hadn\u0027t she? But if she had destroyed him, why hadn\u0027t he dissolved into dust? Oh, Lord, what if she had missed his heart?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove like a maniac, her mind whirling as she headed for the freeway. She glanced at her brother. He was unconscious. She had to get him to a hospital, and soon. Blood leaked from dozens of deep bites on his arms, legs, chest, and neck from where the vampire had savaged him. More blood bubbled from a wound in his stomach, a wound she dared not examine too closely for fear she would lose control of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed help, she thought anxiously. And he needed it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelp he couldn\u0027t get from a hospital. She knew instinctively that a doctor couldn\u0027t save him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik, she thought. She needed Erik. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-22.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
