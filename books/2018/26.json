There was a solemn and lonely silence over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strangers of the Foundation knew nothing of the swirling days and nights of the bloody Sack that had left the University untouched. They knew nothing of the time after the collapse of the Imperial power, when the students, with their borrowed weapons, and their pale-faced inexperienced bravery, formed a protective volunteer army to protect the central shrine of the science of the Galaxy. They knew nothing of the Seven Days Fight, and the armistice that kept the University free, when even the Imperial palace clanged with the boots of Gilmer and his soldiers, during the short interval of their rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose of the Foundation, approaching for the first time, realized only that in a world of transition from a gutted old to a strenuous new this area was a quiet, graceful museum-piece of ancient greatness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were intruders in a sense. The brooding emptiness rejected them. The academic atmosphere seemed still to live and to stir angrily at the disturbance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe library was a deceptively small building which broadened out vastly underground into a mammoth volume of silence and reverie. Ebling Mis paused before the elaborate murals of the reception room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whispered - one had to whisper here: \"I think we passed the catalog rooms back a way. I\u0027ll stop there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis forehead was flushed, his hand trembling, \"I mustn\u0027t be disturbed, Toran. Will you bring my meals down to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you say. We\u0027ll do all we can to help. Do you want us to work under you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I must be alone-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you will get what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ebling Mis replied with a soft certainty, \"I know I will!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran and Bayta came closer to \"setting up housekeeping\" in normal fashion than at any time in their year of married life. It was a strange sort of \"housekeeping.\" They lived in the middle of grandeur with an inappropriate simplicity. Their food was drawn largely from Lee Senter\u0027s farm and was paid for in the little nuclear gadgets that may be found on any Trader\u0027s ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnifico taught himself how to use the projectors in the library reading room, and sat over adventure novels and romances to the point where he was almost as forgetful of meals and sleep as was Ebling Mis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEbling himself was completely buried. He had insisted on a hammock being slung up for him in the Psychology Reference Room. His face grew thin and white. His vigor of speech was lost and his favorite curses had died a mild death. There were times when the recognition of either Toran or Bayta seemed a struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was more himself with Magnifico who brought him his meals and often sat watching him for hours at a time, with a queer, fascinated absorption, as the aging psychologist transcribed endless equations, cross-referred to endless book-films, scurried endlessly about in a wild mental effort towards an end he alone saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran came upon her in the darkened room, and said sharply, \"Bayta!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta started guiltily. \"Yes? You want me, Torie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I want you. What in Space are you sitting there for? You\u0027ve been acting all wrong since we got to Trantor. What\u0027s the matter with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Torie, stop,\" she said, wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd \"Oh, Torie, stop!\" he mimicked impatiently. Then, with sudden softness, \"Won\u0027t you tell me what\u0027s wrong, Bay? Something\u0027s bothering you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Nothing is, Torie. If you keep on just nagging and nagging, you\u0027ll have me mad. I\u0027m just - thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thinking about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About nothing. Well, about the Mule, and Haven, and the Foundation, and everything. About Ebling Mis and whether he\u0027ll find anything about the Second Foundation, and whether it will help us when he does find it - and a million other things. Are you satisfied?\" Her voice was agitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re just brooding, do you mind stopping? It isn\u0027t pleasant and it doesn\u0027t help the situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta got to her feet and smiled weakly. \"All right. I\u0027m happy. See, I\u0027m smiling and jolly. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnifico\u0027s voice was an agitated cry outside. \"My lady-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it? Come-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta\u0027s voice choked off sharply when the opening door framed the large, hard-faced-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pritcher,\" cried Toran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta gasped, \"Captain! How did you find us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHan Pritcher stepped inside. His voice was clear and level, and utterly dead of feeling, \"My rank is colonel now - under the Mule.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Under the... Mule!\" Toran\u0027s voice trailed off. They formed a tableau there, the three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnifico stared wildly and shrank behind Toran. Nobody stopped to notice him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta said, her hands trembling in each other\u0027s tight grasp, \"You are arresting us? You have really gone over to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colonel replied quickly, \"I have not come to arrest you. My instructions make no mention of you. With regard to you, I am free, and I choose to exercise our old friendship, if you will let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran\u0027s face was a twisted suppression of fury, \"How did you find us? You were in the Filian ship, then? You followed us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wooden lack of expression on Pritcher\u0027s face might have flickered in embarrassment. \"I was on the Filian ship! I met you in the first place... well... by chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a chance that is mathematically impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Simply rather improbable, so my statement will have to stand. In any case, you admitted to the. Filians - there is, of course, no such nation as Filia actually - that you were heading for the Trantor sector, and since the Mule already had his contacts upon Neotrantor, it was easy to have you detained there. Unfortunately, you got away before I arrived, but not long before. I had time to have the farms on Trantor ordered to report your arrival. It was done and I am here. May I sit down? I come in friendliness, believe me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat. Toran bent his head and thought futilely. With a numbed lack of emotion, Bayta prepared tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran looked up harshly. \"Well, what are you waiting for - colonel? What\u0027s your friendship? If it\u0027s not arrest, what is it then? Protective custody? Call in your men and give your orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatiently, Pritcher shook his head. \"No, Toran. I come of my own will to speak to you, to persuade you of the uselessness of what you are doing. If I fail I shall leave. That is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is all? Well, then peddle your propaganda, give us your speech, and leave. I don\u0027t want any tea, Bayta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher accepted a cup, with a grave word of thanks. He looked at Toran with a clear strength as he sipped lightly. Then he said, \"The Mule is a mutant. He can not be beaten in the very nature of the mutation-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? What is the mutation?\" asked Toran, with sour humor. \"I suppose you\u0027ll tell us now, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I will. Your knowledge won\u0027t hurt him. You see - he is capable of adjusting the emotional balance of human beings. It sounds like a little trick, but it\u0027s quite unbeatable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta broke in, \"The emotional balance?\" She frowned, \"Won\u0027t you explain that? I don\u0027t quite understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean that it is an easy matter for him to instill into a capable general, say, the emotion of utter loyalty to the Mule and complete belief in the Mule\u0027s victory. His generals are emotionally controlled. They can not betray him; they can not weaken - and the control is permanent. His most capable enemies become his most faithful subordinates, The warlord of Kalgan surrenders his planet and becomes his viceroy for the Foundation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you,\" added Bayta, bitterly, \"betray your cause and become Mule\u0027s envoy to Trantor. I see!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t finished. The Mule\u0027s gift works in reverse even more effectively. Despair is an emotion! At the crucial moment, keymen on the Foundation - keymen on Haven - despaired. Their worlds fell without too much struggle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mean to say,\" demanded Bayta, tensely, \"that the feeling I had in the Time Vault was the Mule juggling my emotional control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine, too. Everyone\u0027s. How was it on Haven towards the end?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Pritcher continued earnestly, \"As it works for worlds, so it works for individuals. Can you fight a force which can make you surrender willingly when it so desires; can make you a faithful servant when it so desires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran said slowly, \"How do I know this is the truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you explain the fall of the Foundation and of Haven otherwise? Can you explain my conversion otherwise? Think, man! What have you - or I - or the whole Galaxy accomplished against the Mule in all this time? What one little thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToran felt the challenge, \"By the Galaxy, I can!\" With a sudden touch of fierce satisfaction, he shouted, \"Your wonderful Mule had contacts with Neotrantor you say that were to have detained us, eh? Those contacts are dead or worse. We killed the crown prince and left the other a whimpering idiot. The Mule did not stop us there, and that much has been undone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, no, not at all. Those weren\u0027t our men. The crown prince was a wine-soaked mediocrity. The other man, Commason, is phenomenally stupid. He was a power on his world but that didn\u0027t prevent him from being vicious, evil, and completely incompetent. We had nothing really to do with them. They were, in a sense, merely feints-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was they who detained us, or tried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again, no. Commason had a personal slave - a man called Inchney. Detention was his policy. He is old, but will serve our temporary purpose. You would not have killed him, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta whirled on him. She had not touched her own tea. \"But, by your very statement, your own emotions have been tampered with. You\u0027ve got faith and belief in the Mule, an unnatural, a diseased faith in the Mule. Of what value are your opinions? You\u0027ve lost all power of objective thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are wrong.\" Slowly, the colonel shook his head. \"Only my emotions are fixed. My reason is as it always was. It may be influenced in a certain direction by my conditioned emotions, but it is not forced. And there are some things I can see more clearly now that I am freed of my earlier emotional trend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see that the Mule\u0027s program is an intelligent and worthy one. In the time since I have been - converted, I have followed his career from its start seven years ago. With his mutant mental power, he began by winning over a condottiere and his band. With that - and his power - he won a planet. With that - and his power - he extended his grip until he could tackle the warlord of Kalgan. Each step followed the other logically. With Kalgan in his pocket, he had a first-class fleet, and with that - and his power - he could attack the Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Foundation is the key. It is the greatest area of industrial concentration in the Galaxy, and now that the nuclear techniques of the Foundation are in his hands, he is the actual master of the Galaxy. With those techniques - and his power - he can force the remnants of the Empire to acknowledge his rule, and eventually - with the death of the old emperor, who is mad and not long for this world - to crown him emperor. He will then have the name as well as the fact. With that - and his power - where is the world in the Galaxy that can oppose him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In these last seven years, he has established a new Empire. In seven years, in other words, he will have accomplished what all Seldon\u0027s psychohistory could not have done in less than an additional seven hundred. The Galaxy will have peace and order at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you could not stop it - any more than you could stop a planet\u0027s rush with your shoulders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long silence followed Pritcher\u0027s speech. What remained of his tea had grown cold. He emptied his cup, filled it again, and drained it slowly. Toran bit viciously at a thumbnail. Bayta\u0027s face was cold, and distant, and white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Bayta said in a thin voice, \"We are not convinced. If the Mule wishes us to be, let him come here and condition us himself. You fought him until the last moment of your conversion, I imagine, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" said Colonel Pritcher, solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then allow us the same privilege.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Pritcher arose. With a crisp air of finality, he said, \"Then I leave. As I said earlier, my mission at present concerns you in no way. Therefore, I don\u0027t think it will be necessary to report your presence here. That is not too great a kindness. If the Mule wishes you stopped, he no doubt has other men assigned to the job, and you will be stopped. But, for what it is worth, I shall not contribute more than my requirement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said Bayta faintly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for Magnifico. Where is he? Come out, Magnifico, I won\u0027t hurt you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about him?\" demanded Bayta, with sudden animation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. My instructions make no mention of him, either. I have heard that he is searched for, but the Mule will find him when the time suits him. I shall say nothing. Will you shake hands?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta shook her head. Toran glared his frustrated contempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the slightest lowering of the colonel\u0027s iron shoulders. He strode to the door, turned and said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One last thing. Don\u0027t think I am not aware of the source of your stubbornness. It is known that you search for the Second Foundation. The Mule, in his time, will take his measures. Nothing will help you - But I knew you in other times; perhaps there is something in my conscience that urged me to this; at any rate, I tried to help you and remove you from the final danger before it was too late. Good-by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saluted sharply - and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayta turned to a silent Toran, and whispered, \"They even know about the Second Foundation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the recesses of the library, Ebling Mis, unaware of all, crouched under the one spark of light amid the murky spaces and mumbled triumphantly to himself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/foundation-and-empire-foundation-2/page-26.html","bookId":2018,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:06:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:06:30 PM"}
