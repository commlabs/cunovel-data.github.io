This wasn’t normal. It was survival of the fittest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice took on an edge. “What are you even doing here? I thought being on this side of the island freaked Trainees out.” That was what Josh had told me anyway. “Aren’t you worried you might turn into one these zombified bloodthirsty monsters someday?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he didn’t want to answer. Finally, he admitted, “Yeah, sure, it’s freaky. But we had to follow Yas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened. “Yasuo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a baffled shrug. “He’s been acting weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Understatement of the year.” It hurt that Yasuo was no longer my friend—he’d once been mine to know about, chat with, look for. “He used to be one of my best friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said, with surprising sincerity, “sorry about that. The guys are still pretty sore about the whole Rob thing. You know, the”—he pointed to his teeth—“the fang thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should watch your back. They’re pretty balls-out for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClassy. But I appreciated the sentiment, if not the choice of words. And wasn’t that just grand, because now I could never kill this kid. How much easier it’d be if he were as much of a jerk as the rest of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I put it off just a bit longer? But that was why Alcántara had assigned me this boy, wasn’t it? He’d know I’d have trouble “assassinating” someone like this. The Spanish vampire was testing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I avoid killing him? Evade my assignment altogether? I ran possible excuses through my head. Possible scenarios. Surely there’d be a way to pass my class without killing Toby-the-Trainee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard someone approaching and spotted Rob and Danny, dragging a limp and pale Yasuo between them. “Found him,” Rob called. Then he spotted me and his eyes went wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa. The moron thought he’d killed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot Toby a glare. “What the fuck is she doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him my brightest smile. “Happy to see me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This time it’ll be the last time.” Rob flung Yasuo’s arm down, making him stumble, then strode toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding tall, Toby put up his hands. “Rob, dude. Take it down a notch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasuo’s head lolled up, and spotting me, life snapped into his eyes. Like a flicked switch, he was instantly animated, his body shooting upright. It was like a rabid animal woken from sleep. One minute Yas was absent, the next he was there. Like, really there. He shouldered past the others to get in my face. “Nobody trusts you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny chimed in. “I agree with Yas. You’re toxic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI angled away from them. “Hey, didn’t you hear Toby? Let’s all chill out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasuo’s attention turned to farm boy. “Ignore her. She gets people to trust her. To tell her their secrets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here, you know,” I said. “You can address me directly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI regretted my words when he turned his full attention back to me. I had to look away from that creepy cold stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emma trusted you and now she’s dead. Amanda trusted you—did you know her secrets, too? How about Ronan?” Then he added slowly, deliberately, “I’ll just bet he tells you all sorts of things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrenaline dumped through me, acid blazing through my veins. What was he referring to? Ronan had shared the secret of Lilac’s strength with me just before I met her in the ring for the Directorate Challenge. Stupidly, I’d later confided it to Yas and Emma. Was Yasuo threatening me with this? Threatening Ronan? Were my friends his enemies now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’d been a secret big enough to save my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig enough to get Ronan killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you saying?” I asked carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m saying you’ll suffer.” His voice was a deep and otherworldly growl. The rationality that’d been in his eyes a moment ago clouded. “There has been a wrong, and I will right it to my death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkeydokey. I took a subtle step backward. Righting wrongs till death was always my cue to exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraug in the surrounding pens began to come to life, their moans turning to snarls. Someone among us was afraid and it smelled tasty. Toby shot a panicked glance their way. “Let’s get out of here, guys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not leaving till it’s finished,” Yas said in that creepy voice. “Till she’s finished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” Rob stepped forward. “Can’t leave this mess behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny snickered. “Hot mess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby put a hand on Rob’s arm. “Let it go, man. What if those things smell her blood and bust out of there? I’m not getting eaten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob snatched his arm back. “They won’t eat you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny taunted him. “Don’t be such a nancy boy, Tobe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There has been a wrong,” Yas intoned again. Suddenly he was pure rage, unhinged, his madness glimmering until his eyes glowed red with it. This was Draug Yasuo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole scene was disintegrating rapidly. My gaze skittered right and left, searching for a plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looking for someone?” Danny’s voice was cool and amused in a way that scared me more than any Draug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. The attention was back on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because there’s nobody here but us,” Rob said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No vamp to come and save you,” Danny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob stepped closer. “Good times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get her,” Yas growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny loomed over me. “You think you’re better than us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re even too good for the island vamps,” Rob said, in an obvious reference to Carden. “Where’d you find that skirt-wearing bastard anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood tall, deflecting the pain, dredging some dignity from down deep. “That bastard is a Vampire, hundreds of years old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby had wandered closer to the Draug pen, looking uneasy. “Hey, guys, these things are really freaking out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob ignored him and held my gaze. “Then where’s the old bastard now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are any of her little friends?” Danny asked. “Oh, right. She has none.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None are left,” Yasuo declared in that eerie atonal voice. His eyes were really glowing now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring Yasuo, I tried to sound braver than I felt and said determinedly, “Carden will be back.” Because he would, right? Carden would need to return sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny glanced right and left, then gave me a stupid grin and a shrug. “I don’t see him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guys, seriously. These Draug things are starting to lose it.” That was Toby. At least one of these morons had a lick of sense. I imagined once the beasts were riled up, smell of fear or not, there’d be no stopping them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, guys,” I interjected, “aren’t you scared of the Draug?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny took a step closer. “We’re not scared of shit. Especially not you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s just get out of here,” Toby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can. I’m staying.” Rob leapt at me, with Danny right behind. The pitchfork flew from my hands. Rob snagged my arm and curled his fingers into me, hard enough that I felt it through my coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than pulling away, I hurled myself toward him, the surprise earning me a moment’s advantage. My hand found his collar, and I slammed my other onto his shoulder, grabbing as much fabric as I could. “Is this still part of your homework assignment? Because I think you failed.” I pulled and twisted, trying to choke him with the collar of his own shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the move gave him some ideas, because he went for my throat, too. “Not yet, I haven’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe grappled, me squirming to stop him from getting a firm grip. The collar of my catsuit was snug against my neck, but not so snug he couldn’t easily wriggle a few fingers down there if I gave him the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny stood close, cheering him on, chanting for blood. Toby mumbled some protest or other, but how successful could he be, really, when he wasn’t exactly doing anything to stop this? And through it all was Yasuo, snarling and muttering. Had he completely lost it already? I couldn’t tell if this was madness or pure, cold-blooded fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob had me restrained in a bear hug now. This close, his hot breath stank like stale onions. He tipped his head to scan my neck and shoulders in a lingering perusal that made my skin crawl. “I live for girls like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, I wasn’t just fighting Rob. I was fighting everything he represented. Everything he stood for. My body exploded into action, renewed kicking, bucking, scratching. “How can you feed with no fangs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll feed.” Rob gave me a gloating smile. “That’s why you’re here. It’s the blood in you girls that makes us strong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment the words were out of Rob’s mouth, Yasuo went ballistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasuo went nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNUTS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flew at Rob, ripped him off me and flung him against the fence, repeatedly slamming his face against the post like a person might beat the dust from a rug. There was a hideous sound, a splat and crack like a hammer on meat, and Yas tossed him away, a bloody heap in the muddy snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?” Toby shouted, backing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny dove to kneel beside Rob in the slush, watching helplessly as his friend writhed and spasmed, then glared over his shoulder at Yasuo. “Have you totally lost it?” Rob’s jaw hung loose, no longer resembling a jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Draug began howling like crazy, rattling their cages, because now they scented fear and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Yasuo just stood there, panting, his mouth agape, fangs longer than I’d ever seen them. Sharp and gleaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell…? What the hell?” Toby was paralyzed, rocking in place, looking like he was going to tear his hair out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should get out of here,” I whispered to him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-keep-the-watchers-4/page-37.html","bookId":2294,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:59 PM"}
