Veronica does not know he has come to see me, and Ronnie needs to keep it quick if he does not want to get caught doing something without Veronica\u0027s permission - something like saying hello to his best friend, whom he has not seen for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I sit up, he says, \"What happened to your face?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touch my forehead. \"My hands slipped yesterday, and I dropped the bar on myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it made your cheek all puffy like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug because I do not really want to tell him my father punched me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, you really have trimmed down and bulked up. I like your gym,\" he says, eyeballing my weight bench and Stomach Master 6000, and then he sticks out his hand. \"Think I could come over and work out with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand, shake his hand, and say, \"Sure,\" knowing the question is only yet another one of Ronnie\u0027s false promises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, I\u0027m sorry I never came to see you when you were in Baltimore, but we had Emily, and well, you know how it is. But I felt like the letters kept us close. And now that you\u0027re home, we can hang out all the time, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if - ,\" I start to say, but then bite my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if - what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still think Veronica hates you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep my mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles and says, \"Well, if she hated you, would she be inviting you over for dinner tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Ronnie, trying to gauge whether he is serious or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Veronica\u0027s making a big meal to welcome you home. So are you coming, or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I say, still not believing my ears, because Ronnie\u0027s promises usually do not come with specific words like \"tomorrow\" attached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. Be at my house at seven o\u0027clock for drinks. Dinner\u0027s at eight, and it\u0027s going to be one of the wife\u0027s formal candlelit three-course meals, so wear something nice, okay? You know how Veronica is about her dress-up dinners,\" he says, and then hugs sweaty me, which I tolerate only because I am so shocked by Veronica\u0027s invitation. With a hand on my shoulder, Ronnie looks me in the eye and says, \"Man, it\u0027s good to have you home, Pat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I watch him jog up the stairs, I think about how much trash Nikki and I would talk about Ronnie and Veronica if apart time were over and Nikki was going to the dress-up dinner with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dress-up dinner,\" Nikki would say. \"Are we in elementary school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, Nikki hates Veronica.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silver-linings-playbook/page-8.html","bookId":1860,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:00 PM"}
