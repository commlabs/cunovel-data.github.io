Most good sci­ ence came from bright minds at play. From men and women able to turn an elegant insight, to find beguiling tricks in arcane matters, deft architects of prevailing opinion. Play, even intellectual play, was fun, and that was good in its own right. But Hari’s heroes were those who stuck it out against hard opposition, drove toward daunting goals, accepting pain and failure and keeping on anyway. Perhaps, like his father, they were testing their own character, as much as they were being part of the suave scientific culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;And which type was he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Time to raise the stakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;He stood, brushing aside the bowls with a clatter. “You’ll have my reply soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;He stepped on a cup going out and shattered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;6.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Voltaire shouted proudly, “I spent much of my career exiled for speaking Truth to Power. I’ll admit to some flaws in judgment, as when I fawned over Frederick the Great. Necessity shapes manners, I’ll remind you.

The alien fogs clung to their ankles. A proud way of showing their courage, perhaps, a bit full of self. Still, she was glad she had thought of it. These fogs held humanity in contempt. A show of force was useful, as she had found against the vile English several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Voltaire said, “I held Power in contempt, usually, yet I’ll admit I was everlastingly hungry for it, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;[THE SIGNATURE OF YOUR KIND]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“So I am a contradiction!

Though their opponent used a voice cool and dispassionate, she too felt the insi­ dious threat in its cast of words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Voltaire went on, as if to please a king in court, “A bit of histor­ ical example.

The hat’s plumed feather danced in a fresh wind. Joan saw that he was dis­ tracting the fog while trying to subtly blow it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The fogs flashed orange lightning and swelled, enormous and purple. Thunderheads rose and towered above them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Voltaire showed only an arch scorn. She had to admire his gait as he whirled and confronted the gargantuan purple cloud-moun-tain. She remembered how he had waxed on about his dramatic triumphs, his legions of acclaimed plays, his popularity at court. As if to show off for her, he curled a lip into a sneer and invented a poem for the moment:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Big whorls have little whorls\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Which feed on their velocity,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;And little whorls have lesser whorls,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;And so on to viscosity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;The cloud hurled savage sheets of rain down upon them.
