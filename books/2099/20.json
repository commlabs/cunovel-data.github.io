The sky was dark as midnight, but there was enough security lighting to give them a decent view of the grounds. From the parking lot they scanned the empty bleachers and vacant football field. They checked the perimeter of the building, and the outer wing where the principal\u0027s office was located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think they\u0027re inside?\" Cassie asked. \"Maybe we should split up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up there,\" Adam said. \"I think that\u0027s them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was movement on the roof of the building, barely visible shadows, but clashing voices echoed down to the ground. Cassie pushed away her fear and forced the trembling within her stomach to steady her. If there were sounds of a scuffle, that meant there was still a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam rushed for the rusty fire escape that ran up the side of the building and Cassie followed just behind him. They quieted their steps as they neared the top. There, they discovered Diana, Melanie, Chris, Doug, and Sean hiding behind the metal railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana noticed them and put her finger over her lips to indicate they should be quiet. Cassie and Adam moved to where they could view the action at the center of the roof. It was a formidable sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick, Faye, Laurel, Deborah, and Suzan were aligned in a tight defensive circle. They appeared trapped and powerless, as if they\u0027d been confined to a cage. And their marks glowed bright on their chests, like iridescent hearts beating over their clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunter marks must shine in the presence of the relics, Cassie thought. Three hunters surrounded the group, and each of them held a gray stone carved into the dreadful shape of the hunter symbol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the principal and two others - one man and one woman. Cassie wondered where Max was. Did Diana have something to do with his absence? But there wasn\u0027t any time for questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was older - Cassie would even call him elderly. He had long white hair and eyes the color of ice. The woman appeared to be around Cassie\u0027s mother\u0027s age. She was rail thin and had mousy brown hair and brown eyes, but there was no mistaking the resemblance between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough her research, Laurel had identified two of the last remaining hunters as Jedediah Felton - an ancestor of one of the most feared hunter families in history - and his daughter, Louvera Felton. Now here they were in the flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Feltons didn\u0027t look as Cassie had expected they would. They seemed so normal. In Cassie\u0027s imagination, the hunters were giant tribal-looking men wearing some sort of traditional garb, like a robe a martial-arts master would wear. But these hunters would have passed for three average adults if not for the ancient relics they wielded like weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t look so tough,\" Adam said. \"Without those stones, they\u0027d have nothing on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But those stones contain power that goes back over six hundred years,\" Diana whispered. \"Isn\u0027t that what Laurel said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they mumbling?\" Adam asked. \"Do you think it\u0027s the killing spell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunters chanted in a low hum, repeating an ominous phrase:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sum eius agens,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI occidere in eius nomen -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sum eius agens,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI occidere in eius nomen -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, all five of their friends on the center of the roof dropped to their knees. They held their skulls as if they were suffering from terrible migraines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to be the killing curse,\" Cassie said. She made a motion to lunge forward and reveal herself, but Diana grabbed her by the arm and pulled her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" she said. \"If we show ourselves, we\u0027ll be trapped just like the others. The witch-hunter curse we translated must not have worked. Otherwise Faye and the rest of them wouldn\u0027t be in this state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel and Suzan were writhing on the ground at the hunters\u0027 feet. Faye was on her knees, screaming out in pain. Nick cringed, holding his head like it was bleeding, and Deborah looked like she had passed out from the torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to try something,\" Cassie said. \"We probably only have a few minutes, maybe even seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A blocking spell,\" Adam said. \"To turn the energy of their curse back on them. With the seven of us, we might have enough power.\" He closed his eyes and reached for Cassie\u0027s hands. \"Repeat after me: Hunters, disperse. We reverse your curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group of them linked arms and did as Adam said, though Cassie didn\u0027t have much faith that such a generic spell could be strong enough to have an effect on those ancient relics. Still, she concentrated all her energy on the chant. \"Hunters, disperse. We reverse your curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first nothing happened, but then the hunters paused. Continuing their low hum, they looked from side to side. The magic had caught their attention, but they continued with the chant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Cassie felt a change. A heated power. Not knowing where it came from, a string of new words sprouted from her mouth. \"Venatores dispergam. Nos vertite maledictionem.\" The words were rasping, guttural sounds that rose from deep in her throat. She immediately recognized the feeling as dark magic, but she allowed it to come. Her whole being trembled with a painful ecstasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunters were truly startled now. They halted their chanting and searched the shadows for the source of the spell. They waved their relics, but they seemed not to understand what they were feeling. They only knew it wasn\u0027t good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Venatores dispergam. Nos vertite maledictionem,\" Cassie said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Boylan scolded the others for breaking their concentration. \"Focus!\" he shouted. \"We\u0027re not finished yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut within seconds the old man stopped reciting the curse. His face reddened and he clutched his chest. \"It\u0027s an ancient,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know how, but I\u0027m sure of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedediah doubled over, and began pounding on his own heart. \"Find him,\" he screamed out to the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cassie continued uttering her dark words, louder now that she saw how well they were working. Adam and the others stood silently by, their arms still linked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouvera made a motion to go to her father\u0027s aid, but then she also grabbed her chest as if she were having a heart attack. She gasped for air, unable to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Boylan was visibly weakening. His spine curved downward, bending his usually rigid posture into a rounded question mark. All the color had drained from his face and his whole body shook with exhaustion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedediah climbed to his hands and knees and began crawling to the hatch door in the roof that led down into the school building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouvera cried out with whatever air she had left, \"Release them!\" She choked and crawled in the same direction as the old man, and slid down the gaping hole in the roof to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the principal refused to run away. He continued reciting the curse, holding tight to his relic, as he fell to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie took a few steps forward, directing her words straight for him. He tried to stand back up, but fell down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one, the Circle members who had fallen began slowly rising to their feet. Faye and Laurel, then Nick and Suzan, and finally Deborah were shaking off the pain that had debilitated them only minutes earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie could feel herself growing stronger as Mr. Boylan became weaker, as if she were sucking out his power and keeping it for her own use. She watched him shrivel before her eyes, panting like a cowardly animal. He clutched his chest and cried out. But Cassie felt no remorse for him whatsoever. She was only disgusted by his frailty. She was sure he would remain there withering to his death, and she would let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, one last time, he got to his feet. He wobbled and, still unsure where the real opposition was coming from, he honed in on Faye. In a final desperate effort, he cast all his remaining energy at her, shouting the killing curse one last time as loud as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Faye knew what was coming, Suzan leapt in front of her, knocking her out of the way and onto the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis power spent, Boylan finally retreated. Defenseless and shambling, he dragged himself away, across the rooftop, and down the same escape route as his fellow hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie continued moving toward him, still uttering the curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie,\" Adam called out. \"That\u0027s enough. He\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cassie couldn\u0027t stop - the words continued coursing through her like a piano that played itself. She didn\u0027t want the sensation to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her furiously. \"Snap out of it,\" he shouted. \"The hunters are gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow Adam\u0027s words reached Cassie through the long tunnel she\u0027d gotten lost in. She snapped to consciousness and looked around hazily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris and Doug came into view, then Sean and Melanie, and even through her clouded vision Cassie could see the hunter symbols glowing on their clothes. Each of them had been marked. Then Cassie turned to Diana and saw that she, too, had the symbol glowing on her sleeve. And so did Adam. Cassie pointed to it, shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Adam said. \"I saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Cassie looked down and saw the front of her shirt gleaming as well. Now they were all on equal footing. The entire Circle had been marked. A strange calm came over Cassie, like the worst had finally happened and now they could move forward - but then Faye shrieked in a haunted pitch that made Cassie\u0027s blood run cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye was kneeling, shaking, over an unmoving Suzan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything started to blur as they all rushed to where Suzan was lying. Adam reached her first. He dropped to his knees and checked her neck and wrist for a pulse. Then he listened to see if she was breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call an ambulance!\" he screamed, but nobody moved. Suzan\u0027s eyes had already glassed over. Her face had hardened to a lifeless mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s dead,\" Faye said, to herself as much as to Adam. \"She died saving my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Adam shuddered, refusing to accept the truth. He tried CPR. He tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Finally he just pounded on Suzan\u0027s chest. But it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie kneeled down to see for herself what none of them could bear to register. The witch hunter\u0027s death symbol was glowing bright on Suzan\u0027s forehead. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-20.html","bookId":2099,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:21 PM"}
