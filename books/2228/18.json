Vittoria sat beside him, looking engrossed by Olivetti, who was transmitting his final orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deployment will be an eight-point hem,\" the commander said. \"Full perimeter with a bias on the entry. Target may know you visually, so you will be pas-visible. Nonmortal force only. We\u0027ll need someone to spot the roof. Target is primary. Asset secondary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, Langdon thought, chilled by the efficiency with which Olivetti had just told his men the cardinal was expendable. Asset secondary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I repeat. Nonmortal procurement. We need the target alive. Go.\" Olivetti snapped off his walkie-talkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria looked stunned, almost angry. \"Commander, isn\u0027t anyone going inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti turned. \"Inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inside the Pantheon! Where this is supposed to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attento,\" Olivetti said, his eyes fossilizing. \"If my ranks have been infiltrated, my men may be known by sight. Your colleague has just finished warning me that this will be our sole chance to catch the target. I have no intention of scaring anyone off by marching my men inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if the killer is already inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti checked his watch. \"The target was specific. Eight o\u0027clock. We have fifteen minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he would kill the cardinal at eight o\u0027clock. But he may already have gotten the victim inside somehow. What if your men see the target come out but don\u0027t know who he is? Someone needs to make sure the inside is clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too risky at this point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if the person going in was unrecognizable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disguising operatives is time consuming and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant me,\" Vittoria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon turned and stared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti shook his head. \"Absolutely not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He killed my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly, so he may know who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard him on the phone. He had no idea Leonardo Vetra even had a daughter. He sure as hell doesn\u0027t know what I look like. I could walk in like a tourist. If I see anything suspicious, I could walk into the square and signal your men to move in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I cannot allow that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Comandante?\" Olivetti\u0027s receiver crackled. \"We\u0027ve got a situation from the north point. The fountain is blocking our line of sight. We can\u0027t see the entrance unless we move into plain view on the piazza. What\u0027s your call? Do you want us blind or vulnerable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria apparently had endured enough. \"That\u0027s it. I\u0027m going.\" She opened her door and got out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti dropped his walkie-talkie and jumped out of the car, circling in front of Vittoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon got out too. What the hell is she doing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti blocked Vittoria\u0027s way. \"Ms. Vetra, your instincts are good, but I cannot let a civilian interfere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interfere? You\u0027re flying blind. Let me help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would love to have a recon point inside, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what?\" Vittoria demanded. \"But I\u0027m a woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That had better not be what you were going to say, Commander, because you know damn well this is a good idea, and if you let some archaic macho bullshit - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us do our job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too dangerous. We would have no lines of communication with you. I can\u0027t let you carry a walkie-talkie, it would give you away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria reached in her shirt pocket and produced her cell phone. \"Plenty of tourists carry phones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria unsnapped the phone and mimicked a call. \"Hi, honey, I\u0027m standing in the Pantheon. You should see this place!\" She snapped the phone shut and glared at Olivetti. \"Who the hell is going to know? It is a no-risk situation. Let me be your eyes!\" She motioned to the cell phone on Olivetti\u0027s belt. \"What\u0027s your number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti did not reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver had been looking on and seemed to have some thoughts of his own. He got out of the car and took the commander aside. They spoke in hushed tones for ten seconds. Finally Olivetti nodded and returned. \"Program this number.\" He began dictating digits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria programmed her phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now call the number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria pressed the auto dial. The phone on Olivetti\u0027s belt began ringing. He picked it up and spoke into the receiver. \"Go into the building, Ms. Vetra, look around, exit the building, then call and tell me what you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria snapped the phone shut. \"Thank you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt a sudden, unexpected surge of protective instinct. \"Wait a minute,\" he said to Olivetti. \"You\u0027re sending her in there alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria scowled at him. \"Robert, I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Swiss Guard driver was talking to Olivetti again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s dangerous,\" Langdon said to Vittoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right,\" Olivetti said. \"Even my best men don\u0027t work alone. My lieutenant has just pointed out that the masquerade will be more convincing with both of you anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of us? Langdon hesitated. Actually, what I meant -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both of you entering together,\" Olivetti said, \"will look like a couple on holiday. You can also back each other up. I\u0027m more comfortable with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria shrugged. \"Fine, but we\u0027ll need to go fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon groaned. Nice move, cowboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti pointed down the street. \"First street you hit will be Via degli Orfani. Go left. It takes you directly to the Pantheon. Two-minute walk, tops. I\u0027ll be here, directing my men and waiting for your call. I\u0027d like you to have protection.\" He pulled out his pistol. \"Do either of you know how to use a gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s heart skipped. We don\u0027t need a gun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria held her hand out. \"I can tag a breaching porpoise from forty meters off the bow of a rocking ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Olivetti handed the gun to her. \"You\u0027ll have to conceal it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria glanced down at her shorts. Then she looked at Langdon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no you don\u0027t! Langdon thought, but Vittoria was too fast. She opened his jacket, and inserted the weapon into one of his breast pockets. It felt like a rock dropping into his coat, his only consolation being that Diagramma was in the other pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We look harmless,\" Vittoria said. \"We\u0027re leaving.\" She took Langdon\u0027s arm and headed down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver called out, \"Arm in arm is good. Remember, you\u0027re tourists. Newlyweds even. Perhaps if you held hands?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they turned the corner Langdon could have sworn he saw on Vittoria\u0027s face the hint of a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e59\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Swiss Guard \"staging room\" is located adjacent to the Corpo di Vigilanza barracks and is used primarily for planning the security surrounding papal appearances and public Vatican events. Today, however, it was being used for something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man addressing the assembled task force was the second-in-command of the Swiss Guard, Captain Elias Rocher. Rocher was a barrel-chested man with soft, puttylike features. He wore the traditional blue captain\u0027s uniform with his own personal flair - a red beret cocked sideways on his head. His voice was surprisingly crystalline for such a large man, and when he spoke, his tone had the clarity of a musical instrument. Despite the precision of his inflection, Rocher\u0027s eyes were cloudy like those of some nocturnal mammal. His men called him \"orso\" - grizzly bear. They sometimes joked that Rocher was \"the bear who walked in the viper\u0027s shadow.\" Commander Olivetti was the viper. Rocher was just as deadly as the viper, but at least you could see him coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRocher\u0027s men stood at sharp attention, nobody moving a muscle, although the information they had just received had increased their aggregate blood pressure by a few thousand points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRookie Lieutenant Chartrand stood in the back of the room wishing he had been among the 99 percent of applicants who had not qualified to be here. At twenty years old, Chartrand was the youngest guard on the force. He had been in Vatican City only three months. Like every man there, Chartrand was Swiss Army trained and had endured two years of additional ausbilding in Bern before qualifying for the grueling Vatican pr��va held in a secret barracks outside of Rome. Nothing in his training, however, had prepared him for a crisis like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first Chartrand thought the briefing was some sort of bizarre training exercise. Futuristic weapons? Ancient cults? Kidnapped cardinals? Then Rocher had shown them the live video feed of the weapon in question. Apparently this was no exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will be killing power in selected areas,\" Rocher was saying, \"to eradicate extraneous magnetic interference. We will move in teams of four. We will wear infrared goggles for vision. Reconnaissance will be done with traditional bug sweepers, recalibrated for sub-three-ohm flux fields. Any questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChartrand\u0027s mind was on overload. \"What if we don\u0027t find it in time?\" he asked, immediately wishing he had not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grizzly bear gazed out at him from beneath his red beret. Then he dismissed the group with a somber salute. \"Godspeed, men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e60\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo blocks from the Pantheon, Langdon and Vittoria approached on foot past a line of taxis, their drivers sleeping in the front seats. Nap time was eternal in the Eternal City - the ubiquitous public dozing a perfected extension of the afternoon siestas born of ancient Spain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon fought to focus his thoughts, but the situation was too bizarre to grasp rationally. Six hours ago he had been sound asleep in Cambridge. Now he was in Europe, caught up in a surreal battle of ancient titans, packing a semiautomatic in his Harris tweed, and holding hands with a woman he had only just met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Vittoria. She was focused straight ahead. There was a strength in her grasp - that of an independent and determined woman. Her fingers wrapped around his with the comfort of innate acceptance. No hesitation. Langdon felt a growing attraction. Get real, he told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria seemed to sense his uneasiness. \"Relax,\" she said, without turning her head. \"We\u0027re supposed to look like newlyweds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m relaxed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crushing my hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon flushed and loosened up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breathe through your eyes,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It relaxes the muscles. It\u0027s called pranayama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piranha?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the fish. Pranayama. Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they rounded the corner into Piazza della Rotunda, the Pantheon rose before them. Langdon admired it, as always, with awe. The Pantheon. Temple to all gods. Pagan gods. Gods of Nature and Earth. The structure seemed boxier from the outside than he remembered. The vertical pillars and triangular pronaus all but obscured the circular dome behind it. Still, the bold and immodest inscription over the entrance assured him they were in the right spot. M AGRIPPA L F COS TERTIUM FECIT. Langdon translated it, as always, with amusement. Marcus Agrippa, Consul for the third time, built this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for humility, he thought, turning his eyes to the surrounding area. A scattering of tourists with video cameras wandered the area. Others sat enjoying Rome\u0027s best iced coffee at La Tazza di Oro\u0027s outdoor cafe. Outside the entrance to the Pantheon, four armed Roman policemen stood at attention just as Olivetti had predicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks pretty quiet,\" Vittoria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded, but he felt troubled. Now that he was standing here in person, the whole scenario seemed surreal. Despite Vittoria\u0027s apparent faith that he was right, Langdon realized he had put everyone on the line here. The Illuminati poem lingered. From Santi\u0027s earthly tomb with demon\u0027s hole. YES, he told himself. This was the spot. Santi\u0027s tomb. He had been here many times beneath the Pantheon\u0027s oculus and stood before the grave of the great Raphael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time is it?\" Vittoria asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon checked his watch. \"Seven-fifty. Ten minutes till show time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hope these guys are good,\" Vittoria said, eyeing the scattered tourists entering the Pantheon. \"If anything happens inside that dome, we\u0027ll all be in the crossfire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon exhaled heavily as they moved toward the entrance. The gun felt heavy in his pocket. He wondered what would happen if the policemen frisked him and found the weapon, but the officers did not give them a second look. Apparently the disguise was convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon whispered to Vittoria. \"Ever fire anything other than a tranquilizer gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you trust me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust you? I barely know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria frowned. \"And here I thought we were newlyweds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e61\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air inside the Pantheon was cool and damp, heavy with history. The sprawling ceiling hovered overhead as though weightless - the 141-foot unsupported span larger even than the cupola at St. Peter\u0027s. As always, Langdon felt a chill as he entered the cavernous room. It was a remarkable fusion of engineering and art. Above them the famous circular hole in the roof glowed with a narrow shaft of evening sun. The oculus, Langdon thought. The demon\u0027s hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s eyes traced the arch of the ceiling sloping outward to the columned walls and finally down to the polished marble floor beneath their feet. The faint echo of footfalls and tourist murmurs reverberated around the dome. Langdon scanned the dozen or so tourists wandering aimlessly in the shadows. Are you here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks pretty quiet,\" Vittoria said, still holding his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Raphael\u0027s tomb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon thought for a moment, trying to get his bearings. He surveyed the circumference of the room. Tombs. Altars. Pillars. Niches. He motioned to a particularly ornate funerary across the dome and to the left. \"I think that\u0027s Raphael\u0027s over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria scanned the rest of the room. \"I don\u0027t see anyone who looks like an assassin about to kill a cardinal. Shall we look around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded. \"There\u0027s only one spot in here where anyone could be hiding. We better check the rientranze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The recesses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Langdon pointed. \"The recesses in the wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround the perimeter, interspersed with the tombs, a series of semicircular niches were hewn in the wall. The niches, although not enormous, were big enough to hide someone in the shadows. Sadly, Langdon knew they once contained statues of the Olympian gods, but the pagan sculptures had been destroyed when the Vatican converted the Pantheon to a Christian church. He felt a pang of frustration to know he was standing at the first altar of science, and the marker was gone. He wondered which statue it had been, and where it had pointed. Langdon could imagine no greater thrill than finding an Illuminati marker - a statue that surreptitiously pointed the way down the Path of Illumination. Again he wondered who the anonymous Illuminati sculptor had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take the left arc,\" Vittoria said, indicating the left half of the circumference. \"You go right. See you in a hundred and eighty degrees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon smiled grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Vittoria moved off, Langdon felt the eerie horror of the situation seeping back into his mind. As he turned and made his way to the right, the killer\u0027s voice seemed to whisper in the dead space around him. Eight o\u0027clock. Virgin sacrifices on the altars of science. A mathematical progression of death. Eight, nine, ten, eleven... and at midnight. Langdon checked his watch: 7:52. Eight minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Langdon moved toward the first recess, he passed the tomb of one of Italy\u0027s Catholic kings. The sarcophagus, like many in Rome, was askew with the wall, positioned awkwardly. A group of visitors seemed confused by this. Langdon did not stop to explain. Formal Christian tombs were often misaligned with the architecture so they could lie facing east. It was an ancient superstition that Langdon\u0027s Symbology 212 class had discussed just last month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s totally incongruous!\" a female student in the front had blurted when Langdon explained the reason for east-facing tombs. \"Why would Christians want their tombs to face the rising sun? We\u0027re talking about Christianity... not sun worship!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon smiled, pacing before the blackboard, chewing an apple. \"Mr. Hitzrot!\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young man dozing in back sat up with a start. \"What! Me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon pointed to a Renaissance art poster on the wall. \"Who is that man kneeling before God?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... some saint?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brilliant. And how do you know he\u0027s a saint?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got a halo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent, and does that golden halo remind you of anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHitzrot broke into a smile. \"Yeah! Those Egyptian things we studied last term. Those... um... sun disks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Hitzrot. Go back to sleep.\" Langdon turned back to the class. \"Halos, like much of Christian symbology, were borrowed from the ancient Egyptian religion of sun worship. Christianity is filled with examples of sun worship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" the girl in front said. \"I go to church all the time, and I don\u0027t see much sun worshiping going on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? What do you celebrate on December twenty-fifth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christmas. The birth of Jesus Christ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And yet according to the Bible, Christ was born in March, so what are we doing celebrating in late December?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon smiled. \"December twenty-fifth, my friends, is the ancient pagan holiday of sol invictus - Unconquered Sun - coinciding with the winter solstice. It\u0027s that wonderful time of year when the sun returns, and the days start getting longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon took another bite of apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conquering religions,\" he continued, \"often adopt existing holidays to make conversion less shocking. It\u0027s called transmutation. It helps people acclimatize to the new faith. Worshipers keep the same holy dates, pray in the same sacred locations, use a similar symbology... and they simply substitute a different god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the girl in front looked furious. \"You\u0027re implying Christianity is just some kind of... repackaged sun worship!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. Christianity did not borrow only from sun worship. The ritual of Christian canonization is taken from the ancient \u0027god-making\u0027 rite of Euhemerus. The practice of \u0027god-eating\u0027 - that is, Holy Communion - was borrowed from the Aztecs. Even the concept of Christ dying for our sins is arguably not exclusively Christian; the self-sacrifice of a young man to absolve the sins of his people appears in the earliest tradition of the Quetzalcoatl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl glared. \"So, is anything in Christianity original?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very little in any organized faith is truly original. Religions are not born from scratch. They grow from one another. Modern religion is a collage... an assimilated historical record of man\u0027s quest to understand the divine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... hold on,\" Hitzrot ventured, sounding awake now. \"I know something Christian that\u0027s original. How about our image of God? Christian art never portrays God as the hawk sun god, or as an Aztec, or as anything weird. It always shows God as an old man with a white beard. So our image of God is original, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon smiled. \"When the early Christian converts abandoned their former deities - pagan gods, Roman gods, Greek, sun, Mithraic, whatever - they asked the church what their new Christian God looked like. Wisely, the church chose the most feared, powerful... and familiar face in all of recorded history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHitzrot looked skeptical. \"An old man with a white, flowing beard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon pointed to a hierarchy of ancient gods on the wall. At the top sat an old man with a white, flowing beard. \"Does Zeus look familiar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe class ended right on cue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening,\" a man\u0027s voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon jumped. He was back in the Pantheon. He turned to face an elderly man in a blue cape with a red cross on the chest. The man gave him a gray-toothed smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re English, right?\" The man\u0027s accent was thick Tuscan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon blinked, confused. \"Actually, no. I\u0027m American.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked embarrassed. \"Oh heavens, forgive me. You were so nicely dressed, I just figured... my apologies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help you?\" Langdon asked, his heart beating wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually I thought perhaps I could help you. I am the cicerone here.\" The man pointed proudly to his city-issued badge. \"It is my job to make your visit to Rome more interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore interesting? Langdon was certain this particular visit to Rome was plenty interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like a man of distinction,\" the guide fawned, \"no doubt more interested in culture than most. Perhaps I can give you some history on this fascinating building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon smiled politely. \"Kind of you, but I\u0027m actually an art historian myself, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Superb!\" The man\u0027s eyes lit up like he\u0027d hit the jackpot. \"Then you will no doubt find this delightful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027d prefer to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Pantheon,\" the man declared, launching into his memorized spiel, \"was built by Marcus Agrippa in 27 B.C.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Langdon interjected, \"and rebuilt by Hadrian in 119 A.D.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the world\u0027s largest free-standing dome until 1960 when it was eclipsed by the Superdome in New Orleans!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon groaned. The man was unstoppable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a fifth-century theologian once called the Pantheon the House of the Devil, warning that the hole in the roof was an entrance for demons!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon blocked him out. His eyes climbed skyward to the oculus, and the memory of Vittoria\u0027s suggested plot flashed a bone-numbing image in his mind... a branded cardinal falling through the hole and hitting the marble floor. Now that would be a media event. Langdon found himself scanning the Pantheon for reporters. None. He inhaled deeply. It was an absurd idea. The logistics of pulling off a stunt like that would be ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Langdon moved off to continue his inspection, the babbling docent followed like a love-starved puppy. Remind me, Langdon thought to himself, there\u0027s nothing worse than a gung ho art historian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the room, Vittoria was immersed in her own search. Standing all alone for the first time since she had heard the news of her father, she felt the stark reality of the last eight hours closing in around her. Her father had been murdered - cruelly and abruptly. Almost equally painful was that her father\u0027s creation had been corrupted - now a tool of terrorists. Vittoria was plagued with guilt to think that it was her invention that had enabled the antimatter to be transported... her canister that was now counting down inside the Vatican. In an effort to serve her father\u0027s quest for the simplicity of truth... she had become a conspirator of chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOddly, the only thing that felt right in her life at the moment was the presence of a total stranger. Robert Langdon. She found an inexplicable refuge in his eyes... like the harmony of the oceans she had left behind early that morning. She was glad he was there. Not only had he been a source of strength and hope for her, Langdon had used his quick mind to render this one chance to catch her father\u0027s killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria breathed deeply as she continued her search, moving around the perimeter. She was overwhelmed by the unexpected images of personal revenge that had dominated her thoughts all day. Even as a sworn lover of all life... she wanted this executioner dead. No amount of good karma could make her turn the other cheek today. Alarmed and electrified, she sensed something coursing through her Italian blood that she had never felt before... the whispers of Sicilian ancestors defending family honor with brutal justice. Vendetta, Vittoria thought, and for the first time in her life understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisions of reprisal spurred her on. She approached the tomb of Raphael Santi. Even from a distance she could tell this guy was special. His casket, unlike the others, was protected by a Plexiglas shield and recessed into the wall. Through the barrier she could see the front of the sarcophagus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael Santi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1483-1520\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria studied the grave and then read the one-sentence descriptive plaque beside Raphael\u0027s tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she read it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen... she read it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, she was dashing in horror across the floor. \"Robert! Robert!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/angels-demons-robert-langdon-1/page-18.html","bookId":2228,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:23 PM"}
