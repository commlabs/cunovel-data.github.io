I\u0027ll go up and look in on her, however.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A damned lot of good that\u0027s going to do,\" his lordship fired at his departing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring that outburst of noble temper, Hugh Whitticomb walked up the grand staircase and turned left at the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he returned to the study sometime later, the earl was sitting as he had been before, but Dr. Whitticomb\u0027s expression had brightened considerably. \"Evidently,\" he said dryly, \"my visit did do some good, after all. Or perhaps she simply liked my voice better than the maids\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen jerked his head up, his gaze searching the physician\u0027s face. \"She\u0027s conscious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s resting now, but she came around and was even able to speak a few words to me. Yesterday, I wouldn\u0027t have given a farthing for her chances, but she\u0027s young and strong, and I think she may pull through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving said all he had to say on that subject, Dr. Whitticomb looked at the deeply etched lines of fatigue and strain at Stephen\u0027s eyes and mouth and embarked on the second of his primary concerns: \"You, however, look like the very devil, my lord,\" he pronounced with the blunt familiarity of a longtime family friend. \"I was going to suggest we go up to see her together after supper—providing you invite me to stay for supper, of course—but the sight of you might frighten her into a relapse if you don\u0027t have some sleep and a shave first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need any sleep,\" Stephen said, so relieved that he felt positively energized as he stood up, walked over to a silver tray, and pulled the stopper out of a crystal decanter. \"I won\u0027t argue about the shave, however,\" he said with a slight smile as he poured brandy into two glasses and held one of them out to the physician. Lifting his own glass in the gesture of a toast, he said, \"To your skill in bringing about her recovery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t my skill, it was more like a miracle,\" the physician said, hesitating to drink the toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To miraculous recoveries, then,\" Stephen said, raising his glass to his lips, then he stopped again as Whitticomb negated the second toast with another shake of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I… didn\u0027t say she was recovered, Stephen. I said she\u0027s conscious and she\u0027s able to speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earl caught the hesitation in his voice, and a pair of piercing blue eyes narrowed sharply on Dr. Whitticomb\u0027s face, demanding an explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a reluctant sigh, the physician acceded to the demand. \"I\u0027d hoped to delay telling you this until after you\u0027d had some rest, but the fact is that even if she pulls through physically—and I can\u0027t promise you\u0026nbsp; she will—there\u0027s still a problem. A complication. of course, it may be very temporary. then again it might not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has no memory, Stephen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She what?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t remember anything that took place before she opened her eyes in the bedchamber upstairs. She doesn\u0027t know who she is or why she\u0027s in England. She couldn\u0027t even tell me her own name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his hand on the ornate brass door handle, Dr. Whitticomb paused before entering his patient\u0027s bedchambers. Turning to Stephen, he lowered his voice and issued some last-minute warnings and instructions: \"Head wounds are very unpredictable. Don\u0027t be alarmed if she doesn\u0027t remember speaking to me a few hours ago. On the other hand, she may have already regained her memory completely. Yesterday, I spoke with a colleague of mine who\u0027s had more experience with serious head injuries than I, and we both felt it would be a mistake to give her laudanum no matter how severe her headache might become. Even though it would help her pain, laudanum will put her to sleep, and we both think it\u0027s imperative to keep her conscious and talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen nodded, but Whitticomb wasn\u0027t finished. \"Earlier today, she grew very anxious and frightened when she couldn\u0027t remember anything, so do not, under any circumstances, say or do anything to add to her anxiety. When we go in there, try to make her feel calm and reassured, and make certain any servant who enters this bedchamber is under the same orders. As I said, head wounds are very dangerous and very unpredictable, and we wouldn\u0027t want to lose her.\" Satisfied that he\u0027d covered everything, he turned the handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheridan sensed the presence of people in the darkened room as she floated in a comforting gray mist, drifting in and out of sleep, her mind registering neither fear nor concern, only mild confusion. She clung to that blissful state, because it allowed her to escape the nameless fears and haunting questions nagging at the back of her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Lancaster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was very near her ear, kind but insistent and vaguely familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Lancaster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was speaking to her. She forced her eyes open and blinked, trying to focus, but her vision was strangely blurry and she saw two of everything, each object superimposed over the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Lancaster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked again, and the images separated into two men, one of them middle-aged and gray-haired, with wire-rimmed spectacles and a neat mustache. He looked kindly and confident, just as he sounded. The other man was much younger. Handsome. Not so kindly. Not so confident, either. Worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older man was smiling at her and speaking. \"Do you remember me, Miss Lancaster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheridan started to nod, but movement made her head hurt so horribly that spontaneous tears burned her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Lancaster, do you remember me? Do you know who I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareful not to move her head when she spoke, she answered his question: \"Doctor.\" Her lips felt dry and cracked, but talking didn\u0027t seem to make her headache more intense. The moment she realized that, her own questions began to rush in on her. \"Where am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" she persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in England. You sailed here from America.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, that made her feel uneasy, depressed. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men exchanged a glance, then the doctor said reassuringly, \"That will all come back to you in due time. Don\u0027t concern yourself with anything right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I… want to know,\" she insisted, her whisper hoarse with tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, child,\" he agreed at once, patting her arm. After a slight hesitation he smiled as if he were giving her happy news and said, \"You came here to join your fiancé.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fiancé. Evidently, she was betrothed… to the other man, she decided, because he was the one who\u0027d looked the most worried about her. Worried and exhausted. She shifted her gaze to the younger man and gave him a wan, reassuring smile, but he was frowning at the physician, who was shaking his head at him in some sort of warning. That frown bothered her for some reason, and so did the physician\u0027s warning look, but she didn\u0027t know why. It was incongruous, but at that moment, when she knew not who she was or where she\u0027d been or how she came to be here, the only thing she did seem to know for certain was that one must always apologize for causing unhappiness to another. She knew that rule of courtesy as if it were deeply ingrained in her—instinctive, imperative, urgent. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3/page-14.html","bookId":1803,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM"}
