She knew that now. Her search for home was still ongoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just out of curiosity,\" she continued, \"did Laura have a problem with you spending time on your painting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy jerked slightly, clearly startled by the question. His mouth was a thin, hard line. \"She called it \u0027playing artist\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One last question. Did you see much of Nick while you and Laura were married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy was quiet again for a while. Eventually he shook his head. \"No. Things change when you get married, you know? Laura had her own set of friends. We hung around with them for the most part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet she still found time to have an affair with Nick?\" Octavia spread her hands. \"Get real, Jeremy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is this? You think you can just walk into this situation and analyze it without knowing all of the people involved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know something about Hartes. Lord knows, they\u0027ve got their flaws, but I honestly can\u0027t see any of the Harte men fooling around with another man\u0027s wife.\" She straightened away from the desk. \"And after looking at your paintings, I know a bit more about you, too. You can see a person\u0027s personality and character clearly enough to translate it onto a canvas. Try looking at Nick with your artist\u0027s eye. Ask yourself how you would paint him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, you really have got it bad for him, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My feelings for Nick have nothing to do with this discussion.\" She dug her car keys out of her shoulder bag and went toward the door. \"But I will tell you one thing, Jeremy. I won\u0027t let you use me to punish him for what you think he did with Laura.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear you\u0027re investigating that missing painting.\" Sandy Hickson drew the squeegee across the BMW\u0027s windshield with professional expertise and flipped the dirty liquid off with a flick of his wrist. \"Just like that private eye guy in your books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick leaned against the side of his car while he waited for Hickson to finish servicing it. He studied Sandy through the lenses of his sunglasses. It was felt in some quarters that Sandy had been born to work in a gas station. Legend held that as a teenager, he\u0027d had a penchant for collecting phone numbers off restroom walls, the kind that were preceded by the inviting phrase for a good time callâ€¦\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether Sandy had ever gotten a date using one of the numbers he had found on the grungy white tiles in the station\u0027s restroom was still an open question, but one thing was certain: The Eclipse Bay Gas \u0026amp; Go was a nexus point of local gossip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You read my books, Sandy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah. Nothing personal. I don\u0027t read a lotta fiction, y\u0027know? I prefer magazines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know the kind of magazines you favor. They\u0027ve all got centerfolds featuring ladies whose bra sizes exist only in the realm of virtual reality. Talk about fiction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy did not take offense. He dipped his squeegee into a bucket of water and aimed another swipe at the windshield. \"I read \u0027em mostly for the articles, y\u0027know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Since you know what I\u0027m after, you got anything for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy looked sly. \"Been some talk going around about that painting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you think I can use to help me find it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now, a few people are saying that you\u0027re getting warm.\" Sandy snickered, evidently enjoying some private joke. \"Real hot, in fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snicker became a guffaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick did not move. Sandy\u0027s sense of humor had not matured much since his high school years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you heard?\" Nick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heard you were getting it on with the chief suspect, that\u0027s what I heard. Whooee. You\u0027re hot, all right, my friend. Probably couldn\u0027t get much closer if you tried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy could no longer restrain himself. He laughed so hard he lost control of the squeegee. It dropped into the bucket, splashing dirty water on his shoes. He paid no attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick watched him for a moment, contemplating his options. The urge to wring Sandy\u0027s scrawny neck was almost overwhelming, but he exerted an effort and managed to resist the temptation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The chief suspect,\" Nick repeated. \"That would be Octavia Brightwell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it.\" Sandy went into another round of howls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick made himself wait until Hickson\u0027s laughter had subsided to a few snorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you that Octavia was the chief suspect, Sandy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couple of folks mentioned it.\" Still chortling a little, Sandy retrieved his squeegee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a name, Sandy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Eugene, for one. B\u0027lieve he mentioned it to me first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugene Woods?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be the same Eugene Woods who is usually between jobs and spends most of his time at the Total Eclipse nursing a beer and associating with his old buddy Dickhead Dwayne and pretending to look for work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Eugene, yeah.\" Sandy scrunched up his face into an expression of keen interest. \"Why? You wanna talk to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I think I want to talk to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlarm flickered in Sandy\u0027s eyes. \"Hang on, Nick, I don\u0027t know as that\u0027s a real smart idea. Eugene ain\u0027t changed much since he was a kid. He didn\u0027t get that nickname of Mean Eugene for no reason, y\u0027know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People change, Sandy. They mature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Mean Eugene. He\u0027s the same as he was back in third grade. Still hold you up for your lunch money if he can figure out a way to do it. And Dickhead\u0027s the same, too. Always goin\u0027 along with whatever Eugene wants him to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bear that in mind, Sandy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick shoved himself away from the side of the car and walked across the street to the entrance of the Total Eclipse Bar \u0026amp; Grill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that key open?\" Gail asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia glanced at the key hanging from the hook inside the storage closet. \"I don\u0027t know, to be honest. Nothing here in the gallery, that\u0027s for sure. I tried it on all the locks. Must have belonged to Noreen. One of these days I\u0027ll toss it out. But I hesitate to discard it until I know for certain that it doesn\u0027t go to anything important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you mean. There\u0027s something about a key that makes you think twice before throwing it out, isn\u0027t there? Even when you don\u0027t know what it unlocks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Octavia shut the closet door and turned around with a smile. \"Okay, I think that\u0027s it. Any other questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked back out into the gallery and went to stand at the window. Outside on the sidewalk several tourists meandered. The day was sunny and pleasantly warm. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-37.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
