I watched the restaurant for signs of movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo different planks led from shore. Beer bottles floated in the scummy water between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia drew her Sig Sauer and gestured that she would take the left plank. Matthew and I took the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped across the gangplank, pushed on the heavy wooden door. The sign NO ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUNDER 18 ADMITTED crinkled under my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dove flitted out of the exposed rafters and I nearly shot at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew and I made our way through a barroom that smelled like lemon ammonia and dried whiskey. I brought out my pencil flashlight and shone it into dark corners—a plastic spoon, a napkin, a forgotten handbag. It was so quiet we could hear the lake gurgle and plunk against the aluminium pontoon floats beneath the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought, just for a moment, that I heard a man\u0027s voice—a murmured question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped Pena. We listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rendezvoused with Maia in the main dining room—a forest of upsidedown chairs stacked on tables. The deck doors were open, letting in the smell of the water and the entire panorama of the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMansfield Dam rose up immediately on the left—an enormous slab of charcoal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena started to whisper, \"This was a waste—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then someone else spoke, directly in front of us. There was a human form out on the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena and I moved toward it, Maia a few steps behind, bringing up the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man glistened—the glint of wet suit material. Victor Lopez was sitting on the railing of the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vic?\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were at the open doorway now, Lopez only ten feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my eyes adjusted, I noticed his gear—the air tank, the regulator, the mask around his neck. He wore two weight belts that were solid with squares of lead, another two belts crossing his chest like bandoliers. No BC to counteract the lead. No fins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Lopez went over the side like that, he would sink fast and have a hell of a time coming back up. He was also holding a gun at his thigh—not a service pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething smaller. An oldstyle Raven from back in the 1980s. A .380 automatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez was staring out over the water, as if in a reverie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at Maia, who shook her head slightly—I don\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Vic mumbled something. \"Here. Right here, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lopez?\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over, said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more scuba equipment at his feet—another air tank, fastened to a BC. On a nearby table was a mask. Next to that, a computer disk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shone my pencil flashlight in Lopez\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pupils stayed fully dilated. His expression didn\u0027t change— as if there were no circulation in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this—\" he droned. \"Is this . . . okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should leave,\" Pena murmured. \"Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the deck boards creaked behind us. I spun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second figure had separated from the darkness right next to Maia. The only thing that wasn\u0027t pure black was the gun. It was pressed against Maia\u0027s temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said the voice I didn\u0027t recognize at all. \"That\u0027s fine, Vic. Put your mask on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMetal thudded against wood—Maia\u0027s gun dropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good, dear heart,\" the voice crooned, the face still in the shadows. \"Now your friend\u0027s—gun and the flashlight in the water, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia said, \"Don\u0027t, Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" the voice said. \"But Tres can\u0027t shoot, can he? He doesn\u0027t trust his aim. He doesn\u0027t trust guns. And certainly, he knows I\u0027ll kill you if he doesn\u0027t cooperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to me, Pena stayed still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tossed my gun and flashlight over the railing, heard two tiny plooshes in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure stepped forward, pushing Maia ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black baseball cap. A wet suit. A face painted black, eyes intense as a raptor\u0027s. The gun slid down, pressed tightly into Maia\u0027s jugular vein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hero.\" Dwight Hayes gave me a pleasant smile. \"Thanks for coming, Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 41\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You son of a bitch,\" Pena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know how appropriate your comment is, Matthew.\" Dwight\u0027s wrist rested on Maia\u0027s shoulder. The neoprene of the wet suit was soaking the top of her shirt. He moved his free hand around her waist, spreading his fingers caressingly across her abdomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You smell good,\" Dwight told her. \"I\u0027ve never been close enough—except for your apartment, looking through your things. I\u0027m glad you decided to pursue us, Maia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed. Her throat muscles pushed against Dwight\u0027s gun and made it look like she was nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched her fingers, waited for our old sign—a threefinger countdown, which would mean she was about to risk a move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Victor,\" Dwight said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez had raised his gun. He was pointing it at Dwight Hayes, but his arm was bent, the gun turned sideways, as if some invisible armwrestling opponent was forcing his hand back at the wrong angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t need that,\" Dwight assured Lopez. His voice was calm, deep. \"Don\u0027t you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re drugged, Lopez,\" I said. \"Fight it. Shoot the bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez\u0027s arm trembled. His chest had begun to cave in like an old man\u0027s under the weight and heat of the scuba gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t remember,\" he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The little boy,\" Dwight told him. \"The little Asian child. He was right under the deck, wasn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right about where you\u0027re sitting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena said, \"Jesus Christ, Dwight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena started to move forward, but Dwight pressed the gun into Maia\u0027s throat, made her gag. \"Tsk, tsk, old friend. First things first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez mumbled, \"Right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Dwight said, nodding pleasantly. \"What should you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Search.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an excellent idea. You can leave the gun, I think. Your prints are on it now. That should be sufficient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez\u0027s hand lowered. The Raven clunked on the floor. \"I can\u0027t— No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need your mask on,\" Dwight suggested. \"And you\u0027ll have to keep looking. Even if it gets cold, even if you can\u0027t get out, you can\u0027t leave a little boy alone down there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan\u0027t let that happen again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight\u0027s voice had taken on a cadence that wasn\u0027t quite human— more like a drum, hit by a small, angry windup machine. \"You\u0027ll just need to keep searching, Vic. That little boy is down there somewhere. Drowning in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez fumbled with his mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Vic,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was just part of the nightmare. His heart must have been slowing, his mind turning to thick sap, flowing over Dwight\u0027s words, hardening wherever they stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bit the regulator\u0027s mouthpiece, groping for a pressure gauge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, there isn\u0027t one, Victor,\" Dwight reassured him. \"Time is the diver\u0027s enemy. This dive, you won\u0027t have any limits. No charts. Just your task. Now over you go—it\u0027ll feel so good to get into the cold water, won\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez had trouble getting his leg over the railing. He slid off awkwardly, his tank hitting the rail as he fell, and then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound in my ears compressed into a roar. I looked at Dwight. \"How much time, you sick fuck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head. \"Air consumption is unpredictable when their metabolism slows down. It\u0027s a race, really, whether his heart fails from the drugs before the air gives out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to me, Pena made his hands into fists. \"You killed her. You drugged Adrienne. You followed us—waited for me to leave. You goddamn—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight made shhshhshh sounds, the way you would for a restless infant. \"Adrienne was getting too close to you, Matthew. She was softening you. I couldn\u0027t allow that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou made too good of a shadow to stand in, allowed me to get away with so much. I couldn\u0027t give up all the years I\u0027d cultivated you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You pointed Pena toward Techsan,\" I said. \"You made the pact with Ruby, killed her when she started having regrets. It was all\"\u0027 your idea—you intended to destroy Jimmy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed his hand across Maia\u0027s belly. \"Lopez needs help. I\u0027ll tell you what, Maia—there\u0027s my equipment. I\u0027ll let you go in. Only you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it was possible for Maia to look any more tense than she already did, with a gun at her throat, Dwight\u0027s comment did the trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only about twenty feet there,\" Dwight told her. \"Pitch black. And of course, you\u0027d have to feel around—not knowing when you\u0027ll touch human flesh, and if he\u0027ll still be alive when you do. What do you say, honey? It would be worth it, letting you save Lopez\u0027s life, just to see you face that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena said, \"I\u0027ll destroy you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight raised his eyebrows. \"Don\u0027t lose your only admirable quality now, Matthew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve got to be strong. You\u0027ve got to cut those ties, stand alone. That\u0027s what you always wanted. That was why I visited your parents that Christmas. I granted your wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena was deadly still for half a second, and then, foolishly, he charged. It might have been an opportunity, but before I could even think of using it, Dwight fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullet caught Pena in the gut. He contracted like he was catching a football, slammed down on his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the shot, the silence was intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve learned a lot of lessons from you, Matthew,\" Dwight told him. \"I was hoping to spare you. But it\u0027s only right you\u0027re here to help me end this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew hugged his middle, made small sounds of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sheen of sweat had formed on Dwight\u0027s blackened face, but I got the feeling it had nothing to do with the insulation of the wet suit. Dwight Hayes was overheating from the inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember, Matthew? How many times we lay awake at night in the dorm room talking, that first semester? Don\u0027t you remember when you gave me the idea? You told me about changing your name, how you wished your parents were dead for ignoring you all those years? You were my inspiration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Pena managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a wet stain on the wood, blood spreading around his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, you were,\" Dwight insisted. \"You gave me the courage to live. You gave me a purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Maia\u0027s eyes, saw what she was thinking. Distract him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Jimmy\u0027s brother,\" I told him. \"Clara and Ewin\u0027s son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight\u0027s smile became disdainful. \"You don\u0027t see the resemblance, Tres? Don\u0027t worry—the disk there on the table, I take the blame for it all. When they find your bodies, they\u0027ll understand. All the roots will be pulled—all the pieces of my family, Jimmy\u0027s family, will be gone. I\u0027m sorry Garrett couldn\u0027t be here, but he\u0027ll have enough charges against him to destroy him. After tonight, Clara\u0027s younger son can rest in peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he spoke of himself in the third person chilled me even more than his threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill him, Tres,\" Pena moaned. \"You have to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia\u0027s first finger went down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d have to tackle him. But the way Dwight shot, the speed with which he moved—I was pretty sure Maia and I were both going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia\u0027s second finger went down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA floorboard creaked in the main dining room, and a voice grumbled, \"Eh! What the fucking gunshot about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmand the biker. I had never been happier to hear a Cajun accent in my life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-47.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM"}
