He exhales noisily through his nose, and when I sense him start to calm, I bury my nose in his throat. Not sure why, but this is the only place where I don’t feel sick or nauseous, with my lungs filled with pure Remy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re getting looked at,” he says gruffly into my hair, then he snakes his arms around me and pulls me onto his lap. I almost moan in gratitude, I feel so ridiculously safe in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowers his head to smell my neck as if to calm himself with my scent as well, then his roaming lips trail to my ear, where he speaks softly and gently to me, gaining momentum with each word, “If those scorpions caused any permanent damage, I swear I’m going to kill that motherfucker and nail his head to a goddamned pike!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t I at least run out to get her a pregnancy test?” Diane asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemington assesses her with shuttered black eyes. And I can’t help but notice, with a little bit of panic, that they’re not glinting at all, and they’re certainly not laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not pregnant. I can’t be,” I insist. My arm thingy birth control can’t fail me! Could it?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtra slowly, he rakes his gaze over my body, running it from the top of my head to my ponytail, the swell of my breasts under my comfortable sky-blue tank top, my tight pink jeans, and slowly back up, his expression unreadable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Do you think I am?” I ask in disbelief, and before he can answer, I add, “Remy, a baby would be very scary right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffs. “Who’s scared of a baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am. You adorable man. Me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chucks my chin and smirks. “Maybe I’ll take it if it looks like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t take shit because there’s nothing to take!” He observes me for a couple of heartbeats, and I vow he looks kind of . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look smug, don’t you,” I accuse, hardly believing what I’m seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifts one sleek black eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do. You look smug thinking you got me pregnant when my birth control says it’s near impossible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs in that deep, throaty way of his that makes my skin come alive and all the little hairs on my arms rise, then he kisses my lips in that boyfriend way of his where the kiss isn’t meant to arouse us—but just to express some sort of connection—then he surveys me with those adorable black eyes that are now shining very, very much in entertainment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d rather you have a baby of mine in you than be sick with his poison,” he half whispers, half growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neither is the case,” I assure. And yet, why am I holding a two-week puke-fest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShitfuck!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flattens me lightly to the hardness of his chest and rubs my back, quickly, up and down, then tells me quietly, his soft words packed with warning, “I’m going to tuck you in bed when we get to the hotel, and you’re not moving from it. I don’t care what’s wrong. You’re not moving from that bed until somebody looks at you and tells me you’re going to be all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha! There’s no way I’m staying in bed all day, not even if I feel bad. I’ve never missed a day of work in my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses my ear again in that boyfriend way I’m starting to like so much. “Then you haven’t lived properly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSO I’M NOT only missing work and living on the edge now, but I just peed on a stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete got us an appointment with an experienced male gynecologist for tomorrow, and Remington is growing impatient; he even forgave Pete the male-doctor part, but he won’t wait that long to know. Of course, Mr. Speedy wouldn’t wait. I’ve told him a thousand times I am not pregnant, and the more I say I am not, the more smug he looks. Now, he seems more excited about me peeing on a stick than I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I come out of the bathroom wearing his black T-shirt, I find him shadowboxing in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch from the threshold, admiring his swings. He knows exactly where his fist goes, and even when he gives the impression of relaxation, I know the power behind each swing is equal to a bulldozer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning on the doorframe, the athlete in me can’t help but admire the athlete in him. I’ve known thousands of sportsmen in my life. But I have never, ever met anyone like him. His speed. Agility. How he ducks. Swings. The way he fights seems to be instinctive, and yet at the same time, I can also see in both his training regimen and fights that his head is always in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about my parents for a moment. They know I’m on tour working, though they have no idea how deeply I’ve involved myself with the man who hired me. The day I left Seattle, my main concern was whether or not Remington would take me back. I didn’t even consider telling my parents that I was in love. That I met the guy—the one I never thought I’d find. The one that made me fall harder than I ever thought I could fall. I know that they trust me to be levelheaded. Throughout the years, I’ve proven to be the most responsible of their offspring, but if this test is positive . . . Ohmigod, if it’s positive, it will scream “reckless!” all over the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy god, what if I am pregnant? And a little baby Tate comes into my life like Remington did, taking it over, telling me, “You know what? You might not know you need me, want me, and will damn well love me, but here I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You check yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice jerks me back to awareness. My stomach tangles from the nerves as I stare at him. He’s been running his fingers through his hair, and every time he does that, he seems to dishevel it even more. His eyes are dark, but the light coming in from the sunset illuminates the tiny blue flecks in his dark eyes. He looks warm and sporty in his sweatpants and hoodie—boyish—and the thought of carrying his baby makes me feel hot and restless and very, very unprepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brooke?” he softly insists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach turns once more. A part of me is curious, and another part doesn’t want to know and all it wants is to keep the status quo. Just us. Remy and Brooke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you or did you not pee on a stick, baby?” he prods when I continue to hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did! I told you I did!” I groan as I go get the test, then I bring it back to the nightstand and read the instructions a third time. Then I gather my courage and put on my imaginary big-girl pants as I peel off the cover and peer into the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butterflies go off inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents flash before my mind. Mom and Dad. Another generation. Maybe Nora told them that I’m seeing the man I work for, but if they don’t even know I’m with him, a baby on the way will leave them in need of therapy for a month. I shake off the thought, because honestly, what’s important now is what he thinks. He. Remington Tate. Your one and only Riptide. Possibly, my baby-daddy soon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can’t be happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around to see him, and a whole truckful of love slams into my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s jumping in the room, swinging his fists in the air, up and down. He hooks, jabs, frowns, and slams into his imaginary boxing partner—who seems to be a fast one, by the way Remington is jabbing and hitting back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is mesmerizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRipped, raw, and so real. He is all mine—or at least, that’s all I want in the world. For him to be mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalmly, as if sensing me, he stops swinging and lifts one of his sleek black brows that always seem permanently slanted. “What’s it say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It says . . .” I stare at the small screen, and no, I’m not seeing double. I mean, I am, but it’s not a hallucination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think rocks have replaced my lungs, for I can’t breathe as I set the test down at the foot of the bed and walk over to him. Step by step, I stare into those black-gray eyes with the blue flecks that watch me approach in growing curiosity. Lifting my hands, I hold his scruffy jaw and really look up at him as he looks down at me, except I’m perfectly sober, and he’s perfectly amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remington, don’t forget this,” I anxiously whisper, my chest swelling with need of his support. “You’re black right now, and I don’t want you to forget what I’m going to tell you. I need all of you here with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” His dimple vanishes as he frames my face in his huge, callused hands. “I got you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, please do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I do. I got you. Now what’s wrong here? Hmm? If you aren’t, then we figure out what’s wrong with you. If you are . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerking away before he can finish, I run over, grab the test, and bring it to him, my heart picking up a wild rhythm. I want his strength. I want his confidence. Even when he’s volatile, he is always so. Damned. Strong! I need that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever taking his eyes off me, he takes the little stick I extend out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut god, he might not be smiling for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice is calm and surprisingly steady. “Two lines means, supposedly, that I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes stay locked on mine for a moment longer, and then his lashes sweep downward as he turns the test screen slightly into the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own anxiety eats me on the inside as I wait for a reaction. We were joking on the plane, but he’s serious now. As serious as I am. His profile is completely unreadable as I take in the perfect form of his nose, how elegant it is. His mouth, relaxed and full, so freaking beautiful. His eyebrows, drawing slightly together in puzzlement as he deciphers the lines. Impossible for me to make out any emotion whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he sets the stick aside, my breath stops in my lungs, and when he lifts his dark head, nothing else exists in the world but this moment. He raises his eyes to mine, and my stomach wrings as hard as my heart does in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if he doesn’t want me like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if this is too much for us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if we’re strong enough to love each other, but not strong enough to love someone else—together?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if we are not ready?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes meet. He studies my reaction while I study his even more desperately. And out of the thousand things I could have imagined to see in his face, I never imagined I would see what I see. He’s . . . pleased. No. He’s more than pleased. His eyes glow as if he were sexually hungry, but what he’s hungry for is something else. Then his dimples flash, and he laughs, and his perfect happiness explodes like a rainbow in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come here.” He picks me up and lifts me so that my abdomen is on his face, and he smacks a noisy kiss on me. I squeal when he flings me down on the bed and hovers over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of those two dimples on his scruffy jaw delights me so much, I start laughing. “You’re a crazy man! You’re the only man I know who throws his pregnant girlfriend onto a bed!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m the only man,” he says, “as far as I know. There’s only one man in your world, and it’s me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, but don’t tell my dad I agreed so easily . . .” I rub his shoulders, and he frames my face and settles down over me. If I thought he looked smug before, he gives a new meaning to the word now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-real-2/page-15.html","bookId":2737,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM"}
