Mat was not bashful, but the smallclothes were far enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNata clicked her tongue. Her servants began draping Mat in fine cloth, black and deep green—so dark it was nearly black itself. \"We shall tailor you outfits for military expression, court attendance, private functions, and civic appearances. It—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\", Mat said. \"Military only\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re at the bloody Last Battle, woman\", Mat said. \"If we survive this, you can make me a bloody feastday cap. Until then, we\u0027re at war, and I don’t need anything else\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat reluctantly stood with arms out to the sides, letting them drape him in the fabric, taking measurements. If he had to put up with this business of being called \"Honored One\" and \"Highness\", then he could at least make certain he was dressed in a reasonable way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, he had been growing tired of the same old clothing. There did not seem to be much lace used by the Seanchan tailor, which was a shame, but Mat did not want to correct her in doing her job. He could not complain about every little thing. Nobody liked a complainer, least of all Mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they dealt with the measurements, a servant approached with a small, velvet-lined case displaying a variety of eyepatches. He hesitated, considering; some were marked with gemstones, others painted with designs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That one\", he said, pointing at the least ornamented patch. Simple black with only two small rubies, cut thin and long, set at the right and left edges of the patch opposite one another. They fitted it on him as the other servants finished measuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat done, the tailor had her servants dress him in a costume she had brought. Apparently, he was not going to be allowed back to his old clothing while he waited for his new outfits to be tailored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clothing started off simple enough. A silk robe of fine weave. Mat would have preferred trousers, but the robe was comfortable. However, they overlaid it with a larger, stiffer robe. It was also silk, of dark green, every inch of it embroidered with scrollwork patterns. The sleeves were large enough to trot a horse through, and they felt heavy and bulky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I said to give me warrior’s clothing!\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a ceremonial warrior’s uniform for a member of the Imperial family, Highness\", Nata said. \"Many will see you as an outsider, and though nobody would question your loyalty, it would be well for our soldiers to see you as Prince of the Ravens first and an outlander second. Would you agree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose\", Mat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servants continued, buckling on an ornate girdle and placing forearm bands of the same design on his arms inside the large sleeves. That was all right, Mat supposed, as the girdle pulled in the waist of the clothing and kept it from feeling quite so bulky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the next piece of clothing was the most ridiculous of all. The stiff, pale piece of cloth fitted onto his shoulders. It draped down his front and back like a tabard, the sides open, but they flared out to the sides a good foot each, making him seem inhumanly wide. They were like shoulder plates from heavy armor, only made of cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here now\", Mat said. \"This isn’t a kind of trick you play on a fellow, just because he’s new, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trick, Honored One?\" Nata asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can’t really . . \" Mat trailed off as someone passed outside his door. Another commander. The man was wearing a costume not unlike Mat’s, though not as ornate, and with shoulders not quite as wide. Not Imperial family armor, but ceremonial armor for one of the Blood. Still, it was almost as lavish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stopped and bowed to Mat, then continued on his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burn me\", Mat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNata clapped and the servants began draping Mat in gemstones. They chose mostly rubies, which made Mat uncomfortable. That had to be a coincidence, did it not? He did not know what he thought of being covered in all of these gemstones. Perhaps he could sell them. Actually, if he could put these on a gambling table, he could probably end up owning all of Ebou Dar . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuon already owns it, he realized. And I married her. It sank in that he was rich. Really rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there, letting them lacquer his fingernails, as he considered what this all meant. Oh, he had not needed to worry about money for some time, as he could always gamble for more. This was different. If he already had everything, what point was there to gambling? This did not sound like much fun. People were not supposed to give you things like this. You were supposed to find a way to come to them yourself, by wits, luck or skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burn me\", Mat said, lowering his arms to his side as the lacquering finished. \"I’m a bloody nobleman\". He sighed, plucking his hat from the hands of a startled servant—who was walking past with his old clothing—and set it on his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honored One\", Nata said. \"Please forgive my forwardness, but it is my place to advise on fashion, if you please. That hat looks . . . particularly out of place with that uniform\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares?\" Mat said, marching out of the room. He almost had to go out the door sideways! \"If I’m going to look ridiculous, I might as well do it with style. Someone point me toward where our flaming generals are meeting. I need to figure out how many troops we have\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto Thakan\u0027dar\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater in the day after her meeting with Rand, Egwene thrust Vora’s sa’angreal out in front of her and wove Fire. Threads came together, tiny glowing ribbons forming a complex weave in the air before her. She could almost feel their heat shining upon her, turning her skin a violent orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finished the weave, and a fiery ball as large as a boulder arced in the air, crackling and roaring. It fell upon the distant hilltop like a meteor. The blast flung bow-wielding Trollocs aside, scattering their carcasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomanda opened a gateway beside Egwene. Romanda was among the Yellows who had insisted on staying at the battlefront to provide emergency Healing. She and her small crew had been invaluable in saving lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, however, there would be no opportunity for Healing. The Trollocs had pulled back into the hills, as Bryne had indicated they would. After a day and a half of rest, many of the Aes Sedai were recovered. Not to full strength—not after over a week of grueling combat—but enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn jumped through the gateway right after it opened, his sword out. Egwene followed, along with Romanda, Lelaine, Leane, Silviana, Raemassa and a handful of Warders and soldiers. They stepped out onto the very hilltop Egwene had just cleared. The charred earth was still warm under her feet, blackened; the scent of burn \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-126.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
