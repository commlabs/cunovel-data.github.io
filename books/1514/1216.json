Although these devil corpses were unable to hurt the both of them, they had to try their best to destroy as many as possible in order to lighten the burden on others. Therefore, the both of them gradually moved closer to one another.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCold aura was circling around Ying Huanhuan. She waved her jade like hand before a few hundred devil corpses were frozen instantly. After which, she involuntarily looked afar. At that spot, there were extremely violent ripples being emitted, and it was considered as the most fearsome battle in the region.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Huanhuan looked at that spot before she frowned slightly. Currently, the Lin Dong trio were risking their lives in an all-out fight with the three great heads of Yuan Gate. It was a valiant and tragic fight with fresh blood spurting everywhere.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Let me go and assist him.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Ying Huanhuan saw that the purple-gold dragon that Lin Dong had transformed, was sent flying by the Cosmic Evil Devil King’s devil totem pole, a cold glint flashed across her pretty eyes. She was just about to make a move when a cool hand pulled her back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What are you doing?” Ying Huanhuan asked in a displeased tone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You should not join such a fight.

She was just about to open her mouth to retort, when she suddenly recalled Lin Dong’s character. She knew that even though Lin Dong may appear warm and friendly on the surface, he was extremely proud in his heart. Three years ago, he was forced to withdraw from Dao Sect and flee the Eastern Xuan Region by the three great heads. This was something that he was most definitely ashamed of. Now that he has returned, given his character, he would definitely want to get back at the other party. In fact, it was precisely because of this that he did not use his formidable puppet and instead relied on his two brothers alone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was just like what Ling Qingzhu said.

Then, she gently clenched her teeth before she involuntarily roared furiously. Soon after, cold aura surged around her before she directly charged into the devil corpse army. Whenever the cold aura swept by, the devil corpses would turn into ice. Moreover, it was clear that she was much more ruthless than before. Clearly, she wanted to vent the fury in her heart on these pitiful devil corpses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e　　……\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe black devil totem pole was accompanied by frightening demonic aura as it swept across the place. After which, it ruthlessly slammed onto the Darkness Saint Tiger, who was charging towards it. Immediately, that tiger emitted a painful moan through his mouth.

After which, he jerked his tiger head and forcefully ripped a huge bloody hole on that devil arm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Swoosh!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePurple-black light came sweeping over from all directions.
