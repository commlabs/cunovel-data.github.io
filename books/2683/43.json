This is getting kinda trippy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, steady yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, what about a cappuccino?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you know who your girlfriend\u0027s acquaintances are? Don\u0027t you talk to her?\" Lauren is losing it. \"What\u0027s with you-oh god, why am I asking? I know, I know. I\u0027ve gotta go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, wait-I want to get these.\" I gesture toward the basket of CDs I\u0027m holding. \"Come with me and I\u0027ll walk you out. I\u0027ve got band practice but I can squeeze in a latte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitates, then moves with me toward the registers. Once there, my AmEx card doesn\u0027t go through. I moan \"Spare me\" but Lauren actually smiles-a smile that causes a major deja vu-and puts it on her card when she pays for her CDs and she doesn\u0027t even say anything about paying her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s so cold in Tower that everything-the air, the sounds revolving around us, the racks of CDs-feels white, snowed in. People pass by, moving on to the next register, and the high-set fluorescent lighting that renders everyone flat and pale and washed out doesn\u0027t affect Lauren\u0027s skin, which looks like ivory that\u0027s tan, and her presence-just the mere gesture of her signing the receipt-touches me in a way I can\u0027t shrug off, and the music rising above us-\"Wonderwall\"-makes me feel doped and far away from my life. Lust is something I really haven\u0027t come across in a long time and I follow it now in Tower Records and it\u0027s getting hard to shake off the thought that Lauren Hynde is part of my future. Outside, I put my hand on the small of her back, guiding her through the sidewalk crowd to the curb on Broadway. She turns around and looks at me for a long time and I let her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor,\" she starts, responding to my vibe. \"Look-I just want to make something clear. I\u0027m seeing someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter,\" she says. \"I\u0027m involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why don\u0027t you tell me who it is?\" I ask. \"And if it\u0027s that twerp Baxter Priestly I\u0027ll actually give you a thousand bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you have a thousand bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a big change bowl at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was\"-she stops, stuck-\"interesting to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, let\u0027s go get a cafe au lait at Dean Deluca. Sounds hip, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the band?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those losers can wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe starts to move away. I reach out, touch her arm gently. \"Wait-are you going to the Todd Oldham show? It\u0027s at six. I\u0027m in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god, come off it, Victor.\" She keeps walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dart in and out of people\u0027s way to keep up with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What is it?\" I\u0027m asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not really part of that scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What scene, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one where all anyone is interested in is who\u0027s f**king who, who has the biggest dick, the biggest tits, who\u0027s more famous than whoever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused, I keep following. \"And you\u0027re, um, not like into this?\" I ask, watching her wave down a taxi. \"You\u0027ve got like a problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve gotta go, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, can I get your phone number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she slams the door, without turning toward me, I hear Lauren say, \"Chloe has it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe and I went to L.A. last September for reasons we never really figured out, though in retrospect I think it had something to do with trying to save our relationship and Chloe was supposed to be a presenter at the MTV Awards, which I remember nothing of except Oscar talk, Frida Kahlo talk, Mr. Jenkins talk, how big is Dweezil Zappa\u0027s dick talk, Sharon Stone wearing pajamas, Edgar Bronfman, Jr., coming on to Chloe, only two green Jujyfruits in the box I held while spacing out during the ceremony, and it was all really just Cindy Cindy Cindy and in every photo printed of me-in W, in US, in Rolling Stone-I am holding the same half-empty bottle of Evian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stayed at the Chateau Marmont in a giant suite with a balcony twice its size overlooking West L.A. When Chloe didn\u0027t want to talk she\u0027d rush to the bathroom, turn on the hair dryer full blast and point it toward my calm, bewildered face. Her nickname for me during those weeks out there was \"my little zombie.\" I tried out for and didn\u0027t get the part of a drug addict\u0027s friend in a medical-drama pilot that ultimately was never produced but it didn\u0027t really matter since I was so out of it I even had to reread things Paula Abdul said in interviews. Chloe was always \"dying of thirst,\" there were always tickets for some lame-o screening, our conversations were always garbled, the streets were always-inexplicably-covered with confetti, we were always at barbecues at Herb Ritts\u0027, which were always attended by either Madonna or Josh Brolin or Amy Locane or Veronica Webb or Stephen Dorff or Ed Limato or Richard Gere or Lela Rochon or Ace of Base, where turkey-burgers were always served, which we always washed down with pink-grapefruit iced tea, and bonfires were always lit throughout the city along with the giant cones of klieg lights announcing premieres. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-43.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
