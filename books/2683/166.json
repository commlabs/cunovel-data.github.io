I\u0027m bending my neck back, letting the water stream down my chest, and when I look back down Bobby\u0027s looking up at me and grinning, his hair wet and pressed down on his forehead, his tongue extended, pink against his face. Then Bobby motions for me to turn around so that he can spread the checks of my ass and I can feel him extending his tongue up in it and then he removes his tongue and sticks his index finger halfway up my ass**le and keeps fingerfucking me until he\u0027s pushed the entire finger as far as it can go, causing my c**k to keep twitching uncontrollably...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop to my knees and start licking Jamie\u0027s pu**y, my fingers spreading her lips, and as her hands massage my hair I lean her against the shower wall-Bobby still behind me on his knees, his finger moving in and out of my ass**le, another hand running over my hard, cubed abs-and I keep running my tongue from her clit to her ass**le and placing one of her legs over my shoulder I suck her clit into my mouth as I f**k her with two then three fingers and then I move my tongue into her ass**le, f**king it with my tongue while my fingers tug on her clit, and when I stand up Bobby\u0027s finger slips out of my hole and I turn Jamie around and squatting down behind her I spread her small, firm ass cheeks open and start pumping my tongue in and out of her ass**le and then I slide my tongue deep inside her anus and keep it there while rubbing her clit until she comes... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-166.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
