Notwithstanding, there was little sign of noise and bustle as there would have been on earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor was there red tape. Within minutes--understanding that I use a term for earth time which is not valid here--I was in a private chamber with a man who had me sit across from him and gaze into his eyes; like everyone I\u0027d met or seen, he was extremely cordial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your wife\u0027s name?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him and he nodded. \"Would you concentrate on her?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the way she looked: her short-cut, brunette hair threaded with gray, her large brown eyes, her small, upturned nose, her lips and delicate ears, the perfect balance of her features. \"It\u0027s nice to be married to a beautiful woman,\" I used to tell her. She\u0027d smile with pleased appreciation, then, invariably, shake her head and answer, \"I\u0027m not beautiful.\" She believed it too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about her tall, graceful figure. She took form in my mind as though she stood before me. Ann always moved well. I recalled her movements with pleasure. Recalled her warmth and softness against me when we made love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about her gentleness--her patience with the children and with me. Her compassion for the suffering--animals as well as people. Recalled how carefully and tirelessly she cared for us when we were ill. How carefully she tended ailing dogs and cats and birds. She had a wonderful rapport with them I never saw in anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about her sense of humor--which she rarely displayed. The children and I always kidded with each other and Ann laughed with us. Her own humor she kept under wraps because she didn\u0027t think it existed. \"You\u0027re the only one who ever laughs at my jokes,\" she used to say. \"That\u0027s because you have to though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about her faith in me through all the years of my attempts to succeed as a writer. Never once did she doubt I\u0027d make it. \"I always knew you would,\" she said to me more than once. Simply; with total conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about her painful background; her stern, often-absent Navy father, her erratic, immature and, ultimately, terminally ill mother. Her unhappy childhood, her insecurities, her breakdown and beginning of analysis. The years it took to give her any confidence in herself. The horrible anxieties she suffered on the few occasions when I had to travel any distance at all. Her dread of traveling herself, of losing emotional control in front of strangers. Yet, despite these fears her bravery in--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" the man said quietly. I focused my eyes on him. He was smiling. \"You care for her a great deal,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do.\" I looked at him anxiously. \"How long will it take before you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little while,\" he said. \"We have many such requests; especially from newcomers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize for pressing you,\" I said. \"I know you must be very busy. But I\u0027m terribly anxious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you and the young lady walk around a bit?\" he suggested. \"Take a look at the city, then return. We should know by then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was disappointed, I admit. I\u0027d thought it would be possible to find out instantaneously; that the information was stored or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would that it were that simple,\" he said, picking up my thought. \"It requires a rather complex process of thought links however.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t be too long,\" he reassured me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thanked him and he took me back to Leona. I was quiet as we left the building and she told me not to be disheartened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made an effort to cheer myself. After all, wasn\u0027t I better off now than before? I\u0027d thought I was going to have to wait all those years for Ann\u0027s arrival never knowing when she was to arrive. Now, at least, I\u0027d know how long it was to be. It would give me a goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI vowed that I wouldn\u0027t be dismayed by what I learned. Ann was only forty-eight. Undoubtedly, she had a good thirty to forty years remaining. Nor would I have wanted it any other way. I\u0027d wait in good cheer however long it took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we look around the city until they have your answer?\" Leona asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I smiled at her. \"I do appreciate your kindness and your company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m happy to be with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the different buildings as we crossed the square. I was about to ask about them when I accidentally bumped into another man. That\u0027s not an apt description really. On earth, I would have collided with him, perhaps painfully. Here, I felt as though I\u0027d struck a cushion of air. Then the man moved past me, smiling and patting me cordially on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked Leona what had happened and she told me that my body is surrounded by a field of energy which prevents collision. Only when contact is desired does the field neutralize itself--as when the man patted my shoulder to reassure me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walked around the fountain, I asked Leona how the buildings were made. I was determined not to dwell on that all-important answer coming from the Office of Records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe buildings, she told me, are designed by people who knew about such things during their lives or who learn about it in Summerland. They create the model image of a building in their minds, which appears from the matrix. They correct the model as needed, then instruct those who were builders on earth--or who learned to be here-- and, together, all their minds in unified concentration, they cause the matrix to produce a full-scale impression of the structure. They stop before it\u0027s completed, correct to perfection, then proceed until solidification takes place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They just concentrate on empty space?\" I asked, the notion flabbergasting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t really empty, of course,\" she said. \"They stand in front of the desired site and ask for help from the higher spheres. Soon a beam of light descends from above, another concentrated beam is projected by the builders and designers and, in time, the conception takes on density.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They look so real\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are real,\" she replied. \"And, albeit created by thought, far longer-lasting than those on earth. Here, there\u0027s no erosion and materials never decay with age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked her if anyone lived in the city and she answered that those who preferred to live in cities on earth prefer it here as well. Of course, the disadvantages they endured on earth no longer exist: no crowding, no crime, no unbreathable air, no traffic commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly though, she told me, cities are centers for instruction and study: Schools, colleges, universities, art galleries, museums, theatres, concert halls, libraries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are plays written on earth performed in the theatres?\" I asked. \"If they\u0027re appropriate,\" she said. \"Nothing that\u0027s sordid though. Nothing conceived merely to harrow an audience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Albert mentioned a line from a play he couldn\u0027t have seen on earth,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He may have seen it here,\" she told me. \"Or on earth. It\u0027s possible, when one is advanced enough, to visit earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And its people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeona\u0027s smile was understanding. \"You\u0027ll be able to see her later if you wish,\" she said. \"By then, you may not want to though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not want to?\" I couldn\u0027t understand how she could say such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not from a lessening of devotion,\" she explained, \"but because your presence can do no good for her and--well, because descending to that level isn\u0027t all that pleasant \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because--\" She hesitated for a moment or two before going on. \"--one has to lower one\u0027s entire system to adjust to it--which can be physically and mentally uncomfortable.\" She smiled and touched my arm. \"Better to avoid it,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded but couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d ever want to avoid it. If, in addition to knowing when Ann was due to join me, I could actually see her from time to time, the wait could be endurable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to ask another question when I noticed that-- as Leona had predicted--the nimbuses of light were starting to fade and I could see the people more clearly. I confess -- not to my credit--that I felt momentary surprise at seeing other races as well as my own. I realized, then, how rarely I\u0027d seen them in my life--especially at home--and how terribly limiting a view that creates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would a rabid segregationist say?\" I asked as we walked by a black man, exchanging smiles with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt if he\u0027d even be in Summerland,\" Leona said. \"Anyone who couldn\u0027t understand that what\u0027s important is a man\u0027s soul, not the color of his skin, would never be content here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All races living in harmony,\" I said. \"It could only happen here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was taken back to see a sad smile on her face. \"I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s true,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we passed a man with one arm, Leona saw my look of startlement as I turned to stare at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can that be?\" I asked. \"Isn\u0027t this a place of perfection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a newcomer too,\" she explained. \"In life, he only had one arm and, since the spirit body responds entirely to mind, it reflects his conviction about the missing arm. Once he understands that he can be whole, the arm will appear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said it once again, Robert. I\u0027m sure you would have too. \"Incredible.\" I looked at the city and its resplendent beauty and felt a burst of happiness. Now I could be newly fascinated by everything around me because, within a short while, I\u0027d know when Ann was to join me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-dreams-may-come/page-18.html","bookId":2541,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM"}
