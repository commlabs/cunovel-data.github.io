Bouldershoulder annoying, he found that by the time he set Sunset down in the mountain forest and helped the dwarf off the pegasus\u0027s back, he had grown quite fond of the green-bearded fellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hee hee hee,\" Pikel said, glancing back many times at the pegasus as he followed Tarathiel along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been up and flying for most of the day, and the afternoon light was beginning to wane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are pleased by Sunset?\" Tarathiel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hee hee hee,\" Pikel answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I have something else, I hope, that I expect might please you equally,\" the elf explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel looked at him curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are nearing the home of a great ranger, now deceased,\" Tarathiel explained. \"An enchanted and hallowed place that has come to be known as Mooshie\u0027s Grove.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel\u0027s eyes widened so greatly that they seemed as if they would fall out of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have heard of it?\" \"Uh huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarathiel smiled and led on through the winding mountain trail, with tall pines all about, the wind swirling around them. They came to the diamond-shaped grove of trees and piled stone walls soon after, the place still looking as if the ranger Montolio was still alive and tending it. There was strong magic about the grove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarathiel only hoped that the last inhabitant of the area he had known was still around. He had taken Drizzt Do\u0027Urden there a few years before, as a measure of the unusual dark elf, and he and Innovindil had decided that a similar test might suit Pikel Bouldershoulder well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two went into the grove and walked around, admiring the elevated walkways and the simple, beautiful design of the huts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you and your brother were heading to the coronation of King Bruenor Battlehammer?\" the elf asked to pass the time, knowing that Innovindil was similarly questioning the other brother back in the Moon-wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup yup,\" Pikel said, but he was obviously distracted, hopping about, scratching his head and nodding happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know King Bruenor well, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup yup,\" Pikel answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped suddenly, looked at the elf, and blinked a few times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh uh,\" he corrected, and gave a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not know Bruenor well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But well enough to represent. . . what was his name? Cadderly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. And tell me, Pikel,\" Tarathiel asked, \"how is it that you have come by such druidic . .. ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice trailed off, for he noticed that Pikel was suddenly distracted, looking away, his eyes widening. Following the dwarf\u0027s gaze, Tarathiel soon enough understood that his question had fallen on deaf ears, for there, just outside the grove, stood the most magnificent of equine creatures in all the world. Large and strong, with legs that could shatter a giant\u0027s skull, and a single, straight horn that could skewer two men standing back to back, the unicorn pawed the ground anxiously, watching Pikel every bit as intently as the dwarf was regarding it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel put his arm above his head, finger pointing up, like his own unicorn horn, and began hopping all about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be easy, dwarf,\" Tarathiel warned, unsure of how the magnificent, and ultimately dangerous, creature would respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel, though, hardly seemed nervous, and with a shriek of delight, the dwarf went hopping across the way, tumbling over the stone wall that lined that edge of the grove, and rushed out toward the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unicorn pawed the ground and gave a great whinny, but Pikel hardly seemed to notice and charged on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarathiel grimaced, thinking himself foolish for bringing the dwarf to the grove. He took up the chase, calling for Pikel to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Tarathiel who stopped, just as he was going over the stone wall. Across the small field, Pikel stood beside the unicorn, stroking its muscled neck, his face a mask of awe. The unicorn seemed a bit unsure and continued pawing the ground, but it did not ward Pikel away, nor did it make any move to rush off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarathiel sat down on the wall, smiling and nodding, and very glad of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel stayed with the magnificent unicorn for some time before the creature finally turned and galloped away. The enchanted dwarf floated back across the field, skipping so lightly that his feet didn\u0027t even seem to touch the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you pleased?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup yup!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it liked you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup yup!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know of Mielikki?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel\u0027s smile nearly took in his big ears. He reached under the front of his tunic and pulled forth a pendant of a carved unicorn head, the symbol of the nature goddess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarathiel had seen another wearing a similar pendant, though Pikel\u0027s was carved of wood while the other had been made of scrimshaw using the bones of the knucklehead trout of Icewind Dale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will King Bruenor be pleased that one who worships the goddess is in his court?\" Tarathiel asked, leading the conversation to a place he thought might prove revealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel looked at him curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is a dwarf, after all, and most dwarves are not favorably disposed toward the goddess Mielikki.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pffft\" Pikel scoffed, waving a hand at the elf. \"You believe T am wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have heard that there is another in his court so favorably disposed to Mielikki,\" Tarathiel remarked. \"One who trained right here with Montolio the Ranger. A very unusual creature, not so much unlike Pikel Bouldershoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drizzit Dudden!\" Pikel cried, and though it took Tarathiel a moment to recognize the badly-pronounced name, when he did, he nodded his approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the unicorn hadn\u0027t been proof enough, then Pikel\u0027s knowledge of Drizzt certainly was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drizzt, yes,\" the elf said. \"It was he I took out here, when first I found the unicorn. The unicorn liked him, too.\" \"Hee hee hee.\" \"Let us spend the night here,\" the elf explained. \"We will set out as soon as the sun rises to return to your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat thought seemed quite acceptable, even pleasing to Pikel Bouldershoulder. The dwarf ran off, searching all the grove, soon enough finding a pair of hammocks he could string up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spent a comfortable night indeed within the magical aura that permeated Mooshie\u0027s Grove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knew Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" Tarathiel said to Innovindil when the two met that following evening, to discuss their respective meetings with the unusual dwarf brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As did Ivan.\" Innovindil confirmed. \"In fact, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and Catti-brie, Bruenors adopted human daughter, are the ties between the priest Cadderly and Mithral Hall. All that Ivan and Pikel, and Cadderly, know of Bruenor they learned from that pair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pikel believes that Drizzt will be with Bruenor,\" Tarathiel said somberly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he returns to the region, we will learn the truth of Ellifain\u0027s current state, of being and of mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarathiel\u0027s eyes clouded over and he looked down. The life and fate of Ellifain Tuuserail was among the saddest and darkest tales in the Moonwood. Ellifain had been but a young child that fateful night, half a century before, when the dark elves had crept out of their tunnels and descended upon a gathering of moon elves out in celebration of the night. All were slaughtered, except for Ellifain, and the baby girl would have found a similar fate had it not been for the uncharacteristically generous action of a particular drow, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. He had buried the child beneath her dead mother, smearing her with her mother\u0027s blood to make it look like Ellifain, too, had been mortally wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Tarathiel and Innovindil and all the rest of the Moonwood clan had come to understand the generosity of Drizzt\u0027s actions and to trust in the remarkable dark elf\u0027s account of that horrible night, Ellifain had never gotten past that one terrible moment. The massacre had scarred the elf beyond reason, despite the best efforts of hired clerics and wizards, and had put her on a singular course throughout her adult life: to kill drow elves and to kill Drizzt Do\u0027Urden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two had met face to face when Drizzt had once ventured through the Moonwood, and it had taken all that Tarathiel and the others could muster to hold Ellifain in check, to keep her from Drizzt\u0027s throat, or more likely, from death at the end of his scimitars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think she will reveal herself in an effort to get at him?\" Innovindil asked. \"Is it our responsibility, in that case, to warn Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and King Bruenor to take care of what elves they allow entry to Mithral Hall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarathiel shrugged in answer to the first question. A few years before, without explanation, Ellifain had disappeared from the Moonwood. They had tracked her to Silverymoon, where she was trying to hire a swordsman to serve as a sparring partner, with the requirement that he was skilled in the two long weapon style common among drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pair had almost caught Ellifain on numerous occasions, but she had always seemed one step ahead of them. And she had disappeared, simply vanished, it seemed, and the trail soon grew cold. The elves suspected wizardly interference, likely a teleport spell, but they had found none who would admit to any such thing, and indeed, had found none who would even admit to ever meeting Ellifain, despite all their efforts and a great deal of offered gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trail was dead, and the elves had hoped-they still did hope-that Ellifain had given up her life-quest of finding and killing Drizzt, but Tarathiel and Innovindil doubted that to be the case. There was no reason guiding Ellifain\u0027s weapon hand, only unrelenting anger and a thirst for vengeance beyond anything the elves had ever known before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is our responsibility as a neighbor to warn King Bruenor,\" Tarathiel answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We hold responsibilities to dwarves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only because Ellifain\u0027s course, if she still follows it, is not one guided by any moral trail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInnovindil considered his words for a few moments then nodded her agreement. \"She believes that if she can kill Drizzt, she will destroy those images that haunt her every step. In killing Drizzt, she is striking back against all the drow, avenging her family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if warned, and she reveals herself and her intent, he will likely slaughter her,\" Tarathiel said, and Innovindil winced at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps that would be the most merciful course of all,\" the female said quietly, and she looked up at Tarathiel, whose face grew very tight, whose eyes narrowed dangerously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that expression softened in the face of Innovindil\u0027s simple logic, in the undeniable understanding that Ellifain, the true Ellifain, had died that night long ago on the moonlit field, and that this creature she had become was ultimately and inexorably flawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not think that Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder are the ones to deliver such a message to King Bruenor,\" Innovindil remarked, and Tarathiel\u0027s dark expression brightened a bit, a smirk even crossing his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likely they would jumble the message and bring about a war between Mithral Hall and the Moonwood,\" he said with a forced chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boom!\" Innovindil added in her best Pikel impression, and both elves laughed aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarathiel\u0027s eyes went to the western sky, though, where the setting sun was lighting pink fires against a line of clouds, and his mirth dissipated. Ellifain was out there, or she was dead, and either way, there was nothing he could do to save her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-18.html","bookId":2140,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:59 PM"}
