{"id":108268,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe night I turned myself back into a vampire, I went searching for an ounce of Yaksha\u0027s blood to serve as an aerobic catalyst. The only place to look, I thought, was the ice-cream truck where Eddie Fender had kept Yaksha\u0027s tortured body in cold storage. There I found the blood I needed, frozen beneath a box of Popsicles. But before I scraped it from the floor of the refrigerated compartment, I had a highly unusual conversation with an elderly homeless man with thinning white hair and a grimy face. He was obviously down on his luck. But when I strode up to say hello, he reacted as if he was expecting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look very nice tonight. But I know you\u0027re in a hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know I\u0027m in a hurry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a few things. You want this truck I suppose. I\u0027ve been guarding it for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t rightly know. I think I\u0027ve been here since you were last here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ice-cream truck should not have been there. The police should have hauled it away a couple of months earlier. Yet not only was the truck parked where it had been when it held Yaksha, the refriger?ator unit was still working, and the homeless man implied he had kept it working for me. That was crucial, because if the blood had melted and rotted, it would have been of no use to me. I wouldn\u0027t have been able to turn back into a vampire. I would have possessed no special abilities with which to protect the child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the big question was ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid the homeless man know that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously knew something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bigger question was how he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the sun setting and with no better place to go, I return to the street where I met the man. There, to my utter astonishment, I find him sitting near the spot where the ice-cream truck had been parked. It is gone but the man has not changed. In fact, he is drinking a carton of milk as he was the last time we met. He looks up as I approach and his eyes sparkle in the dull yellow light of the street lamps. He doesn\u0027t rise, though. He is an old man and getting up is hard on his knees. I remember I had to help him up the last time. He flashes me a warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why if it isn\u0027t you again,\" he says. \"I thought you might come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been waiting for me?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I don\u0027t mind waiting around. Don\u0027t have a lot to do these days, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crouch by his side. \"What do you do when you\u0027re not waiting for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is shy. \"Oh, I just move around, pick up an odd job here and there, help out where I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. \"Well, you sure helped me last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is pleased. \"That\u0027s good. But you\u0027re a bright girl. You know how to help yourself.\" He stops. \"Hey, would you like to play a game of cards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise an eyebrow. \"Poker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushes his hand. \"No. That\u0027s too hard a game for an old fella like me. You have to think too much. How about a game of twenty-one? I\u0027ll be the house. I\u0027ll play by house rules. I\u0027ll hit on every sixteen and give you a tip every now and then if you need it. As long as you promise to tip me if you win in the end. How does that sound? You know how to play twenty-one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit cross-legged in front of him. \"I am a born gambler. Do you have cards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reaches in his old coat pocket and pulls out a pack. \"Do I have cards? These are fresh from a high roller\u0027s blackjack table in Las Vegas. Mind if I shuffle? Those are house rules, you know. Dealer has to shuffle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shuffle. What are we betting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a sip of his milk as he opens the pack. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" Then he laughs and the sound is like music to my ears because it has been so long since I have heard the sound of pure joy. \"An old bum like me--I have nothing to lose!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh with him. \"What\u0027s your name, old bum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pauses and catches my eye. \"Now just one moment. You\u0027re the youngster here. You\u0027ve never told me your name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offer my hand. \"I\u0027m Sita.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes my hand. \"Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you from, Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lets go of my hand and shuffles the cards. He is a pro with them; he obviously can shuffle both sides of the deck with as few as five fingers. Yet a trace of sorrow enters his voice. The tone is not painful, more bittersweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of places, Sita,\" he says. \"You know how it is when you get as old as I am, one place blurs into another. But I try to keep moving, try to keep my hand in. Where are you from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"India.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is impressed. \"By golly, that\u0027s far away! You must have had plenty of adventures between here and India.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many adventures, Mike. But are you going to stop talking and start dealing? I\u0027m getting anx?ious to beat you at what I know is your favorite game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe acts offended, although he is still smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on just one second,\" he says. \"We haven\u0027t decided what we\u0027re wagering. What have you got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. \"Money is good. How much you got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach in my back pocket. \"Three hundred dollars in cash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whistles. \"My sweet lord! You carry your bankroll on you. Now I know that ain\u0027t smart, no sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flip open my wad of twenties. Got them from an ATM machine down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind betting this. What are you bet?ting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy question seems to catch him off guard. He asks with a trace of suspicion, \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Just a few friendly hints, what you offered. Can you give me some of those? When I win I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe speaks with mock confidentiality. \"You don\u0027t need them when you win, girl. You need them when you lose.\" He begins to deal the cards. \"Sure, I\u0027ll help you out. Just don\u0027t you get too rough on old Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI throw a twenty down. \"I\u0027ll try to behave myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe deals me a fifteen, bust hand. He is looking strong, showing a ten. He peeks at his hole card and grins. By the rules, I know I should hit. But I hate chasing a strong hand with so little room to maneu?ver. He waits for me to make a decision, a sly grin on his old lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going to risk it?\" he asks, teasing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" I scratch the ground between us. \"Hit me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get a seven. Twenty-two. Bust. I\u0027m twenty down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe deals another hand. I get eleven, and he shows a six, the weakest card he can show. By most house rules I am allowed to double down at this point. But I ask if it is OK to be sure. He nods, pleased to hit me again. I don\u0027t know what hell do if he gets in my debt. I lay another twenty beside my turned-over cards and he deals me a card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nine,\" I mutter. \"Twenty. I\u0027m sitting pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are pretty, Sita,\" he says as he flips over his cards, showing a five, a total of eleven. He draws and gets a ten, twenty-one, beating me by one again. My forty belongs to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lose the next six hands. Every decision I make is wrong, yet I am playing by the book. The published rules say I should win about half the hands. Yet I don\u0027t think he is cheating me, even though he seems to take great pleasure in taking my money. He already has two hundred bucks, two-thirds of my bankroll. If I don\u0027t win soon I\u0027ll have to walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ninth hand he deals me a natural. Black?jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is showing only a seven. I have finally won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offers me a twenty. The amount I bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want it?\" he asks, and there is a gleam in his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were going to give me a tip,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you won. Fate favored you, Sita, you didn\u0027t have to do anything. When a winning hand is coming around, it\u0027s going to come no matter what.\" He gathers the cards together. He is down to the bottom of the deck; he has to shuffle again. He comments on the fact, as an aside. \"You know if this was a casino and I had myself a shoe, I could deal as many as six decks without shuffling. What do you think of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go completely numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it will be dark angels that force him and his mother to flee to the mirror in the sky, where shoes move without feet and the emerald circle is seen in the morning light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLake Tahoe, I remember suddenly, was called \"the mirror in the sky\" by the original Indians who lived in the area, because they had to hike up the mountain to reach it, and then, it was such a large, clear lake, it looked to them like a perfect mirror reflecting the sky. Also, there is a small but gor?geous cove in the lake called Emerald Bay. Finally, there are casinos nearby that have special shoes for playing twenty-one. As we are playing twenty-one right now, only without one of those shoes that moves without feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika had a book on Lake Tahoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike stares at me. \"Want to play another hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly shake my head. \"It\u0027s not necessary, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods as he reads my expression. \"I guess you\u0027ll be on your way now. I\u0027m sorry to see you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaze into his bright eyes. \"Are you sorry, Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. \"I know you have a job to do. I don\u0027t want to interfere with that none. It\u0027s just that I like it when you stop by, you know. It reminds me of when I was young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m older than I look. You must know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me a wistful expression. \"Well, I sup?pose I do. But I have to say you\u0027re still a youngster to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean forward and hug him, and feel his bony ribs, his dirty clothes, and his love. A powerful feeling sweeps over me, as if I have finally found a member of a family I never knew existed. But the hug can last only so long. He is right--I have a job to do. Letting go, I climb to my feet. The thought of leaving him is painful. I have to ask the next question even though I know he will not give me a straight answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be here when I return?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scratches his head and takes a sip from his milk carton. For a moment he appears slightly bewildered. He quickly counts the money he has won and stuffs it in his coat pocket. Then he coughs and looks up and down and street to see if anyone is listening. Finally he looks at me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Sita, I don\u0027t rightly know. I\u0027m always moving around, like I said, trying to keep my hand in. But I hope I see you again.\" He pauses. \"I like your spirit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean over and kiss his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your spirit, Mike. Be here for me again. Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashes a faint smile. \"I\u0027ll see what I can do.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/evil-thirst-the-last-vampire-5/page-14.html","bookId":2514,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:15 PM"}
