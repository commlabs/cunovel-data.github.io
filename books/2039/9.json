I was exhausted mentally and physically and didn\u0027t even mind the onslaught of dogs and cats that greeted me. Tim stood in the kitchen, mixing up some kind of batter. He also wore a full Native American feather headdress that went all the way down his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that a Sioux thing?\" I asked. \"Er, Lakota?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I keep getting in trouble when I pretend to be one of the local tribes,\" he explained. \"So, I figure if I claim to be from out of town, no one can push for details. Besides, you\u0027re one to judge appearance. Did you sleep out in the rain or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIronically, I had, but I wasn\u0027t about to tell him that. \"It\u0027s been a long day. Days. Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara called like eighty times. She\u0027s got a real attitude, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why she makes the big bucks,\" I said with a yawn. \"I\u0027m going to go take a nap. Wake me if she calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going to go hear me perform tonight?\" he called as I headed down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze. \"Oh, um, gee. I\u0027ve got plans....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\" I turned around. \"I\u0027m going to my mom\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reading\u0027s late,\" he said. \"Doesn\u0027t start until nine. You\u0027ll be done by then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had long since accepted Tim\u0027s fake American Indian gig, but accepting it and witnessing it-aside from when he stood in full regalia in my kitchen-were two entirely different things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve even written new material,\" he added when he saw that he wasn\u0027t making much progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s a selling point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up the bowl of brownie mix. \"I\u0027ll make them with walnuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and turned back toward my bedroom. \"You don\u0027t play fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whooped with joy. \"You\u0027ll love it, Eug. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell asleep pretty easily and woke to two pleasant surprises. One was the scent of freshly baked brownies wafting in the air. The other was Kiyo sitting in a chair in my room, eating one of the aforementioned brownies. With the way he\u0027d been in and out lately, I never really knew when to expect him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice surprise,\" I said, sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likewise,\" he said, eyeing my bare legs. I\u0027d gone to sleep in a T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything new in the Otherworld?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much. Maiwenn\u0027s getting nervous about the delivery, but I kind of figured that would happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s got good healers,\" I said, wanting to reassure him in spite of all the troubled feelings Maiwenn generated in me. I noticed then that he wore his white coat. \"You going into work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just got out.\" Damn. It was later than I\u0027d realized if he\u0027d hung out with Maiwenn and pulled a shift at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to go see my parents with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo made a face. \"Roland hates me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hate is a strong word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t an entirely inaccurate one. Roland, my shaman stepfather, made no secret of the fact that he didn\u0027t like me spending as much time as I did in the Otherworld. Bringing home an Otherworldly boyfriend hadn\u0027t earned his approval either, even though Kiyo was half-human like me. Still, Roland was always more or less polite. My mother, who didn\u0027t know about Kiyo\u0027s heritage, couldn\u0027t gush over him enough. I think she\u0027d nearly given up on me ever dating anyone, so me landing a veterinarian was quite a coup as far as she was concerned. She was a fantastic cook and so even though Roland made him uneasy, Kiyo still consented to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you got enough to eat?\" she asked after we finished dinner with them later that night. She operated under the assumption that I was on the verge of malnutrition and that Kiyo was incapable of feeding himself if someone else didn\u0027t cook for him. In truth, Kiyo was a much better cook than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was great,\" he assured her. \"Believe me, I had more than enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, don\u0027t be afraid to go back for more. Or take home leftovers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geez, Mom. He had three helpings. Are you fattening him up for the kill?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are worse fates,\" mused Kiyo good-naturedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom beamed. I thought she was exceptionally pretty, but maybe I was just biased. People said we had similar looks, and we did as far as build and facial features went. It was the coloring we differed in. Her eyes were just plain blue, and her dark hair was graying. My reddish hair and violet-blue eyes were Storm King\u0027s legacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner, I stole Roland away to the den to talk shop and left Kiyo to entertain my mother. She knew what it was we did, but after her own experiences in the Otherworld, she preferred to avoid our shamanic discussions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still with him, huh?\" asked Roland, relaxing back in an easy chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s nice, and you know it. He\u0027s the same as me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoland scratched his head thoughtfully. His hair had gone gray, and he seemed to have new wrinkles every year. He was still more than a match for most Otherworldly foes (even though he\u0027d ostensibly retired), and the crosses, whorls, fish, and other Christian tattoos on his arms could summon the same power my goddess-based ones could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is like you,\" he agreed. \"He\u0027s not entirely Otherworldly-but he\u0027s tied to it. He\u0027s spent more of his life there than you, let it become more a part of him. And you being with someone like that means that you\u0027ll just be that much more tied to it in return. With everything that\u0027s going on over there, it\u0027s really better if you stay away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything,\" of course, meant the prophecy about me bearing the Otherworld\u0027s savior. While I usually recapped a lot of my shamanic business to Roland, I had neglected to mention a few of my recent activities-say, like inadvertently conquering a kingdom and becoming a queen. Call me crazy, but I just had to think our relationship would be better if he remained in ignorance about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ve kind of gotten involved with something over there. And don\u0027t give me that look,\" I warned, seeing his frown. \"I\u0027m helping out some people who need it, and it\u0027s too late to back out. But the other day, I saw fire demons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got his attention. \"You do mean in the Otherworld, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, yes.\" Demons in our world would be pretty horrible. \"There were five of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a low whistle. \"That\u0027s substantial even for them. It\u0027d take a powerful summoner to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was with, uh, some others, and they managed to do some damage, but for the most part, we were useless. I banished one, and that just about wiped me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it can be done, but it\u0027s not easy. You could do it with a couple of other shamans, but on your own...\" He shook his head. \"I really don\u0027t like you getting involved with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know, but like I said, it\u0027s too late. Do you know how to get rid of them? Aside from assembling a shaman posse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The easiest way-and I use that term loosely-would be to find a gentry who could summon water demons. Put them with fire demons, and they\u0027ll all turn on each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow I\u0027m not optimistic about finding someone like that.\" Yet, even as I said that, I wondered if I could do it. As far as I knew, that wasn\u0027t part of my storm magic. I could summon water and had once controlled air, bending those forces to my will. Summoning elemental creatures was out of my range. Storm King had allegedly been able to do it. Jasmine had commanded water creatures as well, though I didn\u0027t know if that would include demons. It irked me that I couldn\u0027t do what the rest of my family could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True,\" Roland agreed. \"In that case, brute force may be the only way to go. Let them assemble their own forces to get rid of the demons. It\u0027s not your problem. It\u0027s the gentry\u0027s and their leaders\u0027 responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" I said uneasily. \"Well, we\u0027ll see what happens.\" The look he gave me showed that he didn\u0027t believe I\u0027d leave this alone. It also said he knew nothing he could say would convince me. \"I\u0027ve got another question. Ever heard of Otherworldly towns called Ley and Skye?\" Shamans generally avoided crossing over to that world, but Roland had been there many times and knew a lot about the land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ley sounds familiar...it\u0027s in the Alder Land, isn\u0027t it? Or is it Rowan?\" In addition to not knowing about my queenly status, Rowan also didn\u0027t know there\u0027d been a complete upheaval in the Alder Land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rowan,\" I said. \"But very close to, um, Alder. There\u0027s supposedly a crossroads near there. Do you know where it comes out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...nowhere around here, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any way you could find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this tied in to the demons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated a moment and opted for the truth. \"No, it\u0027s something else. A different thing I\u0027m helping them out with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie!\" Roland rarely lost his temper, but I could see the anger in his eyes now. \"What are you doing? You can\u0027t do this. You can\u0027t get entangled in their affairs. Your job is to protect this world, to keep them and the other monsters and ghosts out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not all bad,\" I said, surprised as the words came out of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I need to remind you about your mother\u0027s abduction and the assorted attempts to rape you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing him say those words stung, but I held my ground. \"I\u0027m dealing with that. It\u0027s not an issue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always going to be an issue,\" he argued. \"And I\u0027m not going to help you keep getting into more trouble with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, are you threatening to cut me off from information?\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. If it\u0027ll keep you safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it won\u0027t. The only thing you\u0027ll do is put me in more danger if I keep going there uninformed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. \"So now you\u0027re the one threatening me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother stuck her head in the den\u0027s doorway, concern on her face. \"Is everything okay? I thought I heard shouting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up. \"Roland\u0027s just getting hard of hearing, so I was helping him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her back to the other room, where Kiyo watched me curiously. Even in human form, he had a fox\u0027s hearing, and I wouldn\u0027t have found it surprising if he\u0027d heard the whole argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to take off,\" I said. \"We\u0027re going to hear Tim recite some poetry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo\u0027s raised eyebrow was his only sign of surprise at our evening plans. I\u0027d neglected to tell him earlier because I was pretty sure he would have never left the house with me. He smiled politely at my mom. \"Thanks for dinner. It was great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom was sad to see us go. \"Well, you should come back next weekend. I\u0027ll make lasagna. And cherry pie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed her cheek. \"You don\u0027t have to bribe us to come over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but it doesn\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMad or not, I gave Roland a hug too. In that brief moment, he murmured in my ear, \"I\u0027ll talk to Bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded weary and defeated, and I hugged him closer. \"Thank you.\" Bill was a shaman friend of his in Flagstaff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we were finally able to leave, Kiyo didn\u0027t waste any time in getting to the point. \"Trouble on the home front?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you don\u0027t know,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Told you he hates me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he hates me making all these trips to the Otherworld more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he still thinks I\u0027m a bad influence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a bad influence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove in silence for a few moments. Then Kiyo noticed that I wasn\u0027t heading toward my house. We were going downtown. \"No,\" he groaned. \"We are not actually going to hear Tim, are we? I thought that was just an excuse to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Sorry. I promised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo sighed but took it like a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went to one of Tim\u0027s regular venues, a place called the Fox Den. I thought Kiyo would think that was funny, but he didn\u0027t. When we walked in, there was a girl on the stage reciting poetry about the bleakness of existence and litter on the side of the highway. Kiyo looked around, taking in the patrons and tables-and then realized we were in a coffee shop, not a bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t serve alcohol here? There\u0027s no way I can do this without hard liquor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, just hush,\" I said, trying to hide my smile. We found a small round table in the middle of the crowded cafe, and I left him there while I went to get hot chocolate. I would have loved coffee but had enough trouble sleeping without the addition of caffeine this late at night. When I returned, I saw three visitors had pulled chairs up to our table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, guys,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to see you again, Eugenie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speaker was named Barbara. She was an elderly woman, belonging to the Pascua Yaqui tribe. Their religious beliefs, while having some similarities to the nature-oriented views of neighboring tribes, had picked up a lot of Christian influences over the years. Indeed, she wore a cross around her neck but was also still regarded by many as a type of holy woman. She had no problem with me calling myself a shaman, as those of other Indian tribes sometimes did. Her grandsons, Felix and Dan, were with her tonight, and they didn\u0027t have a problem with me either. Tim, however, was a different story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me your asshole roommate isn\u0027t performing tonight,\" said Felix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch your language,\" said Barbara in a very grandmotherly way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted uncomfortably. \"Well...he might be up there tonight....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ,\" said Dan, munching on biscotti. He looked apologetically at Barbara before turning to me. \"We\u0027ve told him a hundred times not to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, guys. Don\u0027t start something again-it took forever for that last black eye to go away,\" I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shook his head. \"Look, impersonating us wouldn\u0027t be so bad-and it is bad-if his poetry wasn\u0027t such shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix!\" warned Barbara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned sheepish. \"Sorry, Grandma. But you know I\u0027m right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only thing he knows how to do,\" I said lamely. \"Besides, he\u0027s going Lakota tonight-if that helps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll improve the poetry,\" noted Kiyo, stretching back in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" said Felix. \"His poetry\u0027s crappiness transcends all cultures.\" He looked smugly at his grandmother, pleased that he hadn\u0027t sworn this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to me, ignoring him. \"How\u0027s business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" I said. \"Weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she had no issues with me being a shaman, she was sometimes troubled by the thought of me fighting Otherworldly creatures. She seemed undecided about whether they were holy or not, though she had seen her fair share of evil ones and knew what I did was sometimes necessary. She was about to ask me more when Tim suddenly walked onto the stage. He had on the feather headdress, no shirt, and leather chaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh God. No,\" groaned Felix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim held up his hands to silence the scattered applause. \"Thank you, friends,\" he said in a deep, flat voice. \"The Great Spirit welcomes you and your joining of our holy circle tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not even joking,\" said Dan. \"I am this close to walking up there and dragging him out back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" I hissed. \"Not tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For my first poem,\" continued Tim, \"I would like to read you something I was inspired to write while sitting outside and considering the way the beating of a butterfly\u0027s wings are just like the beating of our hearts in this transient world.\" Spreading his hands wide, he recited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister Butterfly upon the wind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWings so yellow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us fly with you into the sky so blue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur souls soaring in the clouds so white\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we look down on those who dream to fly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut are too afraid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd must stay earthbound\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Brother Beetle so brown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to help Dan,\" said Kiyo as the audience applauded. \"I\u0027m going to help him drag Tim off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously?\" said Dan, excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Barbara and I in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim\u0027s next poem was about a mythological woman named Oniata, a girl of divine beauty and youth who came to Earth and caused men everywhere to fight over her. The story was interesting, but like all of his poems, the verses were pretty bad and filled with horrible metaphors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a real story,\" I challenged my companions. \"I\u0027ve heard it before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but it\u0027s not Lakota,\" said Felix. \"I think it\u0027s Iroquois or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly, I don\u0027t think it matters at this point,\" said Dan, looking weary. \"Besides, everyone\u0027s got some story about unearthly beautiful women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo linked his hand with mine and murmured, \"And fortunately, I\u0027ve got my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sly man,\" I said back. \"Sly as a fox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the poetry reading wrapped up, Tim sold his self-published poetry books. I think this was the most remarkable part of all-he always sold a bunch. And the women...the women loved him. A number were cozying up to him already, no doubt wanting to go out later. Watching the women, Dan declared that he was going to quit his job as a computer-support technician and start up on Tim\u0027s gig, causing us all to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say what you want,\" I said to Kiyo, watching Tim and his admirers. \"This all means Tim probably isn\u0027t coming home tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you saying exactly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That the sauna is all ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that anyone else could have really fit into it, though. My wet sauna wasn\u0027t that big, which just meant that when Kiyo and I got home, we had to be that much closer to each other. Neither of us really minded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shed our clothes in the hallway, and he pulled me to him, hands running over my waist and lips grazing my neck. \"You owe me big for making me endure that poetry,\" he growled in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. That was practically foreplay. Are you saying Tim\u0027s poem about Brother Woodpecker plunging his beak into the tree didn\u0027t turn you on? You know that was a total metaphor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo\u0027s only response was a smothering kiss that ended any other witty commentary I might make, his lips hot and hard as his tongue sought mine. Without breaking the kiss, we somehow managed to open the door to the sauna and stumble inside. Immediately, heat and steam surrounded us. Everyone always praised Arizona\u0027s heat for being dry, but I loved humidity and the way it enveloped my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also loved the way the moisture dampened Kiyo\u0027s dark hair, making it curl up even more against his neck. Still holding on to that kiss, he pressed me against the sauna\u0027s wooden wall, his hands gripping my hips. In only a short time, the heat had us both slick and sweating. I tangled my fingers in his hair and then ran them down his arms and chest. The oil and sweat made my hands glide effortlessly across his skin. I paused to run circles around his nipples, slowly increasing the pressure and squeezing them in the way he so often did to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a small grunt of surprise and pleasure and then moved his lips to my neck. I tipped it back, giving him greater access. His kisses were hard, like he was trying to consume me with his mouth alone, and there were even a few teeth involved. With as fair as my skin was, he actually left me with the occasional hickey after sex. It always made me feel like I was sixteen and foolish the next day, but in the moment? It seemed totally worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips moved from my neck to my shoulder while his hands slid up from my hips to my breasts, again moving easily with all that sweat and moisture. He rubbed them and cupped them, his fingers slipping back and forth against my wet skin and occasionally pausing to stroke my nipples in a way that sent waves of need throughout my entire body. Driven to impatience by my own desire, I slid my hands down his stomach, down to the erection pressing against me. I grabbed a hold of him and started to bring him into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpectedly, he turned me around, still keeping me pressed against the wall. I held my hands against it for support while his strong fingers rubbed my back, massaging the muscles that always seemed sore lately. I gasped, finding the massage almost as arousing as the rest. It was fleeting, however. His hands soon moved to my hips again, tipping me out slightly so that I was bent over, rather than pressed flat against the wall. A moment later, he pushed against my body, and I felt him enter me. My own wetness made the thrust almost as effortless as our hands had been on each other\u0027s flesh. I cried out at the feel of him filling me up, pushing harder and harder into me. I rested my check against the sauna\u0027s wall, bracing myself and allowing him to take me more deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped my breasts as he continued moving in and out of me, and I moaned as his touch sent shockwaves through my skin. I was overloaded with sensation as he seemed to take control of every part of my body, both inside and out. His thrusts grew more urgent and fierce; his hold on my breasts became tighter. Having him inside me built a heat between my thighs that radiated out to the rest of my body, rivaling the heat of the air around us. That bliss grew and grew to unbearable heights, until at last the orgasm burst within me, making my legs go weak and nearly give out underneath me. Every part of me tingled and burned, and the feel of him still slamming into my body was almost too much for my flooded senses. Yet, even as I thought I couldn\u0027t handle any more, I still felt that intense pleasure building within me once more and knew that it would take only a little more of this for me to come yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy then, Kiyo\u0027s hands had moved back to my hips, steadying himself so that he could push even harder. With all that force, it was a struggle to continue bending and not simply get pressed flat against the wall. Then, I felt his body grow tense and knew he was about to come. He made a guttural, primal sound, his thrusts growing long and deep as he came and let his own orgasm explode within me. He pressed his face against my shoulder, his motions gradually slowing down as his body sated itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was done, he slid his hands from my hips to my shoulders, turning me around and pulling me toward him. We wrapped our arms around each other, gasping as we leaned against the wall. He said nothing but gently kissed my cheek. I smiled, pushing closer to him and drowning in the scent of his sweat and skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worth enduring the poetry reading?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said. \"Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone woke me up the next morning. Kiyo dozed naked beside me in bed, and I had to practically crawl over him to reach my cell. It was Roland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found out about your crossroads. It crosses over to a town in Texas called Yellow River.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Texas, huh?\" That was unexpected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. And there are two shamans who live there already to keep an eye on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two?\" There weren\u0027t really that many in our profession. We were spread thin, so more than one in a region (aside from a father-and-daughter team like Roland and me) was surprising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s apparently a big gate. Doesn\u0027t take much power or effort to cross through it, so it needs a lot of attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting. Crossroads varied in accessibility. Most required more power than the average human or even gentry could use, fortunately. On certain days of the year-like Beltane and Samhain-areas between our worlds grew thin, making it easier for crossings. Those were dangerous times that kept Roland and me busy. A gateway that was usable the rest of the year was even more dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, if it was easily accessible, then it wouldn\u0027t be too difficult for these girls to cross and seek out humans to father their children. The whole thought made me squirm. A generation of half-Texan, half-gentry kids. God help us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie?\" asked Roland warily. \"What are you thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking I need the names of those shamans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still seemed troubled at my involvement, but I think he felt better about me getting in touch with others-particularly others who were human. He pushed me a little about what was going on, but I still refused to talk about it. After much thanks on my part for the information, we finally disconnected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo had climbed out of bed during the call and was in the shower. As I waited for him, I wondered how I should proceed. Presumably, I should contact these shamans and see if they\u0027d noticed a recent influx of gentry girls. If I could confirm that, it\u0027d ease my worry about bandits (or monsters) kidnapping them, even though it still left the moral dilemma of whether I should be kicking those girls back to their own world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA drop in temperature and a prickling of my skin signaled Volusian\u0027s sudden arrival. He materialized in the darkest corner of my room, expression as sullen and malevolent as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this is a treat,\" I said. \"I do so love seeing your cheery face in the morning. What\u0027s up?\" When I\u0027d left the Otherworld last time, I\u0027d kept Volusian on standing orders to ferry any messages over to me. My joking aside, I wasn\u0027t overly thrilled to see him because I knew it meant there was something I had to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hulking imbecile who commands my mistress\u0027s guards has requested her presence,\" said Volusian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mean Rurik?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, unless my mistress has appointed another hulking imbecile to command her guards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he say why?\" If it had been more trade business, Shaya would have been the one to ask for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wished to tell you that one of the missing girls returned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprang out of bed and hastily threw on some clothes. Kiyo returned to the room, astonishingly sexy with wet hair, and gave me a surprised look. \"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a lead on one of the girls. You want to come with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. He held up his white coat. \"Can\u0027t. I\u0027ve got to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was disappointed. I would have liked to have him with me, but that petty part inside of me felt better about him working than hanging out with Maiwenn again. So, we made our good-byes, parting with a long kiss-a really long kiss. When we finally dragged ourselves away from each other, Volusian looked as though he wouldn\u0027t have minded being smote out of existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent him on ahead of me and then crossed over shortly thereafter. Nia as usual fell all over herself, but I had to politely dismiss her in my eagerness to find Rurik. He was sitting with Shaya in the parlor adjacent to her room, deep in conversation. Both sprang up when they saw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your majesty,\" intoned Shaya politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she?\" I exclaimed. \"The girl. I want to talk to her and get this settled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRurik grimaced. \"Ah. About that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong? Volusian said you found her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we did, in a manner of speaking. It was the girl from Westoria-the one whose parents spoke to you. She surfaced last night in the village, hysterical and going on and on about how she escaped and how horrible it all was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There really was a monster?\" I said, surprised. \"Or did she escape from the bandits?\" I still hadn\u0027t ruled out their involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Nobody knows. She wasn\u0027t making any sense, and mostly, her parents wanted to calm her down. In the meantime, they sent word to us because they knew you\u0027d want to talk to her, and...well, that\u0027s when the problem started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like the rest of this isn\u0027t already a problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the girl heard you were coming, she became even more hysterical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More hysterical over me than a monster or whatever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRurik shrugged. \"As we\u0027ve learned, your reputation is a bit...alarming to some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good God. Didn\u0027t she hear I got my ass kicked by fire demons?\" I sighed. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She ran away. For real this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned and sank back into a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We sent out a search party as soon as we heard,\" he added somewhat hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s something, I guess. It\u0027s one girl...she can\u0027t be that hard to find, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRurik and Shaya exchanged doubtful looks. I groaned again. With the way the land was around here, it was likely anyone who wanted to disappear could. I\u0027d had parties out looking for Jasmine for the last three months and found no clue to her whereabouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to start putting faces on milk cartons,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\" asked Shaya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind. Anything else I should know about? Any word from Leith?\" I figured I\u0027d go do my meditation and connection with the land and then head back to Tucson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing yet,\" said Shaya. \"However...we did hear from Dorian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Another of my problems. She seemed a little nervous about going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sent a message wondering why you hadn\u0027t contacted him yet about trade. And...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. \"Go on. I expect the worst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked embarrassed. \"He said if you can\u0027t be troubled to come in a timely manner, then he\u0027s going to rescind his offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That might not be horrible,\" I pointed out. \"I mean, you\u0027ve told other people, right? We\u0027ve got other kingdoms wanting to buy the copper, don\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer look of discomfort grew. \"Well, not so many.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many is not so many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aside from the Rowan Land? None.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Son of a bitch.\" Honestly? I wouldn\u0027t have put it past Dorian to influence others not to trade with me just so he could play these games. I steeled myself and met Shaya\u0027s pleading gaze. \"I don\u0027t suppose he specified what a \u0027timely manner\u0027 is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did, actually,\" said Shaya. Rurik was smiling, which I took as a bad sign. \"Today.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2/page-9.html","bookId":2039,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM"}
