They were not a mere extrapolation of the peasantry; older, more authoritative, less friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dignity that had marked them at first meeting had grown in impression till it had reached the mark of being their predominant characteristic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat about their oval table like so many grave and slow-moving thinkers. Most were a trifle past their physical prime, though the few who possessed beards wore them short and neatly arranged. Still, enough appeared younger than forty to make it quite obvious that \"Elders\" was a term of respect rather than entirely a literal description of age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two from outer space were at the head of the table and in the solemn silence that accompanied a rather frugal meal that seemed ceremonious rather than nourishing, absorbed the new, contrasting atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the meal and after one or two respectful remarks - too short and simple to be called speeches - had been made by those of the Elders apparently held most in esteem, an informality forced itself upon the assembly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the dignity of greeting foreign personages had finally given way to the amiable rustic qualities of curiosity and friendliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crowded around the two strangers and the flood of questions came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey asked if it were difficult to handle a spaceship, how many men were required for the job, if better motors could be made for their ground-cars, if it was true that it rarely snowed on other worlds as was said to be the case with Tazenda, how many people lived on their world, if it was as large as Tazenda, if it was far away, how their clothes were woven and what gave them the metallic shimmer, why they did not wear furs, if they shaved every day, what sort of stone that was in Pritcher\u0027s ring - The list stretched out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd almost always the questions were addressed to Pritcher as though, as the elder, they automatically invested him with the greater authority. Pritcher found himself forced to answer at greater and greater length. It was like an immersion in a crowd of children. Their questions were those of utter and disarming wonder. Their eagerness to know was completely irresistible and would not be denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher explained that spaceships were not difficult to handle and that crews varied with the size, from one to many, that the motors of their ground-cars were unknown in detail to him but could doubtless be improved, that the climates of worlds varied almost infinitely, that many hundreds of millions lived on his world but that it was far smaller and more insignificant than the great empire of Tazenda, that their clothes were woven of silicone plastics in which metallic luster was artificially produced by proper orientation of the surface molecules, and that they could be artificially heated so that furs were unnecessary, that they shaved every day, that the stone in his ring was an amethyst. The list stretched out. He found himself thawing to these naive provincials against his will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd always as he answered there was a rapid chatter among the Elders, as though they debated the information gained. It was difficult to follow these inner discussions of theirs for they lapsed into their own accented version of the universal Galactic language that, through long separation from the currents of living speech, had become archaic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost, one might say, their curt comments among themselves hovered on the edge of understanding, but just managed to elude the clutching tendrils of comprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil finally Channis interrupted to say, \"Good sirs, you must answer us for a while, for we are strangers and would be very much interested to know all we can of Tazenda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what happened then was that a great silence fell and each of the hitherto voluble Elders grew silent. Their hands, which had been moving in such rapid and delicate accompaniment to their words as though to give them greater scope and varied shades of meaning, fell suddenly limp. They stared furtively at one another, apparently quite willing each to let the other have all the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher interposed quickly, \"My companion asks this in friendliness, for the fame of Tazenda fills the Galaxy and we, of course, shall inform the governor of the loyalty and love of the Elders of Rossem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sigh of relief was heard but faces brightened. An Elder stroked his beard with thumb and forefinger, straightening its slight curl with a gentle pressure, and said: \"We are faithful servants of the Lords of Tazenda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher\u0027s annoyance at Channis\u0027 bald question subsided. It was apparent, at least, that the age that he had felt creeping over him of late had not yet deprived him of his own capacity for making smooth the blunders of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued: \"We do not know, in our far part of the universe, much of the past history of the Lords of Tazenda. We presume they have ruled benevolently here for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same Elder who spoke before, answered. In a soft, automatic way he had become spokesman. He said: \"Not the grandfather of the oldest can recall a time in which the Lords were absent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has been a time of peace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has been a time of peace!\" He hesitated. \"The governor is a strong and powerful Lord who would not hesitate to punish traitors. None of us are traitors, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has punished some in the past, I imagine, as they deserve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain hesitation, \"None here have ever been traitors, or our fathers or our fathers\u0027 fathers. But on other worlds, there have been such, and death followed for them quickly. It is not good to think of for we are humble men who are poor farmers and not concerned with matters of politics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anxiety in his voice, the universal concern in the eyes of all of them was obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher said smoothly: \"Could you inform us as to how we can arrange an audience with your governor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd instantly an element of sudden bewilderment entered the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor after a long moment, the elder said: \"Why, did you not know? The governor will be here tomorrow. He has expected you. It has been a great honor for us. We... we hope earnestly that you will report to him satisfactorily as to our loyalty to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher\u0027s smile scarcely twitched. \"Expected us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elder looked wonderingly from one to the other. \"Why... it is now a week since we have been waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir quarters were undoubtedly luxurious for the world. Pritcher had lived in worse. Channis showed nothing but indifference to externals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was an element of tension between them of a different nature than hitherto. Pritcher, felt the time approaching for a definite decision and yet there was still the desirability of additional waiting. To see the governor first would be to increase the gamble to dangerous dimensions and yet to win that gamble might multi-double the winnings. He felt a surge of anger at the slight crease between Channis\u0027 eyebrows, the delicate uncertainty with which the young man\u0027s lower lip presented itself to an upper tooth. He detested the useless play-acting and yearned for an end to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said: \"We seem to be anticipated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes,\" said Channis, simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just that? You have no contribution of greater pith to make. We come here and find that the governor expects us. Presumably we shall find from the governor that Tazenda itself expects us. Of what value then is our entire mission?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChannis looked up, without endeavoring to conceal the weary note in his voice: \"To expect us is one thing; to know who we are and what we came for, is another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you expect to conceal these things from men of the Second Foundation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps. Why not? Are you ready to throw your hand in? Suppose our ship was detected in space. Is it unusual for a realm to maintain frontier observation posts? Even if we were ordinary strangers, we would be of interest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sufficient interest for a governor to come to us rather than the reverse?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChannis shrugged: \"We\u0027ll have to meet that problem later. Let us see what this governor is like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher bared his teeth in a bloodless kind of scowl. The situation was becoming ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChannis proceeded with an artificial animation: \"At least we know one thing. Tazenda is the Second Foundation or a million shreds of evidence are unanimously pointing the wrong way. How do you interpret the obvious terror in which these natives hold Tazenda? I see no signs of political domination. Their groups of Elders apparently meet freely and without interference of any sort. The taxation they speak of doesn\u0027t seem at all extensive to me or efficiently carried through. The natives speak much of poverty but seem sturdy and well-fed. The houses are uncouth and their villages rude, but are obviously adequate for the purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact, the world fascinates me. I have never seen a more forbidding one, yet I am convinced there is no suffering among the population and that their uncomplicated lives manage to contain a well-balanced happiness lacking in the sophisticated populations of the advanced centers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you an admirer of peasant virtues, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The stars forbid.\" Channis seemed amused at the idea. \"I merely point out the significance of all this. Apparently, Tazenda is an efficient administrator - efficient in a sense far different from the efficiency of the old Empire or of the First Foundation, or even of our own Union. All these have brought mechanical efficiency to their subjects at the cost of more intangible values. Tazenda brings happiness and sufficiency. Don\u0027t you see that the whole orientation of their domination is different? It is not physical, but psychological.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Pritcher, allowed himself irony. \"And the terror with which the Elders spoke of the punishment of treason by these kind hearted psychologist administrators? How does that suit your thesis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were they the objects of the punishment? They speak of punishment only of others. It is as if knowledge of punishment has been so well implanted in them that punishment itself need never be used. The proper mental attitudes are so inserted into their minds that I am certain that not a Tazendian soldier exists on the planet. Don\u0027t you see all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see perhaps,\" said Pritcher, coldly, \"when I see the governor. And what, by the way, if our mentalities are handled?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChannis replied with brutal contempt: \"You should be accustomed to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher whitened perceptibly, and, with an effort, turned away. They spoke to one another no more that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in the silent windlessness of the frigid night, as he listened to the soft, sleeping motions of the other, that Pritcher silently adjusted his wrist-transmitter to the ultrawave region for which Channis\u0027 was unadjustable and, with noiseless touches of his fingernail, contacted the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer came in little periods of noiseless vibration that barely lifted themselves above the sensory threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwice Pritcher asked: \"Any communications at all yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwice the answer came: \"None. We wait always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out of bed. It was cold in the room and he pulled the furry blanket around him as he sat in the chair and stared out at the crowding stars so different in the brightness and complexity of their arrangement from the even fog of the Galactic Lens that dominated the night sky of his native Periphery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere there between the stars was the answer to the complications that overwhelmed him, and he felt the yearning for that solution to arrive and end things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment he wondered again if the Mule were right - if Conversion had robbed him of the firm sharp edge of self-reliance. Or was it simply age and the fluctuations of these last years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t really care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe governor of Rossem arrived with minor ostentation. His only companion was the uniformed man at the controls of the ground-car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground-car itself was of lush design but to Pritcher it appeared inefficient. It turned clumsily; more than once it apparently balked at what might have been a too-rapid change of gears. It was obvious at once from its design that it ran on chemical, and not on atomic, fuel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tazendian governor stepped softly on to the thin layer of snow and advanced between two lines of respectful Elders. He did not look at them but entered quickly. They followed after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the quarters assigned to them, the two men of the Mule\u0027s Union watched. He - the governor - was thickset, rather stocky, short, unimpressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what of that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher cursed himself for a failure of nerve. His face, to be sure, remained icily calm. There was no humiliation before Channis - but he knew very well that his blood pressure had heightened and his throat had become dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not a case of physical fear. He was not one of those dull-witted, unimaginative men of nerveless meat who were too stupid ever to be afraid - but physical fear he could account for and discount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this was different. It was the other fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced quickly at Channis. The young man glanced idly at the nails of one hand and poked leisurely at some trifling unevenness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething inside Pritcher became vastly indignant. What had Channis to fear of mental handling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher caught a mental breath and tried to think back. How had he been before the Mule had Converted him from the die-hard Democrat that he was. It was hard to remember. He could not place himself mentally. He could not break the clinging wires that bound him emotionally to the Mule. Intellectually, he could remember that he had once tried to assassinate the Mule but not for all the straining he could endure, could he remember his emotions at the time. That might be the self-defense of his own mind, however, for at the intuitive thought of what those emotions might have been - not realizing the details, but merely comprehending the drift of it - his stomach grew queasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if the governor tampered with his mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if the insubstantial mental tendrils of a Second Foundationer insinuated itself down the emotional crevices of his makeup and pulled them apart and rejoined them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no sensation the first time. There had been no pain, no mental jar - not even a feeling of discontinuity. He had always loved the Mule. If there had ever been a time long before - as long before as five short years - when he had thought he hadn\u0027t loved him, that he had hated him - that was just a horrid illusion. The thought of that illusion embarrassed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there had been no pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould meeting the governor duplicate that? Would all that had gone before - all his service for the Mule - all his life\u0027s orientation - join the hazy, other-life dream that held the word, Democracy. The Mule also a dream, and only to Tazenda, his loyalty-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharply, he turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was that strong desire to retch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Channis\u0027 voice clashed on his ear, \"I think this is it, general.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher turned again. An Elder had opened the door silently and stood with a dignified and calm respect upon the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"His Excellency, Governor of Rossem, in the name of the Lords of Tazenda, is pleased to present his permission for an audience and request your appearance before him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure thing,\" and Channis tightened his belt with a jerk and adjusted a Rossemian hood over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher\u0027s jaw set. This was the beginning of the real gamble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe governor of Rossem was not of formidable appearance. For one thing, he was bareheaded, and his thinning hair, light brown, tending to gray, lent him mildness. His bony eye-ridges lowered at them, and his eyes, set in a fine network of surrounding wrinkles, seemed calculating, but his fresh-cropped chin was soft and small and, by the universal convention of followers of the pseudoscience of reading character by facial bony structure, seemed \"weak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePritcher, avoided the eyes and watched the chin. He didn\u0027t know whether that would be effective - if anything would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe governor\u0027s voice was high-pitched, indifferent: \"Welcome to Tazenda. We greet you in peace. You have eaten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand - long fingers, gnarled veins - waved almost regally at the U-shaped table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey bowed and sat down. The governor sat at the outer side of the base of the U, they on the inner; along both arms sat the double row of silent Elders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe governor spoke in short, abrupt sentences - praising the food as Tazendian importations - and it had indeed a quality different if, somehow, not so much better, than the rougher food of the Elders - disparaging Rossemian weather, referring with an attempt at casualness to the intricacies of space travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChannis talked little. Pritcher not at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was over. The small, stewed fruits were finished; the napkins used and discarded, and the governor leaned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis small eyes sparkled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have inquired as to your ship. Naturally, I would like to see that it receives due care and overhaul. I am told its whereabouts are unknown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\" Channis replied lightly. \"We have left it in space. It is a large ship, suitable for long journeys in sometimes hostile regions, and we felt that landing it here might give rise to doubts as to our peaceful intentions. We preferred to land alone, unarmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friendly act,\" commented the governor, without conviction. \"A large ship, you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a vessel of war, excellency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha, hum. Where is it you come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A small world of the Santanni sector, your excellency. It may be you are not aware of its existence for it lacks importance. We are interested in establishing trade relationships.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trade, eh? And what have you to sell?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Machines of all sorts, excellency. In return, food, wood, ores.\"***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha, hum.\" The governor seemed doubtful. \"I know little of*** these matters. Perhaps mutual profit may be arranged. Perhaps, after I have examined your credentials at length - for much information will be required by my government before matters may proceed, you understand - and after I have looked over your ship, it would be advisable for you to proceed to Tazenda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer to that, and the governor\u0027s attitude iced perceptibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is necessary that I see your ship, however.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChannis said distantly: \"The ship, unfortunately, is undergoing repairs at the moment. If your excellency would not object giving us forty-eight hours, it will be at your service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not accustomed to waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Pritcher met the glare of the other, eye to eye, and his breath exploded softly inside him. For a moment, he had the sensation of drowning, but then his eyes tore away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChannis did not waver. He said: \"The ship cannot be landed for forty-eight hours, excellency. We are here and unarmed. Can you doubt our honest intentions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence, and then the governor said gruffly, \"Tell me of the world from which you come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all. It passed with that. There was no more unpleasantness. The governor, having fulfilled his official duty, apparently lost interest and the audience died a dull death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when it was all over, Pritcher found himself back in their quarters and took stock of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully - holding his breath - he \"felt\" his emotions. Certainly he seemed no different to himself, but would he feel any difference? Had he felt different after the Mule\u0027s Conversion? Had not everything seemed natural? As it should have been?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe experimented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith cold purpose, he shouted inside the silent caverns of his mind, and the shout was, \"The Second Foundation must be discovered and destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the emotion that accompanied it was honest hate. There was not as much as a hesitation involved in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was in his mind to substitute the word \"Mule\" for the phrase \"Second Foundation\" and his breath caught at the mere emotion and his tongue clogged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut had he been handled otherwise - more subtly? Had tiny changes been made? Changes that he couldn\u0027t detect because their very existence warped his judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he still felt absolute loyalty to the Mule! If that were unchanged, nothing else really mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his mind to action again. Channis was busy at his end of the room. Pritcher\u0027s thumbnail idled at his wrist communicator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then at the response that came he felt a wave of relief surge over him and leave him weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quiet muscles of his face did not betray him, but inside he was shouting with joy - and when Channis turned to face him, he knew that the farce was about over. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/second-foundation-foundation-3/page-5.html","bookId":2017,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:33 PM"}
