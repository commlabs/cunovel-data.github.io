He never tells me beforehand what to expect. Me not knowing heightens the anticipation. Sometimes the man will bind me to cross bars, arms and legs spread wide. He’ll flog me or use leather. Other times he’ll secure me over a spanking bench and after the man has ‘sufficiently prepared’ me, Tate will take over and f**k me while my skin is still heated from the kiss of the whip.” She could feel the blush working its way up her neck at the blunt way she’d described the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKylie sent a suspicious glance Joss’s way. “You don’t seem the least bit shocked or appalled. Just what have you and Dash been up to anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, much the same,” Joss said cheerfully. “Only without the other guy, and well, not since we learned I was pregnant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKylie shook her head. “Clearly I’m the boring one in this group.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChessy smiled mischievously. “Oh, I don’t know. Tying a guy to your bed can’t exactly be considered boring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Y’all are never going to let go of that, are you?” Kylie asked with an exasperated sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope!” Joss said, a huge grin on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think y’all are the ones who need therapy,” Kylie grumbled. “I’m looking more ‘normal’ all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoss checked her watch and then glanced up at the others in chagrin. “Sorry to eat and run but I have to leave if I’m going to make my OB appointment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChessy made a shooing motion with her hand. “You go on. Lunch is on me today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoss paused on her way up from the table and pinned Chessy with a pointed stare. “Kylie and I will expect all the juicy details Saturday, and if we don’t hear from you, we’re totally coming over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHESSY’S phone rang, Tate’s ring tone, and she answered quickly. It was around the time Tate usually got off of work and she hoped he wasn’t calling to say he would be late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTate’s voice was gruff and laced with thick desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you naked and kneeling in the living room when I get home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pulse fluttered and sped up, leaving her breathless and nearly unable to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be waiting,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Love my girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you in ten minutes,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChessy ended the call and then ran for the bathroom, knowing she didn’t have much time. She brushed out her hair as much as she was able. The humidity was particularly high today and the result was her hair being much curlier and less manageable than usual. But then, Tate loved her curls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe checked her appearance with a critical eye, wanting to look her best. She applied light lip gloss, though it was silly considering it would most certainly be wiped off within minutes of Tate’s arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stripped out of her clothing, tossing it in the laundry basket in the bathroom, and then she hurried back to the living room and settled into a kneeling position on the soft rug in front of the fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wait seemed interminable, but then finally she heard the sound of Tate’s car pulling up to the house. Her breath caught in her throat and she expelled it in long, shaky breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith their visit to The House coming up the next day, she wondered what Tate had planned for tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door opened and then Tate appeared in the living room, his suit coat over one arm, briefcase in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis look of intense appreciation gave her a heady thrill. His eyes glowed with open lust. The fact that after so many years of marriage he still looked at her with the same desire he had when they first married gave her fierce satisfaction. But Tate wanting her had never been the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly laid his things down on the couch and immediately loosened his tie, but held on to it instead of discarding it with the other stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis walk toward her was slow and leisurely as if he were taking in every bit of the moment. When he finally got within touching distance, his hand gently threaded through her hair and then he roughly pulled her head back and his mouth crashed down over hers, feeding hungrily from her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Consider tonight a preview of what’s to come at The House,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer blood surged and her ni**les beaded into tight knots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just be warned, I plan to work you hard,” he said. “Remember your safe word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her arms behind her back, her still in a kneeling position, and he tied her wrists together with his tie. Then he walked around to the front of her and hastily unzipped his pants, pulling his c**k free without removing his clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open,” he commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved his hand into her hair and angled her head back as he grasped his c**k with his free hand. She instantly obeyed, opening her lips just as he thrust fully into her mouth. He was rough and she reveled in it. She wanted to sigh her satisfaction that they were returning to the roots of their relationship. Finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s see how much you can take,” he said gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to thrust hard, hitting the back of her throat with the broad head of his cock. Her cheeks puffed outward and she inhaled sharply through her nose to keep up. But she was determined she would endure whatever he chose to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very nice,” he complimented as he continued to push himself as far as he could go. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/taking-it-all-surrender-trilogy-3/page-37.html","bookId":1781,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:47 AM"}
