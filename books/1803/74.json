I—I know this to be true, my lady, because I was once employed by Baron Burleton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurleton… Burleton… Burleton… Burleton. The name began to howl like a banshee in her brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She—she was demanding to see the earl, but you have been very good to me… to all of us, and I would hope that were our positions reversed, not that they ever could be, you would at least come to me with any possible falsehood, instead of carrying the tale to the earl… to someone else. I will, naturally, have to tell him of the woman\u0027s wish to see him when he arrives for the nuptials, but if you perhaps had a chance to see her first and she were to be more calm…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherry leaned her hands on the dressing table for support, nodding to him to show the woman who claimed to be her upstairs, and she closed her eyes tight, concentrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurleton… BURLETON… BURLETON.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImages and voices began to flash through her mind, speeding up faster and faster, spinning so quickly that the next one appeared before the other had spun away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… A ship, a cabin, a frightened maid. \"What if Miss Charise\u0027s fiancé thinks we killed her, or sold her, or something evil like that? It would be the baron\u0027s word against yours, and you aren\u0027t nobody, so the law will be on his side. This is England not America…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… Torchlight, stevedores, a tall, grim man standing at the end of a gangplank. \"Miss Lancaster, I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s been an accident. Lord Burleton was killed yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… Cotton fields, meadows, a wagon filled with goods, a little girl with red hair… \"My papa calls me \u0027carrot\u0027 because of my hair, but my name is Sheridan. There is a rose—a flower—called Sheridan, and my mama named me for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… A restless horse, a stern-faced Indian, the smell of summer. \"White men are not as good as Indians for giving names. Not flower, you. Fire, you. Flames. Burn bright.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… Campfires, moonlight, a handsome Spaniard with smiling eyes and a guitar in his hands, music pulsing in the night. \"Sing with me, cara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… A tiny, neat house, indignant little girl, angry woman. \"Patrick Bromleigh, you ought to be horsewhipped for the way you\u0027ve reared that child. She can\u0027t read, and she can\u0027t write, her manners are deplorable, and her hair is wanton. She announced to me, as bold as brass, that she \u0027fancies\u0027 someone named Raphael Benavente and she\u0027ll probably ask him to marry her someday. She actually intends to propose matrimony herself and to some Spanish vagabond who cheats at cards. And I haven\u0027t even mentioned her other favorite companion—an Indian male who sleeps with dogs! If you have any conscience, any love for her, you will leave her here with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… Two solemn men standing in the yard, a third one in the doorway, his face tense. \"You mind your aunt Cornelia, darlin\u0027. I\u0027ll be back for you before you know it—a year or two at most.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… A distraught child clinging to him. \"No, Papa, don\u0027t! Don\u0027t leave me here! Please! Please, I\u0027ll wear dresses and fix my wanton hair, just don\u0027t leave me here. I want to go with you and Rafe and Dog Lies Sleeping! That\u0027s where I belong, no matter what she says! Papa, Papa, wait—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… A stern-faced woman with gray hair, a child who was supposed to call her \"Aunt Cornelia.\" \"Do not try to stare me out of countenance with that expression, child. I perfected that very look long ago in England, and I\u0027m quite immune to it. In England, it would have served you well, were you Squire Faraday\u0027s acknowledged granddaughter, but this is America. Here, I teach deportment to the children of people whom I would have once regarded as my inferiors, and I am lucky to have the work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… Another woman, stout, pleasant, firm. \"We may have a position for you at our school. I\u0027ve heard some very good things about you from your aunt, Miss Bromleigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…Little girls\u0027 voices. \"Good morning, Miss Bromleigh.\" Miniature young ladies in white stockings and ribbons practicing their curtsies while Sheridan demonstrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer palms were perspiring on the dressing table\u0027s top, her knees were turning to liquid. Behind her, the door opened and a blonde girl stalked in, her voice raised in fury. \"You unspeakable fraud!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeling from the fleeing visions, Sherry forced her eyes open, lifted her head, and stared into the mirror above her dressing table. Framed beside her own face was another face, a FAMILIAR FACE. \"Oh, my God!\" she moaned as her arms began to shake and give way, forcing her to either straighten from her hunched position or fall to the floor. Slowly, she lifted her palms off the dressing table, and very slowly, she turned, while terror began to hammer through her, banishing weakness and lethargy. Her entire body vibrating with panic, she faced Charise Lancaster, and felt each of her enraged words as if it was a blow to her head:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You evil, despicable, scheming slut! Look at this place. Look at you!\" Her eyes were wild as she looked around at the luxurious green and gold suite. \"You\u0027ve actually taken my place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Sheridan burst out, but her voice was unrecognizable, brittle and frantic. \"No, not on purpose. Dear God, don\u0027t—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will take more than prayer to save you from prison,\" her former student snapped, her face contorted with fury. \"You\u0027ve taken my PLACE… You tricked me into marrying Morrison with all your talk of romance, and then YOU TOOK MY PLACE. You actually intended to MARRY AN EARL!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, please, listen to me. It was an accident. I lost my memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat only made her more infuriated. \"Lost your memory!\" she screamed contemptuously. \"Well, you know who I am!\" Without another word, she swung on her heel. \"I\u0027ll be back with the authorities within minutes, and we\u0027ll see how they feel about your memory loss, you vile—!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3/page-74.html","bookId":1803,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM"}
