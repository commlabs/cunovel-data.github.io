And once again he reassembled his scattered thoughts into a semi-coherent assessment of his situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had washed up on an unknown shore. He lay upon snow-covered sand. A light shone somewhere ahead. He had been trying to reach it, crawling toward it. But every time he progressed a few feet, he passed out. And each attempt yielded less progress and briefer consciousness. But now something new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere a dog barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light went out ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... and came back on again. And something else. A vocal rumble nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dog, sniffing, panting, and growling. Would it attack? He could not defend himself against a sick kitten, let along a hungry dog. Never, not even during his darkest days trapped in the depths of the keep, had he felt this helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a voice ... one of the cattle ... a cow ... far away ... or perhaps it only seemed far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rocky? Rocky, come back here this instant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clung to the sound like a sailor to flotsam. He tried to speak but had no voice. He managed to raise his remaining hand, and that set the dog to barking again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you got out there, you dumb mutt?\" the cow said. He sensed age in the voice. \"Whatever it is, leave it alone and come inside before you catch your death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Do not go in! Stay!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make me come out there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! Come out! I beg you, come out! I will give you anything! I will seat you at my right hand after the Change if you will only bring me into your house!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved his hand again, precipitating a new round of near hysterical barking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I declare, you are the dumbest creature on Earth!\" The voice ... growing louder. \"And I\u0027m even dumber for coming out in this to get you. I should leave you out here, but you\u0027re so dumb you\u0027d forget how to find the door! You\u0027ll probably - Mother of God! Is that - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt something nudge him. A toe? He raised his hand as he had before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God, he\u0027s alive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt something tighten on his left arm. He assumed it was the cow\u0027s hands but he was too numb to feel anything beyond deep pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have to help me, mister,\" she said. \"I\u0027m assuming you don\u0027t know I\u0027m on in years and don\u0027t see so well. You\u0027re dead weight and I can\u0027t move you on my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed against the ground with his right hand while she tugged on his left arm. Suddenly she released him and he dropped again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God! Your hand! Did you lose your hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to scream, Isn\u0027t that obvious, you old idiot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately for him, he still had no voice. He could only grunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed him again, pulling on his truncated left arm while he dug his right hand into the semi-frozen snow and pushed toward the light. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-60.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
