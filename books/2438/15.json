We were tired and cranky, and it took time for us to come to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while I asked Evra what the Little People liked to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meat,\"he replied. \"Any kind of animal, they don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many animals will we need to catch?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s twelve of them, but they don\u0027t eat a lot. I guess one rabbit or hedgehog between two of them. A larger animal - a fox or a dog - might feed three or four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you eat hedgehogs?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Little People can,\"Evra said. \"They\u0027re not fussy. They\u0027d eat rats and mice, too, but we\u0027d have to catch a lot to feed so many, so they\u0027re not worth bothering with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe each took a sack and headed off in different directions. Evra told me the meat didn\u0027t have to be fresh, so if I found a dead badger or squirrel, I could stick it in the bag and save some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spotted a fox a couple of minutes into the hunt. It had a chicken in its mouth and was on its way home. I tracked it until the moment was right, then jumped on it from behind a bush and dragged it to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead chicken flew out of its mouth and the fox turned, snarling, to bite me. Before it could attack, I moved quickly, grabbed its neck, and twisted sharply to the left. There was a loud crack, and that was the end of the fox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chucked the chicken into the bag - a nice bonus - but hung on to the fox for a few minutes. I needed blood, so I found a vein, made a small cut, and started sucking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me hated this - it seemed so inhuman - but I reminded myself that I wasn\u0027t human anymore. I was a half-vampire. This was how my kind acted. I\u0027d felt bad killing foxes and rabbits and pigs and sheep the first few times. But I got used to it. I had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I get used to drinking human blood? That was the question. I hoped I could avoid feeding on humans, but by the way I was running out of energy, I knew eventually I\u0027d have to... or die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tossed the fox\u0027s corpse into the bag, then went on hunting. I found a family of rabbits washing their ears in a nearby pond. I crept as close as I could, then struck without warning. They scattered in fear, but not before I got my sharp fingernails into three of the little ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI added them to the contents of the bag and decided that was enough for this trip. I figured the fox, chicken, and rabbits would easily feed six or seven of the blue-hoods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Evra back at camp. He\u0027d found a dead dog and a badger and was feeling pretty pleased with himself. \"The easiest day of hunting I\u0027ve ever had,\"he said. \"Plus I found a field full of cows. We\u0027ll go there tonight and steal one. That\u0027ll keep the Little People going for a day or two at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t the farmer who owns them notice?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are at least a hundred of them,\"Evra said. \"By the time he gets around to counting them, we\u0027ll be long gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But cows cost money,\"I said. \"I don\u0027t mind killing wild animals, but stealing from a farmer is different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll leave money for him,\"Evra said with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where will we get it?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra smiled. \"The one thing we\u0027re never short of at the Cirque Du Freak is money,\"he assured me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, our chores finished, we teamed up with Sam again. He\u0027d been waiting in the bushes for hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you come into the camp?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want to interrupt,\"he said. \"Besides, I thought somebody might have let the wolf-man out. He didn\u0027t seem to like me when I saw him yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s like that with everyone,\"Evra told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\"Sam said, \"but I figure it\u0027s best not to take chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam was in a questioning mood. He\u0027d obviously been thinking about us a lot since the day before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you ever wear shoes?\"he asked Evra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"Evra said. \"The soles of my feet are extra tough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens if you step on a thorn or a nail?\"Sam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra smiled, sat down, and gave Sam his foot. \"Try scratching it with a sharp twig,\"he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam broke off a branch and poked Evra\u0027s sole. It was like trying to make a hole in tough leather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sharp piece of glass might slice me,\"Evra said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"but that doesn\u0027t happen very often, and my skin\u0027s getting tougher every year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I had skin like that,\"Sam said enviously. Then he turned to me. \"How come you wear the same suit all the time?\"he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at the suit I\u0027d been buried alive in. I\u0027d meant to ask for some new clothes but had forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it,\"I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen a kid wearing a suit like that before,\"Sam said. \"Not unless they were at a wedding or a funeral. Are you forced to wear it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ask your parents if you could join the Cirque?\"Evra said then, to distract Sam\u0027s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"Sam sighed. \"I told them about it, of course, but I figured it would be best to take it slowly. I won\u0027t tell them until just before I leave, or maybe not until I\u0027m gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you still plan to join?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet!\"Sam said. \"I know you tried scaring me away, but I\u0027ll get in somehow. You wait. I\u0027ll keep coming around. I\u0027ll read books and learn everything there is to know about freak shows, and then I\u0027ll go to your boss and state my case. He won\u0027t be able to turn me down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra and I smiled at each other. We knew Sam\u0027s dream would never lead to anything, but we didn\u0027t have the heart to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went to see an old, deserted railroad station, about two miles away, which Sam had told us about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s great,\"he said. \"They used to work on trains there, repair and paint them and stuff like that. It was a busy station when it was open. Then a new station opened closer to the city and this place went bankrupt. It\u0027s a great place to play. There are rusty old railroad tracks, empty sheds, a guardhouse, and a couple of ancient train cars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it safe?\"Evra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother says it isn\u0027t,\"Sam told us. \"It\u0027s one of the few places she tells me to stay away from. She says I could fall through the roof of one of the cars or trip on a rail or something. But I\u0027ve been there lots of times and nothing\u0027s ever happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was another sunny day, and we were walking slowly under the shade of the trees when I smelled something strange. I stopped and sniffed the air. Evra could smell it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\"he said, sniffing the air next to me. \"Which way is it coming from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell,\"I said. It was a thick, heavy, sour smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam hadn\u0027t smelled anything and kept walking ahead of us. Then he realized we weren\u0027t beside him, Hopped, and turned to see what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"he asked. \"Why aren\u0027t you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotcha !\"a voice yelled behind me, and before I could move I felt a firm hand grab my shoulder and spin me around. I saw a large, hairy face, and then suddenly I was falling backward, thrown off-balance by the force of the hand. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-15.html","bookId":2438,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM"}
