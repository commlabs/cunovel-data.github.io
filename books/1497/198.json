As the screech grew louder and clearer, the three green colored spots in Qing Lin’s eyes suddenly let out a bright glow. The three spots transformed into three tiny green colored flowers in an instant…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the appearance of these strange green colored flowers, an intense glow suddenly shot out from Qing Lin’s eyes and struck the Flame Spirit Serpent in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing exposed to this somewhat strange glow, the huge body of the Flame Spirit Serpent suddenly stiffened. Its pair of huge eyes were filled with some fear as they stared at the little girl in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strange glow slowly moved on the Flame Spirit Serpent’s body and finally stopped at the middle of the two foreheads of the two snake heads… After the glow stopped moving, it began to gradually shrink. As the size of the glow became smaller, the light that it gave off grew increasingly rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe area of the glow continued to become smaller. At the end, it was around the size of a palm. When the glow shrunk to this size, it ceased becoming smaller. A beam of light shot out and two small green colored flowers were imprinted onto the two heads of the Flame Spirit Serpent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the flowers appeared, the glow began to gradually disappear. A moment later, the tiny flowers swiftly disappeared from Qing Lin’s eyes and her eyes returned to their original dark green in an instant…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter her eyes returned to normal, Qing Lin’s body swayed. Her eyelids fell and she collapsed on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat huge Flame Spirit Serpent continued to foolishly stay on the spot after Qing Lin collapsed. However, every time it swept its gaze onto Qing Lin on the ground, the viciousness and savageness would involuntarily disappear. Replacing it was actually a meekness…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn you!” When the Flame Spirit Serpent was in a daze, Xiao Yan finally broke through the air and appeared. The Heavy Xuan Ruler viciously smashed onto its huge body. Instantly, fresh blood was splashed as it was beaten badly…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hiss…” Having received a heavy blow again, the Flame Spirit Serpent finally regained consciousness. It turned its huge body and started furiously at Xiao Yan. However, when its gaze swept across the huge Heavy Xuan Ruler, look of dread appeared in its eyes. Under Xiao Yan’s furious expression, it once again dived into the magma lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit.” Eyeing the Flame Spirit Serpent which chose to flee, Xiao Yan could not help but curse. He then flapped his pair of wings and swiftly appeared by Qing Lin side. In a hurried manner, he picked her up and placed his finger below her nose, heaving a sigh of relief when he felt a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan withdrew an injury healing medicinal pill from his storage ring and forced it into Qing Lin’s mouth. He then carried her and gradually walked into the tunnel. When he saw the wounded Xiao Ding, he gave a bitter smile and handed him an injury healing medicine before saying, “How is it? Is there something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“*Cough*, it’s nothing serious. I will be alright after resting for awhile.” Xiao Ding took the medicinal pill and swallowed it. Xiao Ding exhaled and smiled bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan leaned against the wall, slowly sat down and hugged Qing Lin into his chest. He rubbed his dust covered face, “Too bad. I haven’t found the ‘Heavenly Flame’...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Later, bring Qing Lin back with you. I will stay here and continue searching. Don’t worry. That beast will only flee when it sees me now. There isn’t anything here that can hurt me now.” Xiao Yan mused for a moment before tilting his head as he told Xiao Ding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh… alright. If we continue to stay here, we will only be a burden to you.” Hearing this, Xiao Ding helplessly nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, the crypt here is so huge and there are flames all over. It won’t be a simple thing for you to search for the ‘Heavenly Flame’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Moreover, I cannot stay too long here. Otherwise, if my movement is detected by some strong people, I’m afraid there will be real trouble…” Xiao Yan nodded and laughed bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing this, Xiao Ding also nodded and laughed sorely. He was very clear about the attraction the ‘Heavenly Flame’ posed to those other strong people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ughh...” Just when Xiao Yan felt helpless, Qing Lin, who was on his chest, slowly woke up. She shook her dizzy small head and lifted it. When she saw Xiao Yan hugging her, her face reddened as her small fingers rubbed her temple. She suddenly said softly, “Young Master, Qing Lin may be able to locate where the ‘Heavenly Flame’ is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” Hearing this, Xiao Yan and Xiao Ding were initially at a loss. Xiao Yan asked in a stunned voice, “How would you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQing Lin pressed her lips together and smiled. She suddenly escaped Xiao Yan’s embrace and ran toward the cave entrance. With her hands around her small mouth, she shouted, “Come out!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs her shout died off, the huge Flame Spirit Serpent suddenly lifted its body from the calm magma lake. After which, it slowly swam toward the tunnel exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the Flame Spirit Serpent, Xiao Yan became shocked. He quickly stood up, grabbed his heavy ruler and intently watched the Flame Spirit Serpent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young Master, don’t hit it. It will not attack us.” Noticing Xiao Yan’s action, Qing Lin hurriedly grabbed him and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?” Xiao Yan’s eyes stared intently at the Flame Spirit Serpent. When he realized that it currently did not possess any intention to attack. he could not help but ask in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not too sure…” Qing Lin shook her head and took two steps forward. Her dark green eyes stared at the huge creature in front of her and said with an uncertain voice, “I don’t know why, but I seem to have built a strange bond with it. I can sense it’s thoughts...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh?” Xiao Yan was at a loss. His gaze swept across the Flame Spirit Serpent in front of him that had suddenly become docile. Finally, his gaze stopped at the green colored flower on one of it’s foreheads. He frowned. That thing was something that was not present before…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tsk tsk, tsk tsk… how incredible. Little boy, I don’t know if you are unlucky or lucky. Why is it that the people you meet are all so unusual? The last time was someone with a Woeful Poison Body, this time is not any worse. You actually met a little girl who possesses the ‘Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils’...” When Xiao Yan was confused, Yao Lao suddenly marveled with a laugh from his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils’? What is that?” Hearing the foreign term, Xiao Yan inquired in wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hm... how do I put it… these are strange inborn pupils. It seems that they will only appear in the descendants of humans and Snake-People. Those individuals who possess these pupils can cause people to hallucinate if they are proficient in using them. Think about it, if you could suddenly cause your opponent to be in a daze mid-fight, or to a greater extent cause the other person to hack at his companion. How would you feel?” Yao Lao grinned and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh… that would definitely be very fun.” Xiao Yan opened his mouth, wiped off his cold sweat and laughed dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Additionally, these kind of pupils can be said to be the nemesis of all snake form Magic Beasts. This is because there is some probability of them forming a one-sided forceful connection with a snake form Magic Beast… Ah, you can consider this kind of forceful relationship as a very rare mysterious contract.” Yao Lao smilingly said, “It is clear that the Flame Spirit Serpent in front of you has unluckily signed a contract with the unskilled ‘Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils’ of this little girl…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“...Damn…” Opening his mouth, Xiao Yan cursed softly. He immediately lowered his head and watched the small timid looking face of Qing Lin beside him. In the future, this little girl would have an incredible bodyguard. A Dou Ling level Magic Beast bodyguard. Tsk tsk… he had not seen anyone who possessed a pet with this kind of combat level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young Master… it knows where the ‘Heavenly Flame’ is.” Qing Lin pointed at the Flame Spirit Serpent in front of her, took credit, as she said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It knows?” Hearing this, Xiao Yan was at a loss as he licked his lips. “Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hm...” Qing Lin closed her eyes and thought quietly for a moment. She then opened her eyes, swept her gaze in all directions and finally pointed awkwardly at the hot magma lake below. In a timid voice, she said, “It says… it is underneath.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hiss…” The corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth twitched as his gaze followed the direction of Qing Lin’s finger and shifted to the hot fiery red magma lake. Under the magma? It was unexpected that the ‘Heavenly Flame’ was actually hidden under the magma. But… must he jump into it to search? Won’t that kill him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ke ke, so that’s why. No wonder I was unable to sense the ‘Heavenly Flame’. It was actually covered by the magma in this crypt.” From within Xiao Yan’s heart, Yao Lao abruptly laughed in a manner that suggested he had suddenly realized something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Teacher… here, can I jump down?” Hearing this, Xiao Yan pulled at his mouth and dryly laughed as he pointed to the bubbling hot magma below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hee hee, if you want to obtain the ‘Heavenly Flame’, it would naturally not be too easy. So how is it? Do you dare to jump?” Yao Lao laughed blandly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan swallowed his saliva. The corner of his eyes glanced at the fiery red magma and his throat rolled a little. His expression flipped quite quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding by the side, Qing Lin watched Xiao Yan with his swiftly changing expression and was also extremely uncertain. She did not dare vouch for the information that the Flame Spirit Serpent passed to her. If something were to happen to Xiao Yan after he jumped down, it was likely she would be in blame…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hu…” After being quiet for a long time, Xiao Yan finally exhaled softly. He tilted his head toward Qing Lin and whispered, “Let it lead the way below!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah...” Hearing Xiao Yan’s words, Qing Lin’s small body immediately trembled. She could only close her eyes and give the orders to the Flame Spirit Serpent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon receiving the order, an unwillingness flashed in the Flame Spirit Serpent’s huge eyes. However, the forceful connection meant that it could only hiss toward Xiao Yan and dive into the magma. It then lifted its huge head and watched the unmoving Xiao Yan with both ridicule and provocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hu…” Staring at the Flame Spirit Serpent which had leaped in, Xiao Yan exhaled a few long breaths. His chest rose and fell. A moment later, he suddenly closed his eyes and under both Qing Lin and Xiao Ding’s shocked gaze, leaped head first into the hot magma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Xiao Yan leap into the magma, Xiao Ding’s and Qing Lin’s hearts suddenly became extremely anxious. Their eyes stared intently at the swiftly falling figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn intense and hot wind blew past Xiao Yan’s ear. The heart in his chest repeatedly beat violently, releasing beat after beat of muffled sound, as though it was just by his ear’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe temperature grew increasingly hot and at one instance, he felt that he was completely isolated from the racket of the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Splash…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing this clear sound similar to plunging into water, the feelings of the three inside the crypt suddenly tensed up into a spring that would collapse with the slightest pull...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-197\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-199\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-198","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:52 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:52 AM"}
