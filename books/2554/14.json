She wondered at his almost feline grace. When, how had he developed that? He\u0027d been such a gangly kid as a teen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook off the questions and pointed to the Compendium, still before Glaeken. \"Still on the same page?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was weird, but fortunate. Weezy had come prepared for the opposite. She\u0027d expected the Compendium to lose that page, so she\u0027d uploaded jpegs of last night\u0027s photos to her laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurned out to be wasted effort. She\u0027d brought the laptop and the Compendium over to the Lady\u0027s place, but when she arrived, the book opened to the same page. A virtual miracle, since the Compendium never showed you what you wanted most to see. And it had stayed on the same page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been counting on Glaeken to translate the gibberish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still can\u0027t translate this,\" Glaeken said, staring at the page. \"I recognize some of the Old Tongue, the language we spoke in the First Age, but that gibberish in the middle is not any language I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy said, \"The section I can read talks about \u0027The Other Name,\u0027 but why can\u0027t I read the rest? I mean, you\u0027ve told us about the Seven Other Names and all, but what\u0027s this page talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken shrugged. \"I wish I could tell you. Each of the Seven had three names, two of which were given, and one chosen. The first given was from their parents and, like everyone else, they had no control over that. The second was one they chose when they aligned themselves with the Otherness. They had to discard their old name as a symbolic way of renouncing everything they were before. The man we know as the Adversary or the One chose \u0027Rasalom.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack said, \"So \u0027Rasalom\u0027 didn\u0027t come from the Otherness? He actually chose that? You\u0027d think he\u0027d come up with something better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\" Weezy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Mordan ... or Omen ... or Dethlok.\" He smiled, but it had a sour edge. \"Or Stimpy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken didn\u0027t seem amused. \"He chose Rasalom - which is why he can\u0027t seem to let it go. His third name, his Other Name, was, like his first, also given - by the Otherness. Each of the Seven received an Other Name when they were elevated to the group. Each Other Name consists of the same seven characters in a unique arrangement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy tapped the table. \"Seven times six, times five, times four, times three, times two, times one gives us five thousand forty permutations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head. \"You just did that in your head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, she had. Without even thinking about it. Just the way her mind worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a gift. And that\u0027s a lot of names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially if you don\u0027t know the seven characters. And I can guarantee none of them is from our alphabet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy remembered something ... from 1983. \"Remember that little pyramid we found as kids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. The little black thing with six sides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven if you count the base. And each of those seven faces was carved with a symbol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack straightened from his slouch. \"Hey...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy looked at Glaeken. \"Do you know the symbols we\u0027re talking about? The same ones were on the big pyramid on your property in the Pine Barrens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could they be the seven characters in the Other Names?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who can say? I never saw or heard the One\u0027s Other Name or any of the Seven\u0027s. But it seems a possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther possibilities flashed through her head as she grabbed a pen and a sheet of paper from her backpack and began drawing. She held up the result and showed it to the other three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what they looked like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack was staring with an awed expression. \"You remember? After all these - \" Then he shook himself. \"What am I saying? Of course you remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...\" she said, \"if Rasalom\u0027s Other Name is composed of these seven characters, we can arrange them in the five thousand forty possible sequences, and know that one of them is his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? What does that get us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if people saying his \u0027Rasalom\u0027 name used to get him worked up, think what saying his Other Name will do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head. \"You\u0027re talking five thousand possibilities. And even if we do find the right one, how would you pronounce it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought Weezy to a screeching halt. \"Oh, right. Didn\u0027t think about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And even if we could antagonize him by spreading his Other name around, what good would it do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might bring him out in the open where you could get a bead on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile broadened. \"I like the way you think. Make him come to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the search going, by the way?\" she said. \"Any luck with the moving people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s smile faded as he shook his head. \"Dead end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady pointed to the Compendium. \"May I see this mysterious writing that no one knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d fully intended to show the Lady, but she\u0027d been so quiet, Weezy had forgotten she was there. She placed the book before her and pointed to the middle section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That gobbledygook there. Does that make any sense to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady stared little more than a heartbeat, then nodded. \"Of course. I know all the languages of Earth for all time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course you would, Weezy thought, chagrined that she hadn\u0027t figured that out on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Jack said, sounding more impatient than usual. Weezy guessed he didn\u0027t realize that the Lady\u0027s responses were very literal at times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What language?\" Weezy said, almost as curious about that as the translation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the original language of the small folk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken\u0027s eyes lit. \"The smithies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy leaned forward. \"\u0027Small folk.\u0027 I\u0027ve seen them mentioned in the Compendium. Like gnomes, elves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they\u0027re the source of those tales,\" Glaeken said. \"Tiny people skilled with metals. As soon as I could afford their services, I allowed no one else to make my weapons.\" He looked at the Lady. \"So this is their tongue. I\u0027d heard them talk among themselves but never saw it written down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is because they rarely committed words to paper,\" the Lady said. She frowned. \"If Srem used their tongue for this, she must have wanted it kept secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA secret passage in a book full of secrets - Weezy could barely contain herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it say - read it, read it, read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already have. It details the ritual of the Other Naming Ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe excitement died - fell off a cliff - and Weezy dropped back into her chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Well, that\u0027s no help.\" She sighed. \"I mean, I don\u0027t see any of us being given an Other Name soon, so I can\u0027t see any use in knowing the naming ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack swiveled to face her. \"Then why write it down in a language that\u0027s effectively code?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps it has something to do with what Srem added here at the end: \u0027No two humans may have the same Other Name. The First-named shall be powerless as long as the Second-named lives. The First-named shall hear the Name within the Second and thus be able to resolve the duplication.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that mean?\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken looked baffled. \"I\u0027ve never heard of any of this.\" He glanced at the Lady. \"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Many things originating with the Otherness are hidden from me. It does, however, offer a reason why they so jealously guarded their Other Names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027No two humans may have the same Other Name,\u0027\" Weezy recited. \"We\u0027ll probably never know why, so let\u0027s just accept that that\u0027s the way the Otherness wants it. But the next part is interesting: \u0027The First-named shall be powerless as long as the Second-named lives.\u0027 Powerless how? Does that mean no longer connected to the Otherness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s eyes lit. \"Could mean he\u0027s mortal and normally vulnerable while someone else has his name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy could almost see the wheels turning in Jack\u0027s head, and guess what he was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last part\u0027s a little scary, though: \u0027The First-named shall hear the Name within the Second and thus be able to resolve the duplication.\u0027 I\u0027ve got a pretty good idea what \u0027resolve the duplication\u0027 entails, but what does \u0027hear the name within the Second\u0027 mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack said, \"Rasalom knows whenever someone speaks his self-given name, so it makes sense he\u0027d know when someone speaks his Other name. But this sounds different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Weezy said. \"\u0027Hear within\u0027 doesn\u0027t seem quite the same. \u0027Within\u0027 what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Within the mind,\" the Lady said. \"I recall tales of this. The First-named will know when someone else has adopted his Other Name, because that name will live in the mind of the Second-named. The Second-named need not speak it, merely be conscious of his Other Name for the First-named to be able to home in on it - and \u0027resolve\u0027 the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if the Second-named forgets the name?\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady gave him a look. \"I believe that is unlikely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy shook her head. Jack ... always looking for a workaround.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know...\" he said slowly, \"this has possibilities. If we figured out his Other Name, you could put me through the naming ceremony and give it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy\u0027s stomach twisted. \"He\u0027d hunt you down and kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d try. But I\u0027d be ready for him. Especially since I wouldn\u0027t have to waste a lot of time looking for him - he\u0027d come to me. I could choose the battlefield.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of wasting time,\" Glaeken said, \"you\u0027re doing that now. We don\u0027t know his Other Name, so there\u0027s no point in discussing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could christen me with all of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Christen\u0027 is a Christian term,\" Weezy said. \"I don\u0027t think that applies here. And we\u0027re talking five-K-plus possibilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady said, \"Whether it applies or would work is irrelevant. Only I can read the text, therefore I am the only one who can perform the ceremony, and I will not - not with one name, not with five thousand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack looked offended. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be tantamount to pronouncing a death sentence. I would not do that to you or anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be Rasalom\u0027s death sentence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady folded her arms with grim finality. \"I have spoken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s that, Weezy thought, relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we move on to something a little more pressing?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack said, \"What\u0027s more pressing than taking out Rasalom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protecting the Lady from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause, then a nod. \"Well, yeah. There\u0027s that. After yesterday, there\u0027s no doubt she\u0027s still his focus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of yesterday,\" Weezy said, \"how\u0027s your arm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack got a funny look in his eyes. \"Coming along fine. Just fine.\" He turned to the Lady. \"Did the noosphere come up with a place you can hide from him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady nodded. \"A possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very near where the two of you grew up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shock zapped through Weezy. \"Johnson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack too looked surprised. \"I know there\u0027s a nexus point in the Barrens - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady shook her head. \"Not there.\" She looked at Glaeken. \"There is a structure on your land - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pyramid?\" Weezy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"There is a good possibility I will be shielded from his awareness if I stay there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy tapped the Compendium. \"I found something once - of course, I can\u0027t find it again - that mentioned a pyramidal structure and hinted it had some sort of \u0027power of occultation.\u0027 And typical of Srem, she didn\u0027t explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Occultation,\" Jack said. \"Fancy word for hiding. How? It\u0027s not even enclosed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Srem said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was once a cage, wasn\u0027t it?\" Jack glanced at her. \"At least we figured it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken nodded. \"Yes. Once a very famous place in the world of the Ancient Fraternal Septimus Order when it wasn\u0027t quite so ancient. They built it to house the last q\u0027qr.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy pounded a fist on the table. \"I knew it!\" She pointed at Jack. \"That thing that chased us in the lost town - that was a q\u0027qr. The last q\u0027qr.\" She looked at Glaeken. \"Is that possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Well, after all, they live until they are killed, so I suppose it could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy had been finding references to q\u0027qrs in the Compendium and Glaeken had filled in the gaps: Q\u0027qrs were created by the Otherness back in the First Age - genetically retrofitted from humans - as savage soldiers in its war against the Ally. Dark, hairy bipeds with two arms and two tentaclelike appendages sprouting from their armpits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why New Jersey, of all places?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe the cage - or pyramid, as you\u0027ve called it - was erected in the late Archaic period. The Order had preserved a good deal of knowledge after the cataclysm that ended the First Age, but never shared it. The \u0027New World\u0027 was not the least bit new to them. They penned the last q\u0027qr near their first Lodge in North America.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one in Johnson?\" Jack said, his expression baffled. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Pine Barrens, in what would eventually become New Jersey, were convenient to the coast via rivers and streams, and even more isolated then. The woods presented a good buffer against the natives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why not someplace warmer - like the Carolinas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The location of the Johnson lodge isn\u0027t random. It lies on a convergence near a particularly powerful nexus point. A settlement sprang up around it long before Columbus or even the Vikings found this continent, and eventually became the Old Town section of Johnson. You probably can\u0027t pronounce its First Age name, but because of the presence of the last q\u0027qr, it was referred to as Q\u0027qret - which translates as Q\u0027qr Home. As English became the dominant local language - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy saw where he was going. \"Q\u0027qret was bastardized into Quakerton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken nodded. \"Which remained the town\u0027s name until President Andrew Johnson decided to spend the night there. Members of the Order had largely moved on by then, leaving only the Lodge as a permanent holding. I knew the cage was empty and assumed the last q\u0027qr was dead, but I bought the land around it to prevent development. Who knew what trouble people might unearth if they started digging?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy remembered what she and Jack had uncovered when they\u0027d dug on his land - Glaeken had been known to the locals back then as Old Man Foster - and it had led to a ton of trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the Lady. \"But you\u0027re saying that old stone cage would be a safe place for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Jack said, holding up a hand. \"We\u0027re just going to forget about this Other Name thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken said, \"I think it\u0027s a dead end, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head. \"I\u0027m not so sure. There\u0027s an opportunity there. I don\u0027t know what, exactly, but something\u0027s there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if I do not perform the ceremony,\" the Lady said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack leaned back, looking frustrated. Weezy had a feeling he wasn\u0027t going to let this go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady turned to Weezy. \"To answer your question: Yes, I think that ancient cage might offer a hiding place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack frowned. \"How? It\u0027s got open sides. I think you\u0027d be more exposed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was built in a way that honors the Otherness. If I stay within its confines, its walls might deflect the One\u0027s awareness of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken said, \"It\u0027s obvious he has no way to harm you - at least at the moment - otherwise he would have used it yesterday. But we can be just as sure that he is leaving no stone unturned looking for a means to extinguish you.
