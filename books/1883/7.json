{"id":84015,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet. That\u0027s why you took it upon yourself to find Renee\u0027s killer. It was your job to protect her. And when you couldn\u0027t, that last time, the least you could do . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent, and then Jared rinsed his hair and started running his soapy hands down her back, started kneading her buttocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoira thought, his body is his weapon. He\u0027s been using all those fighting skills to track down his sister\u0027s killer like a bloodhound. That\u0027s why he got the drop on me so easily. My whole life, I\u0027ve taken my physical strength for granted. I couldn\u0027t do a karate chop if someone held a gun to my head. He\u0027s not an intellectual, and he doesn\u0027t have circus strongman strength. He\u0027s cunning, and quick, and can sneak up on people with no trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s more like a wolf, she realized with a bolt of excitement, than I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould this man be the one? She would never worry about accidentally hurting Jared; he could take care of himself. Certainly it was no problem if he were to accidentally hurt her . . . she was a fast healer, and pain was, at times, almost a friend to her. Best of all, most wonderful of all, he absolutely didn\u0027t care that she was an adding machine on legs. That alone made it worth staying with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer excitement derailed abruptly when she recalled one simple, devastating fact: he had no clue what she was. And once he found out, he would at least walk—run!—out of her life forever. Unless he considered her responsible for his sister\u0027s death, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow, she wondered forlornly, had the tables turned so quickly? Yesterday she would have seen him dead. Today tears sprang to her eyes at the thought of him leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were still stroking, still soaping, and she could feel his erection against her stomach. He pressed her close to him, holding her tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moira, Moira,\" he whispered, his words almost lost under the thrumming of the shower, \"a guy could fall in love. But if you\u0027re holding out on me . . .\" He came into her, hard, a brutal shove, and she bit back a cry of mingled pain and pleasure. \". . . you\u0027ll live to regret it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t doubt it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked her up, pulled her legs around him, and held her easily, pinning her against the slick tile like a butterfly to a board. He shoved, shoved, shoved, and it hurt, she wasn\u0027t ready for him, and she loved it, loved being used roughly. Had she really disdained coupling with a human because she thought they were weak? She had thrice his strength but, without leverage, could only take it. Take him. His length filled her up, took her over, he was deep, so deep. He was shoving angrily but his hands were gentle; she had a flash of intuition\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(he\u0027s angry because he wants me so badly . . . wants me but doesn\u0027t quite trust me) and then could only concentrate on what he was doing to her. She squirmed against the tile. \"You\u0027re hurting me,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" He gently tongued her earlobe . . . then bit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow his thrusts came easier because her body was easing his way, was flooding her with wetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you,\" he whispered, his eyes gleaming, \"I never wanted this to happen . . . ahhhhhhhhh . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel so slick, so sweet. I\u0027m really close. I\u0027m going to come and . . . you\u0027re . . . not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare!\" was as far as she got before she could feel him pulsing inside her. Abruptly, he pulled away, leaving her shaking with need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jared . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are we going to do, bright eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jared . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a simple question, Moira,\" he said patiently, giving her nipple an impudent tweak. Oh, how she hated him. \"A guy could fall in love, but I\u0027ve got to keep my priorities straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers. His fingers, between her legs, finding her throbbing clit. Stroking it, rubbing it. Even squeezing, very, very gently. Her legs trembled, threatened to spill her to the tile. Her head rolled back and forth against the shower wall. \"You\u0027re smack in the middle of a mess, gorgeous, and I don\u0027t envy you at all. The question is, what are you going to do about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please. Please. Please.\" The word was wrenched out of her, shoved out. \"Please, Jared. Don\u0027t make me beg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, sweetheart,\" his mouth very near her ear, \"you are begging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moaned, lost. He took pity on her, knelt, gently spread her apart and lapped, lapped, lapped. She came at once, a shallow spasm that did nothing, that left her wanting him inside her, her need for him a bestial craving. \"More,\" she gasped, demanded, urged. Begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wordlessly led her from the shower, both of them dripping wet. Bent her over the tub. Took her again and again, until the room rang with her screams, until her legs wouldn\u0027t support her any longer and she collapsed to the floor, still feeling the spasms from her last orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, he lifted her to her feet, dried her with a big, fluffy towel, and tucked her into bed as if she were a precious treasure. Left her to nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans are weak, was her last thought before spinning into sleep. In a pig\u0027s eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she woke, hours later, she was alone in the bed and utterly ravenous. The smell of frying bacon filled the room, filled her head, and she hurriedly pulled on some clothes and flew down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burst into the kitchen just as Jared slid three eggs onto a plate laden with bacon, toast, sliced tomatoes, home fries, and sausage links. \"Morning, sunshine. Do you want some—\" Snatching the plate away from him, she sat at the table, grabbed a fork, started shoveling. \"—breakfast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nnnnf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned down at her. \"God, you are the perfect woman. Super smart, awesome in bed, and you eat like a lumberjack.\" He ruffled her curls. \"A sexy lumberjack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmfff nnnggg mmmm,\" she said, or something like that. She swallowed. \"This is good. Thanks very much. Being hungry does nothing for my manners.\" Human manners, she amended silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re not throwing food at me.\" He turned back to the stove. \"After this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes, very non-PC, you beast, it\u0027s over between us, hate you forever . . . salt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, blinked at her, then shook his head and nodded toward the salt shaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, I have to get up?\" she complained. \"You\u0027re standing right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cripes, you\u0027ve got nerve!\" He whipped around, exasperated. \"You know, technically you\u0027re my prisoner. I mean, I did kidnap you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and then you lost me.\" At his scowl, she added, \"Plus, you\u0027re standing right there. Besides, you and I both know you\u0027d eat your own feet before hurting any woman. So spare me the \u0027you are my prisoner, fear me\u0027 crapola. And pass the damned salt! Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it,\" he said, smirking, \"if you\u0027ll show me your tits.\" He paused, obviously braced for shrieks of feminine dismay at his crude request . . . and nearly fell onto the frying pan as her T-shirt hit him in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Salt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" He fetched it for her, gave her left breast a friendly squeeze, and returned to his eggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Now there\u0027s bacon grease on my nipple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take care of that for you,\" he said, scooping eggs onto another plate. He snapped a glance at her over his shoulder, and winked. \"Later.\" He sat down across from her and fell to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. You could just pass me a napkin, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spoilsport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate in friendly silence, until Jared finally asked, \"Do you remember last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vividly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean . . . my dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She stopped mopping egg yolk with her toast and looked up. \"I\u0027m very, very sorry about your sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her thoughtfully. She noticed he hadn\u0027t pulled his hair back in a ponytail, and had to keep brushing back the sandy blonde strands, keeping them out of his face. \"And afterward. What I said afterward . . . I\u0027m pretty sure I told you they\u0027re werewolves. Over at Wyndham\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you did.\" She answered his unspoken question. \"I already knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunderstruck silence, followed by, \"And you work for them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re my family.\" Get it? My family? Don\u0027t make me say it, Jared. Figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved his plate back, stood, started pacing. She unobtrusively pulled his half empty plate toward her. Ah, two pieces of bacon left . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, if I didn\u0027t know for a fact that all werewolves are male, I\u0027d be really worried about—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" What? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t try to deny it, pretty spy. You know, I had to take a long and very fucking strange road to get to this house, this town, and on the way I met some exceedingly weird people. And heard some strange shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Werewolves are all men.\" She could barely get the sentence out without giggling. \"Who told you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I paid good money for that information,\" he said proudly. \"And I got it from an honest-to-God werewolf. I watched the beast change . . . into a bigger beast. And when the moon went down and the sun came up, he told me all about werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll about bullshit, more likely. \"How\u0027d you get him to talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was resting the barrel of my shotgun against his testicles while we played Twenty Questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that would do it.\" So he\u0027ll never guess the truth about me. Not unless I tell him outright, or show him. So: good? Or bad? Moira practically squirmed at the odd dilemma. Good for Moira-the-werewolf, because her main goal, always, was the pack\u0027s safety. Bad for Moira-the-woman, because this put more distance between her and Jared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why did she care ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked nonplussed at the way she hadn\u0027t been horrified to hear about the shotgun, and the testicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, in fact, she seemed to hardly be paying attention to his revelations. He resumed pacing. \"Which is why you shouldn\u0027t be working there. What if one of them bites you, for Christ\u0027s sake? I didn\u0027t think to ask if a woman could get infected that way . . .\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jared-s-wolf-wyndham-werewolf-2/page-7.html","bookId":1883,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:25 PM"}
