My conclusion is that the first goal must be to establish a bridgehead through which men and supplies can be funnelled at speed. The initial thrust must therefore come in the region of a large and capacious harbour. The natural choice is Cherbourg. Both the bombing pattern and the strategic requirements point to Normandy,\" he finished. He picked up his glass and emptied it, and the footman came forward to refill it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodl said, \"All our intelligence points to Calais-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we have just executed the head of the Abwehr as a traitor,\" Hitler interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Krancke, are you convinced?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not,\" the admiral said. \"I too have considered how I would conduct the invasion if I were on the other side but I have brought into the reasoning a number of factors of a nautical nature that our colleague Rundstedt may not have comprehended. I believe they will attack under cover of darkness, by moonlight, at full tide to sail over Rommel\u0027s underwater obstacles, and away from cliffs, rocky waters, and strong currents. Normandy? Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHitler shook his head in disagreement. Jodl then said, \"There is another small piece of information I find significant. The Guards Armoured Division has been transferred from the north of England to Hove, on the southeast coast, to join the First United States Army Group under General Patton. We learned this from wireless surveillance. There was a baggage mix-up en route, one unit had another\u0027s silver cutlery, and the fools have been quarrelling about it over the radio. This is a crack British division, very blue-blooded, commanded by General Sir Allen Henry Shafto Adair. I feel sure they will not be far from the centre of the battle when it comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHitler\u0027s hands moved nervously, and his face now twitched in indecision. \"Generals!\" he barked at them, \"Either I get conflicting advice, or no advice at all. I have to tell you everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith characteristic boldness, Rundstedt plunged on. \"My Fuehrer, you have four superb panzer divisions doing nothing here in Germany. If I am right, they will never get to Normandy in time to repel the invasion. I beg you, order them to France and put them under Rommel\u0027s command. If we are wrong, and the invasion begins at Calais, they will at least be close enough to get into the battle at an early stage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know!\" Hitler\u0027s eyes widened, and Rundstedt wondered if he had pushed too hard again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePuttkamer spoke now for the first time. \"My Fuehrer, today is Sunday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow night the U-boat may pick up the spy, Die Nadel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes, someone I can trust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he can report by radio at any time, though that would be dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRundstedt said, \"There isn\u0027t time to postpone decisions. Both air attacks and sabotage activities have increased dramatically. The invasion may come any day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I disagree,\" Krancke said. \"The weather conditions will not be right until early June-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is not very far away-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough,\" Hitler shouted. \"I have made up my mind. My panzers stay in Germany for now. On Tuesday, by which time we should have heard from Die Nadel, I will reconsider the disposition of these forces. If his information favours Normandy as I believe it will, I will move the panzers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRundstedt said quietly, \"And if he does not report?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he does not report, I shall reconsider just the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRundstedt nodded assent. \"With your permission I will return to my command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Granted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRundstedt got to his feet, gave the military salute and went out. In the copper-lined elevator, falling four hundred feet to the underground garage, he felt his stomach turn over and wondered whether the sensation was caused by the speed of descent or by the thought that the destiny of his country lay in the hands of a single spy, whereabouts unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePART SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy woke up slowly. She rose gradually, languidly, from the warm void of deep sleep, up through layers of unconsciousness, perceiving the world piece by isolated piece: first the warm, hard male body beside her; then the strangeness of Henry\u0027s bed; the noise of the storm outside, as angry and tireless as yesterday and the day before; the faint smell of the man\u0027s skin; her arm across his chest, her leg thrown across his as if to keep him there, her breasts pressed against his side; the light of day beating against her eyelids; the regular, light breathing that blew softly across her face; and then, all at once like the solution to a puzzle, the realisation that she was flagrantly and adulterously lying with a man she had met only forty-eight hours before, and that they were naked in bed in her husband\u0027s house. For the second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes and saw Jo. My God... she\u0027d overslept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was standing beside the bed in his rumpled pyjamas, hair tousled, a battered rag doll under his arm, sucking his thumb and staring wide-eyed at his mummy and the strange man cuddling each other in bed. Lucy could not read his expression, for at this time of day he stared wide-eyed at most things, as if all the world was new and marvellous every morning. She stared back at him in silence, not knowing what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Henry\u0027s deep voice said, \"Good morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJo took his thumb out of his mouth, said, \"Good mornin\u0027,\" turned around and went out of the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, damn,\" Lucy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry slid down in the bed until his face was level with hers, and kissed her. His hand went between her thighs and held her possessively. She pushed him away. \"For God\u0027s sake, stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jo\u0027s seen us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can talk, you know. Sooner or later he\u0027ll say something to David. What am I going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do nothing. Does it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see why, the way he is. You shouldn\u0027t feel guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy suddenly realised that Henry simply had no conception of the complex tangle of loyalties and obligations that constituted a marriage. Any marriage, but especially here. \"It\u0027s not that simple,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got out of bed and crossed the landing to her own bedroom. She slipped into panties, trousers and a sweater, then remembered she had destroyed all Henry\u0027s clothes and had to lend him some of David\u0027s. She found underwear and socks, a knitted shirt and a V-necked pullover, and finally right at the bottom of a trunk one pair of trousers that were not cut off at the knee and sewn up. All the while Jo watched her in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the clothes into the other bedroom. Henry had gone into the bathroom to shave. She called through the door, \"Your clothes are on the bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went downstairs, lit the stove in the kitchen and put a saucepan of water on to heat. She decided to have boiled eggs for breakfast. She washed Jo\u0027s face at the kitchen sink, combed his hair and dressed him quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very quiet this morning,\" she said brightly. He made no reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry came down and sat at the table, as naturally as if he had been doing it every morning for years. Lucy felt very weird, seeing him there in David\u0027s clothes, handing him a breakfast egg, putting a rack of toast on the table in front of him. Jo said suddenly, \"Is my daddy dead?\" Henry gave the boy a look and said nothing. Lucy said, \"Don\u0027t be silly. He\u0027s at Tom\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJo ignored her and spoke to Henry. \"You\u0027ve got my daddy\u0027s clothes, and you\u0027ve got mummy. Are you going to be my daddy now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy muttered, \"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you see my clothes last night?\" Henry said. Jo nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, you know why I had to borrow some of your daddy\u0027s clothes. I\u0027ll give them back to him when I get some more of my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you give my mummy back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Lucy said, \"Eat your egg, Jo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child went at his breakfast, apparently satisfied. Lucy was gazing out of the kitchen window. \"The boat won\u0027t come today,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you glad?\" Henry asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy didn\u0027t feel hungry. She drank a cup of tea while Jo and Henry ate. Afterward Jo went upstairs to play and Henry cleared the table. As he stacked crockery in the sink he said, \"Are you afraid David win hurt you? Physically?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should forget him,\" Henry went on. \"You were planning to leave him anyway. Why should it concern you whether he knows or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my husband. That counts for something. The kind of husband he\u0027s been... all that... doesn\u0027t give me the right to humiliate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it gives you the right not to care whether he\u0027s humiliated or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a question that can be settled logically. It\u0027s just the way I feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a giving-up gesture with his arms. \"I\u0027d better drive over to Tom\u0027s and find out whether your husband wants to come back. Where are my boots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the living room. I\u0027ll get you a jacket.\" She went upstairs and got David\u0027s old hacking jacket out of the wardrobe. It was a fine grey-green tweed, very elegant with a nipped-in waist and slanted pocket flaps. Lucy had put leather patches on the elbow to preserve it; you couldn\u0027t buy clothes like this anymore. She took it down to the living room, where Henry was putting his boots on. He had laced the left one and was gingerly inserting his injured right foot into the other. Lucy knelt to help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The swelling has gone down,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The damned thing still hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey got the boot on but left it untied and took the lace out. Henry stood up experimentaUy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy helped him into the jacket. It was a bit tight across the shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t got another oilskin,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll get wet.\" He pulled her to him and kissed her roughly. She put her arms around him and held tightly for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drive more carefully today,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and nodded, kissed her again-briefly this time-and went out. She watched him limp across to the barn, and stood at the window while he started the jeep and drove away up the slight rise and out of sight. When he had gone she felt relieved, but also empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to put the house straight, making beds and washing dishes, cleaning and tidying; but she could summon up no enthusiasm for it. She was restless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe worried at the problem of what to do with her life, following old arguments around in familiar circles, unable to put her mind to anything else. She again found the cottage claustrophobic. There was a big world out there somewhere, a world of war and heroism, full of colour and people, millions of people; she wanted to be out there in the midst of it, to meet new minds and see cities and hear music. She turned on the radio; a futile gesture. The news broadcast made her feel more isolated, not less. There was a battle report from Italy, the rationing regulations had been eased a little, the London stiletto murderer was still at large, Roosevelt had made a speech. Sandy Macpherson began to play a theatre organ, and Lucy switched off. None of it touched her, she did not live in that world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to get out of the house, in spite of the weather. It would be only a symbolic escape... the stone walls of the cottage were not, after all, what imprisoned her; but the symbol was better than nothing. She collected Jo from upstairs, separating him with some difficulty from a regiment of toy soldiers and wrapped him up in waterproof clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are we going out?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To see if the boat comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it won\u0027t come today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey put bright yellow sou\u0027westers on their heads, lacing them under their chins, and stepped outside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind was like a physical blow, unbalancing Lucy so that she staggered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn seconds her face was as wet as if she had dipped it in a bowl, and the ends of hair protruding from under her hat lay limp and clinging on her cheeks and the shoulders of her oilskin. Jo screamed with delight and jumped in a puddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked along the cliff top to the head of the bay, and looked down at the huge North Sea rollers hurling themselves to destruction against the cliffs and on the beach. The storm had uprooted underwater vegetation from God only knew what depths and flung it in heaps on the sand and rocks. Mother and son became absorbed in the ceaselessly shifting patterns of the waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had done this before; the sea had a hypnotic effect on both of them, and Lucy was never quite sure afterward how long they had spent watching silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts spell this time was broken by something she saw. At first there was only a flash of colour in the trough of a wave, so fleeting that she was not certain what colour it had been, so small and far away that she immediately doubted whether she had seen it at all. She looked for it but did not see it again, and her gaze drifted back to the bay and the little jetty on which flotsam gathered in drifts only to be swept away by the next big wave. After the storm, on the first fine day, she and Jo would go beachcombing to see what treasures the sea had disgorged and come back with oddly coloured rocks, bits of wood of mystifying origin, huge seashells, and twisted fragments of rusted metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the flash of colour again, much nearer, and this time it stayed within sight for a few seconds. It was bright yellow, the colour of all their oilskins. She peered at it through the sheets of rain but could not identify its shape before it disappeared again. Now the current was bringing it closer, as it brought everything to the bay, depositing its rubbish on the sand like a man emptying his trouser pocked onto a table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an oilskin: she could see that when the sea lifted it on the crest of a wave and showed it to her for the third and final time. Henry had come back without his, yesterday, but how had it got into the sea? The wave broke over the jetty and flung the object on the wet wooden boards of the ramp, and Lucy realised it was not Henry\u0027s oilskin, because the owner was still inside it. Her gasp of horror was whipped away by the wind so that not even she could hear it. Who was he? Where had he come from? Another wrecked ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to her that he might still be alive. She must go and see. She bent and shouted in Jo\u0027s ear: \"Stay here. Keep still. Don\u0027t move.\" Then she ran down the ramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway down she heard footsteps behind her. Jo was following her. The ramp was narrow and slippery, quite dangerous. She stopped, turned and scooped the child up in her arms. \"You naughty boy, I told you to wait!\" She looked from the body below to the safety of the clifftop, dithered for a moment in painful indecision, discerned that the sea would wash the body away at any moment, and proceeded downward, carrying Jo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smaller wave covered the body, and when the water receded Lucy was close enough to see that it was a man, and that it had been in the sea long enough for the water to swell and distort the features. Which meant he was dead. She could do nothing for him, and she was not going to risk her life and her son\u0027s to preserve a corpse. She was about to turn back when something about the bloated face struck her as familiar. She stared at it, uncomprehending, trying to fit the features to something in her memory; and then, quite abruptly, she saw the face for what it was, and sheer, paralysing terror took hold of her, and it seemed that her heart stopped, and she whispered, \"No, David, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOblivious now to the danger she walked forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother lesser wave broke around her knees, filling her Wellington boots with foamy saltwater but she didn\u0027t notice. Jo twisted in her arms to face forward. She screamed, \"Don\u0027t look!\" in his ear and pushed his face into her shoulder. He began to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knelt beside the body and touched the horrible face with her hand. David. There was no doubt. He was dead, and had been for some time. Moved by some terrible need to make absolutely certain, she lifted the skirt of the oilskin and looked at the stumps of his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible to take in the fact of the death. She had, in a way, been wishing him dead, but her feelings about him were confused by guilt and the fear of being found out in her infidelity. Grief, horror, relief: they fluttered in her mind like birds, none of them willing to settle. She would have stayed there, motionless, but the next wave was a big one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts force knocked her flying, and she took a great gulp of sea water. Somehow she managed to keep Jo in her grasp and stay on the ramp; and when the surf settled she got to her feet and ran up out of the greedy reach of the ocean. She walked all the way to the clifftop without looking back. When she came within sight of the cottage, she saw the jeep standing outside. Henry was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill carrying Jo, she broke into a stumbling run, desperate to share her hurt with Henry, to feel his arms around her and have him comfort her. Her breath came in ragged sobs and tears mixed invisibly with the rain on her face. She went to the back of the cottage, burst into the kitchen and dumped Jo ungently on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry casually said, \"David decided to stay over at Tom\u0027s another day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, her mind a disbelieving blank; and then, still disbelieving, she understood. Henry had killed David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conclusion came first, like a punch in the stomach, winding her; the reasons followed a split-second later. The shipwreck, the odd-shaped knife he was so attached to, the crashed jeep, the news bulletin about the London stiletto murderer: suddenly everything fitted together, a box of jigsaw pieces thrown in the air and landing, improbably, fully assembled. \"Don\u0027t look so surprised,\" Henry said with a smile. \"They\u0027ve got a lot of work to do over there, although I admit I didn\u0027t encourage him to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom. She had to go to Tom. He would know what to do; he would protect her and Jo until the police came; he had a dog and a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fear was interrupted by a dart of sadness, of sorrow for the Henry she had believed in, had almost loved; clearly he did not exist-she had imagined him. Instead of a warm, strong, affectionate man, she saw in front of her a monster who sat and smiled and calmly gave her invented messages from the husband he had murdered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced herself not to shudder. Taking Jo\u0027s hand, she walked out of the kitchen, along the hall and out of the front door. She got into the jeep, sat Jo beside her, and started the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Henry was there, resting his foot casually on the running board, and holding David\u0027s shotgun. \"Where are you going?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she drove away now he might shoot- hat instinct had warned him to take the gun into the house this time?-and while she herself might chance it, she couldn\u0027t endanger Jo. She said, \"Just putting the jeep away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need Jo\u0027s help for that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He likes the ride. Don\u0027t cross-examine me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him for a moment, wearing David\u0027s hacking jacket and holding David\u0027s gun so casually, and wondered whether he really would shoot her if she simply drove away. And then she recalled the vein of ice she had sensed in him right from the start, and knew that that ultimate commitment, that ruthlessness, would allow him to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an awful feeling of weariness, she threw the jeep into reverse and backed into the barn. She switched off, got out, and walked with Jo back into the cottage. She had no idea what she would say to Henry, what she would do in his presence, how she would hide her knowledge if, indeed, she had not already betrayed it. She had no plans. But she had left the barn door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the place, Number One,\" the captain said, and lowered his telescope. The first mate peered out through the rain and the spray. \"Not quite the ideal holiday resort, what, sir? Jolly stark, I should say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed.\" The captain was an old-fashioned naval officer with a grizzled beard who had been at sea during the first war with Germany. However, he had learned to overlook his first mate\u0027s foppish conversational style, for the boy had turned out against all expectations to be a perfectly good sailor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"boy\" who was past thirty and an old salt by this war\u0027s standards, had no idea of the magnanimity he benefitted from. He held on to a rail and braced himself as the corvette mounted the steep side of a wave, righted itself at the crest and dived into the trough. \"Now that we\u0027re here, sir, what do we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Circle the island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And keep our eyes open for a U-boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not likely to get one anywhere near the surface in this weather and if we did, we couldn\u0027t see it unless it came within spitting distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The storm will blow itself out tonight-tomorrow at the latest.\" The captain began stuffing tobacco into a pipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nautical instinct, I suppose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The weather forecast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corvette rounded a headland, and they saw a small bay with a jetty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove it, on the cliff top, was a little cottage standing small and square, hunched against the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain pointed. \"We\u0027ll land a party there as soon as we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first mate nodded. \"All the same...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Each circuit of the island will take us about an hour, I should say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, unless we\u0027re jolly lucky and happen to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The U-boat will surface, take on its passenger, and submerge again without us even seeing the ripples,\" the captain finished. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain lit his pipe with an expertise that spoke of long experience in lighting pipes in heavy seas. He puffed a few times, then inhaled a lungful of smoke \"Ours not to reason why,\" he said, and blew smoke through his nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A rather unfortunate quotation, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It refers to the notorious charge of the Light Brigade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never knew that.\" The captain puffed away. \"One advantage of being uneducated, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another small cottage at the eastern end of the island. The captain scrutinised it through his telescope and observed that it had a large, professional-looking radio aerial. \"Sparks!\" he called. \"See if you can raise that cottage. Try the Royal Observer Corps frequency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the cottage had passed out of sight, the radio operator called: \"No response, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Sparks,\" the captain said. \"It wasn\u0027t important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crew of the coastguard cutter sat below decks in Aberdeen Harbour playing blackjack for halfpennies and musing on the feeblemindedness that seemed invariably to accompany high rank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twist,\" said Jack Smith, who was more Scots than his name. Albert \"Slim\" Parish, a fat Londoner far from home, dealt him a jack. \"Bust.\" Smith said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim raked in his stake. \"A penny-ha\u0027penny,\" he said in mock wonder \"I only hope I live to spend it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith rubbed condensation off the inside of a porthole and peered out at the boats bobbing up and down in the harbour. \"The way the skipper\u0027s panicking. you\u0027d think we were going to bloody Berlin, not Storm Island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you know? We\u0027re the spearhead of the Allied invasion.\" Slim turned over a ten, dealt himself a king and said, \"Pay twenty-ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith said. \"What is this guy, anyway, a deserter? If you ask me, it\u0027s a job for the military police, not us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim shuffled the pack. \"I\u0027ll tell you what he is-an escaped prisoner of war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, don\u0027t listen to me. But when we pick him up, just take note of his accent.\" He put the cards down. \"Listen, what boats go to Storm Island?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only the grocer,\" someone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the only way he can get back to the mainland is on the grocer\u0027s boat. The military police just have to wait for Charlie\u0027s regular trip to the island, and pick him up when he steps off the boat at this end. There\u0027s no reason for us to be sitting here, waiting to weigh anchor and shoot over there at the speed of light the minute the weather clears, unless...\" He paused melodramatically. \"Unless he\u0027s got some other means of getting off the island.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eye-of-the-needle/page-20.html","bookId":2679,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:56 AM"}
