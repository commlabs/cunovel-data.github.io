I don’t know—Six is pretty good at ass kicking, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine snorts. “Yeah, she was super-badass in her freaking ceiling cocoon. That’s not the point, Johnny. The point is, I need you to tell me what to punch. And I need you to tell me soon or I’m gonna go stir crazy up in here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take another look at Nine’s sketchpad. From the look of it, he probably got right to work on these drawings as soon as we returned from New Mexico. For all his bluster, at least he’s been trying his best to come up with a way to take the fight to the Mogadorians. Meanwhile, I’ve been stuck in this rut, unable to sleep, thinking myself in circles alone on the rooftop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish Henri was here,” I say, “or Sandor. Any of the Cêpans, really. Someone that could tell us what to do next.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, well, they’re dead,” replies Nine, bluntly. “It’s up to us now, and you’re always the one with the ideas. Hell, the last time I wouldn’t go along with your plan, I almost had to throw you off a roof.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a Cêpan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but you’re a freaking know-it-all.” Nine pats me hard on the back, which I’ve come to realize is as close as he gets to real affection. “Quit whining, cut down on the snuggling with your little human girlfriend, and come up with some brilliant plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week ago I would’ve bristled at Nine calling me a whiner and needling me about Sarah. Now, I know he’s just trying to motivate me. This is his version of a pep talk and, embarrassing as it is, I sort of need to hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if I just don’t have a plan?” I ask quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That, John-boy, is simply not an option.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’M BACK ON THE ROOF OF THE JOHN HANCOCK Center. This time, I’m not alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t have to talk about it, if you aren’t ready,” I say gently, looking at the huddled form sitting Indian style on the roof next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla has a blanket wrapped around her shoulders even though it isn’t that cold on the roof. Somehow she looks smaller than usual, and I wonder if stress is causing her to revert back to a younger age. Beneath the blanket she’s wearing one of Nine’s old flannel shirts. It comes all the way down to her knees. Lately, it seems like the only time she’s able to sleep peacefully is in the afternoons. She probably wouldn’t have even gotten out of bed at all today if Marina hadn’t gently prodded her to come up here and talk with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll try,” she says, her voice hard to hear above the wind. “Marina said you might be able to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks, Marina, I think. I’ve barely spoken to Ella one-on-one since we first met in New Mexico. I guess this is a good opportunity to get to know her better, although I wish it was under better circumstances. I badly want to help her; I’m just not sure I know how—I’m hardly an expert on these visions, or a psychiatrist, if that’s what she needs. This is the kind of talk that would normally be left to a Cêpan, but like Nine reminded me earlier, we’re all out of those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to sound confident. “Marina’s right. I’ve had dreams before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dreams about him?” Ella asks, and by the way her voice drops there can be no doubt who she’s talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I reply. “That ugly freak has spent so much time in my head, I should be charging him rent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla smiles a little. She stands up, kicking some loose gravel across the roof. Tentatively, I put my hand on her shoulder. She sighs, almost like it’s a relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It always starts the same way,” Ella begins. “We’re back at that base, fighting Setrákus and his minions. We’re, you know, losing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “Yeah, I remember that part.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I pick up a piece of metal from the floor. I dunno what it is exactly, a broken piece of a sword maybe. When I touch it, it starts glowing in my hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” I say, trying to piece this part together. “Is that what happened or is this just in the dream?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what happened,” she says. “I was scared and just grabbed the first thing I could. My big plan was to just chuck stuff at him until he stopped hitting Nine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From where I was standing, it looked like some kind of dart,” I say, remembering the fight, all the smoke and chaos. “A glowing dart. I thought it was something you got from your Chest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never had a Chest,” Ella replies sullenly. “I guess they forgot to pack me one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ella, do you know what I think?” I’m trying to be comforting, but the excitement is hard to keep out of my voice. “I think you developed a new Legacy back there and we were all too panicked to realize it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla looks down at her hands. “I don’t get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up a handful of the loose stones from the roof and hold them out to her. “I think you did something to that broken piece of sword. And when you hit Setrákus Ra with it, you hurt him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” she replies, not sounding at all thrilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think you could do it again?” I hold the stones out towards her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to,” she answers sharply. “It felt . . . wrong, somehow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were just scared . . . ,” I start, trying to encourage her, but when she takes a step away from me, I realize I’ve made a mistake. She’s still shaken up by the fight, these dreams, her Legacies. I let the stones drop back to the roof. “We all were. It’s okay. We can worry about that later. Finish telling me about the dreams.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s quiet for a moment, and I think maybe she’s withdrawing completely. But, after a moment, she starts again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I throw the piece of metal at him,” she says, “and it sticks inside him. Just like at the base. Except, in my dream, instead of retreating, Setrákus turns to face me. Everyone else—all of you guys—disappear, and it’s just me and him alone in that smoky room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla wraps her arms around herself, shivering. “He pulls the dart out and he smiles at me. Smiles at me with those horrible teeth. I’m stuck standing there like an idiot while he walks over and touches my face. Like, caresses it with the back of his hand. His touch is ice cold. And then he talks to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like shivering too, actually. The thought of Setrákus Ra strolling up to Ella and putting his disgusting hand on her, it turns my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does he say?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um,” she pauses, lowering her voice. “He says, ‘there you are’ and then, ‘I’ve been looking for you.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then what happens?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He—he gets down on his knees.” Her voice drops to a chilled whisper. “He holds one of my hands in both of his, and he asks me if I’ve read the letter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What letter? Do you know what he’s talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla hunches the blanket tighter around her shoulders, not looking at me. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell by the way she answers that Ella isn’t being totally honest. There’s something about this letter—whatever it might be—that’s shaken her up almost as much as these visions of Setrákus Ra. From her description, I don’t know if these dreams are like the ones I’ve had, like the one where Setrákus showed me Sam being tortured to try baiting me into fighting him, or if it’s like Six suggested and these nightmares are simply a result of all the really awful things Ella’s been through lately. I don’t want to press her any further; she already seems close to tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish I could tell you I could make the dreams go away,” I begin, finding myself doing my best Henri impression, “but I can’t. I don’t know what causes them. I only know how painful they can be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla nods, looking disappointed. “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you see him in a dream again, just remember he can’t hurt you. And when he tries to hold your hand, you punch him right in his ugly face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla cracks a smile. “I’ll try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure if anything I said really helped Ella, but one detail from our conversation sticks with me. Whatever she hit Setrákus Ra with, I’m sure that it was the result of her developing a new Legacy. She charged up that projectile and, somehow, it hurt him, or at least distracted him enough that we were able to get our Legacies back. Now I just need to convince her to try doing it again, and hopefully figure out exactly what this new Legacy can do. If it worked once, maybe it will work again. If I’m going to put together a plan to finally kill Setrákus Ra, I’m going to need every weapon we have at my disposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head down to the Lecture Hall, hoping to find something in my Chest or in Nine’s arsenal that might help draw out Ella’s Legacy. I remember when Henri used the warming stone on me to help me first gain control of my Lumen. I wonder if something like that would help Ella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m deep in thought when I hear the muffled sound of gunshots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinch automatically, hunching down, my hands growing hot as my Lumen switches on. It’s instinct. I know the difference between Mog blasters and Nine’s gun collection, which some of the others have taken to practicing with. I also know we’re safe here, at least for now; if the Mogs knew where we were, all of us together, their assault would be a hell of a lot noisier than one gun going off. Even considering all that, my heart is still pounding and I feel ready for a fight. I guess Ella isn’t the only one jumpy from the battle in New Mexico.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push my way through the heavy double doors of the Lecture Hall, my hands glowing dimly because I’m still a little on edge. I’m expecting to find Nine twirling a gun outlaw style into its holster, killing time by shooting up paper targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I find Sarah squeezing off the last round from a small handgun. The bullet tears through the shoulder of a paper Mogadorian hanging at the far end of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not bad,” says Six as she pulls off a pair of noise-canceling headphones. She’s standing next to Sarah, watching over her shoulder. Six uses her telekinesis to pull the paper Mog closer. Most of Sarah’s shots ripped through around the edges, or caught the Mog in the arms and legs. One, however, tore through right between his eyes. Sarah pokes her finger through that hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can do better than this,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not as easy as cheerleading, huh?” Six asks good-naturedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah unloads her spent cartridge and jams home a fresh one. “You’ve obviously never tried a full layout twist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t even know what that is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching this scene play out, I feel suddenly and inexplicably nervous. Admittedly, there’s something about her waving a gun around that makes Sarah hot in a dangerous way that I’d never really considered. But it also makes me feel guilty, like I’m the reason she’s stuck here taking target practice instead of being back in Paradise, living a normal life. Plus, there’s the fact that I haven’t mentioned kissing Six to Sarah, or even talked about it with Six, and now here the two of them are, hanging out. I know I should come clean about that to Sarah. Eventually. When she’s not carrying a loaded weapon, maybe. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-fall-of-five-lorien-legacies-4/page-6.html","bookId":1678,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:59 AM"}
