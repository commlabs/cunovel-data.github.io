I wonder if I’ll ever stop feeling like this from his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA big part of me hopes not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m glad I did now, if it meant getting a welcome like that,” he grins. He’s being all flirty again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just hanging around the hotel, so I thought I’d come … sorry I couldn’t come in the airport to meet you … you know,” he shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” He’d have probably been recognised and mobbed in ten seconds flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be pretty hard being a prisoner of your own success. Never able to go anywhere alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA simple thing like walking through an airport alone would probably mean the world to him if he was able to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave gets in the driver’s seat, turns the engine on and the radio comes to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my seat belt on, using one hand, as Jake doesn’t seem willing to let go of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How was your flight?” Jake asks, as we start moving out of the airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was awesome thanks to you – did you know you get free champagne in first class … of course you know …” I peter off at his amused expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You make me laugh.” He squeezes my hand, rubbing his thumb over my skin, continuously leaving a delicious trail wherever it goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a good way, I hope?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Always in a good way.” He turns his head to the side, directing a fixed look at me. I shiver inside, looking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re quiet for a moment, before Jake says anything more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I spoke to your dad last week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did!” My face nearly cracks with the smile on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips quirk up at the corner. “Yeah, he called to thank me for the donation…” He lifts an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?!” I say innocently. “You never said it was a secret. You just said you didn’t want him thinking you were a flashy bastard – and he didn’t.” I push my lips out into a pout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, laughing at my expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you talked?” I probe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We did, it was good to talk to him after all these years. He’s still just the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You talk music?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” He slides me an amused look. “So I brought something for you,” he says, changing tact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reaches into his jean pocket, pulling something back out. I recognise it instantly. It’s the friendship bracelet I made him all those years ago. It’s a little frayed, the white, black and blue fabric faded slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you actually kept it.” My words come out with my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You thought I was lying?” He screws his face up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! I’m just surprised … hang-on.” I let go off his hand and reach forward into my bag in the foot-well, unzipping in the inside pocket to I get what I’m looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friendship bracelet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brought mine with me too. I put it in my carry on; I didn’t want it in my suitcase in case it got lost in transit. This bracelet is irreplaceable, so I wanted it safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know why I brought it, we hadn’t arranged to. I guess I just hoped he would have his with him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he has … I can’t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I brought mine too,” I say holding my hand out, showing it to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine is exactly the same as his – in my geekdom I made us matching ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares down at it, then lifting his eyes to mine, smiles and says, “Great minds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is flopping around in my chest like a fish out of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old were we when you made these?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So they’re like … sixteen years old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Practically antiques,” I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake takes hold of my hand and pushes the platinum chainmail bracelet that Will bought me, further up my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removes my friendship bracelet from my hand, placing it on his leg. Then I watch as he takes his own friendship bracelet and slips it on over my hand and tightens it to fit around my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he picks mine up, loosening it, he puts it his own arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out the breath I didn’t realise I was holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t ever take it off,” he says, voice deep with meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not even to shower?” I swallow down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not even to shower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’ll keep yours on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Always.” He takes hold of my hand again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my heart leaps out of my chest, then thuds its way back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rest back in the seat. I’m going to have to be so careful. Jake is a naturally tactile person, incredibly sweet, and obviously happy to have me back in his life as his friend again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to have to be very careful to not confuse this with him having any feelings for me, in that way. And also to make sure I don’t let my own feelings get confused too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talk all the way back to the hotel, and Jake points things out to me, important buildings and sites, as we drive through this amazing city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave parks the car in the hotel lot; we’re staying at the Grand Hotel Stockholm. And grand is how it most certainly looks from the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we arrive there is a guy waiting for us in the parking lot, seemingly expecting our arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake introduces me to him as Ben. He’s one of Jake’s other security guys. He works under Dave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity seems a little tighter for Jake here. Maybe it’s because of the hype of the tour, brings the crazies out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen, I’d guess, is in his early thirties and attractive in a Jason Statham kind of way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow along with the three men, Ben wheeling my suitcase for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all ride in silence up in the lift, getting out on the top floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow Jake down the hall, Dave and Ben behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake stops outside a door and produces a key card from his back pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is your room for the next few days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens the door and I step through. I actually gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t a room. It’s a bloody suite. And a huge one at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” Jake says to Ben and Dave. “I got it from here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen parks up my suitcase just inside the room and closes the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly turn around to face Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jake this is awesome … but it’s too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All the suites on the floor are the same size,” he shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m just one person, I don’t need all this room.” I wave my arms around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So am I, and I’m staying in one exactly the same as this.” He seems a little irked by my statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just …” I can’t seem to find the right words. I run my fingers through my hair. “Are all your staff staying in suites like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe meets my eyes. “Tom, Denny, Stuart, Smith and Dave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the rest?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the floors below.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In normal sized rooms … rooms that are just that – one room and a bathroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, slowly, not moving his eyes from mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should be in one of those rooms, Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks little annoyed now, and also a little hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not trying to sound ungrateful, Jake, but the first class at the airport, and now this … I don’t want you spending money on me like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe folds his arms. “It’s my money; I can do what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but …” I’m at a loss to find a plausible and strong enough argument against him. “I just don’t want to piss your other staff off when they find out I’m staying in such a lovely suite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face lightens. “Tru, you won’t piss anyone off, it’s not in you to be able to do so, and anyway you’re important. You’re writing my bio, so I have to keep you sweet so you write nice things about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahh, so that’s what all this niceness has been about.” I kink my eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins. “Not at all, but if it gets you to stay in this room with no complaint, then I’m sticking with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suite … not room,” I correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever,” he waves me off. “So you wanna unpack first or do you wanna meet the guys now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at my suitcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmm, let me think unpack or meet rock stars…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meet the guys,” I beam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get too excited,” he frowns. “They’re uglier in real life than they look in their pictures.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you jealous, Jake Wethers?” I tease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me – jealous? Never. Come on.” He opens the door. “I left those idiots in my room draining my mini-bar when I came to get you, knowing those greedy bastards they’ll still be there, saving their own for later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear the male voices laughing and joking as we approach Jake’s door. I get a little ball of nervous energy in my tummy the closer we get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am, in a few seconds, about to be standing in a room with some of the best musicians the world currently has to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to be in a room with The Mighty Storm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d have to be crazy not to be a little excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake opens his door, allowing me through first, putting me immediately in the living room and I see the guys all sitting around the dining table, playing cards, drinking beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tru, this is Denny.” Jake stands behind me, he places his hand on my lower back and points over my shoulder at a dark haired guy, who is very cute, and who of course I instantly recognise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven distracted by Denny, I still tense under Jake’s touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Denny – this is Tru, my old friend from Manchester, and biographer for the tour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey Tru, it’s great to finally meet you,” Denny smiles at me, running his hand through his short haired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally meet me? So Jake’s already told him about me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he has dopey, you are their biographer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” I smile nervously at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And this is Smith, our session guitarist who is playing lead for us on the tour.” Jake points at the only person in the room I don’t recognise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sweet baby Jesus, he is gorgeous. Long, messy blonde hair and dark green eyes. He looks like a surfer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Smith says in a Southern drawl giving me a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s married,” Jake whispers in my ear. I feel his fingers tense against my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at Jake, wanting to ask him what the hell he meant by that with a look, but he’s not looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And not forgetting, Tom,” Jake says pulling my eyes away from him and back across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom has his back to me, but of course I instantly recognise him the second he turns around in his seat to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom has light-brown hair, shaved close, and he is covered in tattoos, just like Jake. He is really good-looking, not my type, his face is a little to round for my liking; I like my men a little more chiselled, but I can certainly see the allure for the women who love him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mighty-storm-the-storm-1/page-17.html","bookId":1998,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:44 PM"}
