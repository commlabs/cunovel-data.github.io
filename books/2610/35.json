It will minimize scarring.” She extended a hand to help me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for it, then paused. “Mab, look.” My jacket was a tattered mass of ribbons, except for one spot untouched by cuts and slashes. “The Morfran left my demon mark alone. It was the Destroyer. Pryce released the Morfran, and the Destroyer used our bond to call it to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inspected the jacket, looking thoughtful. “That does seem likely.” I groaned as she helped me to my feet. The pain had diminished, but I still felt like I’d lost a fight with a giant cheese grater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab put an arm around my shoulders, and I leaned on her. Together, we made our way across the lawn. As I limped past the fallen slate tile, I thought about the Morfran locked inside. It gave a whole new meaning to the phrase “a murder of crows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE MORFRAN’S USUAL TARGET, BUT I sure looked like a zombie as I staggered into the house in my torn blood-covered clothes, slashed and gouged from head to toe. When she saw me, Rose screamed and covered her face with her apron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get the comfrey salve in the blue jar,” Mab instructed her. “Bring it to Vicky’s room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose’s wide eyes appeared over the edge of the apron. She nodded vigorously and scurried off toward the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab helped me up the stairs. It was hard going at first, but by the time we made it halfway up the second staircase, I was managing by myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose had left the jar of salve on my bedroom dresser. Mab helped me undress, which was harder and more painful than it sounds, because my clothes stuck to my newly formed scabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do your back,” she said. “Then I’ll leave you to take care of the rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe salve felt like a blessing on my skin. As Mab spread it on, a tingly coolness washed away the burning. When Mab left and I took over, the wounds closed almost as I watched. Gouges filled in and smoothed over without a scar. Good stuff. I wondered if it worked on regular wounds or just the kind inflicted by bloodthirsty, demonic crows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped the shreds of my clothes into the wastebasket, then took a long, hot shower. I dried off, marveling at the wholeness of my skin, put on a clean sweater and jeans, and felt good, almost back to normal. I was even hungry. I went downstairs to see what was for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab waited for me in the dining room. For a large, formal manor house, Maenllyd’s dining room was surprisingly intimate. A small chandelier hung over the round table, which seated four. French windows overlooked the terrace and lawn, although now the drapes, moss-green and cream stripes, were drawn. The walls were cream above mahogany wainscoting. The buffet was also mahogany. Gilt-framed landscapes of the green Welsh hills hung on two walls. Mab sat at the table, holding an empty sherry glass. Although her pursed-lip expression didn’t change when she saw me, a light came into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you feeling, child?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better. Amazingly so. I want some of that salve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shall have some. Although I don’t think you’ll need it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I sat down, Rose appeared in the doorway, carrying a tray. She beamed a smile at me. “Oh, Miss Vicky, you’re looking well now. I do hope you’re hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For your cooking, Rose, always.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile broadened as she set down the tray and served up two bowls of cawl, a Welsh stew made of lamb, bacon, leeks, potatoes, and whatever other veggies Rose had to toss in. Nobody cooked like Rose. She’d written down some recipes for me in the past, but since my acquaintance with my own kitchen was limited to knowing which drawer held the can opener, I’d never been able to reproduce them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab poured herself a glass of red wine and held up the carafe, eyebrows raised. I shook my head. We both seemed reluctant to say anything. The subject of the Morfran attack sat between us like an impossible pink rhinoceros that had plunked itself down in the middle of the table. So we talked of other things. I told Mab about Tina and how she’d given up being my apprentice to pursue a career as a zombie pop star, and Mab got me up to speed on the village gossip. Then she asked a question that made me choke on my stew: “And what of you? Surely you’re seeing a young man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped my mouth with my napkin, like that would do something about the heat rising in my face. In all my life, Mab had never asked me such a question. Never. I didn’t want her to ask it now. But in my world, when Aunt Mab asked something, I answered. Truthfully. “Um, two, actually. Sort of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her wineglass, took a sip, and replaced it on the table. “Tell me about them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Okay,” I said, trying to look nonchalant despite my scarlet face. “Well, there’s Alexander Kane. We’ve dated off and on for a couple of years. He’s a lawyer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And a werewolf, yes? Active in promoting paranormal rights in the States? I’ve heard of his work.” U.K. laws about paranormals were more enlightened than America’s hodgepodge of wildly varying state regulations. And the European Union was using U.K. policies as a model for its own draft policy for paranormal rights. Here, paranormal rights were a given, and people watched Kane’s progress stateside with a combination of admiration and bemusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “That’s Kane. He’s all about work. And that’s our problem—we never see each other. He’s been in Washington for three months, but even when he’s home our schedules keep us apart.” I felt a pang as I said it. “When we do get together, half the time we’re arguing. I mean, I like him, but he can be politically correct and just plain pigheaded.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab raised her napkin to her lips, but she wasn’t quick enough to hide the smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, so I can be pigheaded, too. Occasionally. But maybe that means we’re not a good match.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And your other young man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daniel Costello. He’s human, a homicide detective. When Maria was kidnapped, he helped me rescue her. And he saw me shift—believe me, that wasn’t pretty—and still wanted to know me afterward.” I swallowed a spoonful of stew, then shrugged. “But I don’t know him very well. And he’s not used to being around paranormals. He’s trying, but …” Okay, there’d been that one toe-curling kiss. But there were even more awkward moments. “I feel like he’s way too careful around me. One time, we were out together and a sip of my drink went down my windpipe. I had a coughing fit. When it passed, he was gripping the edge of the table, looking like he expected me to shift into God-knows-what at any second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab laughed, and I looked up in surprise. Her eyes twinkled. “Don’t be too quick to judge, child. Human or otherwise, it takes time for two people to understand each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. But maybe we’re too different. In his world, I’m a liability. His boss hates paranormals—I don’t want him to get fired because of me.” I’d spent more than enough time entertaining Mab with the lowdown on my personal life. “Anyway, there it is. My lack of a love life, in a nutshell. Two guys, and neither is destined to be my soul mate.” Not that I needed a soul mate, or even wanted one. “Can we please change the subject?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relationships are important, child. For you especially, I think. Don’t take them lightly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, come on. This was Aunt Mab, not Dear Abby. I’d listen to anything she had to say about fighting demons, but I didn’t need her advice on relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? I’m not going to take Gwen’s path—settle down and raise a family. I thought you of all people would understand. You’ve always told me that demon fighting takes complete dedication. That’s how you’ve lived. Why should my life be any different?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Mab’s face that reddened. “Do not assume you know everything about me.” Her voice was gentle, but her words stung with rebuke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what Pryce said, that there are all kind of things I don’t know about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so there are.” She toyed with the stem of her empty wineglass. “He probably told you I’m older than I appear. That’s true; some of our kind are blessed with extraordinary longevity. But it doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be young.” Her eyes went unfocused, like she was gazing far into the past. She blinked and pushed her glass away. “Forgive me, child. Tonight’s attack frightened me, and I know so little about your life. If I’d lost you …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t finish the thought, because Rose bustled in to clear the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ready for dessert? I made your favorite, Miss Vicky: chocolate-toffee trifle. Would you like tea or coffee to go with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coffee, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I know you’ll be wanting a nice cup of tea, Miss Mab.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Rose. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in silence while Rose was in the kitchen. I felt like a self-centered jerk. When did I bother to get in touch with Mab? When I needed something from her. I never called to say hi or ask how she was doing or tell her my news. She wasn’t asking about my love life out of nosiness; she was asking because I never told her a damn thing. I’d known Kane for three years, dated him for two, and tonight was the first time I’d mentioned his name to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it had never occurred to me, ever, to ask Mab about her life. I thought I knew her so well, but all I knew was the teacher, the role model, the authority figure. She’d always been there, eternal and permanent, like the State House in Boston. Now, she studied her hands, neatly folded on the table. What was she thinking about? Her long-ago youth? Maybe a lost love? How would I have the slightest clue if I never asked?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mab—” I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hush, child.” She patted my hand, briskly. “You must overlook my moment of weakness. And we must not lose our focus on the task at hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose, still in bustling mode, reentered the room, carrying a tray that looked bigger than she was. It was laden with a silver coffeepot, Mab’s favorite teapot, an entire trifle, plus cream and sugar and the cups, dishes, and silverware required to consume it all. I jumped up to help, but Rose had already eased the tray onto the buffet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hellforged-deadtown-2/page-35.html","bookId":2610,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:26 PM"}
