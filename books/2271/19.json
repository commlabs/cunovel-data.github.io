I’ll introduce myself,” Jed told Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith nodded distractedly and looked at his watch. “Great. If you need anything else…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won’t be bothering you, Jed thought. “Thanks,” he said aloud as Smith turned and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan McDuff looked up and frowned when he saw Jed approaching. “Hi,” he said when Jed reached the table. The pretty redhead at his side looked up curiously, and Dan made the introductions. “Marcie, this is my old friend Jed Braden. Jed, Marcie McDonnagh, one of my co-workers. Jed, what the hell are you doing here?” Dan frowned. “Are you…are you working on the last…?” He didn’t say the word murder, but he might as well have, because the word seemed to hang in the air, anyway. “But…you’re not a cop anymore.” He seemed truly puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m working it from the private sector,” Jed explained, and looked down at Marcie, who grew pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit down,” Marcie said. “I’ll tell you what I told the cops. I ran into Patti Jo after her shift. We talked about going to a Halloween party on the thirty-first, after we got off. She was in a good mood. Then she headed to the employee parking lot, and that was the last time I saw her.” Tears suddenly welled in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Marcie,” Jed told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She wasn’t stupid!” Marcie blurted out. “She wouldn’t have gone off with a stranger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marcie, it’s all right,” Dan murmured, looking helplessly at Jed. There was a slight spark of irritation in his eyes, as if he were saying, She’s already been through this with the cops. Just how bad do you want to make her feel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honest to God, she just wouldn’t have gone off with a stranger or with anyone she didn’t trust,” Marcie said. “Oh, my God! I have a shift tonight,” she said, as if she’d just realized it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too,” Dan told her. “So I’ll walk you to your car, and I’ll follow you home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Point me to the employee parking lot?” Jed said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan nodded. “I’ll do better. I’ll take you to the exit Patti Jo used and point the way to the lot where they found her car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcie gave him a hug before they left. Were the two of them just friends? Jed wondered. Or more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs at all the parks, the hall was part of an entire network that ran underground, so the comings and goings of the employees never had to intrude on the excitement above. The walls were painted with creatures, some friendly-looking, others grotesque, to indicate which section of the park they were beneath, and the corridors seemed to go on forever, with doors to dressing, locker, meeting and dining rooms along the way, as well as storage rooms and offices. Sometimes the halls were empty. Sometimes they were passed by a horde of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally they reached the door Patti Jo had used, which opened onto a huge parking lot enclosed by a fence. In the distance, Jed could see a guardhouse at the gate. Surrounding the lot were trees, nothing but trees. The new park had been built far enough away from the other parks that it was practically in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you know her well?” Jed asked Dan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty well,” Dan said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was nice. She got along with everyone.” His voice hardened. “But like Marcie said, she wasn’t a fool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So…she walked out to the parking lot and she wasn’t seen again until she was found off the highway?” Jed murmured to himself as they headed back to the cafeteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s scary, huh?” Dan said, studying Jed. “What do you think it is, then? The ghost of Beau Kidd, come back to kill again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think ghosts commit murder,” Jed told him. “But then again, what the hell do I know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I can help in any way…” Dan offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is personal for me now, you know?” Dan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Jed agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men said goodbye outside the cafeteria. Jed looked inside before he left. Marcie McDonnagh was still sitting where they had left her. A redhead. Jed could almost picture her lying on the autopsy table, just as Patti Jo had been today, as Sherri Mason had been earlier….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedheads. Beautiful redheads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere they all interchangeable in the killer’s mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore softly, afraid. As soon as he could get a signal, he flipped open his cell phone and called Christina’s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran for his car and started driving as quickly as he could in her direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrrational? Hell, yes. But a sense of dread was growing within him, and he was powerless against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“H a,” Christina said, opening her front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiller, woofing loudly, ran in ahead of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a dog now!” she called out. “A ferocious dog. He will bark and rip out the throat of anyone who dares to sneak in to play a prank on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer from inside, not that she’d really expected there to be. In fact, as she entered, she couldn’t help but feel slightly foolish, especially because there was nothing out of order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a soft sigh, following the dog through the house. He was curious and wanted to explore everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they finished the circuit, she set down a bowl of water for him in the kitchen. Killer lapped up a bit, then stared at her, his tail wagging a thousand beats a minute. “So, you like it here?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wagged his tail some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, and Killer gave one sharp bark, as if in warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello?” she said, picking up the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiller barked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s me. Dan. What the hell was that?” her cousin demanded over the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dog?” he said with a groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to love him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. I’m going to love some big, slobbering beast that will eat my shoes if I step out of them,” Dan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll love him, trust me,” Christina said. “So, what’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just calling to check up on you. You didn’t answer your cell when I just tried you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, I left my bag in the front hall when I came in,” she told him. “So what has you so worried?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him let out a long sigh. “Didn’t you hear about the latest victim?” he finally asked. “Christie, she worked here. I knew her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Dan, I’m so sorry,” Christina said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m worried sick about you and Ana now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be. We’re smart, and careful and now I have a dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You gonna be around later? I worked the early shift today, so I’ve got some time before I have to go back for my Grim Reader duties.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be here. Come on by if you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jed was here earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seems he thinks he’s a detective again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is, a private detective. I guess he’s wondering if the case was ever really solved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Well, you take care, understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up, but she had barely replaced the receiver before the phone rang again. This time it was her cousin Mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Christie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. What’s up, Mike?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing, just calling to see if you’re okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m great. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glad to hear it. Um…you don’t have any late nights planned, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I don’t. And yes, I know another woman was killed. But guess what? I bought a dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know. Woof, woof.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. I guess. A big one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His name is Killer. You’ll have to come meet him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do that. Seriously…you need to be careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will. I promise. Dan’s going to come by later to meet Killer. Why don’t you come, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. If I can get out of here at a reasonable hour. Listen…” His voice trailed away. “Take care, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rang off and stared at Killer, who was still madly wagging his tail. He cocked his head at her, and she let out a sigh. She had gotten her dog, but it was too late now to get a locksmith out until tomorrow. Not that it mattered. The only two people who had keys to the house were her cousins. Who loved her. Who were worried about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still going to have the locks changed, she decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for tonight…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have Killer,” she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at her as if he were hanging on her every word. Then his tail stopped wagging and he began to bark like a mad thing before he turned and raced toward the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he ran, she heard the doorbell chime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strode to the door and looked out. She felt as if her heart caught in her throat, then was annoyed with herself for the pleasure that swept through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told herself not to get carried away. He was Ana’s cousin. It only made sense—especially after last night—that he felt obliged to check up on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all right, Killer,” she murmured as she opened the door. He stood by her side, wagging his tail but still barking maniacally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh, it’s all right,” she told the dog again. “Jed, what a surprise. Come on in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJed stared at the dog, then stared at her. “Killer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you coming in?” she demanded with a sigh, then started for the parlor without waiting for an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed, but not before closing and locking the door in his wake. He found Christina sitting on the piano bench, but she indicated that he should take one of the comfortable wing chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he did so, Killer jumped onto his lap, tail wagging as he tried to shower Jed with kisses. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-seance-harrison-investigation-5/page-19.html","bookId":2271,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:57 PM"}
