I could scarcely believe it, but he felt even better than he looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was careful to keep my chest from touching his back as I reached around to rub his abs. It was only fair…and I was dying to know how they felt. I’d never touched six pack abs before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut my eyes, leaning into him, as I kneaded at his hard flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now you’re helping him put some on his belly, boo?” Mat shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, peeka,” I said, flushing hotly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped away from Tristan, handing him the bottle of sunscreen so he could finish putting it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t look at him, taking a few brisk steps, and diving into the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both made a good show of ignoring those brief moments of contact, but I couldn’t seem to get my mind off how good he’d felt, or how amazing it had felt to let him touch me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe swam for hours, playing and frolicking in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTristan was great with the boys, throwing them around the pool just how they liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted a giggling Ivan above his head before dropping him into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan resurfaced, laughing. He pointed at Tristan. “I bet you can’t do that to Danika!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bet me?” Tristan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I dare you!” Ivan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTristan arched one sassy brow, sidling over to where I was working with Mat on his backstroke. I yelped as he gripped his big hands around my waist, lifting me before I could think to put up a fight. He didn’t throw me, as he had Ivan, but lifted me high, thrusting his head between my legs, and settling me onto his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrabbled for a handhold, trying to grip his too-short hair, finally settling for a hold under his chin. My thighs clenched hard around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ivan dared me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t say no to a dare, can you? Even if it comes from an eight-year old?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged his shoulders, jostling me until I clutched him harder, screeching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess not,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I dare you to drop her!” Ivan called, the little traitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTristan didn’t hesitate, lifting me by the hips, holding me high over the water for a brief moment, then dropping me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came up sputtering and glaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started thinking hard about how to get even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sliding glass door opened, and Jerry leaned out. “I’m running errands, boys. Anyone want to join me? I might just be getting ice cream while I’m out…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat was climbing out of the pool before Jerry had even finished. Ivan paused for a moment, considering. Finally, he chose ice cream, bolting out of the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry waved at us as the boys ran inside. “I’ve got them for the afternoon, so, have fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved back, still plotting about how I could dunk Tristan under water. He was just so big…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry ducked back inside, and we were left alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTristan smiled at me, leaning back, and propping his arms up along the side of the pool. He sank low, watching me, and I saw my chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glided over to him, trying hard to look perfectly innocent. I moved close, getting right up in his personal space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched me, swallowing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid my arms around his neck, brushing my hands over his hair. I leaned in very close, and his breath caught, but he didn’t stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straddled him, hooking my legs behind his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing, Danika?” he asked roughly, looking almost panicked, but still, he didn’t stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m daring you,” I began, gripping the backs of his massive arms, “to go under!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took his legs out from under him, yanking his arms away from the side of the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went under, but then again, so did I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maneuver also had the troublesome side effect of shoving his face between my breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t come up right away, instead wrapping his arms around my waist and keeping his face right where it was. When he stood, he took me with him. I laughed as he began a wet motorboat between my breasts. I yanked at his short hair to no avail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally tilted his head back, laughing up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both stopped laughing abruptly as he lowered me, and my body slid along his. There was a brief moment of contact between my sex and his. He was hard. We both gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed away, and he let me, taking a step back himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bad idea,” I said breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he agreed, running a hand over his wet hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess we’re done here. You can shower first,” I told him, since we were sharing a bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” he said, lifting himself out of the water with one smooth move. He wrapped a towel around his hips as he moved toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just let me know when you’re done. I’ll wait out here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already at the door, sliding it open. He kept his back to me as he gave one short nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed in the pool, trying not to panic. So we were attracted to each other. It didn’t mean anything. We were two grown-ups who could control ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t even want to have sex. Sex had never been good for me. For me, at its best, it had been a way to stay connected to someone that I wanted to feel intimate with. It was a sad fact that if I really wanted to get off, I had to take things into my own hands, and not just when I was single.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea why I couldn’t seem to keep my hands to myself when it came to Tristan. It was a new problem for me. I felt hot and bothered as I never had before. I decided to make a short appointment with my vibrator in the very near future. It could only help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swam laps, trying to blow off steam, and give Tristan enough time to shower and change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was breathless and exhausted when I stopped. I started as I saw that Tristan was standing over the pool, dry and dressed in a white T-shirt and some gray athletic shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shower’s all yours,” he said, watching me, his expression blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved to get out of the water, and he met me at the steps with a towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to go workout,” he said as I dried off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just nodded. He’d made good use of Bev’s home gym in the short week he’d been staying at the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feel free to come and join me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again. “I might. I need to wash the chlorine out of my hair, and do a few things first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” he said, walking back into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t tell if he was out of sorts, or just in a quiet mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showered, and changed into a comfortable T-shirt and some shorts. I started to head to the home gym when I changed my mind, turning around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Tristan was on to something with his frequent showers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith kids underfoot, I kept my vibrator at the back of the drawer in my nightstand, wrapped in a sock that was wrapped in a T-shirt. It was very well hidden, since I did not want to have a conversation about that with the boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut and locked my bedroom door, turned on some music, slipped out of my shorts and panties, and grabbed the neglected toy out of my nightstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprawled out on my bed, closing my eyes. I pictured Tristan as I set to work on myself with the small vibrating wand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pictured his massive arms as I worked my T-shirt up, cupping my breast. I visualized his sinister smile as I kneaded the flesh around my nipple. I was already wet. I thought of his golden eyes as I pushed the wand inside of me, shivering in pleasure as the vibrations rocked me. I pulled it out and moaned as I touched it to my clit, imagining his body, with those perfect abs, and that ripped chest. I remembered that brief touch of his erection against me, pushing the toy inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt usually took me a long time to relax and let go enough to come, but I wasn’t having any trouble just then, my race toward the finish faster than I could ever remember. I was letting myself relax into a climax when there was a knock at my bedroom door. I tensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Danika?” Tristan called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, letting that deep voice wash over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?” I answered breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You coming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I nearly moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s taking so long?” he questioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Almost there,” I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause from the other side of the door. “What are you doing?” he asked, his voice rougher now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t answer, something about that rough tone setting me off. I grabbed a corner of my blanket, biting it to stifle my moans as I climaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I come in?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him try the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need a minute,” I told him, just lying there, my heart still racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said, almost too quiet for me to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was decent but flustered when I finally opened my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTristan was just standing there, hands on his hips, eyes on the floor. He looked up, then craned his neck to look into my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everything okay?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I said, mostly meaning it. I did feel more relaxed than I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We working out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Let me just tie my hair back, and grab my shoes. I’ll meet you there in a minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe startled me by tipping my chin up with his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hummed low in his throat, and I about lost it. It was the sexiest noise I’d ever heard. “Fuck, Danika, I know that look. Were you taking your own version of a ‘shower’ in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a while to catch his meaning. My cheeks flushed red, but I was too stubborn not to meet his gaze squarely. I firmed my jaw, leaning away from his hand. “And what if I was? You think you’re the only one that needs a ‘shower’ every once in a while?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed taken aback by that. “No. I didn’t—I don’t think that. I’m sorry, you just caught me off guard. That’s…way too fucking hot. Excuse me.” He turned around and started walking back down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We still on for a workout?” I called to his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell yes,” he called back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was jogging on the treadmill for a good forty-five minutes before he said another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped down from doing a long round of pull-ups that I pretended I wasn’t counting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe approached the front of my machine, studying my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, um,” he finally spoke, clearing his throat, “how often do you need to, uh, take a ‘shower’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent him an arch look, but my heart was pounding harder at his question. “Is this a friendly conversation?” I asked, breathing hard, from the workout, and the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled his most troublesome smile. “We’re friends, aren’t we? Of course it’s friendly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No funny business?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None at all. Just pretend I’m one of the girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbidden, my gaze ran down his body. By sheer force of will, I returned my eyes to his face. One of the girls, my ass…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t need to do it often,” I admitted. “Nothing like what you need to do. I go weeks without needing to. Hell, sometimes I go months.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-things-tristan-danika-1/page-11.html","bookId":1929,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM"}
