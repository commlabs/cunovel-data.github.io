And though it have luckily enough happen’d, for the most part, that the Omission of them does not marr the Coh?rence of the rest; yet till the next design’d Edition afford an opportunity of inserting them, it is thought fit that the Printer give notice of one Omission at the End of the first Dialogue; and that to these Errata there be annex’d the ensuing sheet of Paper, that was casually lost, or forgotten by him that should have put it into the Presse; where it ought to have been inserted, in the 187. printed Page, at the break, betwixt the words, [Nature] in the 13th. line, and [But] in the next line after. Though it is to be noted here, that by the mistake of the Printer, in some Books, the number of 187 is placed at the top of two somewhat distant pages; and in such copies the following addition ought to be inserted in the latter of the two, as followeth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The missing material has been relocated to the correct place in the text.\n\u003cbr\u003e Errata.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Printer\u0027s Errata have been corrected in the text.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Publisher doth advertise the Reader, that seeing there are divers Experiments related in this Treatise, which the Author is not unwilling to submit to the consideration also of Forraign Philosophers, he believes this piece will be very soon translated into Latin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe End\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1411/42360.html","bookId":1392,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:09:17 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:09:17 AM"}
