Since leaving Portland, she’d collected four voice messages: one from her mother; another from Whitney Stone, a reporter who had dogged her before she’d entered the hospital; a third from Holly Dennison, who was a set designer and, if not a friend, an acquaintance; and the last, she noted, biting her lower lip, was from Trent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother had asked her to call, Whitney wanted to meet, and Holly had said, “Hey, I’m in LA. I think I saw you at the airport. Give me a call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it had been Trent’s turn. “It’s me,” and the timbre of his voice touched a forbidden part of her heart. “Jenna called. She’s worried. Wants to know what’s going on with you. She said you were in the airport or taking a trip.” A pause. Cassie held her breath. “Give me a call when you can. Or her.” Another pause and then her undoing, “Take care, Cass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As if you give a crap,” she whispered, her throat instantly thick. That was the problem. If Trent showed her any hint of kindness whether heartfelt or fake, it got to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe erased all the messages, then checked her texts. Again, one from that reporter, Whitney Stone, asking to meet. No way. Not when Whitney Stone produced and reported for her own tell-all television show, a blend of Hollywood gossip and unsolved mysteries. Rumor had it Justice: Stone Cold was already in production with the Allie Kramer disappearance story. Cassie wanted no part of it. Delete! Another from her mother asking her to call. Delete. A third was from Holly, suggesting they get together since they were both in town. That message she didn’t immediately delete. Since Holly had worked on Dead Heat and was an acquaintance of Allie’s, it made sense to meet her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Cassie hesitated. She sipped the coffee, watched people hurrying in and out of the coffee shop, or sitting like she was, laptop on the table or phone in hand or both as they drank from paper cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late afternoon now, a few clouds creating a haze over the lowering sun. She needed a plan. She’d left the hospital with no clear idea of what to do, how to locate Allie, how to go forward with her life. Her first impulse had been to check out Allie’s apartment in Portland, fly south, grab her own things and her car, and snoop around a little down here, see what she could dig up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now as the sun sank lower in the sky and she watched the little birds pluck at bits of scones and whatever dropped near the tables, she wondered what her next move was. She knew she’d probably return to Portland, if only temporarily, as that was where, presumably, Allie had last been seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the police, you were the last person known to see her before she’d disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me about that night,” Detective Rhonda Nash had asked in the stuffy, cinder-block interrogation room. In her forties, Cassie had guessed, she wore short, frosted hair that spiked above an oval face with no apparent laugh lines. Her gray suit was crisp, her open-throated blouse pressed. From the way she’d held herself, Cassie guessed Detective Nash was no stranger to the gym. “The last night you were with your sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing much to tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you discuss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The movie,” Cassie had said. “We were both involved in Dead Heat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was the star.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind rimless glasses, dark eyes had stared pointedly at Cassie, who guessed the detective had been searching for a reaction. “Yes.” This was a fact the whole world knew, an unnecessary question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you had, what? Four lines?” Had there been an underlying sneer in her question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Cassie had nodded as she’d somehow managed to keep her irritation from showing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s become a pretty big name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie had waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you talked about the movie.” She’d glanced down at her notes. “What was the nature of the discussion?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were both a little upset that we had to return to shoot the final scene.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-29.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
