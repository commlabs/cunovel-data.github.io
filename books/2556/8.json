Why should that make any difference to him? Whatever the reason, his tone has definitely changed. He\u0027s suddenly more serious and direct. He left the van momentarily to speak to someone, then came back and pulled the door shut. It\u0027s suffocatingly hot in here now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about her, Danny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t like this. I\u0027ll drip-feed him information and find out why he wants to know. Years of living in the old world have taken their toll, and my guard is up. Part of me can\u0027t help wondering whether I\u0027ve managed to stumble on the last remaining pedophile ring in existence. When I don\u0027t answer he asks another question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just turned five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think you know where she might be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly,\" I answer quickly. I can afford to give him some vague details. Even if I knew exactly where Ellis was, I could tell him anything. He doesn\u0027t know anything about her. He doesn\u0027t know what she looks like. Christ, I haven\u0027t even told him her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She somewhere near here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston leans over to the front seat and picks up a map, which he unfolds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not telling you anything until you tell me why you\u0027re so interested in my daughter. What are you, some kind of pervert? A kiddie-fiddler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face remains impassive and serious. There\u0027s not a flicker of emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not just your daughter we\u0027re interested in,\" he finally starts to explain. \"Our belief is that children are key to our future. They\u0027re important now, and they\u0027ll be even more crucial when this war\u0027s won.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever seen a child fight? They\u0027re fast, strong, agile... completely uninhibited. They\u0027re not burdened with years and years of memories of the old way of things; all they know is now. They accept what they see and experience today, and they accept it without question. This is their normality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he says makes some kind of sense, but I don\u0027t trust this guy. His slimy, slick way of speaking immediately gets my back up. He comes across like a politician, a subpar spin doctor. I know we\u0027re both fighting on the same side, but how different are our aims and objectives?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talk a lot, but you\u0027re not actually saying anything. Why should I tell you anything about my little girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kids are true fighters, Danny, perfect fighters even. Brutes are strong and aggressive, but children are something else entirely. I think-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops speaking suddenly, almost as if he\u0027s not sure I can be trusted. I press him, keen to hear what he has to say. He runs his fingers through his greasy, slicked-back black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the line between us and the Unchanged starts to blur when you\u0027re looking at very young children. Like I said, they don\u0027t carry the baggage and the memories we do. Given the right stimulation and provocation, I think even an Unchanged kid could be taught to fight like us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s another silence as we both think about what he\u0027s just said. My initial reaction is that it\u0027s probably bullshit, but he might just have a point. A young kid growing up surrounded by all this madness wouldn\u0027t know any different. They\u0027d have to learn to fight to survive, whatever their initial allegiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got separated from my family when the Change happened to me,\" I tell him, deciding I\u0027ve got nothing to lose from opening up a little more as long as I\u0027m sparing with the details. I take the map from him and tap my finger on the area where I used to live. \"I last saw them here, but my partner managed to get away with the kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kids? More than one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two sons and a daughter. It\u0027s only Ellis I\u0027m interested in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your little girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so quick to write off the other two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slide my finger across the map, then stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Lizzie would have gone to her sister\u0027s house. What are these marks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo circles have been drawn on the map, both centered on the main part of town. Both my apartment and Lizzie\u0027s sister\u0027s house are just outside the outermost circle. Preston explains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Ankin said, the Unchanged have withdrawn into city centers. Our information\u0027s a couple of weeks old, but we think the first circle is the extent of their occupation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the second line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The outermost edge of their exclusion zone. It\u0027s a strip of empty land smack between them and everything else, pretty well defended. Makes it that much harder for us to get through unnoticed. It\u0027s not impossible, just a little more difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how does Ankin plan to march an army through no-man\u0027sland without being noticed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll find a way,\" Preston answers. He\u0027s not filling me with confidence. I try to steer the conversation back toward Ellis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s my plan,\" I tell him. \"Check the apartment first, then look for Ellis at Lizzie\u0027s sister\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if she\u0027s not there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t thought that far ahead. I don\u0027t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston folds up the map and thinks for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I said we could help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got a group of people heading out that way later today, looking for more recruits. You could go with them. You\u0027ll have more chance if you go with our support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s in it for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are just two conditions,\" he announces ominously. \"First, if you don\u0027t find your girl, you forget about her and come back here and fight with us. Second, if you do find her, you both come back to us and fight.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-8.html","bookId":2556,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM"}
