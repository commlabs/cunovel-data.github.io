Then, he threw his head back and laughed. The rich, deep sound carried over the garden. Jess was smitten by how merriment transformed him, making him more approachable and—if possible—more handsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling her even closer, Benedict pressed his lips to her temple. “You are a treasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From what I understand,” she whispered, leaning into his warmth, “duty lies in the marital bed, while pleasure exists outside of it with paramours. Do I reveal a defect in my character by confessing that I should prefer you to want me in the manner of a mistress rather than a wife, insofar as the bedroom is concerned?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no defects. You are as perfect a woman as I have ever seen or become acquainted with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was far from perfect, as the remembered lash of a switch to the backs of her thighs attested. Learning to disguise her shortcomings had been a necessity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had Caulfield sensed that she would be open to his request to watch him? How had he somehow recognized an aspect of her character of which even she was unaware?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever he’d managed it, Jess was dizzily relieved to know that Benedict did not find her sudden self-awareness threatening or undesirable. Her betrothed’s acceptance gave her unusual courage. “Is it possible you might find such an interest in me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More than possible.” Benedict’s mouth sealed over hers, swallowing the words of relief and gratitude she meant to speak. It was a questing kiss, tender and cautious, yet assured. She caught at his lapels, her chest heaving from the effort to find the breath he was stealing from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue slid along the seam of her lips, then teased them apart. When he entered her mouth with a quick thrust, her knees weakened. He pulled her tighter against him, exposing his need in the hard ridge of arousal pressing into her hip. His fingers kneaded her skin, betraying a growing agitation. When he broke away and pressed his temple to hers, his breathing was labored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God help me,” he said roughly. “As innocent as you are, you have nevertheless seduced me with consummate skill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her into his arms, he carried her swiftly to the summerhouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensitive to the highly charged situation, Temperance walked silently beside them. Then, she waited on the porch with unusual meekness and watched the sun rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven years later …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I beg you to reconsider.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica, Lady Tarley, reached over the small tea table in the Regmont family parlor and gave her sister’s hand a brief squeeze. “I feel I should go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” The corners of Hester’s mouth turned downward. “I would understand if Tarley was with you, but now that he has passed … Is it safe for you to travel such a distance alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a question Jess had asked herself many times, yet the answer was moot. She was determined to go. She had been given a brief window of time in which she could do something extraordinary. It was highly doubtful she would ever be presented with the opportunity again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course it’s safe,” she said, straightening. “Tarley’s brother, Michael—I should become accustomed to referring to him as Tarley now—made the arrangements for the voyage, and I will be met at the dock by someone from the household. All will be well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not reassured.” Toying with the handle of her floral-patterned teacup, Hester looked pensive and unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You once wanted to travel to faraway places,” Jess reminded, hating to see her sister so distressed. “Have you lost that wanderlust?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHester sighed and looked out the window beside her. Through the sheers that afforded some privacy, one could see the steady flow of Mayfair traffic in front of the town house, but Jess’s attention was focused solely on her sister. Hester had matured into a beautiful young woman, lauded for her golden glamour and stunning verdant eyes framed by thick, dark lashes. She’d once been curvier than Jess and more vivacious, but the years had tempered both traits, forging a woman who was slender as a reed and serenely elegant. The Countess of Regmont had acquired a reputation for notable reserve, which surprised Jess considering how charming and outgoing Lord Regmont was. She blamed the change on their father, and his blasted pride and misogyny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look pale and thin,” Jess observed. “Are you unwell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I grieve for your loss. And I must confess, I have not slept well since you first announced your intent to travel.” Hester looked back at her. “I simply cannot comprehend your motivation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly a year had passed since Benedict had gone on to his reward, and he had been severely ill for three months prior to that. There had been time enough for Jess to reach a state of resigned acceptance to life without him. Still, bereavement clung to her like fog over water. Family and friends looked to her for the cue to leave the past behind, and she had no notion of how to give it to them. “I require distance from the past in order to grasp the future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Surely retiring to the country would suffice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It did not suffice last winter. Now another Season is upon us, and we are all still trapped beneath this cloud hovering over me. It is necessary for me to break away from the routine into which I have fallen, so everyone can move forward with life as we now face it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dear God, Jess,” Hester breathed, looking pale. “You cannot mean to say that you must leave us as Tarley did for all to heal. You are still young and marriageable. Your life is far from over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agreed. Pray do not worry over me.” Jess refilled Hester’s teacup and dropped two lumps of sugar into it. “I will be gone only long enough to make arrangements for the sale of the plantation. I shall return refreshed and revitalized, which, in turn, will reinvigorate all who love and worry over me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I still cannot believe he bequeathed that place to you. What was he thinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica smiled fondly, her gaze moving around the cheery parlor with its yellow silk drapes and blue floral accents. Hester had redesigned the space shortly after her marriage, and its style reflected the optimism so innate to her. “He wanted me to be entirely self-sufficient, and it was a sentimental gesture. Tarley knew how much I loved our trip to Calypso.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sentimentality is all well and good, until it sends you on a journey halfway around the world,” Hester muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As I’ve said, I want to go. I will go so far as to say I need to go. It is somewhat of a farewell for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroaning, Hester finally capitulated. “You promise to write and return as soon as you are able?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. And you promise to write back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHester nodded, then picked up her cup and saucer. She downed her hot tea in one unladylike swallow. A fortifying drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess understood. She’d needed a few of those herself as the anniversary of Tarley’s death loomed. “I will bring you gifts,” she promised in a deliberately light tone, hoping to elicit a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just bring yourself back,” Hester admonished with a wag of her finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gesture was so reminiscent of their childhood. Jess couldn’t resist asking, “Will you come after me if I tarry overlong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Regmont would never allow it. However, I could likely convince someone to go after you. Perhaps some of the matrons who are so concerned over your welfare … ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess gave a mock shudder. “Point taken, my ruthless sister. I shall return posthaste.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair Caulfield’s back was to the door of his warehouse shipping office when it opened. A salt-tinged gust blew through the space, snatching the manifest he was about to file right out of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught it deftly, then looked over his shoulder. Startled recognition moved through him. “Michael.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new Lord Tarley’s eyes widened with equal surprise, then a weary half-smile curved his mouth. “Alistair, you scoundrel. You didn’t tell me you were in Town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve only just returned.” He slid the parchment into the appropriate folder and pushed the drawer closed. “How are you, my lord?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael removed his hat and ran a hand through his dark brown hair. The assumption of the Tarley title appeared to weigh heavily on his broad shoulders, grounding him in a way Alistair had never seen before. He was dressed somberly in shades of brown, and he flexed his left hand, which bore the Tarley signet ring, as if he could not accustom himself to having it there. “As well as can be expected under the circumstances.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My condolences to you and your family. Did you receive my letter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did. Thank you. I meant to reply, but time is stretched so thin. The last year has raced by so quickly; I’ve yet to catch my breath.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael nodded. “I’m pleased to see you again, my friend. You have been gone far too long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The life of a merchant.” He could have delegated more, but staying in England meant crossing paths with both his father and Jessica. His father complained about Alistair’s success as a tradesman with as much virulence as he’d once complained about Alistair’s lack of purpose. It was a great stressor for his mother, which he was only able to alleviate by being absent as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Jessica, she’d been careful to avoid him whenever they were in proximity. He had learned to reciprocate when he saw how marriage to Tarley had changed her. While she remained as cool in deportment as ever, he’d seen the blossoming of her sensual nature in the languid way she moved and the knowledge in those big, gray eyes. Other men coveted the mystery of her, but Alistair had seen behind the veil, and that was the woman he lusted for. Forever beyond his reach in reality, but a fixture in his mind. She was burned into his memory by the raging hungers and the impressions of youth, and the years hadn’t lessened the vivid recollection one whit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I find myself grateful for your enterprising sensibilities,” Michael said. “Your captains are the only ones I would entrust with the safe passage of my sister-in-law to Jamaica.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair kept his face impassive thanks to considerable practice, but the sudden awareness gripping him tensed his frame. “Lady Tarley intends to travel to Calypso?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. This very morning, which is why I’m here. I intend to speak to the captain myself and see he looks after her until they arrive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who travels with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only her maid. I should like to accompany her, but I can’t leave now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And she will not delay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Michael’s mouth curved wryly. “And I cannot dissuade her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You cannot say no to her,” Alistair corrected, moving to the window through which he could view the West India docks. Ships entered the Northern Dock to unload their precious imports, then sailed around to the Southern Dock to reload with cargo for export. Around the perimeter, a high brick wall deterred the rampant theft plaguing the London wharves. The same wall increased his shipping company’s appeal to West Indian landowners requiring secure transportation of goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neither can Hester—forgive me, Lady Regmont.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last was said with difficulty. Alistair had long suspected his friend nursed deeper feelings for Jessica’s younger sister and had assumed Michael would pay his addresses. Instead, Hester had been presented at court, then immediately betrothed, breaking the hearts of many hopeful would-be swains. “Why is she so determined to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Benedict bequeathed the property to her. She claims she must see to its sale personally. I fear the loss of my brother has affected her deeply and she seeks a purpose. I’ve attempted to anchor her, but duty has me stretched to wit’s end.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair’s reply was carefully neutral. “I can assist her in that endeavor. I can make the necessary introductions, as well as provide information that would take her months to discover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A generous offer.” Michael’s gaze was searching. “But you’ve just returned. I can’t ask you to depart again so soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, Alistair said, “My plantation borders Calypso, and I should like to expand. It’s my hope to position myself as the best purchaser of the property. I will pay her handsomely, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief swept over Michael’s expressive features. “That would ease my mind considerably. I’ll speak to her at once.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps you should leave that to me. If, as you say, she needs a purpose, then she’ll want to maintain control of the matter in all ways. She should be allowed to set the terms and pace of our association to suit her. I have all the time in the world, but you do not. See to your most pressing affairs, and entrust Lady Tarley to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve always been a good friend,” Michael said. “I pray you return to England swiftly and settle for a time. I could use your ear and head for business. In the interim, please encourage Jessica to write often and keep me abreast of the situation. I should like to see her return before we retire to the country for the winter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do my best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair waited several minutes after Michael departed, then moved to the desk. He began a list of new provisions for the journey, determined to create the best possible environment. He also made some quick but costly adjustments to the passenger list, moving two additional travelers to another of his ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe, Jessica, and her maid would be the only non-crewmen aboard the Acheron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would be within close quarters for weeks—it was an extraordinary opportunity Alistair was determined not to waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the familiar comfort of her town coach, Jessica stared at the sleek ship before her, her gaze following the proud line of its polished deck and the soaring height of its three masts. It was one of the most impressive vessels docked, which she should have expected considering how anxious Michael was about her making the journey. He would have taken great pains to secure her comfort and welfare. She suspected it helped him grieve to hover over his brother’s widow, but that was one of the aftereffects of losing Tarley that made her want to flee. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seven-years-to-sin-historical-1/page-3.html","bookId":2663,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:56 AM"}
