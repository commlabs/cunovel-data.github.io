\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Queen,” that noble baron answered, “to look upon these.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wait ye till the morrow morning: before her then shall ye come.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then trusted they to behold her, but again were they hindered therefrom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then commanded the King, of his favour to the envoys of Hunland’s king,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And of his royal bounty, that on broad shields men should bring\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gold from his treasure-chamber—sooth, great store lay therein:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rich gifts moreover were given unto them by his friends and his kin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With Gere and Ortwein, the Princes Gernot and Giselher\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Showed unto all beholders how open of hand they were;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 203}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For unto the herald-minstrels such rich gifts offered they\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That for dread of their King they dared not but say the givers nay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the messenger-minstrel Werber unto Gunther the King replied:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Lord King, e’en suffer thy presents here in thy land to abide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We may not carry them with us, for my Lord hath forbidden us this,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even accepting of presents—and little we need them, I wis.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the Lord of the Rhine was angered, for he held it discourtesy\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That these should reject the bounty of so great a King as he,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So that of force they accepted his gold and raiment at last,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And homeward they needs must bear them when to Etzel’s land they passed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fain were they to see Queen Uta, ere homeward they should fare;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherefore brought were the minstrels by the young prince Giselher\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To the presence of his mother; and she charged them with this word:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For the honour rendered my daughter mine heart is gladness-stirred.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then for the sake of Kriemhild and the love that to her she bare,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The old Queen gave commandment that gold and girdles fair\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Be given to those two heralds, yea also for Etzel’s sake.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the true heart of the giver those gifts they needs must take.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now the messengers of Kriemhild of all, both dame and knight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Courteous farewell had taken, and with merry hearts and light\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On into Suabia rode they, and Gernot sent thus far\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A warrior-band to escort them, that none their peace might mar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the knights of the Rhine had departed, who thus had warded their way,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the power of the terror of Etzel were they shielded from that day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No reiver there was so daring as to touch or vesture or steed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So back to the land of the Hunfolk they rode with fiery speed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wheresoever they found friends dwelling, they told, as they passed, the tale\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How the lords of the land Burgundian in few days would not fail\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To come from the Rhineland riding unto the Hun-king’s home;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to Pilgerin the bishop withal did the tidings come.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 204}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When, riding adown the highways, they came to Bechlaren’s hold,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto Rüdiger were the tidings of those swift messengers told,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And withal to the Lady Gotlind, the noble Margravine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With exceeding joy rejoiced they that these of their eyes should be seen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ever their foaming horses the minstrels twain spurred on,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Until to the presence of Etzel in his city of Gram they won.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As by greeting upon greeting unto the King they showed\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The love of the far-off kinsfolk, for joy his visage glowed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now unto the Lady Kriemhild were the welcome tidings come\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That her brethren had consented to fare to her Hunland home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then was she glad: of her bounty did the messengers receive\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rich gifts, such as are for the honour of so great a queen to give.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She said: “Now give ye answer, Werbel and Schwemmel, to me:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who of my kinsmen be minded at my festal tide to be\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of their noblest whom we have bidden to ride to the land of the Hun?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Hagen heard the tidings, what said that mighty one?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They answered and said: “To their council he came with earliest day;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But little good of the high-tide would he be moved to say.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When others commended the journey hither with eager breath,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hagen the grim withstood them, and named it the Ride unto Death.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hitherward come thy brethren, the royal Princes three,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Uplifted in spirit: what other shall be of their company—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of the rest can I speak not surely that thou shouldst be certified,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Save this, that the valiant minstrel Volker with these will ride.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I could well have foregone his presence,” answered Kriemhild the Queen:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Small longing had I that Volker should here in our halls be seen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But I joy for the coming of Hagen, for he is a hero good:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the thought that we shall behold him, lightsome am I of mood.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then went that Daughter of Princes where sat the King in hall:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How lovingly did the accents from the lips of Kriemhild fall!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How pleaseth thee the tidings, my lord, my belovèd?” she cried.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The long desire of my spirit shall at last be satisfied!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 205}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thy will is my chiefest pleasure,” the King made answer to her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Were these mine own blood-kinsmen, less joyful my spirit were\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the tidings of their drawing nigh to my land this day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the love of these thy kinsmen my cares have vanished away.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then did the great King’s stewards send forth urgent behests\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That palace and hall with high-seats should be adorned for the guests,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the loved and long expected who were drawing near at last.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Yet out of the life of Etzel by these all gladness was cast!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90351.html","bookId":422,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:37:12
