It was famed not for its beer, which looked like maiden\u0027s water and tasted like battery acid, but for its clientele. It was said that if you sat long enough in the Drum, then sooner or later every major hero on the Disc would steal your horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe atmosphere inside was still loud with talk and heavy with smoke although the landlord was doing all those things landlords do when they think it\u0027s time to close, like turn some of the lights out, wind up the clock, put a cloth over the pumps and, just in case, check the whereabouts of their club with the nails hammered in it. Not that the customers were taking the slightest bit of notice, of course. To most of the Drum\u0027s clientele even the nailed club would have been considered a mere hint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, they were sufficiently observant to be vaguely worried by the tall dark figure standing by the bar and drinking his way through its entire contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonely, dedicated drinkers always generate a mental field which ensures complete privacy, but this particular one was radiating a kind of fatalistic gloom that was slowly emptying the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis didn\u0027t worry the barman, because the lonely figure was engaged in a very expensive experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery drinking place throughout the multiverse has them – those shelves of weirdly-shaped, sticky bottles that not only contain exotically-named liquid, which is often blue or green, but also odds and ends that bottles of real drink would never stoop to contain, such as whole fruits, bits of twig and, in extreme cases, small drowned lizards. No-one knows why barmen stock so many, since they all taste like treacle dissolved in turpentine. It has been speculated that they dream of a day when someone will walk in off the street unbidden and ask for a glass of Peach Corniche with A Hint Of Mint and overnight the place will become somewhere To Be Seen At.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger was working his way along the row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHAT is THAT GREEN ONE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landlord peered at the label.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It says it\u0027s Melon Brandy,\u0027 he said doubtfully. \u0027It says it\u0027s bottled by some monks to an ancient recipe,\u0027he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI WILL TRY IT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked sideways at the empty glasses on the counter, some of them still containing bits of fruit salad, cherries on a stick and small paper umbrellas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you sure you haven\u0027t had enough?\u0027 he said. It worried him vaguely that he couldn\u0027t seem to make out the stranger\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass, with its drink crystallising out on the sides, disappeared into the hood and came out again empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. WHAT is THE YELLOW ONE WITH THE WASPS IN IT?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Spring Cordial, it says. Yes?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES. AND THEN THE BLUE ONE WITH THE GOLD FLECKS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Er. Old Overcoat?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES. AND THEN THE SECOND ROW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Which one did you have in mind?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALL OF THEM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger remained bolt upright, the glasses with their burdens of syrup and assorted vegetation disappearing into the hood on a production line basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it, the landlord thought, this is style, this is where I buy a red jacket and maybe put some monkey nuts and a few gherkins on the counter, get a few mirrors around the place, replace the sawdust. He picked up a beer-soaked cloth and gave the woodwork a few enthusiastic wipes, speading the drips from the cordial glasses into a rainbow smear that took the varnish off. The last of the usual customers put on his hat and staggered out, muttering to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI DON\u0027T SEE THE POINT, the stranger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sorry?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHAT is SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How many drinks have you had?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORTY-SEVEN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just about anything, then,\u0027 said the barman and, because he knew his job and knew what was expected of him when people drank alone in the small hours, he started to polish a glass with the slops cloth and said, \u0027Your lady thrown you out, has she?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePARDON?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Drowning your sorrows, are you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI HAVE NO SORROWS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, of course not. Forget I mentioned it.\u0027 He gave the glass a few more wipes. \u0027Just thought it helps to have someone to talk to,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger was silent for a moment, thinking. Then he said: You WANT TO TALK TO ME?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. Sure. I\u0027m a good listener.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO-ONE EVER WANTED TO TALK TO ME BEFORE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s a shame.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY NEVER INVITE ME TO PARTIES, YOU KNOW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tch.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY ALL HATE ME. EVERYONE HATES ME. I DONT HAVE A SINGLE FRIEND.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Everyone ought to have a friend,\u0027 said the barman sagely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI THINK —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI THINK . . . I THINK I COULD BE FRIENDS WITH THE GREEN BOTTLE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landlord slid the octagon-bottle along the counter. Death took it and tilted it over the glass. The liquid tinkled on the rim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU DRUNK I\u0027M THINK, DON\u0027T YOU?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I serve anyone who can stand upright best out of three,\u0027 said the landlord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOURRRE ABSOROOTLY RIGHT. BUT I —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger paused, one declamatory finger in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWAS WHAT I SAYING?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You said I thought you were drunk.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAH. YES, BUT I CAN BE SHOBER ANY TIME I LIKE. THIS ISH AN EXPERIMENT. AND NOW I WOULD LIKES TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE ORANGE BRANDY AGAIN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landlord sighed, and glanced at the clock. There was no doubt that he was making a lot of money, especially since the stranger didn\u0027t seem inclined to worry about overcharging or short change. But it was getting late; in fact it was getting so late that it was getting early. There was also something about the solitary customer that unsettled him. People in The Mended Drum often drank as though there was no tomorrow, but this was the first time he\u0027d actually felt they might be right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI MEAN, WHAT HAVE I GOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO? WHERE\u0027S THE SENSE IN IT ALL? WHAT IS IT REALLY ALL ABOUT?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Can\u0027t say, my friend. I expect you\u0027ll feel better after a good night\u0027s sleep.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSLEEP? SLEEP? I NEVER SLEEP. I\u0027M WOSSNAME, PROVERBIAL FOR IT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Everyone needs their sleep. Even me,\u0027 he hinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY ALL HATE ME, YOU KNOW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, you said. But it\u0027s a quarter to three.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger turned unsteadily and looked around the silent room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE\u0027S NO-ONE IN THE PLACE BUT YOU AND I, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landlord lifted up the flap and came around the bar, helping the stranger down from his stool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI HAVEN\u0027T GOT A SINGLE FRIEND. EVEN CATS FIND ME AMUSING.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand shot out and grabbed a bottle of Amanita Liquor before the man managed to propel its owner to the door, wondering how someone so thin could be so heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI DON\u0027T HAVE TO BE DRUNK, I SAID. WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE TO BE DRUNK? IS IT FUN?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Helps them forget about life, old chap. Now just you lean there while I get the door open —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORGET ABOUT LIFE. HA. HA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You come back any time you like, y\u0027hear?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU\u0027D REALLY LIKE TO SEE ME AGAIN?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landlord looked back at the small heap of coins on the bar. That was worth a little weirdness. At least this one was a quiet one, and seemed to be harmless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 he said, propelling the stranger into the street and retrieving the bottle in one smooth movement. \u0027Drop in anytime.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT\u0027S THE NICEHEST THING —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed on the rest of the sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYsabell sat up in bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knocking came again, soft and urgent. She pulled the covers up to her chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who is it?\u0027 she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s me, Mort,\u0027 came the hiss under the door. \u0027Let me in, please!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wait!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYsabell scrambled frantically on the bedside table for the matches, knocking over a bottle of toilet water and dislodging a box of chocolates that was now mostly discarded wrappers. Once she\u0027d got the candle alight she adjusted its position for maximum effect, tweaked the line of her nightdress into something more revealing, and said: \u0027It\u0027s not locked.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort staggered into the room, smelling of horses and frost and scumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I hope,\u0027 said Ysabell archly, \u0027that you have not forced your way in here in order to take advantage of your position in this household.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort looked around him. Ysabell was heavily into frills. Even the dressing table seemed to be wearing a petticoat. The whole room wasn\u0027t so much furnished as lingeried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look, I haven\u0027t got time to mess around,\u0027 he said. \u0027Bring that candle into the library. And for heaven\u0027s sake put on something sensible, you\u0027re overflowing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYsabell looked down, and then her head snapped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort poked his head back round the door. \u0027It\u0027s a matter of life and death,\u0027 he added, and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYsabell watched the door creak shut after him, revealing the blue dressing gown with the tassels that Death had thought up for her as a present last Hogswatch and which she hadn\u0027t the heart to throw away, despite the fact that it was a size too small and had a rabbit on the pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she swung her legs out of bed, slipped into the shameful dressing gown, and padded out into the corridor. Mort was waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Won\u0027t father hear us?\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s not back. Come on.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How can you tell?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The place feels different when he\u0027s here. It\u0027s – it\u0027s like the difference between a coat when it\u0027s being worn and when it\u0027s hanging on a hook. Haven\u0027t you noticed?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are we doing that\u0027s so important?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort pushed open the library door. A gust of warm, dry air drifted out, and the door hinges issued a protesting creak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027re going to save someone\u0027s life,\u0027 he said. \u0027A princess, actually.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYsabell was instantly fascinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A real princess? I mean can she feel a pea through a dozen mattresses?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Can she —?\u0027 Mort felt a minor worry disappear. \u0027Oh. Yes. I thought Albert had got it wrong.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you in love with her?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort came to a standstill between the shelves, aware of the busy little scritchings inside the book covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s hard to be sure,\u0027 he said. \u0027Do I look it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You look a bit flustered. How does she feel about you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ah,\u0027 said Ysabell knowingly, in the tones of an expert. \u0027Unrequited love is the worst kind. It\u0027s probably not a good idea to go taking poison or killing yourself, though,\u0027 she added thoughtfully. \u0027What are we doing here? Do you want to find her book to see if she marries you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve read it, and she\u0027s dead,\u0027 said Mort. \u0027But only technically. I mean, not really dead.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good, otherwise that would be necromancy. What are we looking for?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Albert\u0027s biography.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What for? I don\u0027t think he\u0027s got one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Everyone\u0027s got one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, he doesn\u0027t like people asking personal questions. I looked for it once and I couldn\u0027t find it. Albert by itself isn\u0027t much to go on. Why is he so interesting?\u0027 Ysabell lit a couple of candles from the one in her hand and filled the library with dancing shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I need a powerful wizard and I think he\u0027s one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What, Albert?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. Only we\u0027re looking for Alberto Malich. He\u0027s more than two thousand years old, I think.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What, Albert?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. Albert.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He never wears a wizard\u0027s hat,\u0027 said Ysabell doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He lost it. Anyway, the hat isn\u0027t compulsory. Where do we start looking?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, if you\u0027re sure . . . the Stack, I suppose. That\u0027s where father puts all the biographies that are more than five hundred years old. It\u0027s this way.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led the way past the whispering shelves to a door set in a cul-de-sac. It opened with some effort and the groan of the hinges reverberated around the library; Mort fancied for a moment that all the books paused momentarily in their work just to listen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-22.html","bookId":1623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:05 PM"}
