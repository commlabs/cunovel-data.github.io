I understand that this means I will be given a new background and a new identity by the Bureau and inserted into the experiment in Chicago, Illinois, where I will live out the remainder of my days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agree to reproduce at least twice to give my corrected genes the best possible chance of survival. I understand that I will be encouraged to do this when I am reeducated after the reset procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also give my consent for my children and my children’s children, etc., to continue in this experiment until such time as the Bureau of Genetic Welfare deems it to be complete. They will be instructed in the false history that I myself will be given after the reset procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigned,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda Marie Ritter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda Marie Ritter. She was the woman in the video, Edith Prior, my ancestor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at Caleb, whose eyes are alight with knowledge, like there’s a live wire running through each of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur ancestor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull out one of the chairs and sit. “She was Dad’s ancestor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and sits down across from me. “Seven generations back, yes. An aunt. Her brother is the one who carried on the Prior name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And this is . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a consent form,” he says. “Her consent form for joining the experiment. The endnotes say that this was just a first draft—she was one of the original experiment designers. A member of the Bureau. There were only a few Bureau members in the original experiment; most of the people in the experiment weren’t working for the government.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read the words again, trying to make sense of them. When I saw her in the video, it seemed so logical that she would become a resident of our city, that she would immerse herself in our factions, that she would volunteer to leave behind everything she left behind. But that was before I knew what life was like outside the city, and it doesn’t seem as horrific as what Edith described in her message to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe delivered a skillful manipulation in that video, which was intended to keep us contained and dedicated to the vision of the Bureau—the world outside the city is badly broken, and the Divergent need to come out here and heal it. It’s not quite a lie, because the people in the Bureau do believe that healed genes will fix certain things, that if we integrate into the general population and pass our genes on, the world will be a better place. But they didn’t need the Divergent to march out of our city like an army to fight injustice and save everyone, as Edith suggested. I wonder if Edith Prior believed her own words, or if she just said them because she had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a photograph of her on the next page, her mouth in a firm line, wisps of brown hair hanging around her face. She must have seen something terrible, to volunteer for her memory to be erased and her entire life remade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know why she joined?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb shakes his head. “The records suggest—though they’re fairly vague on this front—that people joined the experiment so their families could escape extreme poverty—the families of the subjects were offered a monthly stipend for the subject’s participation, for upward of ten years. But obviously that wasn’t Edith’s motivation, since she worked for the Bureau. I suspect something traumatic must have happened to her, something she was determined to forget.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown at her photograph. I can’t imagine what kind of poverty would motivate a person to forget themselves and everyone they loved so their families could get a monthly stipend. I may have lived on Abnegation bread and vegetables for most of my life, with nothing to spare, but I was never that desperate. Their situation must have been much worse than anything I saw in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t imagine why Edith was that desperate either. Or maybe it’s just that she didn’t have anyone to keep her memory for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was interested in the legal precedent for giving consent on behalf of one’s descendants,” Caleb says. “I think it’s an extrapolation of giving consent for one’s children under eighteen, but it seems a little odd.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess we all decide our children’s fates just by making our own life decisions,” I say vaguely. “Would we have chosen the same factions we did if Mom and Dad hadn’t chosen Abnegation?” I shrug. “I don’t know. Maybe we wouldn’t have felt as stifled. Maybe we would have become different people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought creeps into my mind like a slithering creature—Maybe we would have become better people. People who don’t betray their own sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the table in front of me. For the past few minutes it was easy to pretend that Caleb and I were just brother and sister again. But a person can only keep reality—and anger—at bay for so long before the truth comes back again. As I raise my eyes to his, I think of looking at him in just this way, when I was still a prisoner in Erudite headquarters. I think of being too tired to fight with him anymore, or to hear his excuses; too tired to care that my brother had abandoned me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask tersely, “Edith joined Erudite, didn’t she? Even though she took an Abnegation name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!” He doesn’t seem to notice my tone. “In fact, most of our ancestors were in Erudite. There were a few Abnegation outliers, and one or two Candor, but the through line is fairly consistent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel cold, like I might shiver and then shatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I suppose you’ve used this as an excuse in your twisted mind for what you did,” I say steadily. “For joining Erudite, for being loyal to them. I mean, if you were supposed to be one of them all along, then ‘faction before blood’ is an acceptable thing to believe, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tris . . .” he says, and his eyes plead with me for understanding, but I do not understand. I won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up. “So now I know about Edith and you know about our mother. Good. Let’s just leave it at that, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes when I look at him I feel the ache of sympathy toward him, and sometimes I feel like I want to wrap my hands around his throat. But right now I just want to escape, and pretend this never happened. I walk out of the records room, and my shoes squeak on the tile floor as I run back to the hotel. I run until I smell sweet citrus, and then I stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias is standing in the hallway outside the dormitory. I am breathless, and I can feel my heartbeat even in my fingertips; I am overwhelmed, teeming with loss and wonder and anger and longing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tris,” Tobias says, his brow furrowed with concern. “Are you all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, still struggling for air, and crush him against the wall with my body, my lips finding his. For a moment he tries to push me away, but then he must decide that he doesn’t care if I’m all right, doesn’t care if he’s all right, doesn’t care. We haven’t been alone together in days. Weeks. Months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers slide into my hair, and I hold on to his arms to stay steady as we press together like two blades at a stalemate. He is stronger than anyone I know, and warmer than anyone else realizes; he is a secret that I have kept, and will keep, for the rest of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans down and kisses my throat, hard, and his hands smooth over me, securing themselves at my waist. I hook my fingers in his belt loops, my eyes closing. In that moment I know exactly what I want; I want to peel away all the layers of clothing between us, strip away everything that separates us, the past and the present and the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear footsteps and laughter at the end of the hallway, and we break apart. Someone—probably Uriah—whistles, but I barely hear it over the pulsing in my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias’s eyes meet mine, and it’s like the first time I really looked at him during my initiation, after my fear simulation; we stare too long, too intently. “Shut up,” I call out to Uriah, without looking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUriah and Christina walk into the dormitory, and Tobias and I follow them, like nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTOBIAS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT NIGHT WHEN my head hits the pillow, heavy with thoughts, I hear something crinkle beneath my cheek. A note under my pillowcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeet me outside the hotel entrance at eleven. I need to talk to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Nita\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Tris’s cot. She’s sprawled on her back, and there is a piece of hair covering her nose and mouth that shifts with each exhale. I don’t want to wake her, but I feel strange, going to meet a girl in the middle of the night without telling her about it. Especially now that we’re trying so hard to be honest with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check my watch. It’s ten to eleven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNita’s just a friend. You can tell Tris tomorrow. It might be urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push the blankets back and shove my feet into my shoes—I sleep in my clothes these days. I pass Peter’s cot, then Uriah’s. The top of a flask peeks out from beneath Uriah’s pillow. I pinch it between my fingers and carry it toward the door, where I slide it under the pillow on one of the empty cots. I haven’t been looking after him as well as I promised Zeke I would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I’m in the hallway, I tie my shoes and smooth my hair down. I stopped cutting it like the Abnegation when I wanted the Dauntless to see me as a potential leader, but I miss the ritual of the old way, the buzz of the clippers and the careful movements of my hands, knowing more by touch than by sight. When I was young, my father used to do it, in the hallway on the top floor of our Abnegation house. He was always too careless with the blade, and scraped the back of my neck, or nicked my ear. But he never complained about having to cut my hair for me. That’s something, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNita is tapping her foot. This time she wears a white short-sleeved shirt, her hair pulled back. She smiles, but it doesn’t quite reach her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look worried,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because I am,” she answers. “Come on, there’s a place I’ve been wanting to show you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leads me down dim hallways, empty except for the occasional janitor. They all seem to know Nita—they wave at her, or smile. She puts her hands in her pockets, guiding her eyes carefully away from mine every time we happen to look at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe go through a door without a security sensor to keep it locked. The room beyond it is a wide circle with a chandelier marking its center with dangling glass. The floors are polished wood, dark, and the walls, covered in sheets of bronze, gleam where the light touches them. There are names inscribed on the bronze panels, dozens of names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNita stands beneath the glass chandelier and holds her arms out, wide, to encompass the room in her gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These are the Chicago family trees,” she says. “Your family trees.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move closer to one of the walls and read through the names, searching for one that looks familiar. At the end, I find one: Uriah Pedrad and Ezekiel Pedrad. Next to each name is a small “DD,” and there is a dot next to Uriah’s name, and it looks freshly carved. Marking him as Divergent, probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know where mine is?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crosses the room and touches one of the panels. “The generations are matrilineal. That’s why Jeanine’s records said Tris was ‘second generation’—because her mother came from outside the city. I’m not sure how Jeanine knew that, but I guess we’ll never find out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI approach the panel that bears my name with trepidation, though I’m not sure what I have to fear from seeing my name and my parents’ names carved into bronze. I see a vertical line connecting Kristin Johnson to Evelyn Johnson, and a horizontal one connecting Evelyn Johnson to Marcus Eaton. Below the two names is just one: Tobias Eaton. The small letters beside my name are “AD,” and there’s a dot there too, though I now know I’m not actually Divergent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The first letter is your faction of origin,” she says, “and the second is your faction of choice. They thought that keeping track of the factions would help them trace the path of the genes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother’s letters: “EAF.” The “F” is for “factionless,” I assume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father’s letters: “AA,” with a dot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touch the line connecting me to them, and the line connecting Evelyn to her parents, and the line connecting them to their parents, all the way back through eight generations, counting my own. This is a map of what I’ve always known, that I am tied to them, bound forever to this empty inheritance no matter how far I run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“While I appreciate you showing me this,” I say, and I feel sad, and tired, “I’m not sure why it had to happen in the middle of the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you might want to see it. And I had something I wanted to talk to you about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More reassurance that my limitations don’t define me?” I shake my head. “No thanks, I’ve had enough of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she says. “But I’m glad you said that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans against the panel, covering Evelyn’s name with her shoulder. I step back, not wanting to be so close to her that I can see the ring of lighter brown around her pupils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That conversation I had with you last night, about genetic damage . . . it was actually a test. I wanted to see how you would react to what I said about damaged genes, so I would know whether I could trust you or not,” she says. “If you accepted what I said about your limitations, the answer would have been no.” She slides a little closer to me, so her shoulder covers Marcus’s name too. “See, I’m not really on board with being classified as ‘damaged.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of the way she spat out the explanation of the tattoo of broken glass on her back like it was poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart starts to beat harder, so I can feel my pulse in my throat. Bitterness has replaced the good humor in her voice, and her eyes have lost their warmth. I am afraid of her, afraid of what she says—and thrilled by it too, because it means I don’t have to accept that I am smaller than I once believed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allegiant-divergent-3/page-20.html","bookId":1700,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:52 AM"}
