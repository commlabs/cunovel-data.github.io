{"id":108580,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Exterminator\u0027s Daughter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg Cabot\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music is pounding in time to my heartbeat. I can feel the bass in my chest-badoom, badoom. It\u0027s hard to see across the room of writhing bodies, especially with the fog from the dry ice, and the flickering light show coming down from the club\u0027s industrial ceiling overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I know he\u0027s here. I can feel him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is why I\u0027m grateful for the bodies grinding against one another all around me. They\u0027re keeping me hidden from his view-and from his senses. Otherwise he\u0027d have smelled me coming by now. They can detect the scent of fear from yards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I\u0027m scared. Because I\u0027m not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell. Maybe a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I have my Excalibur Vixen crossbow 285 FPS with me, with a twenty-inch-long Easton XX75 (the tip, formerly gold, now replaced with hand-carved ash) already cocked and ready to be released at the merest pressure from my finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027ll never know what hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, hopefully, neither will she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe important thing is to get a clean shot-which won\u0027t be easy in this crowd-and to make it count. I\u0027ll probably only get one chance to shoot. Either I\u0027ll hit the target... or he\u0027ll hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always aim for the chest,\" Mom used to say. \"It\u0027s the largest part of the body, and the spot you\u0027re least likely to miss. Of course, you\u0027re more likely to kill than wound if you aim for the chest rather than the thigh or arm... but what do you want to wound for, anyway? The point is to take \u0027em down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is what I\u0027m here to do tonight. Take \u0027im down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila will hate me, of course, if she figures out what really happened... and that it was me who did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what does she expect? She can\u0027t think that I\u0027m just going to sit idly by and watch her throw her life away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met this guy,\" she\u0027d gushed at lunch today, while we were standing in line for the salad bar. \"Oh my God, Mary, you wouldn\u0027t believe how cute he is. His name\u0027s Sebastian. He\u0027s got the bluest eyes you\u0027ve ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing about Lila that a lot of people don\u0027t get is that beneath that-let\u0027s face it-slutty exterior beats the heart of a truly loyal friend. Unlike the rest of the girls at Saint Eligius, Lila\u0027s never pulled an attitude with me about the fact that my dad\u0027s not a CEO or plastic surgeon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yeah, okay, I have to tune out about three-fourths of what she says because most of it is stuff that I have no interest in-like how much she paid for her Prada tote at the end-of-season clearance sale at Saks, and what kind of tramp stamp she\u0027s thinking about getting next time she\u0027s in Canc��n.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this caught my attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lila,\" I said. \"What about Ted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Ted\u0027s all Lila has talked about for the past year, ever since he finally got up the guts to ask her out. Well, I mean, all she\u0027s talked about besides the Prada sales and back tattoos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s over,\" Lila said, reaching for the lettuce tongs. \"Sebastian\u0027s taking me clubbing tonight-at Swig. He says he can get us in-he\u0027s on the VIP list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the fact that this guy, whoever he was, claimed to be on the VIP list of the newest and most exclusive club in downtown Manhattan that caused the hairs on the back of my neck to rise. Don\u0027t get me wrong-Lila\u0027s beautiful. If anyone is going to be approached by a random stranger who happens to be on the most sought-after VIP list in town, it would be Lila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the thing about Ted that got to me. Because Lila adores Ted. They\u0027re the quintessentially perfect high school couple. She\u0027s gorgeous, he\u0027s a star athlete... it\u0027s a match made in teen heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is why what she was telling me did not compute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lila, how can you say it\u0027s over between you and Ted?\" I demanded. \"You two have been going out forever\"-or at least since I arrived at Saint Eligius Prep in September, where Lila was the first (and, to date, pretty much the only) girl in any of my classes to actually speak to me-\"and it\u0027s the prom this weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Lila said, with a happy sigh. \"Sebastian\u0027s taking me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seb-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when I knew. I mean, really knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lila,\" I said. \"Look at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila looked down at me-I\u0027m small. But, as Mom used to say, I\u0027m fast-and I saw it at once. What I should have seen from the beginning, that ever-so-slightly glazed expression-the dull eyes... the soft lips-that I\u0027ve come to know so well over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t believe it. He\u0027d gotten to my best friend. My only friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell. What was I supposed to do? Sit back and let him take her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d think seeing a girl with a crossbow on the dance floor of Manhattan\u0027s hottest new club would maybe generate a comment or two. But it is Manhattan, after all. Besides, everyone is having too good a time to notice me. Even-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. It\u0027s him. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m finally seeing him in the flesh...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, his son, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s more handsome than I ever imagined. Golden-haired and blue-eyed, with movie star-perfect lips and shoulders a mile wide. He\u0027s tall, too-although most guys are tall-compared with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, if he is anything like his father, well, then, I get it. I finally get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess. I still don\u0027t-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. He\u0027s sensed my gaze. He\u0027s turning this way-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s now or never. I raise my bow:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood-bye, Sebastian Drake. Good-bye forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just as I have the bright white triangle of his shirt front in my scope, something unbelievable happens: A bright bloom of cherry red appears exactly where I\u0027ve been aiming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept I haven\u0027t pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his kind doesn\u0027t bleed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that, Sebastian?\" Lila shimmies up to him to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit! Somebody\"-and I see Sebastian raise his stunned cerulean gaze from the scarlet stain on his shirt to Lila\u0027s face-\"shot me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s true. Someone has shot him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly it wasn\u0027t me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s not all that doesn\u0027t make sense. He\u0027s bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that\u0027s not possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot knowing what else to do, I duck behind a nearby pillar, pressing the Vixen to my chest. I need to regroup, figure out my next move. Because none of this can really be happening. I couldn\u0027t have been wrong about him. I did the research. It all makes sense... the fact that he\u0027s here in Manhattan... the fact that he went after my best friend, of all people... Lila\u0027s dazed expression... everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything except what just happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I had just stood there, staring. I had had a perfect shot, and I\u0027d blown it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr had I? If he\u0027s bleeding, then that must mean he\u0027s human. Doesn\u0027t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept if he\u0027s human, and he\u0027s just been shot in the chest, why is he still standing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst of it is... he saw me. I\u0027m almost sure I felt that reptilian gaze pass over me. What will he do now? Will he come after me? If he does, it\u0027s all my own fault. Mom told me never to do this. She always said a hunter never goes out alone. Why didn\u0027t I listen? What was I thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the problem, of course. I hadn\u0027t been thinking at all. I\u0027d let my emotions get the better of me. I couldn\u0027t let what happened to Mom happen to Lila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I\u0027m going to pay for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like Mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouching in agony, I try not to imagine what Dad\u0027s going to do when the New York City police ring our doorbell at four in the morning and ask him to come to the morgue to ID his only daughter\u0027s body. My throat will be gouged open, and who knows what other atrocities will be done to my broken body. All because I didn\u0027t stay home tonight to work on my paper for Mrs. Gregory\u0027s fourth-period U.S. History class (topic: the temperance movement in antebellum Civil War America, two thousand words, double-spaced, due Monday), like I was supposed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music changes. I hear Lila squeal, \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. He\u0027s coming. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-1.html","bookId":2030,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM"}
