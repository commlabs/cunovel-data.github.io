But now, under the mid-morning light, the vista had begun to change. Spreading in a vast, curved shadow, the ground was bleaching, all colour draining away. From grey to white, until it seemed that the entire basin was a thing of bone and ash, and in the distance – at the very centre of this blight – the earth had begun to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She awakens,’ said Kilmandaros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And now,’ whispered Errastas, his lone eyes glittering bright, ‘we shall speak of dragons.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hill where no hill had been before, lifting to command the horizon, bulging, swelling – a mountain—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey saw it explode, a billowing eruption of earth and stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuge cracks ripped across the basin floor. The entire ridge rippled under them and all three Elder Gods staggered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the column of dust and ashes rose skyward, as the cloud opened like a mushroom to fill half the sky, the sound finally reached them, solid as a rushing wall, igniting stunning agony inside their skulls. Sechul and Errastas were battered to the ground, sent tumbling. Even Kilmandaros was thrown from her feet – Sechul stared across at her, saw her mouth opened wide in a terrible scream that he could not hear amidst the howling wind, the crushing thunder of that eruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting round, he stared at the vast, roiling cloud. Korabas. You are returned to the world .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the maelstrom spinning vortices of dirt, dust and smoke had begun to form. He watched them coil, pushed out to the sides as if buffeted by some unseen column of rising air at the very centre. Sechul frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer wings? Are those made by her wings? Elder blood!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the roar died away, Sechul Lath heard Errastas. Laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mother?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilmandaros was climbing to her feet. She glanced across at her son. ‘Korabas Otataral iras’Eleint. Otataral, Sechul, is not a thing – it is a title.’ She turned to Errastas. ‘Errant! Do you know its meaning?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one-eyed Elder God’s laughter slowly died. He looked away. ‘What do I care for ancient titles?’ he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mother?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe faced the terrible blight of earth and sky to the west. ‘Otas’taral. In every storm there is an eye, a place of … stillness. Otas’taral means the Eye of Abnegation. And now, upon the world, we have birthed a storm .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSechul Lath sank back down, covered his face with dust-stained hands. Will I ever tire? Yes. I have. See what we have unleashed. See what we have begun .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErrastas staggered close, falling to his knees beside Sechul, who looked up into that ravaged face and saw both manic glee and brittle terror. The Errant smiled a ghastly smile. ‘Do you see, Setch? They have to stop her! They have no choice!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, please. Stop her .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She has begun to move,’ Kilmandaros announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSechul pushed Errastas to one side and sat up. But the sky revealed nothing: too much dust, too much smoke and ash – the pall had devoured two-thirds of the heavens, and the last third looked sickly, as if in retreat. The unnatural gloom was settling fast. ‘Where?’ he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother pointed. ‘Track her by the ground. For now, it is all we can do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSechul Lath stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA broad swathe of bleached death, stretching in a line. ‘Northeast,’ he whispered, watching the slow, devastating blight cutting its slash across the landscape. ‘All that lies beneath her …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where she passes,’ said Kilmandaros, ‘no life shall ever return. The stillness of matter becomes absolute. She is the Eye of Abnegation, the storm’s centre, where all must die.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mother, we have gone too far. This time—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s too late!’ shrieked Errastas. ‘She is the heart of sorcery! Without the Eye of Abnegation, there can be no magic!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kilmandaros was shaking her head. ‘It is not as simple as that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What isn’t?’ Sechul demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now that she is freed,’ she said, ‘the Eleint must kill her. They have no choice. Their power is magical, and Korabas will kill all that magic depends upon. And since she is immune to their sorcery, it must be by fang and claw, and that will demand every Eleint – every storm , until T’iam herself is awakened. And as for K’rul, well, he can no longer refuse the Errant’s summons – he was the one who harnessed the chaos of the dragons in the first place.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ They have to kill her! ’ cried Errastas. The blood leaking from his eye was now black with dust. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-241.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
