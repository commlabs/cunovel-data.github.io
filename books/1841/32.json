And if Madelyne had been watching him, she\u0027d have known how her words had pleased him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, she\u0027d actually shouted at him. Madelyne felt like crying. She took a deep breath, stared at Duncan\u0027s chest, and whispered, \"Then I\u0027d get my heart broken, wouldn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would protect your heart,\" Duncan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded very arrogant. Madelyne gave him an exasperated look. Duncan couldn\u0027t stop himself. Her mouth was too close to deny. All his discipline evaporated. He leaned down and captured her mouth in a searing kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, Duncan, we\u0027re all waiting for Madelyne to play the psaltery,\" Edmond shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan sighed into Madelyne\u0027s mouth before pulling away. His thumb slowly rubbed her lower lip. \"I forgot we weren\u0027t alone,\" he told her with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also,\" Madelyne whispered back. She blushed and tried to catch her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan took hold of her arm and escorted her to the one vacant chair. \"This is where you\u0027re supposed to sit,\" Madelyne told him. \"It has the highest back,\" she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it became obvious Madelyne wasn\u0027t going to begin until Duncan sat where she thought he should, he complied with her order. He even smiled over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond pushed another chair toward Madelyne. \"You\u0027ll be more comfortable here,\" he told her when she reached for a stool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne thanked him and sat down. Gerald handed her the psaltery. Her hands shook when she placed the instrument in her lap. Madelyne was terribly nervous now. She hated being the focus of everyone\u0027s attention. There was comfort in being inconspicuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerald stood behind Adela\u0027s chair. His arm was draped over the back. Both Gilard and Edmond stood, leaning against the hearth at opposite comers. And every one of them was staring at Madelyne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has been such a long time,\" Madelyne said. She looked down at the instrument. \"And I sang only for my uncle and his friends. I\u0027ve had no true training.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m certain your uncle and his friends thought you were wonderful,\" Adela interjected. She had noticed how Madelyne\u0027s hands trembled and tried to encourage her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they did think I was wonderful,\" Madelyne admitted, smiling at Adela. \"But then, they were all quite deaf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan immediately leaned forward so that everyone could see him clearly. The look on his face suggested no one laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron Gerald coughed. Gilard turned around to stare into the fire. Madelyne thought he was weary of waiting for her to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could sing some of our Latin chant we use during Eastertime,\" she suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know any songs about blades of grass?\" Duncan inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne looked startled. Duncan grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A blade in winter can be broken in half when you stomp on it,\" Madelyne told Duncan sweetly. \"And a blade in summer can be smothered if you keep your boot on top of it long enough,\" she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Gilard asked, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sad tune,\" Duncan commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Predictability,\" Madelyne answered at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather you sang about Polyphemus,\" Edmond interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who or what is a Polyphemus?\" Baron Gerald asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A one-eyed giant,\" Edmond answered, grinning at Madelyne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was the leader of the Cyclops,\" Madelyne said. \"Do you know the stories about Odysseus?\" she asked Edmond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bits and pieces,\" Edmond answered. He didn\u0027t add that everything he\u0027d learned had come from Madelyne when she raged with fever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gerald? Madelyne does tell the most wonderful stories,\" Adela said. In her enthusiasm she actually reached up and touched his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never heard of this Odysseus,\" Gerald announced. \"Why is that, do you suppose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne smiled. Gerald sounded irritated that he was uninformed. He seemed to be looking for someone to blame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no shame in that admission,\" Madelyne returned. \"Have you heard of Gerbert of Aurillac perchance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The monk?\" Gerald asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne nodded. She looked at Adela to give her explanation, certain Duncan\u0027s little sister couldn\u0027t have heard of the man. \"Gerbert lived a long time ago, Adela. Almost a hundred years past, I believe. He left his monastery and went to study in Spain. When he returned to France, he led the cathedral school at Reims, and it was during that time that he gave his students some of the ancient stories he\u0027d translated. It was another man named Homer who told the tales about the mighty warrior, Odysseus, and Gerbert who translated the tales from Greek to Latin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were Homer and Gerbert friends, do you suppose?\" Adela asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Madelyne answered. \"Homer lived in ancient times, in a place called Greece. He died hundreds of years before Gerbert was born. Homer\u0027s stories were kept safe in the monasteries. Some of them would make our church frown, but I mean no disrespect when I repeat the stories. In truth, they\u0027re really too foolish to believe as fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked interested. Madelyne turned to Duncan, caught his nod, and then began to play the psaltery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made several ear-wincing mistakes in the beginning. And then the ballad of Odysseus meeting the Cyclops became the focus of her attention. Madelyne stared down at the psaltery, pretended she was sitting next to her uncle Berton and singing to him. Once she\u0027d captured the pretext, her hands stopped shaking. Her voice grew in strength and purity as the tale about the warrior came to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poem captured her audience. Duncan thought her voice was bewitching. It was a true reflection of the gentle woman he now claimed as his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne spun a magical spell around all of them. Duncan, a man who wasn\u0027t given to linger, now leaned back in his chair and smiled with contentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began the story when Odysseus and his men were taken captive by Polyphemus, since Edmond had specifically requested that tale. Polyphemus determined to eat every one of the soldiers. The one-eyed giant kept them imprisoned inside his cave by blocking the entrance with a large boulder. Since Polyphemus also kept his sheep in the cave every night, it was necessary for him to move the stone each morning to let his flock out into the fields to graze. Odysseus blinded the giant and then showed his men how to crawl under the sheep and cling to their bellies. Polyphemus let the sheep pass by but waved his arms higher into the air, trying to catch the soldiers. Odysseus\u0027s clever plan saved them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Madelyne finished her recital, her audience begged to hear another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone took a turn telling their favorite part, interrupting one another in their enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was brilliant of Odysseus to tell Polyphemus his name was Nobody,\" Gilard stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" agreed Gerald. \"And when the other Cyclops heard Polyphemus screaming because Odysseus had blinded him, they called into the cave to him, asking if he needed help and to give them the name of his tormentor.\" Edmond\u0027s laugh joined the others. \"And when he called out that Nobody was tormenting him, his friends left him alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne smiled, pleased with the enthusiastic reaction to her story. She turned to look at Duncan. Her husband was staring into the fire. He was smiling and had a satisfied look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a beautiful profile. As she continued to stare at him, a warm glow washed over her. And then she realized who Duncan reminded her of. Odysseus. Aye, Duncan was just like the mighty warrior she had dreamed about when she was a little girl. Odysseus had become her imaginary confessor, her friend, her confidant; she had whispered all her fears to him when she was frightened and lonely. She liked to pretend that one day Odysseus would magically appear and take her away with him. He\u0027d fight for her, protect her from Louddon. And he\u0027d love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Madelyne became a woman, she put the childhood dreams away. And until this moment, she\u0027d actually forgotten her secret dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet in this precious moment, while she stared at her husband, she realized that her dream had come true. Duncan was her Odysseus. He was her lover, her protector, her savior from her brother. Dear God, she was in love with the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The price of wisdom is above rubies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eold testament, job, 28:18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madelyne, what ever is the matter with you? Are you ill?\" Adela bounded to her feet and hurried over to her friend. She thought Madelyne looked ready to faint. Madelyne\u0027s face had lost all color, and if Adela hadn\u0027t reached out in time, the beautiful psaltery would have fallen to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne shook her head. She started to stand up, then decided her legs might not support her. In truth, she was still shaking over her realization. She was in love with Duncan. \"I\u0027m fine, Adela. Just a little tired, that is all. Please don\u0027t carry on so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you well enough to sing another song?\" Adela asked. She immediately felt guilty for asking, but excused her conduct by telling herself she was desperate, after all, and would think of a way to repay Madelyne for her kindness if she\u0027d only come to her aid now. Why, she\u0027d carry a breakfast tray up to Madelyne in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne knew Adela was stalling. She sympathized with her friend yet couldn\u0027t think of any plan to get her out of her walk with Gerald. When Gerald walked over to stand beside Adela,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne said, \" \u0027Tis a fine instrument you\u0027ve given Adela. You\u0027ve chosen with care, Gerald.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baron smiled. \"Duncan has also chosen with care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne puzzled over his odd remark. Then Edmond and Gilard expressed their pleasure over her performance. She was soon blushing with embarrassment. In truth, she wasn\u0027t used to such praise. She thought the Wextons were the most unusual family. They threw out compliments so easily. They didn\u0027t think it detracted from their own value, Madelyne decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never been called beautiful until she met the Wextons. Yet each one of them had given her that compliment more than once. It seemed to Madelyne that they believed she really was beautiful. \"You\u0027re going to make me quite vain if you keep up this praise,\" she admitted with a shy smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did notice, however, that Duncan hadn\u0027t offered her any comment and wondered if she\u0027d pleased him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband still wasn\u0027t acting like himself. He\u0027d behaved so strangely outside when he grabbed her and kissed her in front of the world. And he\u0027d teased her during dinner. If she hadn\u0027t known better, she\u0027d have to think the man had a sense of humor. That was ridiculous, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne watched Gerald take hold of Adela\u0027s hand and escort her out of the hall. Duncan\u0027s little sister kept glancing back over her shoulder at Madelyne, giving her a pleading look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t stay outside long, Adela,\" Madelyne called out. \"You\u0027ll get a chill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the best she could do. Adela grasped the suggestion with a thankful nod before Gerald pulled her out of Madelyne\u0027s view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard and Edmond also left the hall. Duncan and Madelyne were suddenly alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne smoothed her gown to give her hands something to do. She wished she could go up to the tower room to spend a few minutes alone. Lord, there was so much to think about, so many decisions to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel Duncan staring at her. \"Would you like to tell me about men and their horses now, Duncan,\" Madelyne asked, \"before you take your swim in the lake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He looked perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you were going to talk to me about men and their horses,\" she explained. \"Don\u0027t you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, that,\" Duncan replied. He gave her a warm smile. \"Come closer, wife, and I shall begin my instructions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned over the request, thinking she was close enough. \"You\u0027re acting very strange, Duncan,\" she remarked when she\u0027d walked over to stand at his side. \"And looking very relaxed too. You\u0027re not yourself at all,\" she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne nibbled on her lower lip while she stared down at her husband. She suddenly reached out and put the back of her hand to his forehead. \"You don\u0027t have fever,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought she sounded disappointed. Her frown was fierce enough to give him that idea. Duncan grabbed Madelyne, pulled her into his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne adjusted her gown and sat as primly as she could manage. She folded her hands in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you worried about something?\" Duncan asked. His thumb rubbed her lower lip away from her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she was worried. Duncan was acting like a complete stranger. Wasn\u0027t that enough to worry any wife? Madelyne sighed. She brushed a lock of hair away from her eyes, accidentally bumping Duncan\u0027s chin with her elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe apologized, embarrassed by her sudden awkwardness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, thoroughly resigned to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t sing like a frog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne smiled, thinking it was the most wonderful compliment she\u0027d ever received. \"Thank you, Duncan,\" she said. \"And now you\u0027ll instruct me in the ways of men and horses,\" she suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan nodded. His hand slowly moved upward along her back until it rested against her shoulder. The motion made Madelyne\u0027s skin tingle. Then he pulled her forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne found herself settled against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We men form a special attachment to our steeds, Madelyne,\" Duncan began. His voice was as warm as the heat from the fire. Madelyne snuggled a little closer, yawned, and closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, we depend upon our mounts to obey our every command. A knight can\u0027t fight diligently if he has to take time to control his horse. It could mean his life if the battle is fierce and the animal unruly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan continued on with his explanation for several more minutes. \"You, wife, have bewitched my stallion away from me. I should be furious with you. Now that I think about it, I am furious,\" Duncan muttered. The smile soured on his face as he mulled over the loss of his faithful mount. \"Aye, you\u0027ve ruined Silenus. You may protest now if that is your wish, but I\u0027ve already made up my mind to give you Silenus. And so I will listen first to your apology for ruining my horse and next your appreciation for the gift I\u0027ve given you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan didn\u0027t get either. Madelyne didn\u0027t apologize or thank him. He frowned over her stubbornness and then tilted her head back so he could look at her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sound asleep. She probably hadn\u0027t heard a word he\u0027d said. He should have been angry with her. It was certainly disrespectful at the very least. Duncan kissed her instead of waking her. Madelyne snuggled closer. Her hands crept up around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond walked into the hall just as Duncan placed a second kiss on the top of Madelyne\u0027s head. \"She\u0027s asleep?\" Edmond asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lecture frightened her into a faint,\" Duncan answered dryly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-32.html","bookId":1841,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:29:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:29:58 PM"}
