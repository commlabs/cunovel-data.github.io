He was still wearing his trousers. \"Are you going to take me up on my offer to let you go back to Rendezvous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you mean it? I recall you once threatened to track me down and drag me back no matter how far I ran or where I hid. There\u0027s not much point of my accepting your generous offer if you\u0027re just going to chase after me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph sat down on a small storage locker, his palms spread wide on his thighs. He was tense and alert, a piece ofprisma waiting to be detonated. \"If I give you my word I won\u0027t chase after you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you giving me your word?\" Sariana asked with great interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get to that after you tell me what you want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, going home might be interesting. When I bring this cutter back to the Avylyns, it\u0027s going to put the seal on my success in the west. And if I can use that success to convince the academy to accept me, I could complete my education and take my rightful place in my clan\u0027s firm. It\u0027s certainly an interesting proposition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph lost the slender thread of his patience. \"Stop throwing words at me! Just tell me what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I tell you, will you give it to me?\" she asked softly. \"I\u0027ll try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I love you,\" he roared. The words echoed between the canyon walls, filling the night. \"Damn it, Sariana, I love you more than anything else on this planet. I finally realized that. The bond I feel with you isn\u0027t just based on physical passion. I know that now. I want you to be happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky, curied in a cloak pocket, stuck its head out and hissed inquiringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana smiled at Gryph as she got to her feet and walked over to him. \"That\u0027s all I need to make me stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands caressed her shoulders. \"Sariana, do you mean that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ve been living in the west too long,\" she said with loving amusement. \"I\u0027ve fallen in love and I\u0027ve developed the most illogical, unreasonable, unbusinesslike desire to be loved by you in return. I was fairly certain you did love me, but I\u0027m glad to hear the words. Even with the mental link between us some things still need to be said in the old-fashioned way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph\u0027s relieved chuckle became a hoarse nimble of desire as Sariana rested her head against his bare shoulder. He slid his hands down Sariana\u0027s chemise to her waist, gripped her hard and lifted her high above him. He looked up at her, starlight in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve lived in the west all my life, Sariana, but I didn\u0027t know what love was until I met you. My main concern was ensuring the future of my clan. Nothing was as important as that until I met you. I didn\u0027t even realize I was in love until I started thinking about doing the right thing and allowing you to choose your future, regardless of what that choice did to my own. You teach a rough lesson, lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see?\" Sariana murmured as he let her slide sensually down the length of his hard body. \"You westerneis don\u0027t know everything, not even about love. You just think you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long time later they lay together, saying nothing, just drifting in and out of each other\u0027s satisfaction. The intimacy of their link faded slowly to be replaced by the old-fashioned intimacy of lovers enjoying the sweet aftermath of joining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph reluctantly stirred to reach down and pull up the quilt. \"About that prisma,\" Sariana murmured sleepily, \"I have an idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never got the chance to finish. There was a faint movement on the shore and a soft hiss from Lucky. Sariana recoiled as Gryph rose to his feet, his hand reaching for an object in his trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana knew the intruder had to be the third bandit. Old business, she suddenly realized, should never be left unfinished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT was over before Sariana could kick herself free of the quilt. She heard a choked yell from the attacker soon after Gryph\u0027s hand sliced through the air in a short, lethal motion. Something connected with the other man\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bandit crumpled and fell over the low railing into the water. Silence descended. Gryph walked to the edge of the sled and glanced over the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll drown,\" Sariana said weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\" Gryph didn\u0027t seem overly interested in the matter. He reached over to unlock a storage locker and remove a small vapor lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana felt a chill go through her. She peered over the edge of the craft. \"I think we ought to pull him out of the water, Gryph. It isn\u0027t right to just leave him there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph switched on the lamp and scanned the shoreline. He was obviously preoccupied. \"He was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrying to kill us in case you didn\u0027t notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed!\" Irritated, Sariana started to climb over the edge of the railing. \"What did you use on him?\" \"The belt buckle you gave me. It was the closest thing available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everything you touch a potential weapon?\" she demanded, seriously incensed. Reaction, she told herself. She was suffering from reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite.\" He spoke absently, his attention still on the shoreline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name one thing that isn\u0027t a weapon for you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You.\" He turned to glance at her, frowning as he realized she was almost over the side. \"Where do you think you\u0027re going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to pull that bandit out of the water.\" She landed knee-deep in the black water and began fumbling for something that felt like a body. Her hand connected with a boot. She started hauling it toward the shore. \"And don\u0027t tell me you can\u0027t turn me into a weapon just like you do everything else. What about the way you used me to neutralize that prisma ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Storm and light, Sariana, you really take things to extremes at times, don\u0027t you?\" Gryph set down the lamp and vaulted over the side. Impatiently he jerked the half-conscious bandit from her grasp. \"Here, give him to me. I don\u0027t know what the point of saving him is, but if it will make you happier - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one of the things I love about you, Gryph,\" she said in dulcet tones. \"My happiness always comes first with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at her sharply and then shook his head with a rueful grin. \"Mouthy wench.\" \"You love it. Tell me something, Gryph. Would you really have let me go home to Rendezvous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth flashed in the shadows. \"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned back. \"I think we\u0027re both very lucky we won\u0027t have to test the limits of your loving generosity.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-87.html","bookId":1801,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM"}
