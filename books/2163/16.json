She smiled and wrapped her arm around him, sliding her hand onto his back and moving closer and closer until her body pressedagainst his. She was warm-almost hot, and she smelled good. She felt better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your journey is barely beginning,\" the alu-fiend whispered into his ear. Her breath was so hot it nearly burned the side of his neck. \"I almost envy you the sights you\u0027ll see, the things you\u0027ll experience. You will be in the presence of your goddess soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I like what I see?\" he asked. \"Will the experience be a fulfilling one? Will my goddess speak to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza stiffened, but just for a second, then she wrapped one leg around him and nestled in. The force of her embrace turned them slightly in the air. Pharaun glanced down at the ship of chaos and his companions, a hundred feet or more beneath them, oblivious to their presence there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are all things you\u0027ll have to discover on your own,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how can you be sure it\u0027ll be something to envy?\" he asked, his voice playful but forced, his attention returning to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I envy you the surprises,\" she replied with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the Abyss?\" she asked. \"Not for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Demonweb Pits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alu-fiend withdrew enough to look him in the eye, smiled, and said, \"No, I\u0027ve never been to the Demonweb Pits. Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun shook his head. He could answer her but not when she was looking at him. He leaned into her, and she squeezed him tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasthere twice, I think,\" he said into the soft warmth of her long neck. \"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a long time ago,\" Pharaun replied, \"and it might have been a dream. There was the last time, when we were all there in astral form, but I thought you might have been there once in the flesh. You\u0027re a demon. You can go there and . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun stopped talking. He wasn\u0027t sure what he was trying to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been to Menzoberranzan?\" he asked instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza stiffened againand for a little bit longer, and he knew that she had. \"Will there be a city for us to return to?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza shrugged. Pharaun could feel the gesture against his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me,\" he pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said, \"or no. It all depends on what you find in the Abyss and how soon Kaanyr and his new friends can break your matron mothers\u0027 backs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun found himself laughing. He was exhausted again. The Lake of Shadows had a way of sapping his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly, Pharaun,\" she said, \"you ask me questions as if I\u0027m some sort of fortune teller or oracle ... or goddess. I don\u0027t know what\u0027ll happen to you and your friends. No one, not even your Spider Queen I think, can predict what will happen from minute to minute in the mad chaos of the Abyss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun looked her in the eye and decided not to say the first few things that came into his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you thought about my coming with you?\" Aliisza asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you help me pilot the ship?\" he asked her, gently pushing her away. \"We enjoy each other, but I can\u0027t imagine you\u0027re asking me to simply trust you. I\u0027llneed an answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza resisted playfully and flicked the tip of her tongue against his cheek. \"You\u0027re pretty,\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as pretty as you,\" said Pharaun. \"Answer me. Why would you help me find Lolth and help Vhok and the duergar lay siege to Menzoberranzan at the same time? You\u0027re the enemy-the consort of the enemy, at least-of the city I call home. One might be tempted to choose sides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever for?\" she asked. \"When I\u0027m with you, I like you best. When I\u0027m with Kaanyr, he is everything to me. Either way, I\u0027m amused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun found himself laughing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll assume that\u0027s the best answer I\u0027ll ever get from you,\" he said, \"or any other tanar\u0027ri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza winked at him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Pharaun let his hands explore her exquisite body, he said, \"We should begin our lessons. Quenthel and the others are anxious to get underway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliisza responded to his touch with a sigh, then replied, \"As soon as you wish, love. You know how to get there from here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Through the Shadow Deep,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alu-fiend nodded and said, \"From there to the Plain of Infinite Portals-the gateway to the Abyss. There you\u0027ll need to find precisely the right entrance. The place you seek-the Demonweb Pits-is the sixty-sixth layer. There are guardians there and lost souls and things maybe even you can\u0027t imagine. You might actually like the Abyss, and you might not. Either way, it will change you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun sighed. She was probably right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really didn\u0027t want to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is responsible? Quenthel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Mistress, Mistress, K\u0027Sothra answered. Of the five vipers in her scourge, K\u0027Sothra was the least intelligent, but Quenthel listened anyway. Mistress, it was you. You are responsible. It\u0027s all your fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel closed her eyes. The skin on her face felt tight, stretched too thin on her skull. Her head hurt. She touched the viper just below its head, and K\u0027Sothra writhed playfully under her touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it really my fault? the high priestess asked. Could it be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew her finger away from K\u0027Sothra, found the next viper, and cupped her head in two fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came back when she sent me back and I served her as best I could, Quenthel sent to all five snakes. I became the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, and the worship of Lolth was never stronger. Isn\u0027t that what she sent me back to do? There was no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat will become of us all? she asked Zinda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-and-red-speckled snake twitched, flicked her tongue at Quenthel, and said, That is also your responsibility, Mistress. What happens as a result of your having driven Lolth away from us will be washed away if only you can bring her back. If you can attract her good graces again, she will save us all. If not, we will be destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel felt herself physically sag under the weight of that. Though she tried hard to muster all her training and natural fortitude, she wasn\u0027t able to sit up straight. What weighed most heavily on her was the feeling that the snakes were right. It was her fault, and she was the only one who could fix it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen will Lolth answer? Quenthel asked, moving her fingers to Qorra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third viper had the most potent poison. Quenthel only let her strike when she wanted to kill, when she wanted to show no mercy at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever, Qorra hissed into the high priestess\u0027s mind. Lolth will never answer. Menzoberranzan, Arach-Tinilith, and your entire civilization are doomed without her, and she\u0027s never coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel\u0027s head spun. She was sitting on the deck of the ship of chaos but still felt as if she were about to fall over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat isn\u0027t necessarily true, said Yngoth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel had grown more and more dependent on Yngoth\u0027s limitless wisdom. It was his voice that tended to reassure her, and to Quenthel he sounded most like a drow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was I sent back? she asked Yngoth. Is this why? To find her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you were sent back, the viper replied, Lolth didn\u0027t need to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven\u0027t you thought all along that you were sent back to sit at the head of Arach-Tinilith? To hold that post for House Baenre and preserve Lolth\u0027s faith and Lolth\u0027s favorite in the power structure of Menzoberranzan ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure now, the Mistress of the Academy admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were sent back for this, Yngoth said. Of course you were. You were sent back to become Mistress of Arach-Tinilith so that you would be the one they sent to find Lolth when the goddess chose to turn away. You were meant to be the savior of Menzoberranzan and perhaps even the savior of Lolth herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel sagged a little further at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can you be sure? she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure, replied Yngoth, but it seems reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lolth\u0027s plan all along that I go back there, Quenthel asked, to find her? How will I do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet to the Abyss first, replied Hsiv. The last of her vipers was never shy when it came to offering his mistress advice. Go there first and you will be guided to Lolth by Lolth. You will know what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you know? Quenthel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t, Hsiv replied, but do you have any choice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuenthel shook her head. She hadn\u0027t had any choice in a very long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValas looked around at the ragged drow who made up the expedition to the Abyss. They didn\u0027t look very good. Aside from Danifae, who had more energy than Valas had ever seen, who seemed transformed by their trip to Sschindylryn, they were tired, ragged, temperamental, and unfocused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask a practical question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Danifae looked at him. Quenthel was in a world of her own, deep in her own obviously troubled thoughts. The draegloth was pacing, almost pouting if such a thing could be possible from a creature that was half drow, half demon. The wizard was nowhere to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where has the wizard gone?\" the scour asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae pointed upward, and Valas followed her finger to see Pharaun slowly descending from the darkness above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never fear, scout,\" the wizard said as he finally settled on the deck, \"I wouldn\u0027t dream of abandoning this great expedition to rescue our mighty civilization from the brink of annihilation. We are nearly ready to begin, though there are a few more things I need to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValas stopped himself from sighing. The never-ending string of delays was wearing on them all-especially when they came with little or no explanation. \"You\u0027re keeping us here,\" the draegloth said, giving voice to what Valas was thinking-and what the others were likely thinking as well. \"You don\u0027t want to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master of Sorcere turned on the draegloth and lifted an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed?\" said Pharaun. \"Well, in that case perhaps you can attune the third resonant of the Blood Helm to the planar frequency of the Shadow Fringe.\" There was a silence while the draegloth looked at him with narrowed eyes. \"No?\" Pharaun went on. \"I didn\u0027t think so. That means you\u0027re going to have to let me finish what I need to finish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard looked around at the rest of them, and Valas shrugged, casually meeting his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not some mushroom-stem raft,\" Pharaun said to them all, \"splashing about on Donigarten Lake. This vessel, if you haven\u0027t noticed,is alive. It is a being of pure chaos. It has a certain intelligence. It has the innate ability to shift between the planar walls from one reality to another. You don\u0027t simply paddle something like this. You have to make it a part of you and in turn make yourself a part of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused for effect then continued, \"I am willing to do that-for the good of the expedition and for the pure curiosity of it. It\u0027s a unique opportunity to explore some fabulously outre magic. What you must all remember is that if I don\u0027t get it right, we could never make it out of this lake. Worse yet, we could find ourselves scuttled in the Shadow Deep or lost forever in the endless Abyss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master of Sorcere looked around as if he was waiting for an argument. None came-even from Jeggred, but he went on anyway, \"This time it will be different-the Abyss, the journey there, everything. Last time we were projected across the Astral. We were ghosts there. This time we\u0027ll actually be there. If we die in the Abyss, we don\u0027t snap back into our bodies. There will be no silver cord. We will be real there, and if we die . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValas wondered why the wizard stopped. Perhaps Pharaun didn\u0027t know what would happen if they died there. If you die in your own afterlife, is there an after-afterlife? Thinking about it gave Valas the beginnings of a nagging headache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have any of you ever been to the Abyss before?\" Pharaun asked. \"Really been there, physically? Even you, Jeggred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe draegloth didn\u0027t answer, but his smoldering look was enough. None of them had been there, none of them knew- \"I\u0027ve been there,\" Quenthel said. The sudden sound of her voice almost startled Valas. \"I have been there as a ghost, as a visitor, and as a ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae took a few steps toward Quenthel then sank to her knees on the deck half a dozen paces away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What as, Mistress?\" the battle-captive asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was killed,\" the high priestess said, her voice sounding as if it were coming from a great distance. Her vipers grew increasingly agitated as she went on. \"My soul went to Lolth. I served the goddess herself for a decade, then she sent me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValas\u0027s flesh ran cold, and he found himself stepping slowly away from the high priestess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Pharaun asked, a skeptical look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mistress of Arach-Tinilith turned and gave him a dark, cold stare. \"I think he means,\" Danifae continued for Pharaun, \" why were you sent back?\" \"I\u0027ve never heard anything about this,\" the Master of Sorcere added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was kept secret,\" said Quenthel, \"for a number of reasons. There were circumstances concerning my death and the one who killed me that might have embarrassed my House. It\u0027s not a simple thing, attaining a position like the one I hold. Indeed there is no position like the one I hold ... in Menzoberranzan, at least. It was not a position House Baenre was prepared to concede to any other House. For ten years I was simply \u0027away pursuing studies\u0027 or some other excuse alternating between ludicrous and clever. Eventually I returned, then things happened and I was elevated to Mistress of the Academy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now you\u0027re on your way back,\" Danifae said in hushed, heavy tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s as if someone has a plan for you,\" said Pharaun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one said anything more. Valas walked back to the bags and finished sorting the supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae stood up slowly. Quenthel wasn\u0027t looking at her, but it was clear from her body languagethat the high priestess had finished speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae thought through the revelation quickly but thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter. It didn\u0027t change anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, scanning the deck as she did so. The others had gone back to what they were doing. Each of them was undoubtedly going over in his own mind what Quenthel had said. She turned her back to them and stared at Jeggred. When the draegloth finally looked at her, she signaled him in sign language, careful to keep her hands close to her so the others wouldn\u0027t see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is time, she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe draegloth nodded and glanced meaningfully at the tattered sails of human skin that sagged listlessly in the still air. Danifae nodded and began to ease her way across the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took them both several minutes to maneuver themselves behind the sailwithout making it obvious they were hiding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were safely out of sight, Jeggred signed, Where are we going, Mistress?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae smiled and replied, Hunting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe draegloth\u0027s lips twisted into a fierce smile. The half-demon looked hungry. Danifae stepped closer to him. She could see him stiffen, stand straight-almost at attention. The former battle-captive stepped closer still and wrapped one arm around the half-demon\u0027s huge waist. Jeggred\u0027s gray fur was warm to the touch and a little bit oily. He was surprisingly soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae concentrated on the ring she\u0027d taken from Zinnirit, and in the blink of an eye they were in Sschindylryn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeggred took a deep breath and looked around at the dark interior of the gatehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae took his hand and led him to one of the gates. Not answering his question, she busied herself with the gate itself, activating it first, then tuning the location to the agreed-on meeting place. The portal blazed to life in an almost blinding torrent of violet light. Still holding Jeggred\u0027s hand, she stepped through. The draegloth didn\u0027t hesitate to follow, and they stepped out into a dimly lit ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if Danifae didn\u0027t know exactly where they were she would have known they were on the World Above. The lighting was strange, a different color than anything found in the Underdark. The walls were made of mud bricks-very old, crumbling. Vines and moss grew in the cracks between the bricks, twisting in and out of every crevice, crawling up every wall, and matting the floor, eating away at the structure the way plants did on the World Above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It smells strange here,\" Jeggred grumbled. \"What is this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae looked around to get her bearings. The dull gray light seeped in through dozens if not hundreds of cracks and holes in the decaying walls. On one side of the room a set of uneven steps led up to a floor above. On the other side was a similar staircase leading down. Danifae started up the stairs to the higher room, and Jeggred followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was once a temple to the orcs\u0027 foul, grunting pig-god,\" she explained. \"Now it\u0027s just another piece of rotting garbage being eaten away by the World Above. A suitable place to do what we\u0027ve come here to do, don\u0027t you think?\" \"What have we come here to do?\" asked the draegloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae, disappointed but not surprised that the subtlety was lost on the draegloth, replied, \"The traitors are coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came out into a more brightly lit room, and both of them had to shade their eyes with their hands. Danifae moved to a wide crack in the ancient wall and looked out onto the World Above. The sun had set, but the light was still difficult to take. In time, though, her eyes began to adjust. Half a dozen yards below her was what surface dwellers called a swamp. It was a place where water covered the ground-in most places at least-but it wasn\u0027t a proper lake. The whole area around the temple was choked with alien vegetation. The sounds of the myriad creatures of the World Above were almost deafening. The swamp crawled with life. Beyond the edge of the swamp, miles to the west, was a wide expanse of water: the end of a long river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae let out a slow breath through her nose and heard the draegloth scuffle on the loose rocks behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate this,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Jeggred asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The surface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae scanned the ground below the ruined temple. Finally she drew from a pouch one of the rings she\u0027d taken from Zinnirit and turned it over in her fingers. The fading light played against its polished surface and picked out a scattering of ruby chips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing the ring into one of the draegloth\u0027s four hands she said, \"Use this ring to return at will to the ship of chaos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeggred nodded, slipped the ring on, and stood patiently behind her, listening attentively as sheexplained the proper use of the ring\u0027s magic. Confident that the draegloth understood, Danifae let the minutes drag on-and finally she saw them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There they are,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe draegloth moved closer behind her, and she suppressed a gag when hisbreath rolled over her. She waited while he searched for them, and when he finally saw them he growled low in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re together,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They lied,\" said Danifae. \"She didn\u0027t go to Menzoberranzan. She went to the Velarswood-a forest where there\u0027s a temple to ...\" She feigned difficulty in articulating the word. \"Eilistraee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeggred growled again and said, \"And the weapons master?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s made a choice,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeggred began to growl with every exhale. He was ready to kill. Danifae could smell it on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the male,\" she whispered to the draegloth. \"Just him for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed Jeggred back away from the crack but held him so he wouldn\u0027t leave. Stepping up onto the bottom of the wound in the wall, Danifae drew herself up into the dimming light. She waved a hand over her head to attract her former mistress\u0027s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took an infuriatingly long time, but eventually Halisstra stopped at the edge of the swamp and pointed up at Danifae. Ryld looked up as well, and Halisstra waved in answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae made exaggerated, wide gestures, an unsubtle form of the drow sign language, sending the message: Only you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalisstra turned to Ryld, and they conversed. Even from so far away Danifae could tell that Ryld was reluctant to let her go alone. The weapons master might have been a traitor to his city, his goddess, and his race, but he was no fool. Still, Halisstra managed to convince him-or command him-to stay behind. He stood with his arms crossed as Halisstra stepped gingerly into the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanifae stepped down from the crack in the wall and took the draegloth by the shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoing her best to withstand the half-demon\u0027s foul breath, she said, \"Go. Don\u0027t let her see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe draegloth smiled, and a thick, ropy strand of drool dropped from his lower lip. His fangs glimmered in the dim light, and so did his burning red eyes. Danifae thought he was the most beautiful thing she\u0027d ever seen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-16.html","bookId":2163,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:06 PM"}
