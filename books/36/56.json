Your conversation with God will go on forever. And, now that you are actively engaged in it, that conversation will soon lead to friendship. All good conversations eventually lead to friendship, and soon your conversation with Cod will produce a Friend-ship with God.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI feel that.

You will feel and experience your Self as being in Communion with God.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis will be a Holy Communion, for then We will speak as One.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so this dialogue will continue?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, always.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd I won’t have to say goodbye at the end of this book?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou never have to say goodbye. You only have to say hello.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’re marvelous, do You know that? You’re simply marvelous.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so are you, My son. And so are you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs are all My children, everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDo You have children “everywhere”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo, I mean literally, everywhere. Is there life on other plan-ets? Are Your children elsewhere in the universe?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAgain, of course.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAre these civilizations more advanced?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome of them, yes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn what way?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn every way. Technologically. Politically. Socially. Spiritually. Physically. And psychologically.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, your penchant for, your insistence upon, comparisons, and your constant need to charac-terize something as “better” or “worse,” “higher” or “lower,” “good” or “bad” demonstrates how far into duality you have fallen; how deeply into separatism you have submerged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn more advanced civilizations You do not observe these characteristics? And what do You mean by duality?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe level of a society’s advancement is reflected, inevitably, in the degree of its duality thinking. Social evolution is demonstrated by movement towards unity, not separatism.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhy? Why is unity such a yardstick?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause unity is the truth. Separatism is the illusion. As long as a society sees itself as separate—a series or collection of separate units—it lives in the illusion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of life on your planet is built on separatism; based in duality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou imagine yourselves to be separate families or clans, gathered in separate neighborhoods or states, collected in separate nations or countries, comprising a separate world, or planet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou imagine your world to be the only inhabited world in the universe. You imagine your nation to be the finest nation on earth. You imagine your state to be the best state in the nation, and your family the most wonderful in the state.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFinally, you think that you are better than anyone else in your family.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh, you claim you don’t think any of this, but you act as if you do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour true thoughts are reflected every day in your social decisions, your political conclusions, your relig-ious determinations, your economic choices, and your individual selections of everything from friends to belief systems to your very relationship with God. That is, Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou feel so separate from Me that you imagine I won’t even talk to you. And so you are required to deny the veracity of your own experience. You experience that you and I are One, but you refuse to believe it. Thus you are separate not only from each other, but from your own truth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow can a person be separate from his or her own truth?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy ignoring it. By seeing it and denying it. Or by changing it, twisting it, contorting it to fit a precon-ceived notion you have about what must be so.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTake the question with which you started off here. You asked, is there life on other planets? I answered, “Of course.” I said, “Of course” because the evidence is so obvious. It is so obvious that I’m surprised you even asked the question.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet this is how a person can be “separate from his own truth”: by looking truth in the eye so squarely he can’t miss it—and then denying what he sees.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDenial is the mechanism here. And nowhere is de-nial more insidious than in self-denial.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve spent a lifetime denying Who and What You Really Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt would be sad enough if you limited your denials to less personal things, such as your depletion of the ozone layer, your rape of old-growth forests, your horrible treatment of your young. But you are not content with denying all that you see around you. You won’t rest un-til you deny all that you see within you as well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou see goodness and compassion within you, but you deny it. You see wisdom within you, but you deny it. You see infinite possibility within you, but you deny it. And you see and experience God within you, yet you deny it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou deny that I am within you—that I am you—and in this you deny Me My rightful and obvious place.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have not, and do not, deny You.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou admit that You are God?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, I wouldn’t say that...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExactly. And I tell you this: “Before the cock crows, you will deny Me three times.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy your very thoughts will you deny Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy your very words will you deny Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy your very actions will you deny Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou know in your heart that I am with you, in you; that We are One. Yet you deny Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh, some of you say I exist all right. But away from you. Way out there somewhere. And the further away you imagine Me to be, the further away you step from your own truth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs with so much else in life—from depletion of your planet’s natural resources to the abuse of children in so many of your homes—you see it, but you don’t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut why? Why? Why do we see, and yet not believe?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause you are so caught up in the illusion, you are so deep in the illusion, that you cannot see past it. In-deed, you must not for the illusion to continue. This is the Divine Dichotomy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou must deny Me if you are to continue seeking to become Me. And that is what you are wanting to do. Yet you cannot become what you already are. So denial is important. It is a useful tool.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUntil it is not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe master knows that denial is for those who are choosing to have the illusion continue. Acceptance is for those who choose now for the illusion to end.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAcceptance, proclamation, demonstration. Those are the three steps to God. Acceptance of Who and What You Really Are. Proclamation of it for all the world to hear. And demonstration in every way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSelf-proclamation is always followed by demonstra-tion. You will demonstrate your Self to be God—even as you now demonstrate what you think of your Self. Your whole life is a demonstration of that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet with this demonstration will come your greatest challenge. For the moment you stop denying your Self, others will deny you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe moment you proclaim your Oneness with God, others will proclaim your partnership with Satan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe moment you speak the highest truth, others will say you speak the lowest blasphemy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd, as happens with all masters who gently dem-onstrate their mastery, you will be both worshipped and reviled, elevated and denigrated, honored and cru-cified. Because while for you the cycle will be over, those who are still living in the illusion will not know what to make of you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet what will happen to me? I don’t understand. I’m con-fused. I thought You’ve said, over and over again, that the illu-sion must go on, that the “game” must continue, in order for there to be any “game” at all?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, I have said that. And it does. The game does go on. Because one or two of you end the cycle of illusion, that does not end the game—not for you, and not for the other players.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe game is not ended until All-in-All becomes One again. Even then it is not ended. For in the moment of divine reunion, All with All, will the bliss be so magnifi-cent, so intense, that I-We-You will literally burst wide open with gladness, exploding with joy—and the cycle will begin all over again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt will never end, My child. The game will never end. For the game is life itself, and life is Who We Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut what happens to the individual element, or “Part of All,” as You call it, which rises to mastery, which achieves all-knowing?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat master knows that only his part of the cycle is complete. She knows that only her experience of the il-lusion has ended.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow the master laughs, because the master sees the master plan. The master sees that even with her comple-tion of the cycle, the game goes on; the experience con-tinues. The master then also sees the role he may now play in the experience. The master’s role is to lead others to mastery. And so the master continues to play, but in a new way, and with new tools. For seeing the illusion al-lows the master to step outside of it. This the master will do from time to time when it suits his purpose and pleasure. Thus she proclaims and demonstrates her mastery, and he is called God/Goddess by others.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen all in your race are led to mastery and achieve it, then your race as a whole (for your race is a whole) will move easily through time and space (you will have mastered the laws of physics as you understood them) and you will seek to assist those belonging to other races and other civilizations in coming to mastery as well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven as those of other races and other civilizations are do-ing so now, with us?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExactly. Precisely.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd only when all the races of all the universe have achieved mastery—\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e—or, as I would put it, only when All of Me has known the Oneness—\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e—will this part of the cycle end.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have put it wisely. For the cycle itself will never end.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause the very ending of this part of the cycle is the cycle itself!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBravo! Magnifico!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have understood!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo yes, there is life on other planets. And yes, much of it is more advanced than your own.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn what way? You never really did answer that question.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes I did. I said, in every way. Technologically. Po-litically. Socially. Spiritually. Physically. Psychologically.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, but give me some examples. Those are statements so broad that they are meaningless to me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou know, I love your truth. It’s not everyone who would look God in the eye and announce that what He is saying is meaningless.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo? What are you going to do about it?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExactly. You have exactly the right attitude. Be-cause, of course, you’re right. You can challenge Me, confront Me, and call Me into question as much as you want, and I’m not going to do a damned thing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI may, however, do a blessed thing, such as I’m do-ing here, with this dialogue. Is this not a blessed event?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, this is. And many people have been helped by this. Millions of people have been, are being, touched by this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI know that. It’s all part of the “master plan.” The plan for how you become masters.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou knew from the beginning that this trilogy would be a massive success, didn’t You?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course I did. Who do you suppose has made it such a success? Who do you imagine has caused those people who are reading this to have found their way to it?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI tell you this: I know every person who will come to this material. And I know the reason each has been brought.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so do they.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow the only question is, will they deny Me again?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDoes it matter to You?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot in the least. All My children will one day come back to Me. It is not a question of whether, but of when. And so, it may matter to them. Therefore, let those who have ears to hear, listen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, well—we were talking about life on other planets, and You were about to give me some examples of how it is so much more advanced than life on Earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTechnologically, most other civilizations are far ahead of you. There are those which are behind you, so to speak, but not many. Most are far ahead of you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn what way? Give me an example.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOkay, the weather. You don’t seem able to control it. (You can’t even accurately predict it!) You are, there-fore, subject to its whims. Most worlds are not. The be-ings on most planets can control the local temperature, for example.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey can? I thought temperature on a planet was a product of its distance from its sun, its atmosphere, etc.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThose things establish the parameters.

Yet you are in denial about this. That is, most of you will not admit it. Even when the finest minds among you prove beyond doubt the damage you are doing, you will not acknowledge it. You call the finest minds among you crazed, and say that you know better.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOr you say that these wise people only have an ax to grind, a point of view to validate, and their own inter-ests to protect. Yet it is you who are grinding an ax. It is you who are seeking to validate a point of view. And it is you who are protecting your special interests.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd your chief interest is yourself.

It took so long because to stop the poisoning would cost many major companies a great deal of money. It took so long because it would cost many individual people their conveniences.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt took so long because for years many people and nations chose to deny—needed to deny—the evidence in order to protect their interest in the status quo; in keeping things the way they are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnly when the rate of skin cancers increased alarm-ingly, only when the temperatures began rising and the glaciers and snows began melting, and the oceans got warmer and the lakes and rivers began flooding, did more of you begin paying attention.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnly when your own self-interest demanded it, did you see the truth that your finest minds had been plac-ing before you for years.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s wrong with self-interest? I thought You said in Book I that self-interest was the place to start.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI did, and it is. Yet in other cultures and other socie-ties on different planets, the definition of “self-interest” is much larger than it is on your world. It is very clear to enlightened creatures that what hurts one hurts the many, and that what benefits the few must benefit the many, or, ultimately, it benefits no one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOn your planet it is just the opposite. What hurts one is ignored by the many, and what benefits the few is denied the many.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is because your definition of self-interest is very narrow, barely reaching past the individual being to his loved ones—and to those only when they do his bidding.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, I said in Book 1 that in all relationships, do what is in the best interests of the Self. But I also said that when you see what is in your highest self-interest, you will see that it is that which is also in the highest interest of the other—for you and the other are One.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou and all others are One—and this is a level of knowingness that you have not attained.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’re asking about advanced technologies, and I tell you this: You cannot have advanced technologies in any beneficial way without advanced thinking.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAdvanced technology without advanced thought creates not advancement, but demise.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have already experienced that on your planet, and you are very nearly about to experience it again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat do You mean?

You had a civiliza-tion on Earth more advanced than the one now exist-ing.

Its technologi-cal evolution was so far ahead of its spiritual evolution that it wound up making technology its God. The peo-ple worshipped technology, and all that it could create and bring. And so they got all that their unbridled tech-nology brought—which was unbridled disaster.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey literally brought their world to an end.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis all happened here, on this Earth?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAre You talking about the Lost City of Atlantis?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome of you have called it that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lemuria?

Indeed, they are dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is the mark of a primitive society to call regression progress. Your society has moved backward, not for-ward.

I’m merely showing you that “primitive” is not necessarily pejorative. It is your judgment that makes it so. “Primitive” is merely descriptive.

It says nothing about “right” or “wrong.” You add those meanings.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have not “made you wrong” here. I have merely described your culture as primitive.
