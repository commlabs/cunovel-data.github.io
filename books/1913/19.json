She’d endured enough sniping for the day. She caught a glimpse of Sully through the pass-through. What would he do if she just up and joined him? She could lean against the counter and sip her tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tore her eyes away. The last thing she needed was a fry cook for a love interest. Best to stick to her previous plan: pouring heart and soul into the historical society. Which meant planning the best festival the area had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we should advertise this year,” Marlene interjected. “What do you girls think?” She purposely included both Bailey sisters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have all kinds of ideas about how we could handle it,” Laura said. “I’ll do a press release, of course. Maybe align ourselves with some celebrity figure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ladies cooed at that. Laura was a handful—not like Edith at all—and when she was in charge, she was something else again. She’d always been ambitious that way, must’ve gotten it from Bear. Even back in her high school days, Laura was the kid who’d sneak out after curfew and still make honor roll. It was clear why she was so successful as a career woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know all this?” Pearl asked, her voice awed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura brightened. “I have tons of marketing experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we’ve heard,” Sorrow muttered. “Five thousand times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s wonderful,” said Ruby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Edith, you must be so proud,” Pearl added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith smiled and reached across the table to pat her daughter’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gesture gave Marlene the tiniest of pangs. She loved her boys, but had always wondered what it would’ve been like to have a daughter. Her sourpuss daughter-in-law definitely didn’t count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d be thrilled to take over publicity,” Laura said, positively beaming. “We could do some online promotions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds fabulous,” Marlene told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With what money?” Sorrow’s voice was flat, and it gave Marlene pause. The girl looked like steam was about to pour from her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura waved off the question. “We won’t need much. We’ll use Twitter. Make a Facebook fan page. Guerilla marketing stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gorillas?” Mama took that moment to tune in, sounding alarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePearl snuck a skeptical look at Ruby. “I don’t think we have a permit for those.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think the fairgrounds will allow wild animals,” Ruby agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene choked back a laugh and almost spat out her tea. “She meant guerilla, like in warfare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePearl gave her head a prim shake. “I think Buck Larsen is enough of a theme.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, dear.” Ruby gave Laura a soothing look. “We don’t need to include things about wars, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene rolled her eyes. This wasn’t exactly going as planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorrow scooted her stool back with a loud scrape. “You know, you ladies have at it. My fearless sister seems to have this under control.” She sidled up to the bar, calling into the kitchen, “Sully, I’d love you forever if you made me one of your cookie sundaes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peeked out from the pass-through, a smile warming his face. “You got it, kid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene thought back. The last time she had a sundae she’d been a kid herself. It made her think, Sully was so great with the Bailey kids, it was too bad he didn’t have children of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart stuttered. Maybe he did. The man might have two dozen kids out there somewhere—how was she to know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly lost all interest in the conversation happening at the table and strained to catch every word of Sully and Sorrow’s exchange. She studied his profile as he scooped the ice cream—the man had a strong, clean-shaven jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peeked out again. “You still like whipped cream?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorrow made a face. “Duh. It’s not really a sundae if there’s no whipped cream. And please, will you do that thing with the chocolate sauce?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene held her breath, waiting to hear his response. But none came. All the man did was smile a knowing smile. Take off that apron, put him in a collared shirt, and he’d be downright dashing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women’s conversation became a meaningless drone around her. That was it. She had to find an excuse to join them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sliding Sorrow’s treat toward her when Marlene came up to the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You make desserts, too?” She’d made her voice breezy and self-possessed, but it cracked to see that Sully’s special chocolate thing was to squirt a big, cursive S with chocolate sauce along the top. She sucked in a breath, murmuring, “Adorable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorrow grinned. “S for Sorrow.” She plucked the cherry from the top of his creation and popped it into her mouth. “Sully’s cookie sundaes are to die for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene studied it. “Cookie sundae?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup, there are cookies all along the bottom. He bakes them himself.” Sorrow shoveled in a huge bite and sighed with pleasure. She covered a hand in front of her mouth to say, “I make a mean Crème Brûlée, and it still couldn’t compete with Sully’s chocolate chip peanut butter cookie sundae.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell, woman. I’ll make you one.” Sully leaned against the bar. He had biceps like no sixty-something man should have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t,” she said, considering both the ice cream and the strong arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his eyes on her. “You can’t eat ice cream?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I can. I just shouldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe refused that answer. “If it’s your figure you’re worried about, you can throw those concerns right out the door.” There was something assessing in his eyes. The way he’d spoken with such intensity about her figure heated her blood. “I say you need some ice cream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully grabbed a spoon, and Marlene’s mouth went dry. This man was a far cry from her husband, who’d never given two hoots what she needed or wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Try this,” he said, as he assembled a spoonful of ice cream, cookie, and whipped cream in careful proportions. “The secret is mixing the dough in with the ice cream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be sure to break off enough cookie from along the bottom,” Sorrow told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for the spoon, dumbfounded. Her husband had never tried to feed her ice cream. Her husband had thought she needed to watch her waistline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sully didn’t hand her the spoon. Instead, he reached it toward her mouth. “Have a taste.” His voice was like gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart kicked to life in her chest. The last time a man fed her something, she must’ve been in her twenties. She hesitated, then opened her mouth. Risking eye contact, she saw Sully’s eyes were riveted on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she tasted the ice cream. Shutting her eyes in bliss, she sighed a purring, contented sound. When she opened her eyes, she couldn’t stop the grin from spreading across her face. “You’ve got a way with food, Tom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment’s lull in the tavern as the women read the letters and Bear stopped talking to sip his beer. Sully’s voice filled the silence. “I want a day off.” There was something intense in his voice, something driven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear put down his glass and gave him a blank look. “What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene watched avidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said I need a day off, Bear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did Sully do on his time off? Did he date women he met on the Internet? Take them out for drinks? Would he ever ask her out for drinks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m taking a night off.” And then Tom Sullivan met her eyes, and it was as though he’d read her mind. “A man needs to live his life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God…what now?” Sorrow was trying on one of the old dresses she’d found in the attic when a loud thud reverberated through the house. As she raced for the stairs, the heavy fabric swirled between her legs—how had pioneer women managed?—but she galloped down, doing her best not to trip, half expecting to find the walls caved in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe darted from room to room, stopping short at the door to the den. Her sister. Of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the…?” Her eyes goggled, catching sight of a giant black workout contraption. A couple of men in blue-shirted uniforms were rearranging the furniture to make room. “What on earth is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura smirked and pointed at her dress. “The question is, what on earth is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, embarrassed, tugging the low neckline up and the tight bodice out. “I asked you first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s an elliptical trainer.” Laura gave her an aggravatingly innocent smile. “You’re looking pretty saucy, baby sister. Is that one of Sorrow Crabtree’s dresses?” Then her eyes lit. “Hey, I know. We should have people dress up. You know, for the festival.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if Laura cared about the festival, really. Getting dolled up in costume would probably be just another way for her trim sister to get attention. “You just want to dress up for the festival.” She turned her glare at Laura’s contraption. “What’s that doing here?” Just the sight of it made her chest tighten. Moving the furniture had revealed more than she cared to see—the brown carpet was five shades darker where the couch had been, and the baseboards were caked with dust. Just more things for her to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cardio,” Laura answered brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put it in your room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t fit in my room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course it won’t, because it’s ginormous. Careful!” Sorrow dashed between her dad’s recliner and the wall. The moving men were hauling the huge leather chair out of the way and getting too close to the television in the process. If they damaged either, she’d be the one to pay the price. She swung on her sister. “Laura, this cannot go in here.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sierra-falls-sierra-falls-1/page-19.html","bookId":1913,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:27 PM"}
