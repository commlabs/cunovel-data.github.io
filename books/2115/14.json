I wondered, primed to feel guilty about Ric\u0027s and my late, leisurely lunch at the Bahama Breeze at the juncture of Howard Hughes Center Road and Parkway near Paradise and Flamingo. That\u0027s where and when I explained my and Helena \u0027s hit-and-run cross-country trip. I even promised Ric a Vampire Sunrise soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy tale bemused and amused him. He was also too unquestioning. I realized Helena \u0027s therapeutic hypnotism had put her in the back of his mind so that I could remain up front to tend and pamper him. My respect for her tripled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restaurant was so very Vegas, and the pi\u0026amp;ntilde;a coladas were almost as good as my homemade cocktails. They even allowed Quicksilver inside for a grilled steak kabob... as long as he ate it under the table and from my skewer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the estate, Godfrey was unruffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good day, Miss, Master Quicksilver. Splendid to see you back, Mr. Montoya. I am posted here to take your belongings, Miss, and establish Master Quicksilver at the cottage. We presume you will drive Mr. Montoya to his place of residence. Should you require a change of costume, this bag will suit your needs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took our paper shopping bags and handed another to Ric in Dolly\u0027s passenger seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick jumped out of the backseat and ran to the top of the Enchanted Cottage\u0027s semicircular stairs, barking once in protest at being left behind as I drove back out on Sunset Road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic suddenly slapped his forehead with a palm. \"Say. We need to pick up my Corvette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmigod! I wasn\u0027t about to stimulate bad memories by breezing past the Karnak \u0027s parking lot for a look-see. Maybe Ric\u0027s gal pal, Captain Kennedy Malloy of the LVMPD, could check into that. I imagined a delicate and unpleasant conversation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why can\u0027t Ric Montoya deal with getting his own car from the Karnak parking ramp, Miss Street?\" Malloy would ask in icy disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s still recovering from my raising him from the dead,\" I\u0027d reply. \"It\u0027s best he doesn\u0027t deal with the little things for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I am a \u0027little thing\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, like many women in authority, she was way more petite than I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, asking Malloy to retrieve Ric\u0027s car wouldn\u0027t work. My best bet for that was my friends, the parking valet demons. They went crazy over vintage rides and Ric\u0027s bronze Stringray was one, if not as venerable as my own Dolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI texted Ric\u0027s home address to Hermie at the Karnak and requested the car\u0027s \"discreet\" return to his home address garage. Ric must have parked the Vette on the Karnak grounds and demons had an infallible nose for Old Detroit metal. Foreign models just didn\u0027t do it for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I really needed to find out was what Ric\u0027s mental wheels could remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worry about your ride later, hombre,\" I purred in a kittenish way I\u0027d picked up from late-night TV movies. \"You look good in my passenger seat for now.\" Was I turning into your usual manipulative fatal femme or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand smoothed the red leather interior. \"I\u0027d rather drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you\u0027re better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can get better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned to hear that cheeky optimism back. Ric was pretty quick with the quips for a dead man. My hands tightened on the big steering wheel with the finger indentations sculpted on the underside. I had a lot of verbal tap-dancing on the truth ahead of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe soon reached his rambling house in an established Vegas gated community. I parked Dolly inside the courtyard, so Old Mexico. At Ric\u0027s Alamo-massive dark wood front door I suddenly realized he\u0027d been found naked. No house keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, we\u0027re still missing your personal effects,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers tapped out a pattern too quick to see on the security keypad. The heavy door jerked ajar as the system beeped. Ric\u0027s short-term memory might be AWOL, but he recalled the important things. I was glad to be one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was cool and dark, shuttered against the peak late-afternoon heat. We turned on lights as we went through the public rooms right to the bedroom and into the master bathroom beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Del,\" he said, yanking out the impeccable knot he\u0027d only put into the new tie a couple hours before. \"I really need a shave and a real shower. I feel like I\u0027ve been through... I don\u0027t know, been crawling through some rank slimy jungle for hours. Like my skin is crawling. Except for my back, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted me to sit atop the long bathroom countertop and began to take off the clothes I\u0027d just seen him put on. I was beginning to get why men went to strip clubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slip-on shoes and silky socks went first, then the men\u0027s bedroom \"butler\" stand got the pants, shirt, and tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really like these things?\" he asked of the briefs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yeah.\" Trust the Swiss to engineer underwear to its most smoothly structured second-skin state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic touched his neck bandage just below the beard line, then picked up an electric razor that looked like a Martian spaceship probe from The War of the Worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a hand on his wrist. \"Some like it rough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, I wanted to get past the settling-in process to the thing all men hate: talking it over. I\u0027d probably have to sleep with him first, which was fine with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, then put down the razor and turned his bare brown back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already knew,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other night, when I slept over in the den. I woke up first. You\u0027d turned over in your sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn! I never do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was my fault. I can\u0027t sleep on my back so you forgot to keep your back out of the light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you acted kind of... weird that morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never try to fool an ex-FBI man.\" I ran a finger down his shoulder blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut his eyes in remembered past pain and present pleasure. \"So when and where\u0027d you get the Midol touch, paloma?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every miracle has its price.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom must have told you what and why. She swore it was just between us when I was ten years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were a child and she was acting as your psychologist. Things change. People change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You changed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Superficially.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You changed my past. You replaced my past with whatever you did to me last night. I\u0027d be a fool to resent that, but I need to know what and why, just as you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers plucked the faint silver skeins of scars on his back like a harp, sending shivers of sensual pleasure through his frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught my wrists in his hands, then in a one-handed grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Delilah. You don\u0027t play me to distraction. I know I\u0027m foggy about a lot of things. First a shower, then bed, then you spill your guts. S��?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed as he pulled me off the countertop and tugged me toward the shower. It was one of those glass curves with a tiled wall and floor and sprays versatile enough for a car wash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m still dressed!\" I objected, but I kicked off my casual mules as I went with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll have to get all those wet things off when we\u0027re done. I\u0027m not letting you loose to work your wiles. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t stop laughing as he turned on the water. I shut my eyes to the warm tropical waterfalls of modern plumbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all I remembered going through, and all he couldn\u0027t remember going through, that simple chlorinated city water seemed to rinse our skins and souls clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic peeled me out of my sopping top and jeans until I was as naked and free as he was. Well, except for the silver familiar. It had curled down into a big toe ring, either shy or savvy about staying out of the way. Anyway, our impromptu coed shower had us both feeling safe and happy, even though that could never last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My bed this time, a real bed?\" Ric asked. \"You can be on top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeds were my b��te noire, thanks to childhood nightmares. I couldn\u0027t bear to lie on my back, feel pinned. But if Ric was my bed and lay under me...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we waltzed into the bedroom, smooching, and I finally dared really look at his bed, I melted like a shelled M \u0026amp;M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheets were black satin, all the better to set off my Snow White skin. The many piled pillows were encased in blue satin, to set off my ballad-black hair and blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I could harbor no doubt this man was as terminally crazy about me as I was about him. Color-coordinated bed linens, can you dig it? I shut my eyes. This felt like a continuation of the Inferno bridal suite wedding night, when I kissed my comatose prince whole and awake again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve wanted you here for a long time,\" he said. \"I guess you can tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only been weeks, Montoya,\" I reminded him as I pushed him down, under me. Ric could sweep me away like a swooning bondage princess or let me ride him like a Valkyrie. What a guy. Thanks to Helena \u0027s shrink insights, I understood that his sexual versatility was adapting to my conflicting needs for both trust and independence... surrender and control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay, maybe I could accomplish another bit of sexual healing, as the song said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to shut my eyes to block the image of his dead-to-the-world body crawling with black leeches and blue-winged tsetse flies feeding on his genitals as well as every inch of skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis ready erection then at my presence was his miracle, not mine, and I blessed his foster mother (yeah, she\u0027d approve) for giving him this pleasant, delayed return to reality. Maybe I could extend it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glimpsed a familiar glint behind his head and pulled away the color-coordinated pillows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a mirrored headboard, Montoya?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bought it before I knew you and about your mirror magic,\" he protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his protests, however sincere, were too late. I\u0027d spotted the chrome border and churchlike spires at the top framing the beveled mirror squares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is so tacky,\" I said. \"You have really gone over to Vegas glitz. Hunt-club Virginia bluebloods would be shocked. Stay right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced into the master bath and the huge closet, snagging the sky-blue tie and a similarly smooth, silky black one to match the d��cor honoring moi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrma was trying to urge me to tasteful restraint, but that was exactly what I had in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been found in the Land of the Book of the Dead, slumped half sitting against a wall, his wrists in chains above his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reappeared with the ties swagged around my hips entwined with the double glints of my own hip chain and the silver familiar. Belly-dancing gear was Ric\u0027s Achilles\u0027 heel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delilah,\" he said, his voice both a warning and a goad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay right there,\" I answered, unleashing the ties and looping them around his wrists and the headboard spires. \"I\u0027m going to kiss you all over until you beg for mercy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe map of his face and body bites was burned into my memory. My Brimstone Kiss lips were going to visit the site of every atrocity, erased maybe, but still needing a sensory remodeling. Pleasure where pain had been. So simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took it for an erotic game. That showed how far I had come, repressed Kansas orphan me. I could seduce Ric into taking this healing necessity that admitted how deeply he\u0027d been lost, how close he\u0027d been to a tortured-to-death vampire victim, as Delilah\u0027s naughty little bedroom improvisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat we were here, able to make love and deceive ourselves, just a little, to get us through the night, testified to our mutual loyalty. I untied him just as playfully as I\u0027d confined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t stop now,\" he complained as his arms wrapped around me. \"I\u0027d love to do this same thing to you.\" His luxurious, probing kisses punctuated a list of druthers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, paloma... on my midnight black sheets... your white naked body on your back... I\u0027d make you moan... like you made me moan... when you made my back... your personal paranormal playground... and my old scars... my new erotic zone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, oh, oh. I so wanted what he did. I was almost climaxing before his arms lifted my torso so he could impale my soft center and take me for a wild ride on a bucking bronco, my long hair whipping around my face and neck like a mane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic was back, stallion-strong, loving me more than ever. His release matched mine and justified everything. For the first time, I felt less soiled by the Brimstone Kiss. For the first time, I felt a throb of inner peace that I had taken and given that potent kiss in such quick succession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was getting back to what it\u0027d been Before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Karnak Hotel vampire Pharaohs had lured Ric into their power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I risked my free will and traded Snow the addictive Brimstone Kiss for Snow\u0027s help in rescuing Ric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore my attempts at the Kiss of Life, aka CPR, failed and I resorted to a last, passionate farewell kiss... tainted by the brimstone of compromise yet containing the new gift of the Resurrection Kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat scenario was a lot for one Latin lover to absorb so I concentrated on our reunion and union, until we collapsed on each other in waves of fulfillment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is wild,\" Ric said. \"I have this whole new erotic zone.\" He wriggled his back into the satin sheets as I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" he added, \"I don\u0027t remember anything from early that afternoon a week ago when I went to check out the Karnak until you were tongue-lashing my back with your velvet lips last night. How\u0027d you find Helena anyway? Why didn\u0027t she stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said what you needed was me, hombre, and she was right. You\u0027d mentioned your father\u0027s full name once. Philip Burnside. I\u0027m a reporter. Once is enough.\" I considered. \"Not with everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Forget it. No more sex until I know what\u0027s going on from A to Z,\" he threatened, getting up to leave the bed and the bedroom. He showed me his naked back without a qualm. I wished I could be as forthright about what he wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned with a bottle of roja wine, no brand I recognized but a vintage as red and smooth and warm as blood. We drank it out of big bubble glasses as we leaned against piled satin pillows the color of my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember anything about your kidnapping?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that what it was? I, um, remember heading to the Karnak Hotel and Casino. Grisly Bahr had alerted me by phone that someone from there had just contacted the coroner\u0027s office with suspicious questions about the male corpse from the Sunset Park grave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t pause to tell me where you were going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bother you with a slender lead at an established hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d just lectured me about keeping current on who was doing what, where. In fact, I was trying to call you that day to say I\u0027d checked out the Karnak the day before and it was crawling with vamps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found out soon enough, but I don\u0027t remember much yet. So what are they like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As old as the ancient tomb paintings and as eternally young-looking. I\u0027d only gotten out, and that barely, thanks to my mirror magic skills. I didn\u0027t realize until the next day that the folks in charge were obsessively interested in the zombies you pulled out of the ground at Cesar Cicereau\u0027s Starlight Lodge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying that my raising the zombies to protect you in the mountains last month tipped these Karnak vampires off to my, um, talent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You saved my skin from being mounted in the werewolf mobster trophy teepee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should these Karnak vamps care? So I stopped another Vegas hotel mogul\u0027s hit squad. You\u0027d think they\u0027d thank me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they would have, had you cooperated. They want someone who can raise really old vampires, the ugly, ruthless bloodsuckers, not the modern half-and-half kind. We both know how you feel about raising the dead for other people\u0027s gain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will never sell bodies and souls into slavery again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admirable. I will never starve again, or eat turnips again.\" His grin showed I\u0027d lightened his dark mood by evoking Scarlett O\u0027Hara\u0027s famed turning-point vow. \"Holy Hathor, Montoya! You must have made that all too clear to the Karnak vamps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They decided to induct you into their club so you\u0027d want to do what they wanted. When the expedition from the other Vegas hotels found you, the Karnak vamps had sucked you dry, Ric. They\u0027d used every bloodsucker they had access to, even leeches and vampire tsetse flies. You were-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I don\u0027t remember anything after arriving at the Karnak lobby. I recall a huge hyena-headed statue of a god I\u0027d never seen or heard of before in the main check-in area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027d already ID\u0027ed you, as they had me, and were waiting to pounce. Luckily. I doubt we\u0027ll ever know what kind of t��te-��-t��te you had with the terrifyingly self-absorbed Twin Pharaohs who rule the Karnak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kephron and Kepherati, two of the most incestuous brother-sister royal twins the River Nile ever birthed. It\u0027s a long story, but I found archaeological evidence on the web that the ancient Egyptians had vampires among them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw. Their culture keyed on death and resurrection, life and the afterlife, true, but I\u0027ve never heard of Egyptian vampires. Anne Rice had an \u0027immortal\u0027 mummy running around World War I England in one novel, but I don\u0027t think he sucked blood. The Egyptians are almost the only ancient world culture without vampire lore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quoth the raven?\" he asked, leaning forward to kiss me long and deep and totally without fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poe\u0027s raven was carping about \u0027nevermore.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more, nevermore, what\u0027s the diff? I\u0027m okay, you\u0027re okay. We\u0027re so more than okay together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I believed that as easily as he did. It was indeed all too easy to soften into his arms and strum my fingers over the silvery scar strings on his now sensually tuned back and celebrate life and love and libido.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how did you know where I was and what was going on?\" he asked when our embrace took a time-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEternal ex-FBI man, asking questions. The habit of intellectualizing would probably save his sanity. I smiled and resumed my narrative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The clue I\u0027d found was that some Egyptian tombs, from the most ancient and lost to the most celebrated finds of modern times, including King Tut, contained a weird potted artifact of a gilded headless animal hide hanging from a lotus plant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Headless? Like the \u0027bone boy\u0027 in the Sunset Park grave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mentally acute and decidedly not dead,\" I said, smiling. \"That\u0027s my boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This \u0027artifact\u0027 was the symbol of beheaded vampires in the Egyptian tombs, the proof that even pharaohs like Tutankhamen could be vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so. Meanwhile, the Peter Lorre CinSim at the Karnak has many shared movie ties to the Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains CinSims at the Inferno. He\u0027d seen me captured, and then escape. He must have realized your capture was act two of the royal twins\u0027 ambitious scenario. When he saw you being held and forced to suck winding cloths, the \u0027better angels of his being\u0027 emerged from behind the creepy criminal roles and came to the rescue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CinSims have \u0027better angels\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A theory of mine. I think the actors are taking over the roles. It was an incredible string of events. The Karnak\u0027s Peter Lorre \u0027Ugarte\u0027 Casablanca CinSim somehow managed to break his venue moorings and get a physical token I\u0027d lost at the Karnak to me at the Inferno Bar as a veiled warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did it using the Inferno\u0027s Humphrey Bogart \u0027Rick Blaine\u0027 CinSim, who broke free of the lower-level Casablanca key club and got to the William Powell \u0027Nick Charles\u0027 CinSim at the Inferno Bar. Nicky somehow tipped off his \u0027cousin\u0027 William Powell CinSim, Godfrey, at Hector\u0027s estate. Who told me to get to the Inferno Bar to pump Rick Blaine of all the things he didn\u0027t think he knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gosh, Delilah! I need one of those star maps of Hollywood, Las Vegas-style, to follow this scenario.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Consider it as a CinSim chain reaction, and damn efficient in its dysfunctional way. Trust me. We\u0027ve got a long ways to go before we understand the hows and whys of CinSims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, I was called to the Inferno Bar in my best thirties velvet gown to evoke Rick Blaine\u0027s film ladylove, Ilsa/Ingrid Bergman. I picked his brain like a noir femme fatale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the Inferno\u0027s Rick Blaine physically produced the case of Lip Venom I\u0027d unknowingly dropped during my escape from the Karnak, I realized someone at the Karnak wanted me to go back there, bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also realized that you weren\u0027t answering my calls because of the usual Vegas Strip cell-phone dead zone, but were actually missing. That\u0027s when I finally grasped that the Royal Pains had been much more interested in your zombie-raising act than my minor mirror magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is,\" Ric asked, \"where Christophe and his rock-star persona\u0027s Brimstone Kiss come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOuch. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard of the Brimstone Kiss,\" he said dismissively, the way even the best guys sometimes don\u0027t get girls with long-distance but potent crushes. \"Heartthrob singers always sucker the fangirls with some sexy stage shtick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody does it like Snow does, Irma singsonged softly in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gritted my teeth and gave Ric a palatable song-and-dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly right. Only, Snow has some ulterior motive for kissing strangers. He takes it semi-seriously and insisted I accept the infamous kiss if I wanted his help invading the Karnak and springing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped I\u0027d sounded casual enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some freaking stage kiss?\" Ric asked. \"You\u0027d think a rock star could get whole harems of a lot more than kisses in the dressing room every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like a job application. The dude thinks he\u0027s going to find Cinderella or something. I didn\u0027t pass the glass lip-lock test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He kissed you? You let him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think Ric was ready for the potential multiple orgasm part yet. Maybe never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I\u0027ve never been the groupie type. I admit I found it pretty humiliating and sure hated the idea of kissing another man when I was rounding up a rescue party for you, mi amor. But it proved worth the hassle. Ric, he raised a dragon from its ashes to help take down the mummy legions!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No big deal. I can raise zombies. So back to this kiss thing-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a big deal. I really, really didn\u0027t want to be unfaithful to you but I guessed he was the only Vegas mogul who could or would save you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see you were between a rock and a soft place. A kiss is just a kiss,\" Ric consoled me, ironically quoting the song from Casablanca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Snow\u0027s,\" I admitted. \"The mosh-pit women who get it are forever addicted to trying to get another, but they never do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Women go nuts over those rock idols.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once was enough for me, since it got you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t mention how very specifically it got him \"back.\" From the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can dig the bastard would want to kiss you but it\u0027s awful petty to make a guy\u0027s girlfriend give out just to revive a dead dragon and take on a pack of vampire mummies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, as he meant me to do, glad this iffy confession was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, a kiss is just a kiss unless it\u0027s a key to immortality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-sunrise-delilah-street-3/page-14.html","bookId":2115,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:47 PM"}
