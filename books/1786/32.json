He carved buttons with a small knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re looking for Shuri,\" Kev said in the old language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy glanced over his shoulder into the tent. \"Mainl.\" he called. \"There are two men to see you. Roma dressed like gadjos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA singular-looking woman came to the entrance. She was not quite five feet tall, but her torso and head were broad, her complexion dark and wrinkled, her eyes lustrous and black. Kev recognized her immediately. It was indeed Shuri, who had only been about sixteen when she had married the rom baro. Kev had left the tribe not long after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe years had not been kind to her. Shuri had once been a striking beauty, but a life of hardship had aged her prematurely. Although she and Kev were nearly the same age, the difference between them could have been twenty years instead of two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at Kev without much interest. Then her eyes widened, and her gnarled hands moved in a gesture commonly used to protect oneself against evil spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kev,\" she breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Shuri,\" he said with difficulty, and followed it with a greeting he hadn\u0027t said since childhood. \"Droboy tume Romale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a spirit?\" she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan looked at him alertly. \"Kev?\" he repeated. \"Is that your tribal name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev ignored him. \"I\u0027m not a spirit, Shuri.\" He gave her a reassuring smile. \"If I were, I wouldn\u0027t have grown any older, would I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, her eyes slitting in a leery squint. \"If it\u0027s really you, show me the mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I do it inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long hesitation, Shuri nodded reluctantly, waving both Kev and Rohan into the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam paused at the entrance and spoke to the boy. \"Make certain the horses aren\u0027t stolen,\" he said, \"and I\u0027ll give you a half crown.\" He wasn\u0027t certain whether the horses would be more in danger from the Chorodies or the Roma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, kako,\" the boy said, using a respectful form of address for a much older male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling ruefully, Cam followed Merripen into the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe structure was made of rods stuck into the ground and bent at the top, with other supporting rods fastened to it with string. The whole of it was covered with coarse brown cloth that had been pinned together over the ribs of the structure. There were no chairs or tables. To a Rom, the ground served perfectly well for both purposes. But there was an abundant pile of pots and trenchers in the corner, and a light pallet covered with cloth. The interior of the tent was heated by a small coke fire glowing in a three-legged pan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Shuri\u0027s direction, Cam sat cross-legged by the fire pan. He stifled a grin as Shuri insisted on seeing Merripen\u0027s tattoo, which provoked a long-suffering glance from him. Being a modest and private man, Merripen was probably cringing inside at having to undress in front of them. But he set his jaw and tugged off his coat, and unbuttoned his vest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than remove his shirt entirely, Merripen unfastened it and let it fall to reveal his upper back and shoulders, the muscled slopes gleaming like copper. The tattoo was still a mildly startling sight to Cam, who had never seen it on anyone but himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering in deep Romany, using a few words that sounded like Sanskrit, Shuri moved behind Kev to look at the tattoo. Merripen\u0027s head lowered, and he breathed quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam \u0027s amusement faded as he saw Merripen\u0027s face, detached save for a slight frown. For Cam it would have been a joy and a relief to encounter someone from his past. For Merripen, the experience was pure misery. But he bore it with a stoic endurance that touched Cam. And Cam discovered that he didn\u0027t like to see Merripen being made so vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter glancing at the mark of the nightmare horse, Shuri moved away from Merripen and motioned for him to dress himself. \"Who is this man?\" she asked, nodding in Cam \u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of my kumpania,\" Merripen muttered. Kumpa-nia was a word used to describe a clan, a group united though not necessarily by family ties. Pulling his clothes back on, Merripen asked brusquely, \"What happened to the tribe. Shuri? Where is the rom baro?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the ground,\" the woman said, with a pointed lack of respect for her husband. \"And the tribe is scattered. After the tribe saw what he did to you, Kev… making us leave you for dead… it all went bad after that. No one wanted to follow him. The gadjos finally hanged him, when he was caught making wafodu luvvu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\" Cam asked, unable to follow her accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Counterfeit money,\" Merripen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before that,\" Shuri continued, \"the rom baro had tried to make some of the young boys into asharibe, to earn coins at fairs and in the London streets. But none of them could fight like you, and their parents would only let the rom baro go so far with them.\" Her shrewd dark eyes turned in Cam \u0027s direction. \"The rom baro called Kev his fighting dog,\" she said. \"But the dogs were treated better than he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shuri-,\" Merripen muttered, scowling. \"He doesn\u0027t need to know-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband wanted Kev to die,\" she continued, \"but even the rom baro wouldn\u0027t dare to kill him outright. So he starved the boy and put him in too many fights, and gave him no bandages or salve for his wounds. He was never given a blanket, only a bed of straw. We used to sneak food and medicine to him when the rom baro wasn\u0027t looking. But there was no one to defend him, poor boy.\" Her gaze turned chiding as she spoke to Merripen directly. \"And it wasn\u0027t easy to help you, when you would do nothing but snarl and snap. Never a word of thanks, not even a smile.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-32.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM"}
