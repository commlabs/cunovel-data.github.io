{"id":53616,"no":1291,"title":"Chapter 1287: Outsider!","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[/expand]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the words left his mouth, the starry sky grew incredibly cold, as if invisible ice was spreading out rapidly in all directions. Wherever it passed, the fleeing cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were filled with intense coldness, causing their souls to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that he didn’t have to worry about the Meng Clan, Meng Hao turned to look at the cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, and his killing intent exploded out. He actually didn\u0027t have any personal vendetta with these people, and in fact, as the future Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm, it would probably be appropriate to let them off a bit lightly, and not kill them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, there was a greater war coming, and the stronger the Mountain and Sea Realm was in general, the better. However, despite being aware of that, Meng Hao didn’t choose that course of action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not a hero or a leader, he was just an ordinary cultivator, a former scholar who had always dreamed of being rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad they not provoked him, he could have let things drop. But they had attempted to exterminate the Meng Clan, which was something he couldn’t tolerate. In fact, he didn’t even want to tolerate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted coldly and took a step forward. When his foot fell, an incredible pressure began to weigh down, covering the entire area in the blink of an eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds could be heard, as if there were invisible collisions up in the starry sky. The thousands of cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea all coughed up huge mouthfuls of blood, and expressions of complete astonishment and terror covered their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them dared to fight back. They remained in place, trembling and looking with terror at Meng Hao, not even daring to make the slightest of movements, let alone flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarquis Lu’s face fell, but then he gritted his teeth, causing violet light to radiate out from him. It quickly enveloped him, whereupon he burst into movement, apparently intending to break out from the pressure crushing down from Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I say you could leave?!” Meng Hao said coolly. He took another step forward, vanishing, then reappearing directly in front of Marquis Lu. He waved his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn incredible force exploded out from Meng Hao, which transformed into a tempest. When it slammed into Marquis Lu, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he tumbled backward like a kite with its string cut. A fierce expression could be seen on his face as he managed to stop in place, then glared at Meng Hao, flames of madness dancing in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m one of the three Marquis of the Seventh Mountain, Lu Yunli!” he shrieked. “If you dare to harm me, the Seventh Mountain will hunt you down and kill you, no matter where you run to!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao\u0027s only response was to take a third step forward, and then unleash the Life-Extermination Fist, shooting forward and slamming his fist into Marquis Lu’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom echoed out as Marquis Lu’s chest caved in, causing blood to spray out as he fell back. Cracking sounds could even be heard as a layer of magical cloth armor, which had previously been invisible, shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was one of his life-saving magical items, something which had enabled him to sweep unrivalled across the battlefield when fighting the Heavengod Alliance. He had even relied on it to kill some of the Dao Realm experts of the Eighth Mountain and Sea. And yet, Meng Hao shattered it with a single blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of you, attack immediately! Kill him!” Marquis Lu cried urgently, face ashen. The other cultivators of the Seventh Mountain and Sea around him hesitated, but about a thousand of them gritted their teeth and charged forward. They quickly formed into groups of nine, arranging themselves in special formation. Those spell formations then grouped into nines to create a grand spell formation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling could be heard as dozens of spell formations appeared in the starry sky, which then shot toward Meng Hao. Brilliant lights flashed, and the ripples of divine abilities spread out. However, Meng Hao’s expression was the same as ever as he made a grasping motion, which tore a rift open. The Blood Demon roared out, instantly charging toward the spell formations. Surrounded by the sounds of explosions, Meng Hao pierced through the spell formations and began to chase down Marquis Lu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadness could be seen in Marquis Lu’s eyes. The fact that Meng Hao could simply disregard the spell formations caused that madness to grow more intense. Throwing caution to the wind, he threw his head back and roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You made me do this!” he roared, extending his hand and causing the totem tattoo there to radiate violet light. It grew more and more intense, and in the blink of an eye, violet qi suddenly began to swirl around. Astonishingly, it transformed into... an enormous head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had eight horns on its head, its skin was greenish-black, and its face resembled that of a human. As soon as it appeared, a shocking energy burst out, causing the starry sky to tremble. Furthermore... the face emanated an aura that was not of the Mountain and Sea Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was... an Outsider!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Outsider from the 33 Heavens!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Meng Hao saw it, he could tell where it came from. At the same time, he could sense the Mountain and Sea Realm stirring with hatred, with the desire to destroy Outsiders, to destroy anything with that blood running through their veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Outsider threw its head back and roared, causing the starry sky to shatter, and a massive tempest to spring up and spin toward Meng Hao. Simultaneously, the head shot away from Marquis Lu’s hand and headed toward Meng Hao as if to consume him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DIE!” screamed Marquis Lu, his face twisted with madness. This was his trump card, something that sucked away at his longevity every time he used it, forcing him to be very cautious about how he utilized it. It was also the entire reason he had charged into the Meng Clan’s territory with complete disregard for Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his mind, the totem tattoo essentially made him invincible to 4-Essences enemies, and enabled him to fight it out with 5-Essences cultivators. In fact, during the fighting against the Heavengod Alliance, he had even fought to a draw with the Heavengod Alliance’s Chief Dharma Protector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of that, he was incredibly confident, and his killing intent was currently surging. Now that he had sent the enormous head against Meng Hao, he was sure that Meng Hao was as good as dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This totem tattoo is a precious treasure that my Mountain and Sea Lord bestowed upon me. It draws upon the soul of a Heavenly Devil from the Outside world and gives me the power to fight against five Essences! It doesn’t matter who you are, you’re DEAD!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After you’re dead, the rest of the Eighth Mountain and Sea will accompany you to the Yellow Springs, and the Meng Clan that escaped to the Ninth Mountain and Sea will still be exterminated. Even the Ninth Mountain and Sea will be destroyed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the coming war, nobody will be safe. You’re dead no matter what!!” Marquis Lu threw his head back and roared madly, drawing upon his longevity to power the totem. Stabbing pain filled his mind, making him go even crazier, to the point where he began to lose his grip on consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet he still maintained control. Performing an incantation gesture, he made the gigantic Outsider’s mouth open wide. Its eyes shone with a red light as it made to devour Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered, and he snorted coldly. As the Outsider’s head closed in on him, he extended his hand and pointed at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was none other than the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao had known that his Demon Sealing Hexing magic was especially effective on Outsiders. As soon as he finished waving his finger, he waved it again to unleash the Seventh Demon Sealing Hex. Then came the Sixth Hex and the Fifth Hex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour waves of a finger caused the Outsider to scream miserably. Black mist began to roil out from inside of it, as it twisted and distorted, howling, “Nine... Seals... Hexing... Magic.... DAMMIT!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began to corrode, sending black mist out in all directions. Marquis Lu was shaking, and began to wither as his longevity was rapidly sucked away. However, instead of fleeing, he charged Meng Hao, face twisted with madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, aren\u0027t you interesting,” Meng Hao said, eyes flickering. He then reached out and made a grasping motion, but instead of utilizing the power of the Mountain and Sea Realm he unleashed the Star Plucking Magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Ancient Mana flowed, and his 33 Soul Lamps burned brightly. Combining the power of his fleshly body with that of his cultivation base caused Meng Hao to explode with battle prowess equivalent to five Essences, and that was without the power of the Mountains and Seas!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was... a terrifying power that was second only to that of a Mountain and Sea Lord. Rumbling could be heard as the Outsider screamed, its face twisting as it sped uncontrollably toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Meng Hao managed to grab it, then he would have the soul’s life or death within his control. However the face suddenly screamed and began to turn blurry; apparently, it had chosen to self-detonate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the face exploded, it used that power to break free, blocking the hand of the Star Plucking Magic and simultaneously transforming into a stream of black mist that began to shoot back toward Marquis Lu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao swished his sleeve, causing a tempest to spring up. The power of the self-detonation instantly faded away, and Meng Hao took a step forward toward the black mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black mist moved so fast that Marquis Lu didn’t have any time to react. It streamed into his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, causing him to tremble and then let out a bloodcurdling scream, as if he were being possessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes glittered coldly as he closed in. He was just about to perform an incantation gesture when Marquis Lu, face covered in black mist, let out an insane howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis energy then spiked, and his skin began to turn green and sprout scales. His head split open as eight horns grew out. Furthermore, his lips split in half so that his mouth was in the shape of a cross. In the blink of an eye, he grew to a height of thirty meters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicious-looking spikes even pierced out through his clothing. Shockingly, what was standing in front of Meng Hao now was no longer a cultivator, but a humanoid beast!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was... an Outsider!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faces of the other cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea fell, and they began to back up. Clearly, even they had not known the true origin of Marquis Lu’s totem tattoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only a few dozen whose faces flickered with what seemed to be panic, but which Meng Hao saw through to the zeal and devotion toward this version of Marquis Lu that was hidden beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re dead! DEAD, I tell you!!” The beast-form of Marquis Lu threw his head back and howled, causing his energy to rise higher and higher. Then, his eyes turned red, and he seemingly lost all control of himself, descending fully into madness as he charged Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 1287: Outsider!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1286\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1288\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1287","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
