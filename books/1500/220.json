A few of them landed by Su’s feet, splashing out a warm blossom of blood before helplessly landing on the floor again to be completely absorbed by the ice cold rocks.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Your injury…” Su diverted his attention from Madeline’s quiet appearance and abrupt departure and looked at Persephone’s body.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was because she had lost too much blood. Persephone’s face was also abnormally pale. When she heard Su’s question, she erupted with a brilliant smile and said, “I’m fine. A bit of medicine will stop the bleeding.

Meanwhile, Persephone’s clothes were a mess, and she who cared quite a bit about her appearance would never appear in front of her subordinates like this. Fortunately, Persephone’s strength was quite great herself. The effects of death prison slowly faded, and the blood flow on her arm gradually stopped.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone’s outfit was in tatters, and large amounts of her snow white skin was revealed. Her impressive figure wasn’t something that clothes could hide to begin with, and right now, it was \u0026nbsp;on the verge of exposing everything. However, she didn’t seem to have any intention of hiding anything as she confidently swayed back and forth in front of Su’s face, as if she didn’t mind Su seeing things that shouldn’t be seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu had to admit that Persephone’s destructive power was astonishing. Only through quite a bit of struggle did he successfully divert his attention from her body to her pale face and blood dyed hair. However, some of Su’s abilities didn’t seem as obedient and secretly activated a few times, even successfully overwhelming his will.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen she felt the changes in Su’s gaze, Persephone revealed a warm smile and said, “I’m fine.

He found that after these seven years, he truly did not know much about Madeline. That was why his understanding and memories ended when she was still a little girl.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone wanted to say something, but she ultimately sighed and said, “Perhaps things are not like how we think they are.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Perhaps? But she…” Su still didn’t know what to say. His chest tightened, and then suddenly, his vision darkened. His body’s weakness and lack of nutrients now thoroughly swallowed up his consciousness. He swayed back and forth and then slowly dropped onto the ground.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone was startled. She hurriedly propped up Su and then immediately felt how heated up his body was. Even though she sensed that Su was exceedingly weak and tired, as well as the fact that his body’s vitality was flourishing with astonishing vigor, Persephone still couldn’t suppress her worry. She quickly contacted Helen and sent Su’s data over. Only when she received a similar reply as what she herself deduced did she calm down.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen the Helen in the screen saw how Persephone looked, she adjusted her glasses and said calmly, “When he wakes up in a bit, it will be when his will and reasoning is at its weakest.

She calmed herself down, and then she looked into Helen’s eyes and said, “My dear Helen, you moved your glasses again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I am aware. However, moving my glasses does not always mean that I am lying.” Helen calmly replied before cutting off communications, leaving Persephone in a daze by herself with Su.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOnly after hesitating for a while did Persephone undo a button from her shirt and reveal a syringe that was only a few millimeters in size and shoot it into Su’s neck.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe darkness seemed to last eternally. There were countless flames raging within the darkness, burning so greatly that it was hard for others to breathe. Inside the burning pain was a bit of coldness that felt like the oasis of a desert, an oasis that thirsty wanderer would pay any price to obtain. Just as the scorched thirst and suffering reached its critical point, Su woke up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe world Su woke up to was far better than the one he experienced when he was asleep. First of all, what appeared first in his field of view was Persephone’s face that would make anyone feel a violent urge that was hard to suppress. He then felt that the place where his head rested on was extremely soft, yet it possessed an astonishing flexibility. Su immediately realized the place where his head rested on were Persephone’s legs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHis wandering eyes took in the surrounding scenery. What he saw was a cavern where the wind didn’t enter. The temperature inside the cave was quite high and extremely cozy. However, there were no chemical flames providing warmth, and instead Persephone’s own body that raised its temperature to help Su sleep more comfortably.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu raised his head and tried to sit up, but the unexpected lack of reaction made him turn his head towards Persephone who was currently in a daze and thinking about who knows what. She unexpectedly didn’t avoid him or show any type of reaction. Su couldn’t help but hug her; this was a type of subconscious reaction. The moment large amounts of skin made contact, Su’s body seemed to carry out large amounts of explosions under her body’s temperature and softness, and the flames of desire seemed to burn through all of his reasoning.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu suddenly became as hard as steel. He tightly embraced Persephone, and then her lips were sealed! Persephone released a moan, and then her body began to burn with even more heat and became more flexible. Her lips naturally couldn’t stop Su’s powerful invasion.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis time, all of the firepower within Su’s body erupted! His breathing erupted like a heavy volcano. His right hand suddenly reached outwards into Persephone’s clothes, finding to his surprise that he couldn’t completely hold them even after expanding his five fingers to their limit!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eJust at this moment when things were going to reach their climax, the temperature in the cave quickly decreased and Persephone’s body became incomparably chilly.
