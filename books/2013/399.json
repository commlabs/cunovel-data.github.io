Who had once been a soldier, but was one no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife with the Grey Swords had not altered that. They had travelled to this land, drawn by the Wolves with gifts of faint visions, murky prophecies born in confused dreams: some vast conflagration awaited them-a battle where they would be needed, desperately needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot, it had turned out, alongside the Awl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA most fatal error in judgement. The wrong allies. The wrong war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToc had never trusted the gods anyway. Any god. In truth, his list of those whom he did trust was, after all he had been through, pathetically short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTatter sail. Ganoes Paran. Gruntle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sorceress, a mediocre captain, a caravan guard and a damned T’lan Imass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould that they were with him now, riding at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis horse’s charge was slow, turgid, slewing. Perched over the press of his knees against the beast’s shoulders, Toc sent arrow after arrow towards the skirmishers-though he knew it was hopeless. He could barely see, so jostled was he atop the saddle, with mud flying up on all sides as the horse careered in a wild struggle to stay upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he drew closer, he heard screams. With but two arrows left, he rose higher still on his stirrups, drawing on his bowstring-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arrows, he saw with astonishment, had not missed. Not one. Eight skirmishers were down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sent another hissing outward, saw it take a man in the forehead, the stone point punching through bronze and then bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was suddenly among the Letherii. Driving his last arrow at near point-blank range into a woman’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spear tore into his left leg, cut through and then gouged along his horse’s flank. The beast screamed, launched itself forward-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing the bow away, Toc unsheathed his scimitar-damn, should’ve brought a shield-and hacked from side to side, beating away the thrusting spears.-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis horse pulled through into the clear. And would have rushed on, straight into the Letherii ranks two hundred paces ahead, but Toc grasped the reins and swerved the animal round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly to find a dozen or so skirmishers right behind him-pursuing on foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo spears drove into his mount, one skidding off a shoulder blade, the other stabbing deep into the animal’s belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquealing piteously, the horse foundered, then fell onto its side, hind legs already fouled with spilled out intestines, each frantic kick tearing more loose from the body cavity. Toc, with legs still drawn high, was able to throw himself from the beast, landing clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkidding in the mud, struggling to regain his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spear drove into his right hip, lifting him from the muck before throwing him onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hacked at the shaft. It splintered and the pressure pinning him down vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlashing blindly, Toc fought his way back onto his feet. There was blood pouring down both legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother lunging attack. He parried the spear thrust, lurched close and chopped his scimitar into the side of the soldier’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA point slammed into his back, punched him forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd onto a shortsword that slid up under his ribs, cutting his heart in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToe Anaster sank down onto his knees, and, releasing his last breath, would have fallen forward into the mud, but for a hand grasping him, yanking him back. The flash of a knife before his lone eye. Sudden heat along the line of his jaw-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent watched as the Letherii skirmisher cut away Toc Anaster’s face. One more trophy. The task was quick, well-practised, and then the soldier pushed his victim away, and the red wound that had once been Toe’s face plunged down into the mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children were crying, and yes, he realized-in watching, in waiting, he had perhaps condemned them all to the Letherii knives. Still, they could-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent turned round-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd found strangers before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Ak’rynnai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot D’rhasilhanii.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he had never before seen such people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clans of the White Face Barghast approached the scene of the battle-a battle nearing its grisly end. Who won, who lost, was without meaning to them. They intended to kill everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hundred paces ahead of the ragged lines was their vanguard, walking within a stream of the Tellann Warren, which was strong in this place, where beneath the silts of the ancient shoreline could be found stone tools, harpoons made of antler, bone and ivory, and the hulks of dugout canoes. And out here, on the old seabed, there were offerings buried deep now in the silts. Polished stones, pairs of antlers locked together, animal skulls daubed in red ochre\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– countless gifts to a dwindling sea. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-399.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
