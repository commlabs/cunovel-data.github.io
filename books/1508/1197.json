But Huo Violentstone didn’t laugh raucously like before.

This was also the reason why he went out to hunt down Zhong Wenshu and Sacred Martial Mansion’s three prodigies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The divine dream marks are already saturated and can’t absorb any more dreamland energy. Does this mean I can open the third divine dream mark now?” Lin Ming thought to himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen he poured the dreamland energies of Sacred Martial Mansion’s three prodigies into his soul marks, he found that the two soul marks had reached an energy saturation point and couldn’t grow any further.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming focused his mind and began to unravel the colored lines around the Magic Cube.

After passing through his meridians, the energy gathered in his soul. Slowly, Lin Ming could feel power rise within his body, as if there was some indescribable change happening to his soul force, causing it to slowly grow. This strange energy surged through Lin Ming’s meridians, gushing out from his acupoints and pores, dissipating into the air where it turned into rippling rainbow lights.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf someone were to rush into his chambers and also have a thorough understanding of the Divine Dream Law, they would see Lin Ming surrounded by countless rippled lights, each one of them a different color, all of them fantastical and beautiful like a dream!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Divine Dream Law had the word ‘divine’ because every time it was used, it would be like the descend of a true immortal, with auspicious signs appearing everywhere.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sort of feeling was amazing!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“My strength is increasing, but my cultivation isn’t following much; I still can’t break through to the middle Divine Sea realm. But my strength is increasing. Where could this extra strength be coming from? Could it be…?” Lin Ming thought to himself. Finally, he realized just how he was becoming stronger.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA martial artist’s body could hold only a limited amount of true essence and energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor a Houtian and Xiantian Realm martial artist, they could only store true essence in their dantian. For a Revolving Core martial artist, their revolving core crystal nucleus could compress true essence, so they naturally surpassed Houtian and Xiantian Realm martial artists. As for Life Destruction martial artists, their entire body would transform into a spirit physique that would allow them to store true essence all throughout their bodies. After reaching the Divine Sea, one could open their own inner world and store true essence within that world as well as gather the power of a world from within themselves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEvery boundary was distinct in its unique characteristics.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut regardless of how one cultivated, there was a common point between all of them. That was that the body was used to store this energy. Once one lost their body, they would also lose the ability to move true essence as well as the power of the world. For instance, even though Mo Eversnow once was a heaven-gifted genius who had been at the half-step World King boundary, after she perished and all that was left over was her soul form, it became impossible for her to move true essence. She could only rely on her understandings of Laws and her battle spirit to fight. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo an essence gathering system martial artist, the power of the world and the power of true essence were their everything. Once they lost the ability to move energy, it was the same as a bird having lots its wings. Their combat strength would only be the tiniest fraction of what it once was. Currently, Mo Eversnow was only able to deal with the weakest of Divine Lord realm powerhouses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow, as Lin Ming cultivated this transcendent divine might that was created by Empyrean Divine Dream, he discovered that as he trained in it, he could actually use his soul to store true essence!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe true essence stored within his soul was transformed from the divine dream energy within this dreamland.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the real world, a martial artist could absorb heaven and earth origin energy and transform that into true essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut in this Divine Dream World, a martial artist could absorb divine dream energy and transform that into true essence!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese divine dream marks were the manifestation of this condensed energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf true essence was no longer restricted to the body but had an even wider space to utilize, the benefits could be imagined.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this way, a martial artist could increase the total amount of true essence they could store within themselves. For instance, although Lin Ming was growing stronger, he still couldn’t break through to the middle Divine Sea. This was the same as gaining extra strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn another way, if true essence was fused into the soul, this would make the soul even tougher and far more tenacious. If one were to encounter a situation like Mo Eversnow’s where she lost her physical body and only had her soul form, they could still display a far greater than normal combat strength by relying on their soul.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t doubt that even if Empyrean Divine Dream didn’t use her mortal body and had her soul leave her body, she could still easily kill a Holy Lord, and even easily kill a Great World King!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was on this day, after perceiving the Divine Dream Law for almost three months with the Magic Cube, that Lin Ming could see the practical advantages of the Divine Dream Law. Although he had many comprehensions at the start, he hadn’t been able to see just how the Divine Dream Law could be used in actual combat. But now, that all changed!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“If I could somehow enable Miss Mo to study this transcendent divine might, with her talent in addition to the Magic Cube’s help, she can still cultivate and even greatly increase her combat strength. There won’t be a situation where she might fall into a deep slumber if she ever tried to help me. Moreover, this transcendent divine might can even help strengthen her soul force and make it easier to reform her mortal body in the future. After reforming her body, she will even be far more formidable than she was in the past!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was overjoyed when he thought of this. After co-existing for so many years, Lin Ming’s interests were inseparable from Mo Eversnow. He also held an extremely special and unique sentiment toward her. If he could somehow help her out even if it didn’t benefit him, he would be sincerely happy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe wanted more and more to learn this transcendent divine might. For him, this transcendent divine might was no less significant than the Heretical God Force or the grandmist space.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, it was unknown whether or not he could obtain this transcendent divine might. Everything would depend on Empyrean Divine Dream herself. Lin Ming suspected that the complete transcendent divine might that was being rewarded in this First Martial Meeting was likely not the self-created transcendent divine mights of Empyrean Divine Dream or Empyrean Vast Universe. Rather, it might be the inheritance of a long gone Empyrean that the two Empyreans obtained in some ancient ruins.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough such a transcendent divine might was extremely precious, it still wasn’t what Lin Ming desired most.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Whether or not I can obtain Empyrean Divine Dream’s transcendent divine might, I will need to make use of every second I have here to perceive the Divine Dream Law. If I can obtain the Empyrean Divine Dream’s transcendent divine might in the future, I can use this as a foundation to further my understandings. But if I cannot, I’ll need to focus my efforts on perceiving it myself.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The divine dream energy I obtained from hunting down Sacred Martial Mansion’s three prodigies should be enough to form the third divine dream mark. After this, I’ll have to search for more prey to accumulate more divine dream energy. Although I’ll probably end up offending some people and sects, there’s nothing I can do about that.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t fear offending anyone anymore. As long as he could obtain a top ten result within the entire Divine Realm of this First Martial Meeting, at that time, the attention of everyone would be on him. He would obtain the tutelage of Empyrean Vast Universe’s chief disciple and just what World King Holy Land would dare touch him then? It had to be known that Empyrean Vast Universe’s chief disciple, whether it was status, strength, or any other qualification, completely surpassed an ordinary Great World King in every aspect. Then again, killing in this dreamland space was completely permitted within the rules. Since it didn’t cause any true casualties, those that were offended could only live with it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming thought like this he continued his training.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDuring this time, the three month long deadline finally arrived.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe first round of preliminary eliminations had begun!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eElimination rate: 99%!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was an extra number that caused all ordinary participants to wallow in despair.
