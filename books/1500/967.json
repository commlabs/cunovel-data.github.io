This reply left Fitzdurk extremely surprised, and also somewhat uneasy. He immediately thought of the face of the young man on Serendela’s body that he killed. According to normal reasoning, Serendela shouldn’t bear a grudge over this, because she had already awoken. After awakening, all memories and experiences of this world, for the apostle, were like a dream. Regardless of what happened, since they already woke up, they shouldn’t concern themselves over it any further.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThis was how it was in theory, but Fitzdurk still felt a vague sense of unease. He composed himself, and then his consciousness linked up with all of the mechanical units, thus seeing Serendela.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSerendela was dressed in black clothes, stably standing on a mothership, currently flying southeast. Behind her, more than ten humanoid robust males were standing on the same mothership, their expressions all grave and stern, the iron chain wrapped around their left arms making one feel a sense of chilliness. These were the flesh puppets Serendela made, they only knew how to obey her will. Meanwhile, Serendela’s own body already shrunk to about two meters in height, from the outside looking just like a beautiful and ice-cold human woman. Compared to the close to hundred meters long mothership below her, she was small to the point of almost being overlooked. However, when anyone with some ability saw her, they would feel that what was insignificant was that mothership below her feet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Serendela, it is best if you immediately return!” Fitzdurk shouted with a frown.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“You do not have to right to order me around!” Serendela responded coldly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eFitzdurk surged with anger, immediately ordering the mothership Serendela and her flesh puppets were standing on to self destruct. However, when the order was given out, there was no response at all. With both of them being apostles, there was hardly any difference in abilities between Serendela and Fitzdurk. Perhaps she might not be able to command a fleet on the scale of tens of millions like Fitzdurk, but seizing control over a dozen or so motherships from Fitzdurk’s hands was still easily done.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSerendela’s small scale fleet quickly flew in the southeastern direction, along the way mostly moving through areas that had been ‘purged’ by the mechanical bug swarms, so there was no large-scale life to be seen at all. Four hundred kilometers of direct distance, under the mothership’s full speed flying, only took twenty minutes. When the mothership stopped moving, Serendela leapt off in a diving manner, heading towards the great earth with her head down legs up. This was but five hundred meters of high altitude!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eWhen she was about to land, her body turned in the air, and then her feet landed on the ground, forcefully sending the tremendous momentum straight into the ground. The force of impact made the earth where she landed ripple outwards like a wave, extending in all directions, only calming down after traveling several dozen meters. There were two ordinarily dressed men standing close to the edge of the wave, even though they were a few meters from the edge of the earth wave, their bodies mysteriously left the ground, and then they began to twist at all types of unnatural angles, blood continuously pouring out from their mouth and nose. When the two landed again, their bodies didn’t even twitch, from the looks of it already dead before they flew into the air.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eBehind the two corpses, was a somewhat tattered courtyard. Those two seemed to be gatekeepers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe courtyard looked rather ordinary. Even though the amount of space it occupied wasn’t small, there was only a single main building and a few auxiliary houses, just like a ranch that couldn’t be any more common. However, to have sixth level ability users as guards, how could this be an ordinary ranch? The courtyard’s main entrance consisted of two black painted flower patterned iron gates, so ordinary that it almost felt a bit unsophisticated. A name plate hung from the cement doorpost on the side, on it written Stam Ranch.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe few who understood the inner details knew that Stam was precisely the name Bevulas used when the Blood Parliament was first established. Stam Ranch, was Blood Parliament’s first prison.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eLocked up here were all the most dangerous prisoners, every one of them able to stir up great disorder if they were let loose into the northern continent, but of course, this could only happen outside the Blood Parliament’s territory. If one wished to cause trouble in the Blood Parliament, forget about the Spider Empress, just Bevulas alone was already enough to send them into prison once more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHowever, there was one exception, and this person was locked up in the deepest level of this prison. The number of those who knew of his existence, did not exceed five.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eWith the death of the two gatekeepers, a primitive and bleak alarm sounded in the ranch, seven or eight individuals rushing out from the main and side building. Even though they were in ordinary servant, maid, or cook attire, their powerful auras exposed their identities as ability users. Their expressions were ice-cold and stiff. When they saw Serendela who was clearly a bit different from an ordinary human, they didn’t reveal any surprise, instead instantly separating, flanking her in a circular manner. It was to the extent where a petite woman’s figure became blurry, thus disappearing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHowever, right at this time, the wind here suddenly became strong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-33-9\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-34-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-34-1","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM"}
