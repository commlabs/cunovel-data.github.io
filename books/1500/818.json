She sized up this little house, and then reached out her hand to push open the door. The door immediately silently opened up. One could see that the lock was broken into two pieces, the surfaces as smooth as a mirror.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eInside was a small living room, the coffee table covered in cloth, on it all types of firearm components. Kane sat on a couch, currently fully concentrating his attention on cleaning a component. Only when Madeline’s figure was cast over the coffee table did he notice another person had appeared in the room. Kane suddenly raised his head, his right hand calmly placed on his legs, and only after seeing that it was Madeline did he release a breath of relief. He stood up with pleasant surprise, saying, “You came back! Where’s leader?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMadeline didn’t reply, instead looking carefully at Kane. Only after a while did she say, “Your genes are already extremely unstable, if you use your abilities any further, they will collapse within half a year.

At the very least, I have to repair Li’s blade every so often. She’s simply gone mad, always coming back covered in injuries. Not having a good weapon won’t do.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Moulding Ability?

I am someone from the wilderness, so I never expected to even live past thirty years of age. I’m now already over forty, already lived long enough. I don’t have any other abilities, only able to use this type of method to help protect this bit of foundation leader left behind.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMadeline nodded, and then said, “It is good as long as you understand.

She then pushed the door and left.

Her silver-gray long hair rose and fell in the wind, bits of stellar splendor flickering about, only disappearing after they traveled far into the distance. A faint glow of radiation was released from the clouds in the sky, outlining her silhouette that gave off a bit of bleak beauty.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCirvanas was in a room, quietly laying there, looking at the ceiling covered in dust, unknown what he was thinking.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhere was Su?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis question repeatedly wandered about in Madeline’s sea of consciousness, impossible to get rid of. This night, no, not just this night, almost every night, only when she hugged herself would she no longer feel the coldness and loneliness. However, from the depths of her chest, every minute, there would always be a strong and forceful pulsation, the unstoppable torrent of energy declaring her existence. The nucleus and her heart tangled together, forming one body, no longer any distinguishable difference between them. This heart wasn’t hers, yet it was. From the moment it entered her body, she naturally grasped many of its uses. As the nucleus and the Heart of Darkness gradually merged, her level of authority continuously increased as well. At the very least, when the Heart of Darkness was in Su’s body, this high of authority had never been unlocked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith each pulse of her heart, it meant endless energy and great power. However, when Madeline felt its pulsation, she would always feel as if her eyes would become uncontrollably sore. Whenever this happened, she could only look up into the sky and wait for this feeling to pass, or, like right now, bury her head in her knees.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLate into the night was her time alone.

In reality, this question long had an answer. His final traces, were precisely in the depths of Madeline’s chest.
