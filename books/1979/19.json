We’ve been seeing each other for over a year now, and if we were going to fall in love it would’ve happened before now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We haven’t given it a real chance.” Colby didn’t understand why he was arguing with her when he was in full agreement. Sherry would make some man a wonderful wife. Some other man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re using me, Colby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had nothing to say in his own defense. He hadn’t realized until she’d said it, but Sherry was right. He had been using her. Not to make Valerie jealous, or in any devious, underhanded way, but in an effort to prove to himself that he could happily live without Valerie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe experiment had backfired. And now he was alone, wondering how he could have let the only woman he’d ever loved walk out of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s this I hear about you going to Texas?” David Bloomfield asked when Valerie joined him on the front porch following the evening meal. She sat on the top step, her back pressed against the white column while her father rocked in his old chair. She looked at the blooming apple orchard, breathed in the scent of pink and white blossoms perfuming the air. The setting sun cast a golden glow across the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie hadn’t said anything at dinner about returning to Texas, and was surprised that her father was aware of her intentions. She’d sat quietly in her place at the table, pushing the food around her plate and hoping no one would notice she wasn’t eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time for me to go back, Daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It hurts, doesn’t it?” he asked, his voice tender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little.” A lot, her heart cried, but it was a cry she’d been ignoring from the moment she left Colby’s home. “Your health’s improved so much,” she said with forced cheerfulness. “You don’t need me around here anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, but I do,” her father countered smoothly, continuing to rock. “Colby needs you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name went through her like the blade of a sharp sword, and her breath caught at the unexpected pain. Her father was the reason she’d come home, but Colby was the reason she was leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Love is funny, isn’t it?” she mused, wrapping her arms around her knees the way she had as a young girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and I are so much alike,” her father said. “Your mother saw it before I did, which I suppose is only natural. I’m proud of you, Valerie, proud of what you’ve managed to accomplish in so short a time, proud of your professionalism. Cassidy’s lucky to have you on his team, and he knows it—otherwise he wouldn’t have promoted you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got a terrific future with CHIPS.” She said it to remind herself that her life did have purpose. There was somewhere to focus all her energy. Something that would help her forget, give her a reason to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother’s and my romance wasn’t so easy, either, you know,” her father said, rocking slowly. “She was this pretty young nurse, and I was head over heels in love with her. To my mind, she was lucky to have me. Problem was, she didn’t seem to think so. I was a business success, a millionaire. But none of that impressed your mother.” His smile was wryly nostalgic, his eyes gazing into a long-ago world. “Convincing Grace to marry me was by far the most difficult task I’d faced in years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t love you?” That was impossible for Valerie to comprehend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She loved me, all right, she just didn’t think she’d make me the right kind of wife. I was wealthy, socially prominent and, as you know, your mother was a preacher’s daughter from Oregon. Before I contracted rheumatic fever I was one of the most sought-after bachelors in California, if I do say so myself. But I hadn’t met the woman I wanted to marry until your mother became my nurse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow achingly familiar this sounded to Valerie. She’d been content with her own life until she met Colby. Falling in love was the last thing she’d expected when she returned home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There were other problems, too,” David went on. “Your mother seemed to think my work habits would kill me, and she wasn’t willing to marry me only to watch me work myself to death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you solved everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eventually.” A wistful look stole over him. “I loved your mother from the first moment I opened my eyes and saw her standing beside my hospital bed. I remember thinking she was an angel, and in some ways she was.” His face shone with the radiance of unending love. “I knew if she’d ever agree to marry me, I was going to have to give up everything I’d worked so hard to achieve. That meant selling my business and finding something new to occupy my time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did it, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not without a lot of deliberation. I’d already made more money than I knew how to spend, but I realized I wasn’t going to be happy retiring before the age of forty. I had to have something to do. It took a couple of years—and Grace’s help—to figure out what that should be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie nodded. “I feel the same way. I’d never be happy just sitting at home— I’m too much like you.” The extent of his sacrifice shook her. “How could you have given up everything you’d worked all those years to build?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Without your mother my life would’ve been empty. My work didn’t matter anymore. Grace was important, and the life we were going to build together was important. I gave up one life but gained another, one I found far more fulfilling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But didn’t you ever get bored or restless?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some, but not nearly as much as I expected. When we’d been married a year or two, your mother saw I had too much time on my hands and we looked around for something to occupy me, some new interest. That was when we bought the orchard and moved here.” He grinned. “My own Garden of Eden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think I ever understood how much you’d changed your life to marry Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a sacrifice, and at the time it seemed like a huge one, but as the years passed, I realized she’d been right. I would’ve killed myself if I’d continued in business. Your mother brought balance into my life, the same way Colby will bring balance into yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe allowed a moment to pass before she spoke. “I’m not marrying Colby, Dad. I wish I could tell you I was, and that we were going to seek the same happiness you found with Mom, but it isn’t going to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if she hadn’t said a word. “You’ll be so good for him, Valerie. He loves you now, and you love him, but what you feel for each other doesn’t even begin to approach the love you’ll experience over the years, especially after the children arrive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad, you’re not listening to me.” He seemed to be in a dream world that shut out reality. She had to make him stop, had to pull him out of the fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He needs you, too, you know, even more than you need him. Colby’s lived alone too many years. Only recently has he recognized how much he wants a woman in his life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t want me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father closed his eyes and smiled. “You don’t truly believe that, do you? He wants you so much it’s eating him alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lacked the strength to argue with her father, not after her confrontation with Colby earlier in the day. Nor did she have the energy to explain what had passed between them. In her mind, it was over. She’d told him she wouldn’t look back and she meant it. She’d swallowed her pride and gone to him and he’d cast her out of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t hate him for being cruel; she’d asked for that. Nor had she made it easy for him to reject her. But he’d done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid sipped his coffee, and his smile grew even more serene. “You have such happiness awaiting you, Valerie. This problem with my heart is a perfect example of good coming out of bad. My attack was what brought you racing home. Heaven only knows how long it would’ve been before you met Colby if it weren’t for this bum heart of mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie reached for her own mug of coffee and took a sip. “You want anything else before I go inside?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So soon? It’s not even dark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a lot to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to think about what I said?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated to disappoint him, hated to disillusion a romantic old man whose judgment was clouded by thirty years of loving one woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll think about it,” Valerie promised, but it was a lie. She intended to push every thought, every memory of Colby completely from her mind. That was the only way she’d be able to function. She got slowly to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” He nodded, still smiling. “Stay with me, then. There’s no need for you to hurry inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie hesitated. This conversation was becoming decidedly uncomfortable. Despite her father’s illusions, she had to face what had happened between her and Colby, accept it as truth and get on with her life. Pining away for him would solve nothing. And listening to her father only added to the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to do a few things before I leave.” The excuse was weak, but it was all she could think of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s plenty of time. Sit with me a spell. Relax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad…please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to tell you something important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it, Dad?” she asked with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know for a fact that you’re going to marry Colby,” he said, smiling up at her, his eyes bright and clear. “Your mother promised me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad,” Valerie said, suppressing the urge to argue with him. “If it’s about your dream, I don’t think—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was more than a dream! I was dead. I told you—ask Colby if you don’t believe me. I crossed over into the valley of shadows. Your mother was waiting for me there and she wasn’t pleased. No, sir. She was downright irritated with me. Said it wasn’t my time yet, and I was coming home much too early.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure this seemed very real to you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was real.” His voice had grown louder. “Now you sit down and listen, because what I’m about to tell you happened as surely as I live and breathe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrapped, Valerie did as her father asked, lowering herself to the top porch step. “All right, Dad, I’ll listen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” He smiled down at her, apparently appeased. “I’ve missed your mother, and I didn’t want to continue living in this world without her. She told me my thinking was all wrong. She promised me the years I have left will be full and happy ones, with nothing like the loneliness I’ve endured since she’s been gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course they will.” Valerie didn’t put much stock in this near-death experience of her father’s, but he believed it and that was the important thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Problem was, I didn’t much care about my life back here,” he went on, almost as if he hadn’t heard Valerie. “I was with Grace, and that was where I wanted to be. As far as I was concerned, I wasn’t going back.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/orchard-valley-grooms-orchard-valley-0/page-19.html","bookId":1979,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:05 AM"}
