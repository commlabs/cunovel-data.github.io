Go ahead, open it up now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let go of Ella’s hand and grab hold of the lock. I’m sick thinking that I’m able to open it on my own, now that Adelina is dead. I remove the lock and toss the lid open. The small crystal is still glowing a faint blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t touch that,” he says. “The fact that it’s glowing means a Macrocosm is in orbit somewhere. If you touch it now, it will tell them exactly where you are. I don’t know whose Macrocosm is operational, but I’m pretty sure the Mogadorians have stolen somebody’s,” he finishes. I haven’t the slightest idea of what he’s talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Macrocosm?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, frustrated. “There isn’t time to explain it all,” he says. “Relock it.” He opens his mouth to say more, but is interrupted by banging on the door at the bottom of the stairs. We can hear muffled bursts of foreign voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to go,” Crayton says, rushing to the back of the room and grabbing a large black suitcase. He flings it open, revealing ten different guns, a handful of grenades, several daggers. He shrugs his coat to the floor and reveals a leather vest, and he rushes to strap every piece of weaponry to it before slipping his coat back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mogadorians ram the door below with a heavy object, and we hear footsteps enter the stairwell. Crayton removes one of the guns and snaps a clip into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The burning symbol on the mountain,” I say. “Was it you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. “I waited too long, I’m afraid, and when you opened the Chest it became impossible to slip away under their gaze. So I created the biggest beacon I could, and now we have to hope the others have seen it, and that they’re on the way. Otherwise . . .” He trails off. “Well, otherwise we’re out of options. We have to get to the lake now. It’s our only chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what lake he’s talking about, or why he wants to go there, but my whole body is trembling. I just want to get away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps are closer. Ella grabs hold of my hand, back to her eleven-year-old self. Crayton pulls the slide on the gun, and I hear a bullet clicking into place. He aims it at the belfry’s entryway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a very good friend in town,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Héctor?” I ask, suddenly understanding why the two of them were talking in the café this morning. Crayton wasn’t spreading lies, but rather telling the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, and let’s hope he keeps his word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Héctor will,” I say, certain that’s true regardless of what Crayton has asked him to do. “It’s in his name,” I add.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grab the Chest,” Crayton says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach down and take the Chest in my left arm just as we hear the footsteps reach the last curves of the stairwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both of you, stay close to me,” Crayton says, his eyes moving from Ella to me. “She was born able to change ages, but she’s young and hasn’t developed any Legacies yet. Keep her close. And don’t let go of that Chest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, Marina. I’m fast,” she says, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ready,” Ella says, tightening her hand around mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re all going to be wearing body armor that would stop almost every bullet here on Earth,” Crayton says, “but I’ve soaked mine in Loricyde, and there isn’t a shield here that could stop them. I’m going to mow every damn one of them down.” His eyes narrow. “Keep your fingers crossed that Héctor’s outside the gates waiting for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll be there,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Crayton pulls the trigger, and he doesn’t let go until every bullet’s been fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWE KEEP THE WINDOWS DOWN, SAYING LITTLE, unnerved by the task ahead. Sam keeps a firm grip on the wheel as the highway winds through Virginia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think Six will make it?” Sam asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure she’ll make it, but who knows what she’ll find.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was a hell of a kiss you two had.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my mouth and then shut it. A minute later I say, “She likes you, too, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, as a friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, Sam, she like-likes you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam blushes. “Sure. I could tell by the way she shoved her tongue in your mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She kissed you, too, dude. I saw it.” I slap him in the chest with the back of my hand, and I can see he’s replaying the kiss in his mind. “After I kissed her I asked if she knew you liked her and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re jerked over the double yellow line on the road. “You did what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, relax. Don’t kill us.” Sam glides us back onto our side of the road. “She said she liked you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA devilish grin spreads across Sam’s face. “Interesting. It’s kind of hard to believe this,” Sam finally says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, Sam. Why would I lie about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I can’t believe that this whole thing is real. That you’re real or that Six is real, or that a hostile race of aliens has scattered themselves across the planet and nobody seems to know it. I mean, they’ve hollowed out a mountain in the middle of the state. How has it not been found? What did they do with all the dirt and rocks they removed? Even as scarcely populated as parts of West Virginia are, surely somebody had to stumble across it at some point. Hikers or hunters. Pilots of small planes. What about satellite imaging? And who knows how many other base camps or outposts or whatever you want to call them they have on Earth. I just don’t understand how they move about so freely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I agree,” I say. “I don’t know how either, but something tells me we probably don’t know the half of it. You remember the very first conspiracy theory you told me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Sam says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were talking about an entire Montana town being abducted, and you said the government allowed abductions in exchange for technology. Remember now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vaguely. Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that makes sense now. Maybe technology has nothing to do with it, and maybe the government isn’t allowing abductions; but I really think some agreement has to be in place. Because you’re right, there’s no way they’re traveling unnoticed. There are way, way, way too many of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam doesn’t respond. I look over and see that he’s smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sam?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just thinking of where I might be at this exact moment if you guys hadn’t come along. Probably alone in my basement, collecting more conspiracy theories and wondering if my dad’s still alive. That’s how it was for years. But what’s awesome is that I really do believe he’s alive now. He’s somewhere, John. I know it. And I know it because of you guys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope so,” I say. “It’s pretty cool that Henri came to Ohio to try to find him, and you and I became friends almost immediately. It’s like fate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam smiles. “Or a cosmic aligning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nerd,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a pause, Sam asks, “Hey, John? You’re positive that skeleton in the well wasn’t my dad, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely, dude. He was Loric and huge. Bigger than any human.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s your best guess, then? Who was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really don’t know. I just hope he wasn’t too important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour hours pass, and finally we see a sign pointing the way to Ansted, six miles ahead. We fall silent. Sam makes the turn and navigates a precarious two-lane road that twists up the mountain until we pass the town’s border. We drive through it and turn left at the only stoplight in town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hawks Nest, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep, a mile or two down the road,” Sam says, and it’s there we’ll find the map that Six drew three years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe map is exactly where Six said it would be, hidden at Hawks Nest State Park, overlooking the New River. Exactly forty-seven steps down the Gysp Trail, Sam, Bernie Kosar, and I reach a tree with E6 deeply carved into its side. From there, we leave the trail, taking thirty steps past the tree to the right. That’s followed by a hard left turn, and then, a tenth of a mile away, we see a tree that towers over the others. In the small gap at the base of its twisted trunk, safely tucked away in a black plastic box, is the map that leads to the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe make our way back to the SUV and drive another fifteen miles, ultimately pulling down a muddy, deserted road. It’s the closest any road can get us, five miles due north of the cave. Sam takes the address Six wrote out of his pocket and puts it in the glove compartment. “On second thought.” He removes it and puts it back into his pocket. “As safe as anywhere,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop the Xitharis and some duct tape into Six’s backpack that she left behind, and Sam slips the bag over his shoulders. I flip my dagger over in my hand and then stuff it into my back pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe step out and I lock the doors, Bernie Kosar running circles around my legs. There’s only a few hours left of daylight, which doesn’t leave us much time. Even with the benefit of my hands, I can’t imagine finding the cave without the sun to help us along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam holds the map in his hands. At its right side Six has drawn a heavy X. A winding path five miles long connects the X with where we are now, marked on the map’s left side. Along the way we’ll skirt a riverbed while passing various landmarks noted for their physical descriptions, all of which are carefully marked to keep us on track. Turtle Rock. Fisherman’s Pole. Circle Plateau. King’s Throne. Lover’s Kiss. Lookout Point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam and I lift our heads at the same time, and we both see the rock a quarter mile away with an uncanny resemblance to a turtle’s shell. Bernie Kosar barks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess we know which direction to head first,” Sam says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd off we go, following the path set by the map. There’s no trail, nothing that might allude to these mountains having been trampled by beings of another world, or even by beings of this one. Once we reach Turtle Rock, Sam spots a fallen tree that hangs over the cliff side at a forty-five degree angle, and thus looks like a fishing pole patiently waiting for a bite. And we hike on, following the trail as the sun lowers in the western sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach step taken is another chance to turn around and walk away. But neither of us does. “You’re a hell of a friend, Sam Goode,” I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not so bad yourself,” he replies. And then, “I can’t stop my hands from shaking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter passing King’s Throne, which is a tall slender rock that looks like a high-back chair, I immediately spot two tall trees leaning against one another at slight angles, their branches appearing like arms wrapped around each other in an embrace. And I smile, for a brief moment forgetting how terribly scared I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only one more to go,” Sam says, pulling me back into the clutches of reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reach Lookout Point five minutes later. All told, the hike has taken an hour and ten minutes, and the shadows are long and stretched as the last light of dusk drains away. Without warning, a deep growl bellows beside me. I look down. Bernie Kosar’s teeth are flashed, his fur bristling along his spine, his eyes pointed in the direction of the cave. He begins backing away from it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-power-of-six-lorien-legacies-2/page-37.html","bookId":1676,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:53 AM"}
