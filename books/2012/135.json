Do you want your responsibilities to consume you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And since we began marching with the Bonehunters, what has the Adjunct given you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not much—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nothing,’ she snapped. ‘Nothing but silence. Every time you needed something else, she gave you silence. Brys, you’ve said little to anyone for days. Don’t take on someone else’s wounds. Don’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChastened, he looked ahead. The dark stain of legions in the hazy distance, and a nearer group, humans and lizards both, drawing closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Guardian of the Names came for me, the sea ran from him like tears. But I was dead by then. I saw none of that. Only upon my rebirth did these visions find me. I see poor Rhulad Sengar lying cut and broken on the blood-spattered floor, crying out to his brothers. I see them turn away. I see my body slumping down against the dais. I see my king sitting lifeless on his throne .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould we but have left him there, so useless to resist the puppet-masters who ever gather to symbols of power – are they all so blind as to not see the absurdity of their ambitions? The pathetic venality of all their petty scheming? Grasp those dead limbs, then, and make him do your will .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have dreamed the names of a thousand lost gods. Will I ever speak them? Will I break upon this world one last time those names of the fallen? Is that enough, to give remembrance to the dead? A name upon my breath, spoken out loud, a whisper, a bold shout – will a distant soul stir? Find itself once more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn speaking a god’s name, do we conjure it into being?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Brys.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aranict?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did you hear me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did, and I will heed your warning, my love. But you should bear in mind that, sometimes, solitude is the only refuge left. Solitude … and silence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw how his words left her shaken, and was sorry. Shall I by name resurrect a god? Force its eyes to open once more? To see what lies all about us, to see the devastation we have wrought?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I that cruel? That selfish?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. Tavore, I think I begin to understand you. Must the fallen be made to see what they died for, to see their sacrifice so squandered? Is this what you mean – what you have always meant – by ‘unwitnessed’?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now it is you who weep – Errant’s shove, Brys, what a wretched pair we make. Gather yourself, please – we are almost upon them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew a shaky breath and straightened in his saddle. ‘I could not have stopped her, Aranict.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did you really expect to?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know. But I think I have figured something out. She gives us silence because she dares not give us anything else. What we see as cold and indifferent is in fact the deepest compassion imaginable.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you think that is true?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I choose to believe it, Aranict.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well enough, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys raised his voice. ‘Bearer!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man reined in and swung his mount out to the right. Brys and Aranict drew up alongside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two marines had dismounted, joining a woman, a boy and a girl. The woman was middle-aged, possibly an Awl by birth. The children were Malazans, though clearly unrelated. Had he seen these two before? In the palace? Possibly. Behind them all stood a half-dozen K’Chain Che’Malle, including three of the saddled creatures. Two of the remaining lizards were not as robust, yet bore huge blades instead of hands, while the third one was broader of snout, heavier of girth, and unarmed. Two ragged-looking dogs wandered out from between the legs of the lizards. The humans approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aranict,’ said Brys under his breath, ‘tell me what you see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not now,’ she said, her voice hoarse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced across to see her setting alight a stick of rustleaf, her hands shaking. ‘Tell me this at least. Shall a prince of Lether relinquish command to these ones?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoke hissed out, and then, ‘The marines … yes, for one simple reason.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Which is?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Better them than those two children.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt five paces away they halted, and the clean-shaven marine was the first to speak. His eyes on the standard, he said, ‘So it’s true.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-135.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
