The door was opened again, and for the first time he heard a voice, “Come out here.” \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Peter had been longing to hear a voice; but now he shrunk terrified into a corner. The voice was the voice of Guffey, and Peter knew what it meant. His teeth began to rattle again, and he wailed, “I dunno anything! I can’t tell anything!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A hand reached in and took him by the collar, and he found himself walking down the corridor in front of Guffey. “Shut up!” said the man, in answer to all his wailings, and took him into a room and threw him into a chair as if he had been a bundle of bedding, and pulled up another chair and sat down in front of Peter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now look here,” he said. “I want to have an understanding with you. Do you want to go back into that hole again?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “N-n-no,” moaned Peter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, I want you to know that you’ll spend the rest of your life in that hole, except when you’re talking to me. And when you’re talking to me you’ll be having your arms twisted off you, and splinters driven into your finger nails, and your skin burned with matches—until you tell me what I want to know. Nobody’s going to help you, nobody’s going to know about it. You’re going to stay here with me until you come across.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Peter could only sob and moan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now,” continued Guffey, “I been finding out all about you, I got your life story from the day you were born, and there’s no use your trying to hide anything. I know your part in this here bomb plot, and I can send you to the gallows without any trouble whatever. But there’s some things I can’t prove on the other fellows. They’re the big ones, the real devils, and they’re the ones I want, so you’ve got a chance to save yourself, and you better be thankful for it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Peter went on moaning and sobbing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shut up!” cried the man. And then, fixing Peter’s frightened gaze with his own, he continued, “Understand, you got a chance to save yourself. All you got to do is to tell what you know. Then you can come out and you won’t have any more trouble. We’ll take good care of you; everything’ll be easy for you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Peter continued to gaze like a fascinated rabbit. And such a longing as surged up in his soul—to be free, and out of trouble, and taken care of! If only he had known anything to tell; if only there was some way he could find out something to tell!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3225/87992.html","bookId":701,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:08:10 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:08:10 AM"}
