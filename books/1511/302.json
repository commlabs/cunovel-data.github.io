I feel truly moved for being able to write another afterword like this.

I\u0027ve made several wrong choices and sometimes, I\u0027ve hated my own work.

I thought about what heroine I\u0027d like to make this time around, and when I made the decision to make Jin, a skeleton horse, the heroine, all the other authors aside from me went crazy. That\u0027s right. To be honest, Jin became the heroine as soon as I added her in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eYou all didn\u0027t believe me, but I really went with it.

To be honest, it was just as difficult while writing them. I felt weak as I was writing them, and I had my doubts, like \u0027Is this right?\u0027, so I wasn\u0027t able to write for a month (You must be asking, \u0027Then why didn\u0027t you stop writing it?\u0027 To be honest, it was all stuff I\u0027d had stocked up already!)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eBut because there were readers who loved and supported me and had their laughs when they read about Shin Woo, I was able to put my love into Shin Woo and the rest of the cast. I was determined to write even better.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eBecause of that, I was able to complete this story. I\u0027m not sure how you feel about this, but I don\u0027t think I could\u0027ve written a different ending. It\u0027s an honor if you like the ending.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThank you very much for all the readers who stuck with me to the very end.

The type of story where the laughs come naturally while I write it. When I let various things go, I found that my hands move themselves.
