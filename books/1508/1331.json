What sort of comprehensions could Lin Ming have gained that allowed his strength to reach this degree in just a year and a half? This is just far too exaggerated. Moreover, in a time enchantment you can only increase your cultivation, not your understanding of Laws. Lin Ming’s current cultivation has only risen by an extremely small amount and he’s still at the middle Divine Sea, but his Laws and techniques are completely different!” Another old man said, unable to accept the previous point.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut the first old man said, “What you’re saying is reasonable.

But even so, geniuses with decent martial talent would experience this state several times in their long lives, so entering into sudden enlightenment wasn’t strange at all. However, when one entered into sudden enlightenment, that was usually for several quarter hours or several hours at most. To enter into sudden enlightenment for a year and a half was simply unheard of! All of these young elites had complex feelings as they heard this. Because of Lin Ming’s injuries, many of them had been gloating over his misfortune. There were even many of them that thought their disparity with Lin Ming wasn’t too great. Only now did they realize that all their previous assumptions were simply laughable jokes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUnder the arena stage, Hang Chi was watching Lin Ming and Frost Dream’s fight. His palms were pressed together as he recited Buddhist chants. Hang Chi originally thought that something strange had occurred in his battle with Lin Ming. He felt that Lin Ming shouldn’t have been severely wounded by him. Only now did he realize that not only was Lin Ming’s soul not injured, but he had instead been cultivating during this deep sleep of a year and a half. He was biding his strength, like a divine spear waiting for the right time to appear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the arena stage, Frost Dream looked at the scattered light of wills in the skies, a strange color flashing in her bright eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe used a true essence sound transmission to say to Lin Ming, “Before I came on stage, Honorable Master already warned me that I must pay attention to this battle, because this battle will temper my will. I had thought otherwise, but now I know that what my master said is true. I have indeed underestimated you.

The Divine Seal Art was also incomplete because of this. If it were the complete Divine Seal Art, then the level of it would surpass the boundaries of an Empyrean cultivation method.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Frost Dream spoke these words, she quietly took out an ice blue zither from her spatial ring.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe shimmering translucent zither seemed as if it were carved from the purest crystal. 18 strings were tightened on the zither, gleaming with a cold light.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis zither exuded a mysterious and unspeakable aura, as if the soul of a sleeping goddess were hidden within it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“My zither is called Dreamsoul, and this song is called the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrost Dream’s words were clear and calm.

Most of them were youths that were Frost Dream’s fans. As for the others, they thought that this match would finish almost immediately, thus they weren’t excited to see it. Since there was no value in watching this match, they simply didn’t come.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, on board a spirit ship, a middle-aged man was looking at a flame that lit up in front of him.

If the person delivering this message wasn’t one of their juniors who had no reason to trick them, then they simply wouldn’t believe that the message of this sound transmitting talisman was real.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“No matter what happened let’s go back and take a look. According to the sound transmitting talisman, Lin Ming wasn’t injured at all.

From dozens of miles away, these hundreds of thousands and millions of martial artists looked like a mass of spots against the sun, just like a rapidly approaching swarm of locusts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe seats were rapidly being filled.

As for whether or not they could return in time, that was still uncertain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the martial field, a melodious song reverberated through the air.

From above the arena, one could only see an unending number of flower petals sprinkling down. A fresh fragrance greeted the senses. As for Frost Dream, within this domain, she sat cross-legged high in the skies, her light blue clothes fluttered in the wind as the Dreamsoul Zither lay across her legs. At this time, she was like an immortal goddess from the highest heavens exiled to the mortal world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHer zither tunes were pleasing and symphonious.
