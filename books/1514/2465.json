Then, he lifted his head only to see that there were now two ancient symbols glimmering on the surface of Lin Dong’s body.

As the Ancestor Stone Spirit, he naturally had a profound understanding of Ancestral Symbols. Thus, he knew that the eye of the Ancestral Symbol would only appear after the owner of the Ancestral Symbol forged an extremely close relationship with it. Since the beginning of time, only a few individuals managed to activate the eye of the Ancestral Symbol.

Although he was a peak Samsara stage expert who had touched Reincarnation, his Mental Energy cultivation was far beneath Lin Dong’s. In fact, he had also practised Mental Energy before he ultimately gave up. That was because he knew just how difficult it was to reach the Symbol Grandmaster level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“He has finally reached that level.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLittle Marten sighed somewhat emotionally.

Amidst that warm white light, Lin Dong’s senses also began to spread.

Meanwhile, there were also a couple of frightening auras located in some hidden spots.

Then, his eyes gathered towards the dark Heavenly Cave. That was because he could detect an extremely frightening aura from within.

After which, the eye of the Ancestral Symbol slowly appeared between Lin Dong’s brows. Immediately, to that eye, the darkness within the Heavenly Cave was nonexistent. As if it had penetrated through space, that eye stared right at the cave, which was located at the deepest part of the Heavenly Cave.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn that cave, Lin Dong saw a withered figure who looked just like a skeleton.

Soon after, he glanced at the empty space quizzically before he waved his sleeves.

As he bathed in the unique sensation of being able to snoop on the entire world, he slowly spread his hands.
