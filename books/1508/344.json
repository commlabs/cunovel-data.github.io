The manic energy burned through the impurities of his marrow. This painful ache as if one’s bones were being set on fire could be imagined.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was supporting himself with his will alone.

Lin Ming’s body quickly heated to a scalding temperature, and blood seeped out from his pores, covering him in a shell of red blood, seeming as if it would tear like broken paper at the slightest touch.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrom the side, Zhou Xinyu could only watch in shock. Where did Lin Ming resemble a human at this moment? He was like a fish that had been taken out from a pool of blood and then dried out over a fire. The fact that Lin Ming was alive right now was a miracle in itself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn fact, to swallow the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal at the Pulse Condensation period and still last for over half an hour and already surpassed the scope of Zhou Xinyu’s understanding.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, it didn’t seem as if this miracle could continue. Lin Ming’s breath was becoming increasingly faint, and whilst he had been painfully struggling before, his struggles were weakening, like a lamp that was almost out of oil. Finally, he stopped moving altogether, his expression frozen in time like a crimson sculpture. His twisted face looked like a suffering soul that had been nailed to an execution column in hell.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Xinyu’s heart began to gradually sink.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this situation, it was meaningless even if Lin Ming survived.

For a mere Pulse Condensation period youth to swallow a Shattered Demon Heart Crystal and survive, his future achievements could be imagined!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever… he wouldn’t have this opportunity.

Zhou Xinyu had been prepared for this from the time that Lin Ming had absorbed the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal. If Lin Ming died, she would commit suicide. If she fell into Huang Sanping’s hands, her fate might be worse than death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe dreamland enchantment began to shake more and more fiercely. In this half hour, Huang Zixuan had been waiting outside of the enchantment, never leaving. During this time period, they would bombard the enchantment every once in a while.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven though Zhou Xinyu didn’t understand anything about array formations or this enchantment, she was still able to see that the energy that supported the dreamland enchantment was being continuously consumed; it probably wouldn’t be able to last much longer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKa ka ka –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBecause of the violent tremors, the ground under Zhou Xinyu’s feet had cracked, and the rocks had broken open.

It was probably because Huang Zixuan feared he would consume too much energy, and even if he broke the enchantment, he wouldn’t have the strength to stop Lin Ming from escaping. Thus, after every quarter hour of attacks, he would stop and sit down, meditating and restoring himself to his best battle state.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Xinyu let out a long breath and turned to look at Lin Ming. She was surprised to see that with Lin Ming’s terrifying appearance, he had stopped bleeding. It wasn’t that his wounds had healed, but rather that he had reached the point where there was no more blood to flow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis skin blackened red and cracking, his blood charred into a shell of blood, it was like he had gone through the ancient torture of being sliced up and then tied to a blazing copper pillar.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOnly that method could mimic Lin Ming’s miserable appearance at this time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf she hadn’t been able to feel a faint, nearly invisible breath coming from Lin Ming, Zhou Xinyu would have thought that he already died.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Xinyu’s heart surged with waves of despair. She couldn’t depend on Lin Ming. Although he had created a miracle and didn’t die after swallowing the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal with his Pulse Condensation period cultivation for an hour, at present, how could he have the ability to fight?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Xinyu stared at the dagger in her hands. She made her decision. When the enchantment broke, she would first kill Lin Ming, and then commit suicide. After all, the only reason that Lin Ming had ended up in this state was because of her. If she let Lin Ming fall into their hands, his death would be even more tragic.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOne hour… two hours… three hours…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming seemed dead. Sitting on the broken rock, his eyes dull and lifeless, the only sign that he was alive was the weak fire of life that burned within him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrom the outside, he didn’t appear any different than a corpse that was charred in a fire; there wasn’t even blood. But throughout Lin Ming’s entire body, the marrow was slowly coated in a pale gold color…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEnergy tempering marrow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe moment that Lin Ming’s blood had run dry, he had been surprised to find that the tempering marrow process became much easier!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBecause his blood was exhausted, the unforgettable pain had numbed his entire body. At this point where it was nearly impossible for him to direct the flow of true essence in his body, he found that the energy that tempered his marrows proceeded at a much smoother pace!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThen, he realized that blood and marrow were originally intertwined. Marrow gave birth to blood, and blood fed the marrow, both of them dependent on each other.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThus, if one wanted to temper marrow, they had to change their blood first!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was only when the old blood was drained away, the marrow was tempered, and new blood regenerated, would it be the complete Tempering Marrow process.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTherefore, Lin Ming no longer tried to stop his body’s old blood from leaking, letting it cleanly flow out. As for Lin Ming, relying on his strong inner vitality, he was just barely able to maintain the fire of his life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the eastern sky brightened in the dawn, the golden color of Lin Ming’s marrow became increasingly rich, as if golden flakes were mixed within.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMarrow like golden soup!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the moment that Lin Ming finished absorbing the medicinal efficacy of the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal, his new and improved marrow began to regenerate blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith the rapid consumption of the origin energy within Lin Ming’s body, new blood flowed unceasingly from his marrow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis new blood was incomparably thick and heavy, just like red mercury flowing in his blood vessels.

Although Lin Ming’s true essence was extremely thick, over half of it was still used.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, after the true essence had been consumed to a certain point, the compressed true essence in the Heretical God Seed automatically released itself. The energy of the Purple Flood Dragon Divine Thunder and the Earthcore Crimson Flame were also released along with it. The power of thunder and fire, especially the power of thunder, contained an extremely raw and vibrant force of life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLegends said that in the most ancient of times, when the infinite universe was in primal chaos, there was no life.

But, from all appearances, the fire of Lin Ming’s life still seemed incomparably weak. His true essence had hidden within the Heretical God Seed – aside from Lin Ming himself, no one else could feel this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………………..\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOutside of the enchantment, Huang Zixuan and his group began another round of attacks.

Before now he had always been staying his hand, in fear that even if he broke the enchantment, he would consume too much of his strength and wouldn’t be able to grab Lin Ming. Now after so many repeated delays, he had gradually and finally lost his patience. It was just like Huang Sanping said. In the end, this was the territory of the Seven Profound Valleys and that boy seemed to be some renowned genius from a sect. If they stayed here too long, a master might come to rescue him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Alright, let’s attack together!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuang Zixuan gave a clear, loud cough, and the black fog around his body began to thicken.
