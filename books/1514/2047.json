It was unusually steep and was covered with black trees that were also known as sound trees. These trees were quite mysterious and they had the same effects as a loudspeaker and were able to magnify a sound to many times its original volume. Each and every moment, there would be a sharp sound being emitted from the entire mountain. Hence, this mountain was termed the Demon Sound Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a stone hall standing at the top of the Demon Sound Mountain. The stone hall was somewhat dark red in colour. Its fresh blood sediment like colour gave one an extremely pressurising feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen one looked at the large hall, it was possible to see a dark golden skinned middle-aged man seated on top of a dense white bone throne.That man’s eyes were sunken. His mouth revealed a somewhat unusual shape, causing his face to appear extremely shady and insidious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has the owl sonic formation been set up?” The middle-aged man’s shady eyes looked towards two figures in front of him before he asked indifferently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, please relax. All the human head owls have moved out. Once anyone invades this place, the owl sonic formation will be activated immediately!” Amongst the two of them, the man wearing a leopard skin parted his mouth and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, is that feminine looking man really that frightening? We have already hid in the Demon Sound Mountain for a couple of days without going out.” The other large man with a fierce face curled his mouth and involuntarily asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Humph, that fellow might appear extremely fragile on the surface, but he has likely reached the Advanced Profound Life Stage. If we really end up fighting, even I am no match for him!” That middle-aged man coldly chided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Had I known earlier, I would have directly crippled that large fellow that day. All these problems would not have appeared…” That man wearing a leopard skin had a dark ruthlessness flashing over his eyes as he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, what should we do now? Don’t tell me that we can only continue to hide in the Demon Sound Mountain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle-aged man leaned against the backrest of his chair. A dense dark smile was lifted on his face, “Relax, Yuan Gate and I have some history. This time around, I have already sent a message and invited an Elder. Once he arrives, that fellow will not be able to throw his weight around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose two men quietly sighed in relief upon hearing these words. They were just about to speak when a hurried sharp cry was suddenly being transmitted from outside the large hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sharp cry had just been transmitted when the three people in the large hall had a change in expression. That middle-aged man suddenly got up. His body flashed and he rushed out of the large hall. After which, his eyes were shady as they looked towards the sky outside of the mountain. There were four figures suspended in the sky there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s you again, why won’t you leave me alone!” That middle-aged man’s eyes were dark and gold as he stared at the handsome man amongst the four before speaking in a dense manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh swoosh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, everyone within the mountain was alarmed. Immediately, waves after waves of rushing wind sound appeared. Soon after, many figures gathered and landed on the mountaintop one after another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This lineup is really quite grand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong surveyed this Demon Sound Mountain. His gaze swept over it before sensing that there were countless unusual fluctuations on the mountain. These fluctuations were extremely slight and there was a vague ear-piercing sonic wave being emitted. They were likely the human head owls that Little Marten had mentioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have injured my brother. How can I let you off so easily? Yellow Golden Ghost Owl, why don’t you kill your two subordinates and I will forget about this matter? What do you say?” Little Marten spoke with a twinkly smile. His smile contained a cunning dark chillness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose two people standing behind the Yellow Golden Ghost Owl immediately had a momentary unnaturalness in their expressions when they heard Little Marten’s words. Although their expressions were normal, their eyes involuntarily glanced at the Yellow Golden Ghost Owl’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you really think that this king is so stupid?” The Yellow Golden Ghost Owl’s eyes turned chilly as he laughed coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are right, I really thought you are so stupid.” Little Marten laughed. His appearance was as though he wanted to anger the other party to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have sharp tongue. Wait until you have the ability to break my owl sonic formation before you speak. Otherwise, you will have to flee in shame like in the past!” The Yellow Golden Ghost Owl’s eyes were dark and cold. However, he was also aware that with his current strength, he would not be able to match up against Little Marten in a head on battle. Immediately, he waved his hand. The black trees in the entire mountain immediately swayed. Soon after, numerous dark and ugly Demonic Beast, which appeared to have a human head, climbed out. They covered the entire mountain and looked extremely frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hoot hoot!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese human head owls had just appeared when they extended their heads into the sound trees. After which, their sharp cries suddenly resounded over this entire place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuzz buzz!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless black sonic waves spread across the Demon Sound Mountain in all directions. Finally, it became like a sound web that covered the entire mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black sonic waves were just like numerous enormous black snakes that were slowly wiggling around this mountain. These black sonic wave might appear quiet but Lin Dong’s group could sense a shocking destructive strength from within. If there was only one human head owl, it was hardly worth anything. However, there were currently ten thousand of them gathered together. Hence, their combined strength was quite frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, when Little Marten saw that enormous black sonic wave web, his eyes also hardened. Immediately, they quickly pulled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought that you had a trick up your sleeve. It turns out you are here just to embarrass yourself!” That Yellow Golden Ghost Owl involuntarily mocked when he saw Little Marten retreating. His subordinates behind him also laughed along with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, just when they were laughing, they saw a young lady carrying a fiery red ancient zither walking out from their group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young lady was wearing white clothes and she had a pretty face. A pair of clear bright eyes appeared like a lake while her black ponytail fell in front of her chest. That innocent manner caused those fellows on the Demon Sound Mountain to be stunned. Most of those present were ruthless people, whose hands were dyed in blood and they had done many terrible things. Hence, their eyes could not hide an obscene expression when they saw such a juicy young lady. Soon after, whistling noises permeated the air as some foul languages spread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha, do you really think that we will show mercy to such a juicy young lady?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hee hee, we can capture her to serve you, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These fellows are actually here for the express purpose of delivering a woman huh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rich killing intent involuntarily flashed across Lin Dong’s heart when he heard the foul language that permeated the place. Immediately, his eyes were just like blades as they swept over the mountain, imprinting in his mind the faces of those who were laughing the hardest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to Lin Dong’s icy cold expression, Ying Huanhuan remained unusually calm. She directly sat down while suspended in mid-air. That fiery red ancient zither in her embrace was gently placed in front of her. After which, her seemingly flawless hands gently landed. Immediately, a phoenix cry resounded over this entire place in a loud and clear manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soft cry resounded over the place and the many foul languages that were present on the Demon Sound Mountain suddenly halted. Even that Yellow Golden Ghost Owl also had a sudden change in expression while uneasiness surged within his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phoenix cry resounded and a monstrous fiery red light swept out from Ying Huanhuan’s body like a volcano. Finally, a crimson phoenix flapped its wings and rushed out from the Heavenly Phoenix Zither amidst the zither music. It lingered in the sky above Ying Huanhuan’s head. At the same time, a somewhat shocking fluctuation was being emitted from within the crimson phoenix’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pure Yuan treasure!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Yellow Golden Ghost Owl on the Demon Sound Mountain looked at the crimson phoenix that lingered. His eyes immediately shrunk as he involuntarily cried out in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct. Too bad there is no prize.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYing Huanhuan raised her head. She smiled gently at the shocked Yellow Golden Ghost Owl. Immediately, her finger suddenly moved over the zither string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crimson phoenix that lingered in the sky also let out a cry toward the sky. Its enormous wings were suddenly flapped. Immediately, a bright red sonic wave swept out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis phoenix cry also came into contact with the zither music that was being emitted from the Heavenly Phoenix Zither. Finally, it appeared to transform into a monstrous flame that directly whistled towards the owl sonic formation that covered the Demon Sound Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bright red fire sound wave swept out in all directions. Finally, it collided onto the owl sonic formation that was formed by ten thousand human head owls. Immediately, Lin Dong’s group saw that the seemingly black large python like sound wave collapsed almost instantly. It struggled and transformed into nothingness within the rising flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sound formation that thwarted Little Marten was torn apart almost instantly!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human head owls that covered the mountains also appeared to have met with their nemesis when their large formation was broken. Their bodies trembled before they emitted a ‘bang’ and actually exploded into clusters of bloody fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Yellow Golden Ghost Owl and the rest, who were laughing in a proud and arrogant manner previously, had a drastic change in expression when they saw the human head owls exploding into a bloody mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is indeed worthy of being a Pure Yuan treasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong observed this scene with a rich shock in his eyes. This Pure Yuan treasure’s strength was actually this frightening. Although part of the reason was because they countered each other, Lin Dong was aware that if he was to fight with Ying Huanhuan when she had the Heavenly Phoenix Zither, there was no guarantees that he would emerge victorious…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is your turn…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYing Huan Huan turned her head around. The pretty face, which was still calm earlier, appeared a little pale after she had used the Heavenly Phoenix Zither. At the same time, an icy chillness spread. Immediately, she clenched her silver teeth and viciously said, “Lin Dong, if you do not kill all those fellows who had mocked me previously, I will tell father and elder sister that you bullied me when I return!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong was instantly stunned speechless when he heard her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-733\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-735\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-734","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM"}
