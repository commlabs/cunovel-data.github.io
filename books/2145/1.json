I imagined the deliverer was an enigmatic figure masked in a centuries-old black hooded cloak, slipping undetected through the darkness past the Mansion\u0027s wrought-iron gate. He may have approached theSterlings \u0027 haunted-looking house in a hearse. Or perhaps he\u0027d flown over the menacing fence in the form of a bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy nightfall, the Mansion\u0027s mailbox was usually as I hollow as an empty coffin, sitting lonely at the bottom of Benson Hill, at the end of a long and windy driveway. So the letter would go unnoticed for several hours as I was stolen away in Alexander\u0027s attic room, pressed against my vampire boyfriend\u0027s deathly pale, but full of life, lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral weeks had passed since Alexander and I had returned from our adventure inHipsterville , and though Alexander hadn\u0027t bitten me, he did make this mortal feel a part of the Underworld. During that Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,time, we began to experience the vampire life without distractions. There was no school to interrupt my daytime sleep, no Trevor Mitchell to be a thorn in my side, and no Dullsville High students to ridicule my dark attire. There were no teen vampires lurking in the cemetery, disrupting Alexander\u0027s and my Stardust dates. No threat of a preteenNosferatu attempting to turn my younger brother and his nerd-mate immortal. Free of the feudingMaxwells , Alexander and I were now able to unite our mortal and immortal worlds as one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was also beginning to do something I\u0027d never had the opportunity to do before-make the Mansion my home. And why shouldn\u0027t I? On a dare, in my youth, I\u0027d snuck into it by squeezing through the abandoned estate\u0027s broken basement window. Now, invited, I could confidently walk right up its splintered stone path and through its creaky unlocked front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had never been so happy in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI transformed the Mansion into Alexander\u0027s and my private vampire castle. I felt like a medieval queen and Alexander was my handsome king. Instead of spending the rest of summer break in my tiny bedroom, I suddenly had full reign over a palatial estate. I replaced Alexander\u0027s torn and aged bedroom curtain with a brand-new black lace one. I added some candelabras I\u0027d found at a rummage sale to the ones his grandmother had brought fromRomania . I placed black roses in pewter vases and lavender-scented votives androse petals on all the empty antique end tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson, Alexander\u0027s butler, didn\u0027t seem to mind. In Tact, he even appeared to delight in a woman\u0027s (or, in my case, teen girl\u0027s touch around the barren estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt even seemed like the Mansion itself was amused by my presence. The floors appeared to give an extra squeak when I ran over them, as if the uneven boards were greeting my stay. The wind sounded louder than I\u0027d remembered as it whistled through the cracked windowpanes. The creaking in the foundation warmly echoed off the hollow wails at a higher volume than it had before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive house glistened with candles and cobwebs,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the day I nestled in Alexander\u0027s corpse-cold arms, cuddling in his coffin. At night we cranked Rob Zombie and had midnight showings ofFright Night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander gave me the next best thing to a sparkling diamond ring-a dresser drawer. His dresser was as ancient as Dracula himself,A family-owned chipped oak bureau with glass knobs held his clothes in five three-foot-long drawers. Alexander emptied the middle one for me, to be filled with anything I liked. One of the glass handles had broken and he replaced it with a wooden raven. There was even a lock on the dresser. At first I thought it was a facade, but on closer inspection it was revealed to be realWhereas everything in my bedroom-clothes, magazines, hair products-was cast about in an unorganized mess, my drawer at the Mansion was in perfect order. Alexander brought out the best in me. It held a pair of socks, my Emily the Strangehoodie , a few T-shirts, and a bat-shaped sachet. I often felt jealous of the accessories I left there, which got to call the Mansion their home, while I returned to my house onDullsville Drive .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even managed to bake at the Mansion. I prepared ghost-shaped cookies, cupcakes with witch hats, and chocolate RiceKrispie treats. With my new independence I found a side of me that I didn\u0027t know existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents were pleased, too, as long as I returned home for dinner and didn\u0027t stay out after midnight. My spirits were high, and they were content that I wasn\u0027t hiding under the covers all summer Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander seemed happier, too-and inspired. When we weren\u0027t roaming the cemetery at night, he painted landscapes and portraits of me. He began to churn out one beauty after another. Many of them were upbeat pictures of places around town we\u0027d visited. The golf course, Dullsville High,OakleyPark , Hatsy\u0027s Diner, the swings atEvansPark , and the historic library. These paintings were bright and vivid and sweet and reflected his fondness for the town. I knew he had truly found his home here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut unbeknownst to Alexander and me, all that was about to be changed by the letter that awaited him under the glow of the Mansion\u0027s lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander took my hand in his as we left the Mansion and strolled down its drive. When we reached the gate, he drew me close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These last few weeks have been great. This is how it should always be. Just you and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For eternity?\"I asked and stared up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hair hung sexily over his soulful eyes. There was a contentment I hadn\u0027t seen in Alexander. He gave me a long, breathtaking, weak-knee-making kiss. When we finally broke apart, something alongside the mailbox caught a reflection from the streetlight. The mailbox flag was sticking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny. Does the mailman deliver your post at night? I thought only I knew your true identity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander appeared puzzled, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jameson is diligent about bringing the mail in as soon as it arrives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that couldn\u0027t have been later than noon,\" I said. \"Maybe they made a special delivery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get it later,\" Alexander resolved with a shrug andput his arm around my shoulder. \"I\u0027ll walk you home first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget that,\" I said before he could lead me away. \"Maybe it\u0027s an invite to a party. Or notification that you won a trip toLondon .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or it could be a batch of coupons for pizza.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027ll never know unless you open it,\" I said coyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander paused. Then he reluctantly leaned againsti lie rickety box. He reached his pale fingers out to open the lid when we were struck with a few drops of rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s funny. It\u0027s not supposed to rain until tomorrow,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander drew back the metal door. \"Be my guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into the rusty mailbox, which was as dark as any tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI half expected to see a detached hand holding out a letter. This was, after all, a vampire\u0027s mailbox. But I saw nothing,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you afraid? It won\u0027t bite. But I might\", he said, tickling me in the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promise?\" I giggled as a few more drops of rain tapped me on the head. I imagined I could get snapped by a bird protecting its young or a field mouse hoping for a snack, I took a deep breath and reached my black chipped finger-nailed hand into the dark box but felt only aspiderweb . I reached in farther, allowing my ashen palm to disappear until I couldn\u0027t even see my Eve L wristband. Then I felt something pointy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a package\", I said, yanking it out. I had grasped a single standard-size black envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held it toward the streetlight. The letter lookedodd, First of all, there wasn\u0027t a stamp, or even a postmark. Perhaps I had been right about a fang-toothed flying mailman. In perfect beautiful silver calligraphy it read: MR. Alexander STERLING.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I handed the envelope to my boyfriend, a few sprinkles of rain hit the letter and the ink began to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like I\u0027ll have to drive you home,\" he said resignedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander tucked the letter into his jacket and took my hand and we raced up the mile-long driveway, escaping into the Mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood in the foyer of the magnificent Mansion. Lavender wafted through the estate,A new portrait of me stared back, a substitute for one of the original portraits that once lined the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no return address\", I remarked, smoothing out my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I recognize the handwriting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?Then who is it from?A long-lost girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet you get millions of love letters from old girlfriends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander placed the envelope on a hallway table. \"Wait here while I ask Jameson for his car keys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to open the letter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander was patient and disinterested. I was neither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must tell me who it\u0027s from,\" I said, snatching his mail. \"OrI\u0027ll open it,\" I teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander paused. \"It\u0027s from my parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"I asked, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been ages since Alexander\u0027s parents had been to Dullsville, and Alexander rarely spoke of them. Most of the time, I forgot they existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, open it up,\" I pushed, handing it back to him. \"Maybe they sent you a check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander took a white gold S-shaped letter opener lying on the hall table. Unlike me, who ripped open mail like a wild animal, Alexander carefully severed the envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the black letter, which had abloodred border. A check didn\u0027t fall out. Not even a Romanianleu .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander began to read the letter to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it say?\" I asked, bouncing around him and desperately trying to take a peek. But all I could make out was regal-looking letterhead with an inscription I couldn\u0027t decipher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander playfully held the letter out of my sight. But when he finished reading, he turned serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it say?\" I asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout answering, he put the letter in the envelope and returned it to the table. \"I\u0027ll take you home now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it say?\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your parents wrote to tell you nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everyone okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why aren\u0027t you smiling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I thought maybe reading a handwritten note from them made him homesick. A creepy but kind butler wasn\u0027t a substitute for parents in a lonely old estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you miss them. I bet you wish you could see them soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" he said. \"They\u0027re arriving tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow?\"I asked, shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Alexander said, almost melancholy. That means things are about to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around the Mansion. We felt like two teenswho\u0027d trashed the house with a party only to find their parents were returning from their vacation early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our \u0027coffin clutches\u0027 will have to end,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander nodded reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my decorations will have to be removed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about my drawer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found the dresser key,\" he said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Alexander closed the door behind us, I managed to catch a last glimpse of the black rose petals lying on the hallway table. The painting of me would have to be shelved and the original ones returned. The votives would have to be stored away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing was for sure: This time Alexander, not Jameson, would have to clean up the Mansion. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-1.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
