The first night we lost him after a couple of minutes: he shot up a fire escape and by the time we got to the top he was nowhere to be seen. We wandered around the city for a few hours, hoping to stumble upon him, but saw neither hide nor hair of him for the rest of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe learned from that experience. While Mr. Crepsley slept the next day, I went and bought a couple of cell phones. Evra and me tested them out before dusk, and they worked pretty well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, when Mr. Crepsley headed for the rooftops, Evra stuck to the ground. He couldn\u0027t move as fast as me. By myself, I was able to keep track of the vampire and pass the information to Evra, who followed on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven alone, it was difficult to keep up. Mr. Crepsley could move a lot quicker than me. Fortunately, he had no idea I was after him, so he didn\u0027t go as fast as he could, since he didn\u0027t think he had any need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept him in sight for three hours that night before losing him when he slipped down to street level and took a couple of turns that I missed. The next night I stuck with him until dawn. It varied after that: some nights I\u0027d lose him within an hour; others I\u0027d be on his tail until morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t do much while I was following him. Sometimes he\u0027d stop in one place for a long time above crowds of people and observe them silently (picking out his next victim?). Other times he roamed without stopping. His routes were unpredictable: he might go the same way two or three nights in a row, or try entirely new directions every night. It was impossible to anticipate his moves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra was exhausted at the end of each night - I kept forgetting he wasn\u0027t as powerful as me - but he never complained. I said he could stay in for a few nights if he wanted, but he shook his head and insisted on coming with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he thought I\u0027d kill Mr. Crepsley if he wasn\u0027t around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo fresh bodies had been discovered since news of the six in the building broke. It had been confirmed that all the bodies had been drained of their blood, and that they were ordinary humans: two men and four women. All were young - the oldest was twenty-seven - and from different parts of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra\u0027s disappointment was evident when he heard the victims were normal people - it would have made life much easier if they\u0027d been vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would doctors be able to tell the difference between a human and a vampire?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different kind of blood,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they were drained of blood,\" he reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their cells wouldn\u0027t be the same. Atoms act strangely in vampires - that\u0027s why they can\u0027t be photographed. And they\u0027d have extra-tough nails and teeth. The doctors would know, Evra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trying to keep an open mind. Mr. Crepsley hadn\u0027t killed anyone while we\u0027d been following him, which was a good sign. On the other hand, maybe he was waiting for the fuss to die down before striking again - at the moment, if somebody was late home from school or work, alarm bells rang immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr perhaps he had killed. Maybe he knew we were following him and was only killing when he was cer-tain he\u0027d lost us. That was unlikely, but I didn\u0027t rule it out completely. Mr. Crepsley could be crafty when he wanted. I wouldn\u0027t have put anything past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I was sleeping through most of the days - in order to stay awake at night - I made a point of waking a couple of hours before sunset to spend some time with Debbie. Usually I went over to her house and we sat upstairs in her bedroom and played music and talked - I was always trying to conserve energy for the night chase ahead - but sometimes we\u0027d go for a walk or hit the stores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was determined not to let Mr. Crepsley ruin my friendship with Debbie. I loved being with her. She was my first girlfriend. I knew we\u0027d have to break up sooner rather than later - I hadn\u0027t forgotten what I was - but I wouldn\u0027t do anything to shorten our time together. I\u0027d given up my nights to pursue Mr. Crepsley. I wasn\u0027t going to give up my days, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you don\u0027t come around after dark anymore?\" she asked one Saturday as we came out of a matinee. I\u0027d woken up earlier than usual so that I could spend the day with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid of the dark,\" I whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously,\" she said, pinching my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad doesn\u0027t like me going out at night,\" I lied. \"He feels a little guilty, not being around during the day. He likes Evra and me to sit with him at night and tell him what we\u0027ve been up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure he wouldn\u0027t mind if you went out now and then,\" Debbie protested. \"He let you out the night of our first date, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I snuck out,\" I said. \"He went crazy when he found out. Wouldn\u0027t speak to me for a week. That\u0027s why I haven\u0027t introduced you to him - he\u0027s still fuming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sounds like a mean old man,\" Debbie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is.\" I sighed. \"But what can I do? He\u0027s my dad. I have to stick by him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt bad lying to her, but I could hardly tell her the truth. I smiled to myself when I imagined breaking the news: \"That guy I say is my father? He\u0027s not. He\u0027s a vampire. Oh, and I think he\u0027s the one who killed those six people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you smiling at?\" Debbie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I said quickly, wiping the smile from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a strange double life - normal boy by day, deadly vampire-tracker by night - but I was enjoying it. If it had been a year or so earlier, I would have been confused; I would have tossed and turned in my sleep, worrying about what the next night would bring; my eating habits might have been affected and I would have become depressed; I probably would have chosen to focus on one thing at a time, and stopped meeting Debbie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot now. My experiences with Mr. Crepsley and the Cirque Du Freak had changed me. I was able to handle two different roles. In fact, I liked the variation: tracking the vampire at night made me feel big and important - Darren Shan, protector of the sleeping city! - and seeing Debbie in the afternoons let me feel like a normal human boy. I had the best of both worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped when Mr. Crepsley zoomed in on the next victim - the fat man. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tunnels-of-blood-the-saga-of-darren-shan-3/page-12.html","bookId":2439,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:06 PM"}
