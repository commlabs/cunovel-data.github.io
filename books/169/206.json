{"id":5026,"no":206,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"The young man arrived at precisely 4 T.S.T. (Trantorian Standard Time) and Seldon smiled. He loved punctual people. He placed his hands on his desk and made ready to heave to his feet, but the young man said, \"Please, Professor, I know you have a bad leg. You needn\u0027t stand up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon said, \"Thank you, young man. However, that does not mean that you cannot sit down. Please do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The young man removed his jacket and sat down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon said, \"You must forgive me .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; when we met and set up this appointment, I neglected to learn your name-which is .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; ?\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Stettin Palver,\" said the young man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Ah. Palver!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The name sounds familiar.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"It should, Professor. My grandfather boasted frequently of having known you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Your grandfather. Of course. Joramis Palver. He was two years younger than I was, as I recall. I tried to get him to join me in psychohistory, but he refused. He said there was no chance of his ever learning enough mathematics to make it possible. Too bad! How is Joramis, by the way?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Palver said solemnly, \"I\u0027m afraid that Joramis has gone the way of old men generally. He\u0027s dead.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon winced. Two years younger than he himself was-and dead. An old friend and they had lost touch to such a degree that, when death came, it did so unknowingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon sat there for a while and finally muttered, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The young man shrugged. \"He had a good life.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"And you, young man, where did you have your schooling?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Langano University.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon frowned. \"Langano? Stop me if I\u0027m wrong, but that\u0027s not on Trantor, is it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No. I wanted to try a different world. The Universities on Trantor, as you undoubtedly know very well, are all overcrowded. I wanted to find a place where I could study in peace.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"And what did you study?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Nothing much. History. Not the sort of thing that would lead one to a good job.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; (Another wince, even worse than the first. Dors Venabili had been a historian.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon said, \"But you\u0027re back here on Trantor. Why is that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Credits. Jobs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"As an historian?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Palver laughed. \"Not a chance. I run a device that pulls and hauls. Not exactly a professional occupation.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon looked at Palver with a twinge of envy. The contours of Palver\u0027s arms and chest were highlighted by the thin fabric of his shirt. He was well muscled. Seldon had never himself been quite that muscular.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon said, \"I presume that when you were at the University, you were on the boxing team.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Who, me? Never. I\u0027m a Twister.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"A Twister!\" Seldon\u0027s spirits jumped. \"Are you from Helicon?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Palver said with a certain contempt, \"You don\u0027t have to come from Helicon to be a good Twister.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; No, thought Seldon, but that\u0027s where the best ones come from.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; However, he said nothing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He did say, though, \"Well, your grandfather would not join me. How about you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Psychohistory?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I heard you talking to the others when I first encountered you and it seemed to me that you were talking quite intelligently about psychohistory. Would you like to join me, then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"As I said, Professor, I have a job.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Pushing and hauling. Come, come.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"It pays well.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Credits aren\u0027t everything.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"They\u0027re quite a bit. Now you, on the other hand, can\u0027t pay me much. I\u0027m quite certain that you\u0027re short of credits.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why do you say that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m guessing, in a way, I suppose. -But am I wrong?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon\u0027s lips pressed together hard, then he said, \"No, you\u0027re not wrong and I can\u0027t pay you much. I\u0027m sorry. I suppose that ends our little interview.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Wait, waaaaaaaaa.\" Palver held up his hands. \"Not quite so fast, please. We\u0027re still talking about psychohistory. If I work for you, I will be taught psychohistory, right?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Of course.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"In that case, credits aren\u0027t everything, after all. I\u0027ll make you a deal. You teach me all the psychohistory you can and you pay me whatever you can and I\u0027ll get by somehow. How about it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Wonderful,\" said Seldon joyously. \"That sounds great. Now, one more thing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Oh?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes. I\u0027ve been attacked twice in recent weeks. The first time my son came to my defense, but he has since gone to Santanni. The second time I made use of my lead-filled walking stick. It worked, but I was dragged before a magistrate and accused of assault and battery-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why the attacks?\" interjected Palver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I am not popular. I have been preaching the Fall of the Empire for so long that, now that it is coming, I am blamed for aa.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I see. Now then, what does all that have to do with the one more thing you mentioned?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I want you to be my bodyguard. You\u0027re young, you\u0027re strong, and, most of all, you\u0027re a Twister. You\u0027re exactly what I need.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I suppose it can be managed,\" Palver said with a smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46934.html","bookId":169,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:49:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:49:53 AM"}
