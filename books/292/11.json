In other words, take a break and assess what is working and what is not working. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. Stop doing what is not working and look for something new to do.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e?Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch. Ask them for tips, for little tricks of the trade. As for 16 percent tax lien certificates, I went to the county tax office and found the government employee who worked in the office. I found out that she, too, invested in the tax liens. Immediately, she was invited to lunch. She was thrilled to tell me everything she knew and how to do it. After lunch, she spent all afternoon showing me everything. By the next day, I found two great properties with her help and have been accruing interest at 16 percent ever since. It took a day to read the book, a day to take action, an hour for lunch, and a day to acquire two great deals.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e?Take classes and buy tapes. I search the newspapers for new and interesting classes. Many are for free or a small fee. I also attend and pay for expensive seminars on what I want to learn. I am wealthy and free from needing a job simply because of the courses I took. I have friends who did not take those classes who told me I was wasting my money, and yet they\u0027re still at the same job.\u003c/p\u003e   \n\u003cp\u003e?As for stocks, I like Peter Lynch\u0027s book Beating the Street for his formula for selecting stocks that grow in value. I have found that the principles of finding value are the same regardless if it\u0027s real estate, stocks, mutual funds, new companies, a new pet, a new home, a new spouse, or a bargain on laundry detergent. The process is always the same. You need to know what you\u0027re looking for and then go look for it!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e?Why consumers will always be poor. When the supermarket has a sale on, say, toilet paper, the consumer runs in and stocks up. When the stock market has a sale, most often called a crash or correction, the consumer runs away from it. When the supermarket raises its prices, the consumer shops elsewhere. When the stock market raises its prices, the consumer starts buying.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e?Learn from history. All the big companies on the stock exchange started out as small companies.\u0026nbsp; Colonel Sanders did not get rich until after he lost everything in his 60s.\u0026nbsp; Bill Gates was one of the richest men in the world before he was 30.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eHow To Pay for a Child\u0027s College Education for $7000\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAbout the Authors-Robert T.
