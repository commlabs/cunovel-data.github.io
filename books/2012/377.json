Nor can I judge his reasons for doing so – this, this is beyond all of us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young soldier called out, ‘Brother Syndecan! Do we fight this day?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been thinking about that, from the moment of Krughava’s fall, and he recalled looking across to the hacked corpse of Tanakalian, and thinking, you are only what we deserved . ‘Brothers, sisters, on this day, yes, we must fight!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence answered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had expected as much. They would not follow blindly – not any more. Not after this .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Brothers, sisters! There has been murder in our fold – we were witness to it! And in witnessing, we are made part of this crime. We must be cleansed. Today, we must fight to regain our honour!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ But who is the damned enemy? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here, the old veteran found himself at an impasse. Wolves help me, I don’t know. And I’m not the one to decide. Veteran, am I? Yes, but the only wise veterans are the ones who have left war and killing behind them. No, I’m just the biggest fool among you all. Oh, fine then! Time to fall back on useless superstition. Isn’t that what old soldiers turn to when all else fails? ‘Brothers, sisters! We must seek a sign! We must look to the world – here and on this day! We must—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then his eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaces turned. Eyes stared –\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– as the Prince of Lether lunged into view atop the high berm at the fort’s facing wall. Surging up and on to the narrow, ragged edge – and how the horse found purchase there was a mystery. That beast then reared, hoofs scything the air, with the prince glaring down at them all. And at that moment, from either side of the valley’s length, came the sound of battle’s clash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods take me! Think I just pissed my breeches .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal sat astride her charger – the beast felt thin beneath her, but was still quivering in anticipation. Bastard loves this – the stench of blood, the screams – wants at them. Gods, war is a fever! She glanced back at Spax and his mass of warriors. ‘Hold them, Warchief! Wait for it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gilk Barghast glared up at her. ‘But how long? Your damned soldiers are dying on that front – at least let us charge and take out one of the fortlets. Those onagers are carving you bloody!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that – she could see the terrible casualties those perfectly emplaced weapons were delivering as her legion struggled to overrun the first line of defences. ‘I said wait, Spax! I will need you and the Teblor to move fast when that Assail finds out—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But what if it’s all gone wrong at the Spire? Firehair! We can collapse this flank – just let us loose, damn you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something had caught her eye – she wheeled her mount round, stared towards the centre. ‘Jheckan’s fat cock! The Perish are pouring out of their trenches! Spax!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see them! Do you see Krughava?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal shook her head. ‘They’re too far away – listen, form a line to hold our inside flank, Warchief. If I was commanding that position and saw it uncontested, I’d do precisely what they’re doing right now – out and into our unprotected sides.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They’ll see us’ – Spax was now at her side, a heavy axe in his hand, a spear in the other, his face half hidden by his ornate shell helm – ‘and wheel round to bite the Letherii flank – Brys has no reserves to guard against them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If they do that,’ Abrastal said in a snarl, ‘you know what to do, Spax.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Climb up their hairy asses, yes. But—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just ready your warriors,’ she cut in, and then jabbed her spurs into her mount’s sides. ‘I’m going for a closer look!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not too close!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed her horse into a canter, the beast’s armour cladding a weaponsmith’s clamour around her. When four bodyguards rode to join her she waved them back. She hated the fools. Worse than hens. But the one messenger who drew close she gestured forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the Perish, the Letherii army had locked jaws with the first line of defenders, but they too were being savaged by the Kolansii onagers. She saw that the prince had deployed his own artillery, and the rate of fire from these heavy weapons was superior to the enemy’s. At least three positions were concentrating fire on the nearest fortlet, and the raised redoubt was studded with heavy quarrels. Foot archers and skirmishers had advanced under the cover of that counterfire and were now assaulting the position. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-377.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
