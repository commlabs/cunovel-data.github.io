I asked for help in understanding this subject from my friend Warren Silver, who is a fine attorney. Warren guided me carefully, and along the way he also told me about a quaint old device called the Stenomask, which I immediately appropriated for my own fell purposes. If I\u0027ve made procedural mistakes in the story which follows, blame me, not my legal resource. Warren also asked me--rather plaintively ¡ª if I could maybe put a \u0027good\u0027 lawyer in my book.
