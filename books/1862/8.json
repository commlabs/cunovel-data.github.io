There\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas nothing that way except two creeks andlots of trees. And her house. She hoped he was goingto try\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto walk into town, and that he didn\u0027t realize how far it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, he\u0027s gone, now forget about him. You\u0027vegot a job to do, remember? A slightly dangerous one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he\u0027s not involved. I don\u0027t believe he knows anything about what happened to Mrs. B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got the shovel and started down the road west.As she walked she found that she was able to put\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh out of her mind completely. Because all she could think of was what was waiting ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not scared to do it; I\u0027m not scared, I\u0027m notscared.... OfcourseI\u0027m scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut being scared was good, it would make her careful. She would do this job quickly and quietly. In\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough the gap in the hedge, a little fast work with the shovel, out again before anybody saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried not to picture what she was going to findwith that shovel if she was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe approachedBurdock Farm cautiously, going north and then doubling back southeast to come in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough the back property. The farmland had gone wild here, taken over by poison oak, beargrass, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edodder, besides the inevitable blackberry bushes and gorse. Tan oaks and chinquapins were moving in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime soon these pastures would be forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure I believe I\u0027m doing this, MaryLynnette thought as she reached the hedge that surrounded the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egarden. But the strange thing was that she didbelieve it. She was going to vandalize a neighbor\u0027s property\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand probably look at a dead bodyand she was surprisingly cool about it. Scared but not panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe there was more hidden inside her than she realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may not be who I\u0027ve always thought I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garden was dark and fragrant. It wasn\u0027t theirises and daffodils Mrs. B. had planted; it wasn\u0027t the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efireweed and bleeding heart that were growing wild. It was the goats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette stuck to the perimeter of the hedge,eyes on the tall, upright silhouette of the farmhouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only two windows lit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease don\u0027t let them see me and please don\u0027t letme make a noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill looking at the house, she walked slowly, taking careful baby steps to the place where the earth was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edisturbed. The first couple of swipes with the shovel hardly moved the soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. Put a little conviction in it. And don\u0027t watch the house; there\u0027s no point. If they look out, they\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing to see you, and there\u0027s nothing you can do about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she put her foot on the shovel, somethingwent hooshin the rhododendrons behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouched over her shovel,Mary-Lynnette froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop worrying, she told herself. That\u0027s not the sisters. It\u0027s not Ash coming back. That\u0027s an animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened. A mournful maaaa came from the goat shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t anything. It was a rabbit. Dig!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got out a spadeful of dirt-and then she heardit again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoosh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA snuffling sound. Then a rustling. Definitely an animal. But if it was a rabbit, it was an awfully loud one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho cares what it is? Mary-Lynnette told herself.There aren\u0027t any dangerous animalsout here. And I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enot afraid of the dark. It\u0027s my natural habitat. I love the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut tonight, somehow, she felt differently. Maybe it was just the scene with Ash that had shaken her,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade her feel confused and discontented. But just now she felt almost as if something was trying to tell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher that the dark wasn\u0027t any human\u0027s natural habitat. That she wasn\u0027t built for it, with her weak eyes and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher insensitive ears and dull nose. That she didn\u0027t belong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoosh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may have rotten hearing, but I can hearthatjustfine. And it\u0027s big. Something big\u0027s sniffing around in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of big animal could be out here? Itwasn\u0027t a deer deer went snort-wheeze. It sounded larger\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethan a coyote, taller. A bear?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she heard a different sound the vigorousshaking of dry, leathery rhododendron leaves. In the dim\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elight from the house she couldseethe branches churning as something tried to emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit\u0027s coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette clutched her shovel and ran. Nottoward the gap in the hedge, not toward the housethey\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere both too dangerous. She ran to the goat shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can defend myself in here-keep it out---hit itwith the shovel....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem was that she couldn\u0027t see from in here.There were two windows in the shed, but between\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edirt on the glass and the darkness outside, Mary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t make out anything. She couldn\u0027teven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esee the goats, although she could hear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t turn on the penlight. It\u0027ll just give awayyour position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding absolutely still, she strained tohear any thing from outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nostrils were full of goat. The layers of oat straw and decomposing droppings on the floor were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmelly, and they kept the shed too warm. Her palms were sweating as she gripped the shovel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never hit anybody ... not since Mark and Iwere kids fighting ... but, heck, I kicked a strangerthis\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emorning... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped the potential for violence would comeout now when she needed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA goat nudged her shoulder.Mary-Lynnette shrugged it away. The other goat bleated suddenlyand she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebit her lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God-I heard something out there. The goatheard it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could taste her bitten lip. It was like sucking on a penny. Blood tasted like copper, which, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erealizedsuddenly, tasted like fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething opened the shed door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened then was that Mary-Lynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething unholy was after her. Something thatsniffed like an animal but could open doors like ahuman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t see what it was-just a shadowdarkness against darkness. She didn\u0027t think ofturning on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epenlight-her only impulse was to smash out with the shovel now, to get ft before ft could get her. She was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etingling with the instinct forpure, primordial violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, she managed to hiss, \"Who is ft? Who\u0027sthere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA familiar voice said,\"Iknew you were going to do this. I\u0027ve been lookingeverywherefor you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,God, Mark.\" Mary-Lynnette sagged against wall of the shed, letting go of the shovel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goats were both bleating. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s earswere ringing. Mark shuffled farther in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, this place smells. What are you doing inhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Youjerk,\"Mary-Lynnette said. \"I almost brained you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0\"You said you were forgetting all this crazy stuff. You lied to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark, you don\u0027t ...We can talk later.... Did you hearanything out there?\" She was trying to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egather her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\" He was so calm. It made MaryLynnette feel vaguely foolish. Then his voice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esharpened. \"Like a yowling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Like a snuffling.\" Mary-Lynnette\u0027s breath was slowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t hear anything. We\u0027d better get out ofhere. What are we supposed to say if Jade comes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette didn\u0027t know how to answer that. Mark was in a different world, a happy, shiny world\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere the worst that could happen tonight was embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she said \"Mark, listen to me. I\u0027m your sister. I don\u0027t have any reason to lie to you, or playtricks\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon you, or put down somebody you like. AndI don\u0027t just jump to conclusions; I don\u0027t imagine things. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m telling you, absolutely seriously,that there is something weird going on with these girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark opened his mouth, but she went on relentlessly. \"So now there are only two things you can\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebelieve, and one is that I\u0027m completely out of mymind, and the other is that it\u0027s true. Do you really think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was thinking of the past as she said it, of allthe nights they\u0027d held on to each other when their mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewassick, of the books she\u0027d read out loud tohim, of the times she\u0027d put Band-Aids on his scrapes and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eextra cookies in his lunch. And somehow, even though it was dark, she could sense that Mark was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremembering, too. They\u0027d shared so much. They would always be connected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Mark said quietly, \"You\u0027re not crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t know what to think. Jade wouldn\u0027t hurtanybody. I justknow that. And since I met her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e, .\"Hepaused. \"Mare, it\u0027s like now I know why I\u0027m alive.She\u0027s different from any girl I\u0027ve ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s ____ she\u0027s so brave, and so funny, and so ... herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I thought it was the blond hair, MaryLynnette thought. Shows how shallow I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was moved and surprised by the change in Mark-but mostly she was frightened. Frightenedsick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cranky, cynical brother had found somebody to care about at last ... and the girl was probably\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edescended from Lucrezia Borgia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, even though she couldn\u0027t see him, shecould hear earnest appeal in his voice. \"Mare, can\u0027t we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust go home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette felt sicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke off and they both snapped their heads to look at the shed window. Outside a light had gone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut the door,\" Mary-Lynnette hissed, in a tone that made Mark dose the door to the shed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einstantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And be quiet,- she added, grabbing his arm and pulling him next to the wall. She looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecautiously out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan came out of the back door first, followedbyjade,followed by Kestrel. Kestrel had a shovel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. My. God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" Mark said, trying to get alook. Mary-Lynnette damped a hand over his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emouth.What was happening was that the girls were digging up the garden again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t see anything wrapped in garbage bags this time. So what were they doing? Destroying the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eevidence? Were they going to take it into the houseand burn it, chop it up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart was pounding madly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark had scooted up and was looking out. MaryLynnette heard him take a breath-and then choke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he was trying to think of an innocent explanation for this. She squeezed his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both watched as the girls took turns with theshovel. Mary-Lynnette was impressed all over againat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow strong they were. Jade looked so fragile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time one of the sisters glanced around the garden, Mary-Lynnette\u0027s heart skipped a beat. Don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esee us, don\u0027t hear us, don\u0027t catch us, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a respectable mound of dirt had piled up, Rowan and Kestrel reached into the hole. They lifted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout the long garbage-bagged bundle Mary-Lynnettehad seen before. It seemed to be stiff-and surpris\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eingly light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Mary-Lynnette wondered if it was too light to be a body. Or too stiff ... how longdid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erigor mortis last?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s breathing was irregular, almost wheezing.The girls were carrying the bundle to the gap inthe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark cursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s brain was racing. She hissed,\"Mark, stay here. I\u0027m going to follow them-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going with you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to tell Dad if anything happens to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going withyou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t time to argue. And something inside Mary-Lynnette was glad to have Mark\u0027s strength to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped, \"Come on, then. And don\u0027t make asound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was worried they might have already lost the sisters--it was such a dark night. But when she and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark squeezed through the gap in the rhododendron bushes, she saw a light ahead. A tiny, bobbing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhite light. The sisters were using a flashlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep quiet, move carefully. Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027tdare say it out loud to Mark, but she kept thinking it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover and over, like a mantra. Her whole consciousness was fixed on the little shaft of light that was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleading them, like a comet\u0027s tail in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light took them south, into a stand of Douglasfir. It wasn\u0027t long before they were walking into forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere are they going? Mary-Lynnette thought. She could feel fine tremors in her muscles as she tried to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emove as quickly as possible without making a sound. They were lucky--the floor of this forest was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecarpeted with needles from Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine. The needles were fragrant and slightly damp\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand they muffled footsteps. Mary-Lynnette could hardly hear Mark walking behind her except when he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehurt himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went on for what seemed like forever. It was pitch dark and Mary-Lynnette very quickly lost any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esense of where they were. Or how they were going to get back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, I was crazy to do this-and to bring Markalong, too. We\u0027re out in the middle of the woodswith\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethree crazy girls....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette stopped, holding out an arm thatMark immediately ran into. She was staring at thelight,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrying to make sure it really wasn\u0027t moving away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. It was steady. It was pointed at the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get loser,\" Mark whispered, putting his lips against Mary-Lynnette\u0027s ear. She nodded and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebegan to creep toward the light, as slowly and silently asshe knew how. Every few steps she paused and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estood absolutely still, waiting to see if the light was going to turn her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t. She got down and crawled the last ten feet to the edge of the clearing where the girls had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estopped. Once there, she had a good view of what they were doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigging. Kestrel had shoveled the pine needles aside and was working on a hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette felt Mark crawl up beside her,crushing sword fern and woodfem. She could feel his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echest heaving. She knew he saw what she saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m so sorry. Oh, Mark, I\u0027m so sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way to deny it now. Mary-Lynnetteknew. She didn\u0027t even need to look in the bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow am I going to find this place again? When I bring the sheriff back, how am I going to remember it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s like a maze in one of those computer fantasy games-Mixed Evergreen Forest in every direction,and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enothing to distinguish any bit of it from any other bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chewed her lip. The bed of moist needles she was lying on was soft and springy-actually\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomfortable. They could wait here for a long time, until the sisters left, and then mark the trees somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTakephotographs. Tie their socks to branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the clearing the flashlight beam showed a hand putting down the shovel. Then Rowan and Kestrellifted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe garbage-bagged bundle-Jade must beholding the flashlight, Mary-Lynnette thought-and lowered it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einto the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. Now cover it up and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beam showed Rowan bending to pick up the shovel again. She began quickly covering the hole with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edirt. Mary-Lynnette was happy. Over soon, she thought, and let out a soft breath of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that instant everything in the clearingchanged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flashlight beam swung wildly. Mary-Lynnette flattened herself, feeling her eyes widen. She could see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea silhouette against the light-golden hair haloed around the face. Kestrel. Kestrel was standing, facing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark and Mary-Lynnette, her body tense and still. Listening. Listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette lay absolutely motionless, mouthopen, trying to breathe without making a soundThere\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere things crawling in the soft, springy needlebed under her. Centipedes and millipedes. She didn\u0027tdare\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emove even when she felt something tickle acrossher back under her shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer own ears rang from listening. But the forest was silent ... eerily dent. All Mary-Lynnette couldhear\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas her own heart pounding wildly in herchest-although ft felt as if it were in her throat, too.It made her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehead bob with its rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn\u0027t just fear. It was something shecouldn\u0027t remember experiencing since she was nineor ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost fear. The fear of something you\u0027re not even sure exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, watching Kestrel\u0027s silhouette In the dark woods, Mary-Lynnette was afraid of monsters.She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad aterrible,terrible feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, please--I shouldn\u0027t have brought Mark here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that she realized that Mark\u0027s breathing was making a noise. Just a faint sound, not a whistling,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore like a cat purring. It was the sound he\u0027d made as a kid when his lungs were bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel stiffened, her head turning, as if to locate a noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Mark, no. Don\u0027t breathe. Hold your breath-Everything happened very fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel sprang forward. Mary-Lynnette saw her silhouette come running and jumping with unbelievable\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espeed. Toofast-nobody moves thatfast .. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enobody human....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are these girls?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer vision came in flashes,as if she were under a strobe light. Kestrel jumping. Dark trees all around. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoth caught in the beam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel coming down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtect mark...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deer. Kestrel was coming down on a deer. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s mind was filled with jumbled, careening\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimages. Images that didn\u0027t make sense. She had a wild thought that it wasn\u0027t Kestrel at all, but one of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethose raptor dinosaurs she\u0027d seen at the movies. Because Kestrel moved like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe ftwasn\u0027t a deer-but Mary-Lynnette could seethe white at its throat, as pure as a lace ruffle at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe throat of a young girl. She could see itsliquid black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deer screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t be seeing this....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deer was on the ground, delicate legs thrashing. And Kestrel was tangled with it. Her face buriedin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe white of its throat. Her arms around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deer screamed again. Wrenched violently.Seemed to be having convulsions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flashlight beam was all over the place. Then it dropped. At the very edge of the light, Mary-Lynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould see two other figures join Kestrel.They were all holding the deer. There was one last spasm and it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estopped fighting. Everything went still. Mary-Lynnette could see Jade\u0027s hair, so fine that individual strands\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecaught the light against the background of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the silent Bearing the three figures cradled thedeer. Huddling over it. Shoulders moving rhythmically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette couldn\u0027t see exactly what theywere doing, but the general scene wasf,miliar.She\u0027d seen it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon dozens of nature documentaries. About wild dogs or lionesses or wolves. The pack hadhunted and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow ft wasfeeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have always tried... to bea very good observer. And now, I have to believe my own eyes... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, Mark\u0027s breath wassobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, let me get him out of here. Please justlet us get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if she\u0027d been suddenly released from paralysis. Her lip was bleeding again-she must havebitten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown on it while she was watchingthe deer.Copperbloodfear filled her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" shegasped almost soundlessly, wiggling backward. Twigs and needles raked her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estomachas her T-shirt rode up. She grabbed Mark\u0027s arm.\"Come onl\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Mark lurched to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark!\" She wrenched herself to her knees andtried to drag him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away. Hetook a step toward theclearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was heading for the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Mary-Lynnette thought again, andthen shewas moving after him. They were caught now, andit really\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t matter what he did. Butshe wantedto bewith him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade!\" Mark said and he grabbed the flashlight.He turned it directly on the little huddle at the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eedgeof the clearing. Three faces turned toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s mind reeled. It was one thing toguess what the girls were doing; it was another thingto\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseeit. Those three beautiful faces, white in the flashlight beam ...with what looked like smearedlipstick on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheir mouths and chins. Cardinal red, thimbleberry color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t lipstick or burst thimbleberries. It wasblood, and the deer\u0027s white neck was stained with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEating the deer, they\u0027re really eating the deer;oh, God, they\u0027re really doing it....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome part of her mind-the part that had absorbedhorror movies-expected the three girls to hiss and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecringe away from the light. To block it out with bloodstained hands while making savage faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t happen. There were no animal noises, nodemon voices, no contortions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, as Mary-Lynnette stood frozen in an agonyof horror, and Mark stood trying to get a normal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreath, Jade straightened up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd said, \"What are you guys doing out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a puzzled, vaguely annoyed voice. The way youwould speak to some boy who keeps following you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverywhere and asking you for a date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette felt her mind spinning off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. Then Rowan and Kestrelstood up. Mark was breathing heavily, moving the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflashlight from one of the girls to another, but always coming back to Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What areyoudoing out here; that\u0027s the question!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe said raggedly. The flashlight whipped to the hole, then back tothe girls. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked you first,\" Jade said, frowning. If ft hadJust been her, Mary-Lynnette would have started\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etowonder if things were so awful after all. if maybethey weren\u0027t in terrible danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Rowan and Kestrel were looking at each other,and then at Mark and Mary-Lynnette. And their ex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epressions made Mary-Lynnette\u0027s throat close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have followed us,\" Rowan said.She looked grave and sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They shouldn\u0027t have beenableto,\" Kestrel said.She looked grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s because they smell like goats,\" Jade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"Mark shouted again, almostsobbing. Mary-Lynnette wanted to reach for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim, butshe couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.\"Well, can\u0027t youtell?\"She turned to her sisters.\"Now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat are we supposed todo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. Then Kestrel said, \"We don\u0027thave a choice.
