Your voicemail message is ‘talk’.” Suddenly my laughter died away and I whispered, “That is so you.” I closed my eyes tight because it was so him and I loved that about him and I finished, “Please call me so I can say I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I flipped the phone shut, placed it on the kitchen countertop, lifted both hands and pressed my fingers in my cheeks. Then I closed my eyes again and sent a wish into the universe that Cabe Delgado would call me back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I grabbed my phone, grabbed my purse, grabbed my net bags and headed out the front door to my car, which was still at the curb where I parked it prior to the drive-by. It hadn’t moved in over a week. I was halfway down my walk when Detective Mitch Lawson slid up and parked behind my Hyundai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him in his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis being there could only mean, firstly, something was wrong with Ginger and/or I was in some peril or secondly, he’d heard things were over with Hawk, I was down the mountain from Tack and he was moving in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy… me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI buried this reaction and met him on the sidewalk, wishing he wasn’t so freaking hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey Mitch,” I greeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gwendolyn,” he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at his smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, I will repeat, me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve managed not to get shot at or kidnapped for a whole week,” I bragged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good for you.” He kept smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please tell me you’re not here to inform me my winning streak is ending and another incident is imminent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “Not here for that, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tipped my head to the side. “Then why are you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“’Cause Leo spoke to me this mornin’ and he gave me a surprise invitation to girls’ night in with cosmopolitans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to kill Cam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mitch,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honey, I said no,” he replied gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt relief and loss, the first more than the last but I felt loss all the same mostly because he was hot, partly because he was gentle and also partly because I really liked his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got closer and I held my ground as his soulful eyes I liked so much locked with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he shared, “Every instinct I got is tellin’ me to move in and protect you not only from everything that’s happening with your sister but from two men I’m uncertain are good for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in my lips and bit them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the same time,” he went on,” I’m sensin’ that you need space to do whatever you’re gonna do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let my lips go and nodded my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That said, I’d be a fool not to tell you where I stand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was another type of man, the type they are, I wouldn’t hesitate gettin’ in there and muddling your head by making my play.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point, I felt I should intervene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hawk is… well, Hawk,” I lamely defended him. “And Tack is giving me space.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t space to install you in his house, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that was semi-true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But –”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s makin’ his play,” Lawson said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh… okay,” I agreed since he would know because he was a man and I, obviously, wasn’t. “But I’m home now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Lawson agreed. “You’re in a home that every time you walk up your walk or into your livin’ room, you’ll be reminded of Tack’s play.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmm.

I like kissing and if you’re a good kisser that’ll definitely muddle my head. No joke. And, honest to God, I don’t need that right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head dipped toward me, I braced but his face stopped an inch away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, honey,” he whispered, “I won’t kiss you but just for your information, I’ve had no complaints.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bet he hadn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great,” I muttered. “Now I’m curious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned and his thumb moved over my cheek. “You ever wanna assuage that curiosity, find me.
