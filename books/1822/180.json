Lady Katharine? This is the man I said you simply had to meet, Sir Philip Wilkins.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But you said you wanted to show me a painting from Lady Metcalf’s collec-’ the young lady began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Anyway,’ Captain Carter said hurriedly, and loudly. ‘Now we’re all introduced. Isn’t that wonderful?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wonderful is hardly the word for it,’ Sir Philip breathed. He had an expression on his face I had seen only once before - when he had first beheld Ella at Lady Metcalf’s last ball. ‘Perfect would be more appropriate. Lady Katherine, would you do me the honour of the next dance?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh… why, certainly, Sir Philip,’ she said, blinking in astonishment. ‘But… don\u0027t you already have a partner? Your companion…’ her eyes wandered to the place where Ella was standing. Ella opened her mouth reflexively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beside her in a flash, grasping her arm in iron grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She doesn\u0027t mind at all. I think she’s a bit tired.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh. Well, if that’s the case…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Philip’s eyes hadn’t left Lady Katherine. He extended his arm, and she took it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla watched as the two of them departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘W-what was that?’ she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can’t you tell? A miracle, of course.’ Across the ballroom I could see Edmund. He was staring gloomily out of the window again. ‘And,’ I added, ‘We might just have time for another, tonight. Look over there.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ella.’ Edmund’s voice was hoarse. I could tell, because I was hiding behind a potted plant nearby. I was curious, all right? I had worried myself to death over this affair of Ella\u0027s. The least I wanted in exchange was to see the happy end!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young piano tuner’s son looked around the ballroom. ‘I don\u0027t see Sir Philip anywhere.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla took a step forward. Her eyes were glued to the young man opposite her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So is it done, then?’ he asked bitterly. ‘Are you his now? He has proposed?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmund’s eyes flew open. Then his jaw muscles twitched. ‘But he will.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother step. They were standing in front of each other now. I thanked God that they were in a quiet corner of the room, with nobody paying attention to them. The way they were looking at each other made things all too clear for anyone who cared to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ Ella whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you mean, no?’ His voice was just a whisper, too - desperation, pain, with a tinge of hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It appears Sir Philip has lost interest in me. I… I cannot rightly understand it, but he was introduced to another young lady, and from one moment to the next seemed to forget I exist.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spark of hope in Edmund exploded into a fiery blaze. I could see it shining in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He is a fool,’ he said in a quiet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was he who took the next step forward. They were standing almost close enough to kiss now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they wouldn’t, here in the ballroom, would they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo keep myself from screaming a warning to the two lovelorn fools, I bit down on the sleeve of my dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So, Miss Linton, it appears that you are still free.’ Edmund’s voice was casual, but his eyes weren’t leaving hers for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It appears so, Mr Conway.’ Her eyes seemed fixed on his by the same unbreakable force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And will remain so? Or will Sir Philip appear at your door tomorrow morning, begging forgiveness?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do not ask me how… but I know in my heart that he is gone. He will trouble me no more.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmund took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And don\u0027t you regret his leaving? Haven’t all the flowers that he sent you conquered your heart?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If he were to send me a million red roses it would not gain him my love.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded approvingly. My sister might have very strange ideas about love, life and honour, but at least she wasn’t mercenary. Never that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And his noble titles, his lands?’ Edmund enquired. ‘Are you not sorry to lose such grand prospects?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Were he the King of England and offered me all the riches of the Empire, I would not be swayed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite right! Oh, that’s female rectitude for you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So you are truly still free,’ Edmund breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am,’ she said, then, lowering her voice so only he - and I, behind the nearby potted plant - could hear: ‘But my heart is not. It was given to another long ago.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove, adoration, yearning, relief: A symphony of emotions played on Edmund’s face - or maybe it was a sonata, considering he was a piano tuner’s son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then,’ he said, his voice trembling in vibrato, full of feeling, ‘since you are still free, may I request the honour of your hand for the next dance, Miss Linton?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dipped her head in the chastest curtsy I had ever seen. ‘You may, Mr Conway. I shall await you on the dance floor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, she glided away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay I say that, up to this moment, I had never looked forward to a dance as I did to this one? Which says something about my attitude to dancing, considering I wasn’t even going to be involved in the actual exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen, finally, one song ended and the musicians struck up the tune of the next dance, I stuck a bit more of my dress into my mouth, just to be sure I wouldn’t make any noise and alert them to my secret hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere he was! Edmund was approaching Ella while in the background, the notes of a slow waltz sounded. The most romantic of all couple dances - I couldn’t have planned it better myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped in front of her and bowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Miss Ella?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe curtsied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mr Conway.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe extended his arm. She took it, her face composed, but her eyes shining with an inner light. I didn’t fail to notice that instead of placing her hand against his so his fingers touched the back of her hand, as was custom for reasons of propriety, she slid her hand into his so that his fingers could surround all of her little hand and touch her palm. When her hand was in his, I could see a small shiver going through her body. It was as if she had finally come home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-180.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM"}
