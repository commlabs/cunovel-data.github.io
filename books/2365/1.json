One of them almost gets an entire hospital closed down, the second one kills a patient for a million dollars, and the third one is murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrews stopped to take a deep breath. \"And they\u0027re all women! Three goddam women doctors! The media is treating them like celebrities. They\u0027re all over the tube. 60 Minutes did a segment on them. Barbara Walters did a special on them. I can\u0027t pick up a newspaper or magazine without seeing their pictures, or reading about them. Two to one, Hollywood is going to make a movie about them, and they\u0027ll turn the bitches into some kind of heroines! I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the government put their faces on postage stamps, like Presley. Well, by God, I won\u0027t have it!\" He slammed a fist down against the photograph of a woman on the cover of Time magazine. The caption read: \"Dr. Paige Taylor -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Angel of Mercy or the Devil\u0027s Disciple?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Paige Taylor.\" The district attorney\u0027s voice was filled with disgust. He turned to Gus Venable, his chief prosecuting attorney. \"I\u0027m handing this trial over to you, Gus. I want a conviction. Murder One. The gas chamber.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Gus Venable said quietly. \"I\u0027ll see to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting in the courtroom watching Dr. Paige Taylor, Gus Venable thought: She\u0027s jury-proof. Then he smiled to himself. No one is jury-proof. She was tall and slender, with eyes that were a startling dark brown in her pale face. A disinterested observer would have dismissed her as an attractive woman. A more observant one would have noticed something else - that all the different phases of her life coexisted in her. There was the happy excitement of the child, superimposed onto the shy uncertainty of the adolescent and the wisdom and pain of the woman. There was a look of innocence about her. She\u0027s the kind of girl, Gus Venable thought cynically, a man would be proud to take home to his mother. If his mother had a taste for cold-blooded killers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an almost eerie sense of remoteness in her eyes, a look that said that Dr. Paige Taylor had retreated deep inside herself to a different place, a different time, far from the cold, sterile courtroom where she was trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trial was taking place in the venerable old San Francisco Hall of Justice on Bryant Street. The building, which housed the Superior Court and County Jail, was a forbidding-looking edifice, seven stories high, made of square gray stone. Visitors arriving at the courthouse were funneled through electronic security checkpoints. Upstairs, on the third floor, was the Superior Court. In Courtroom 121, where murder trials were held, the judge\u0027s bench stood against the rear wall, with an American flag behind it. To the left of the bench was the jury box, and in the center were two tables separated by an aisle, one for the prosecuting attorney, the other for the defense attorney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe courtroom was packed with reporters and the type of spectators attracted to fatal highway accidents and murder trials. As murder trials went, this one was spectacular. Gus Venable, the prosecuting attorney, was a show in himself. He was a burly man, larger than life, with a mane of gray hair, a goatee, and the courtly manner of a Southern plantation owner. He had never been to the South. He had an air of vague bewilderment and the brain of a computer. His trademark, summer and winter, was a white suit, with an old-fashioned stiff-collar shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige Taylor\u0027s attorney, Alan Penn, was Venable\u0027s opposite, a compact, energetic shark, who had built a reputation for racking up acquittals for his clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men had faced each other before, and their relationship was one of grudging respect and total mistrust. To Venable\u0027s surprise, Alan Penn had come to see him the week before the trial was to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came here to do you a favor, Gus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeware of defense attorneys bearing gifts. \"What did you have in mind, Alan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now understand - I haven\u0027t discussed this with my client yet, but suppose - just suppose - I could persuade her to plead guilty to a reduced charge and save the State the cost of a trial?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you asking me to plea-bargain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable reached down to his desk, searching for something. \"I can\u0027t find my damn calendar. Do you know what the date is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"June first. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a minute there, I thought it must be Christmas already, or you wouldn\u0027t be asking for a present like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gus ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenable leaned forward in his chair. \"You know, Alan, ordinarily, I\u0027d be inclined to go along with you. Tell you the truth, I\u0027d like to be in Alaska fishing right now. But the answer is no. You\u0027re defending a coldblooded killer who murdered a helpless patient for his money. I\u0027m demanding the death penalty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she\u0027s innocent, and I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenable gave a short, explosive laugh. \"No, you don\u0027t. And neither does anyone else. It\u0027s an open-and-shut case. Your client is as guilty as Cain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until the jury says so, Gus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will.\" He paused. \"They will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Alan Penn left, Gus Venable sat there thinking about their conversation. Penn\u0027s coming to him was a sign of weakness. Penn knew there was no chance he could win the trial. Gus Venable thought about the irrefutable evidence he had, and the witnesses he was going to call, and he was satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no question about it. Dr. Paige Taylor was going to the gas chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had not been easy to impanel a jury. The case had occupied the headlines for months. The cold-bloodedness of the murder had created a tidal wave of anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe presiding judge was Vanessa Young, a tough, brilliant black jurist rumored to be the next nominee for the United States Supreme Court. She was not known for being patient with lawyers, and she had a quick temper. There was an adage among San Francisco trial lawyers: If your client is guilty, and you\u0027re looking for mercy, stay away from Judge Young\u0027s courtroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day before the start of the trial, Judge Young had summoned the two attorneys to her chambers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to set some ground rules, gentlemen. Because of the serious nature of this trial, I\u0027m willing to make certain allowances to make sure that the defendant gets a fair trial. But I\u0027m warning both of you not to try to take advantage of that. Is that clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, your honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, your honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable was finishing his opening statement. \"And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the State will prove - yes, prove beyond a reasonable doubt - that Dr. Paige Taylor killed her patient, John Cronin. And not only did she commit murder, she did it for money ... a lot of money. She killed John Cronin for one million dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, after you\u0027ve heard all the evidence, you will have no trouble in finding Dr. Paige Taylor guilty of murder in the first degree. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jury sat in silence, unmoved but expectant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable turned to the judge. \"If it please your honor, I would like to call Gary Williams as the State\u0027s first witness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the witness was sworn in, Gus Venable said, \"You\u0027re an orderly at Embarcadero County Hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you working in Ward Three when John Cronin was brought in last year?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you tell us who the doctor in charge of his case was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Taylor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you characterize the relationship between Dr. Taylor and John Cronin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Objection!\" Alan Penn was on his feet. \"He\u0027s calling for a conclusion from the witness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sustained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me phrase it another way. Did you ever hear any conversations between Dr. Taylor and John Cronin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure. I couldn\u0027t help it. I worked that ward all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you describe those conversations as friendly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I remember the first day Mr. Cronin was brought in, and Dr. Taylor started to examine him, he said to keep her ...\"He hesitated. \"I don\u0027t know if I can repeat his language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead, Mr. Williams. I don\u0027t think there are any children in this courtroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he told her to keep her fucking hands off him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said that to Dr. Taylor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell the court what else you may have seen or heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he always called her \u0027that bitch.\u0027 He didn\u0027t want her to go near him. Whenever she came into his room, he would say things like \u0027Here comes that bitch again!\u0027 and \u0027Tell that bitch to leave me alone\u0027 and \u0027Why don\u0027t they get me a real doctor?\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable paused to look over to where Dr. Taylor was seated. The jurors\u0027 eyes followed him. Venable shook his head, as though saddened, then turned back to the witness. \"Did Mr. Cronin seem to you to be a man who wanted to give a million dollars to Dr. Taylor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn was on his.feet again. \"Objection! He\u0027s calling for an opinion again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Young said, \"Overruled. The witness may answer the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn looked at Paige Taylor and sank back in his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no. He hated her guts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Arthur Kane was in the witness box. Gus Venable said, \"Dr. Kane, you were the staff doctor in charge when it was discovered that John Cronin was mur...\" He looked at Judge Young. \"... killed by insulin being introduced into his IV. Is that correct?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you subsequently discovered that Dr. Taylor was responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Kane, I\u0027m going to show you the official hospital death form signed by Dr. Taylor.\" He picked up a paper and handed it to Kane. \"Would you read it aloud, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane began to read. \"John Cronin. Cause of Death: Respiratory arrest occurred as a complication of myocardial infarction occurring as a complication of pulmonary embolus.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in layman\u0027s language?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The report says that the patient died of a heart attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that paper is signed by Dr. Taylor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Kane, was that the true cause of John Cronin\u0027s death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The insulin injection caused his death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Dr. Taylor administered a fatal dose of insulin and then falsified the report?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you reported it to Dr. Wallace, the hospital administrator, who then reported it to the authorities?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I felt it was my duty.\" His voice rang with righteous indignation. \"I\u0027m a doctor. I don\u0027t believe in taking the life of another human being under any circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next witness called was John Cronin\u0027s widow. Hazel Cronin was in her late thirties, with flaming red hair, and a voluptuous figure that her plain black dress failed to conceal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable said, \"I know how painful this is for you, Mrs. Cronin, but I must ask you to describe to the jury your relationship with your late husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe widow Cronin dabbed at her eyes with a large lace handkerchief. \"John and I had a loving marriage. He was a wonderful man. He often told me I had brought him the only real happiness he had ever known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long were you married to John Cronin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two years, but John always said it was like two years in heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Cronin, did your husband ever discuss Dr. Taylor with you? Tell you what a great doctor he thought she was? Or how helpful she had been to him? Or how much he liked her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never mentioned her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did John ever discuss cutting you and your brothers out of his will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not. He was the most generous man in the world. He always told me that there was nothing I couldn\u0027t have, and that when he died ...\" Her voice broke. \"... that when he died, I would be a wealthy woman, and ...\" She could not go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Young said, \"We\u0027ll have a fifteen-minute recess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated in the back of the courtroom, Jason Curtis was filled with anger. He could not believe what the witnesses were saying about Paige. This is the woman I love, he thought. The woman I\u0027m going to marry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately after Paige\u0027s arrest, Jason Curtis had gone to visit her in jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll fight this,\" he assured her. \"I\u0027ll get you the best criminal lawyer in the country.\" A name immediately sprang to mind. Alan Penn. Jason had gone to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been following the case in the papers,\" Penn said. \"The press has already tried and convicted her of murdering John Cronin for a bundle. What\u0027s more, she admits she killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know her,\" Jason Curtis told him. \"Believe me, there\u0027s no way Paige could have done what she did for money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since she admits she killed him,\" Penn said, \"what we\u0027re dealing with here then is euthanasia. Mercy killings are against the law in California, as in most states, but there are a lot of mixed feelings about them. I can make a pretty good case for Florence Nightingale listening to a Higher Voice and all that shit, but the problem is that your lady love killed a patient who left her a million dollars in his will. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Did she know about the million before she killed him, or after?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paige didn\u0027t know a thing about the money,\" Jason said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenn\u0027s tone was noncommittal. \"Right. It was just a happy coincidence. The DA is calling for Murder One, and he wants the death penalty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you take the case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenn hesitated. It was obvious that Jason Curtis believed in Dr. Taylor. The way Samson believed in Delilah. He looked at Jason and thought: I wonder if the poor son of a bitch had a haircut and doesn\u0027t know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason was waiting for an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take the case, as long as you know it\u0027s all uphill. It\u0027s going to be a tough one to win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn\u0027s statement turned out to be overly optimistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the trial resumed the following morning, Gus Venable called a string of new witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nurse was on the stand. \"I heard John Cronin say, \u0027I know I\u0027ll die on the operating table. You\u0027re going to kill me. I hope they get you for murder.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn attorney, Roderick Pelham, was on the stand. Gus Venable said, \"When you told Dr. Taylor about the million dollars from John Cronin\u0027s estate, what did she say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said something like \u0027It seems unethical. He was my patient.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She admitted it was unethical?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she agreed to take the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn was cross-examining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Pelham, was Dr. Taylor expecting your visit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, no, I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t call her and say, \u0027John Cronin left you one million dollars\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So when you told her, you were actually face-to-face with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a position to see her reaction to the news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when you told her about the money, how did she react?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well - she - she seemed surprised, but ...\" \"Thank you, Mr. Pelham. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trial was now in its fourth week. The spectators and press had found the prosecuting attorney and defense attorney fascinating to watch. Gus Venable was dressed in white and Alan Penn in black, and the two of them had moved around the courtroom like players in a deadly, choreographed game of chess, with Paige Taylor the sacrificial pawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable was tying up the loose ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the court please, I would like to call Alma Rogers to the witness stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his witness was sworn in, Venable said, \"Mrs. Rogers, what is your occupation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Miss Rogers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do beg your pardon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I work at the Corniche Travel Agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your agency books tours to various countries and makes hotel reservations and handles other accommoda-i tions for your clients?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to take a look at the defendant.

Gus Venable walked over to the prosecutor\u0027s table and held up some folders. \"The police found these brochures in Dr. Taylor\u0027s apartment. These are travel itineraries to Paris and London and Venice, brochures for expensive hotels and airlines, and one listing the cost of chartering a private yacht.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a loud murmur from the courtroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prosecutor had opened one of the brochures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here are some of the yachts listed for charter,\" he read aloud. \"The Christina O ... twenty-six thousand dollars a week plus ship\u0027s expenses ... the Resolute Time, twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars a week ... the Lucky Dream, twenty-seven thousand three hundred dollars a week.\" He looked up. \"There\u0027s a check mark after the Lucky Dream.

Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prosecutor looked over at the jury, shook his head, and took his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Taylor, when you administered the insulin to John Cronin, were you aware that he had put you in his will for one million dollars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I was stunned when I learned about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nose should be growing, Gus Venable thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never discussed money or gifts at any time, or asked John Cronin for anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint flush came to her cheeks. \"Never!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you were on friendly terms with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. When a patient is that ill, the doctor-patient relationship changes. We discussed his business problems and his family problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you had no reason to expect anything from him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He left that money to you because he had grown to respect you and trust you. Thank you, Dr. Taylor.\" Penn turned to Gus Venable. \"Your witness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Penn returned to the defense table, Paige Taylor glanced toward the back of the courtroom. Jason was seated there, trying to look encouraging. Next to him was Honey. A stranger was sitting next to Honey in the seat that Kat should have occupied. If she were still alive. But Kat is dead, Paige thought. I killed her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable rose and slowly shuffled over to the witness box. He glanced at the rows of press. Every seat was filled, and the reporters were all busily scribbling. I\u0027m going to give you something to write about, Venable thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in front of the defendant for a long moment, studying her. Then he said casually, \"Dr. Taylor ... was John Cronin the first patient you murdered at Embarcadero County Hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn was on his feet, furious. \"Your honor, I - !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Young had already slammed her gavel down. \"Objection sustained!\" She turned to the two attorneys. \"There will be a fifteen-minute recess. I want to see counsel in my chambers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the two attorneys were in her chambers, Judge Young turned to Gus Venable. \"You did go to law school, didn\u0027t you, Gus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, your honor. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see a tent out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was a whiplash. \"My courtroom is not a circus, and I don\u0027t intend to let you turn it into one. How dare you ask an inflammatory question like that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize, your honor. I\u0027ll rephrase the question and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll do more than that!\" Judge Young snapped. \"You\u0027ll rephrase your attitude. I\u0027m warning you, you pull one more stunt like that and I\u0027ll declare a mistrial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, your honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they returned to the courtroom, Judge Young said to the jury, \"The jury will completely disregard the prosecutor\u0027s last question.\" She turned to the prosecutor. \"You may go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable walked back to the witness box. \"Dr. Taylor, you must have been very surprised when you were informed that the man you murdered left you one million dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn was on his feet. \"Objection!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sustained.\" Judge Young turned to Venable. \"You\u0027re trying my patience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize, your honor.\" He turned back to the witness. \"You must have been on very friendly terms with your patient. I mean, it isn\u0027t every day that an almost complete stranger leaves us a million dollars, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige Taylor flushed slightly. \"Our friendship was in the context of a doctor-patient relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t it a little more than that? A man doesn\u0027t cut his beloved wife and family out of his will and leave a million dollars to a stranger without some kind of persuasion. Those talks you claimed to have had with him about his business problems ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Young leaned forward and said warningly, \"Mr. Venable ...\" The prosecutor raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. He turned back to the defendant. \"So you and John Cronin had a friendly chat. He told you personal things about himself, and he liked you and respected you. Would you say that\u0027s a fair summation, doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And for doing that he gave you a million dollars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige looked out at the courtroom. She said nothing. She had no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenable started to walk back toward the prosecutor\u0027s table, then suddenly turned to face the defendant again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Taylor, you testified earlier that you had no idea that John Cronin was going to leave you any money, or that he was going to cut his family out of his will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much does a resident doctor make at Embar-cadero County Hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn was on his feet. \"Objection! I don\u0027t see...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a proper question. The witness may answer.\" \"Thirty-eight thousand dollars a year.\" Venable said sympathetically, \"That\u0027s not very much these days, is it? And out of that, there are deductions and taxes and living expenses. That wouldn\u0027t leave enough to take a luxury vacation trip, say, to London or Paris or Venice, would it?\" \"I suppose not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. So you didn\u0027t plan to take a vacation like that, because you knew you couldn\u0027t afford it.\" \"That\u0027s correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn was on his feet again. \"Your honor ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Young turned to the prosecutor. \"Where is this leading, Mr. Venable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to establish that the defendant could not plan a luxury trip without getting the money from someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s already answered the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn knew he had to do something. His heart wasn\u0027t in it, but he approached the witness box with all the good cheer of a man who had just won the lottery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Taylor, do you remember picking up these travel brochures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you planning to go to Europe or to charter a yacht?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. It was all sort of a joke, an impossible dream. My friends and I thought it would lift our spirits. We were very tired, and ... it seemed like a good idea at the time.\" Her voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn glanced covertly at the jury. Their faces registered pure disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable was questioning the defendant on reex-amination. \"Dr. Taylor, are you acquainted with Dr. Lawrence Barker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a sudden memory flash. I\u0027m going to kill Lawrence Barker. I\u0027ll do it slowly. I\u0027ll let him suffer first... then I\u0027ll kill him. \"Yes. I know Dr. Barker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what connection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Barker and I have often worked together during the past two years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you say that he\u0027s a competent doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn jumped up from his chair. \"I object, your honor. The witness ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before he could finish or Judge Young could rule, Paige answered, \"He\u0027s more than competent. He\u0027s brilliant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenn sank back in his chair, too stunned to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you care to elaborate on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Barker is one of the most renowned cardiovascular surgeons in the world. He has a large private practice, but he donates three days a week to Embarcadero County Hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you have a high regard for his judgment in medical matters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And do you feel he would be capable of judging another doctor\u0027s competence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenn willed Paige to say I don\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus Venable turned to the jury, \"You\u0027ve heard the defendant testify that she had a high regard for Dr. Barker\u0027s medical judgment. I hope she listened carefully to Dr. Barker\u0027s judgment about her competence ... or the lack of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Penn was on his feet, furious. \"Objection!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sustained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late. The damage had been done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the next recess, Alan Penn pulled Jason into the men\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell have you gotten me into?\" Penn demanded angrily. \"John Cronin hated her, Barker hated her. I insist on my clients telling me the truth, and the whole truth. That\u0027s the only way I can help them. Well, I can\u0027t help her. Your lady friend has given me a snow job so deep I need skis. Every time she opens her mouth she puts a nail in her coffin. The fucking case is in free fall!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon, Jason Curtis went to see Paige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a visitor, Dr. Taylor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason walked into Paige\u0027s cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paige ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to him, and she was fighting back tears. \"It looks pretty bad, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason forced a smile. \"You know what the man said - \u0027It\u0027s not over till it\u0027s over.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jason, you don\u0027t believe that I killed John Cronin for his money, do you? What I did, I did only to help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you,\" Jason said quietly. \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her into his arms. I don\u0027t want to lose her, Jason thought. I can\u0027t. She\u0027s the best thing in my life. \"Everything is going to be all right. I promised you we would be together forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige held him close and thought, Nothing lasts forever. Nothing.
