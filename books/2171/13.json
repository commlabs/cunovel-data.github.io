Everything\u0027s so ... dead, so quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was a white blur in her dark face. \"I have to go. Sooner out, sooner back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the hatch clicked shut behind her, the stillness of the little room boomed in Brett\u0027s ears. He looked at the bed where Scudi had slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that sleep was impossible. His attention wouldn\u0027t leave the slight impression left by Scudi\u0027s body on the other bed. Such a small room, why did it feel bigger when she was in it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heartbeat was fast, suddenly, and as it got faster he found a constriction of his chest whenever he tried to take a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung his legs off the bed, pulled on his clothes and started to pace. His gaze moved erratically around the room - sink and water taps, the cupboards with conchlike whorls in the corners, the hatch to the head ... everything was costly metal but plain and rigid in design. The water taps were shiny silver dolphins. He felt them and touched the wall behind them. The two metals had entirely different textures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room had no ports or skylights, nothing to show the exterior world. The walls with their kelplike undulations were breached only by the two hatches. He felt that he had an unlimited amount of energy and nowhere to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe folded the beds back into their couch positions and paced the room. Something boiled in him. His chest became tighter and a swarm of wriggling black shapes intruded on his vision. There was nothing around him, he thought, but water. A loud ringing swelled in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, Brett jerked open the outside hatch and lurched into the passageway. He only knew that he needed air. He fell to one knee there, gagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Mermen stopped beside him. One of them gripped his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man said, \"Islander.\" His voice betrayed only curiosity. \"Easy does it,\" another man said. \"You\u0027re safe.\" \"Air!\" Brett gasped. Something heavy was standing on his chest, and his heart still raced inside his straining chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man gripping his shoulder said: \u0027There\u0027s plenty of air, son. Take a deep breath. Lean back against me and take a deep breath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett felt the tension clawing at his belly lift a bony finger, then another. A new, commanding voice behind him demanded: \"Who left this Mute alone here?\" There was a scuffling sound, then a shout: \"Medic! Here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett tried to take a fast, deep breath but couldn\u0027t. He heard a whistling in his constricted throat. \"Relax. Breathe slow and deep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him to a port,\" the commanding voice said. \"Get him somewhere he can see outside. That usually works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands straightened Brett and lifted him with arms under his shoulders. His fingertips and lips conveyed the buzz and tingle of electric shock. A blurred face bent close to him, inquiring, \"Have you ever been down under before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett\u0027s lips shaped a silent \"No.\" He was not sure he could walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be afraid,\" the blur said. \"This occasionally happens your first time alone. You\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett grew aware that people were hurrying him along a pale orange passageway. A hand patted his shoulder. The tingling receded, and the black shapes floating across his vision began to shrink. The people carrying him stopped and eased him to the deck on his back, then propped him upright. His head was clearing, and Brett looked up at a string of lights. The light cover directly overhead had blobs of dust and bugs inside. A head blotted out his view and Brett had an impression of a man about Twisp\u0027s age with a backlighted halo of dark hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feeling better?\" the man asked. Brett tried to speak in a dry mouth, then managed to croak, \"I feel stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the sudden laughter all around him, Brett ducked his head and looked out a wide port into the sea. It was a horizontal view of low-lying kelp with many fish grazing between its leaves. This was a perspective of undersea life far different from the driftwatch views topside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older man patted his shoulder and said, \"That\u0027s all right, son. Everyone feels stupid some time or other. It\u0027s better than being stupid, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp would have said that, Brett thought. He grinned up at the long-haired Merman. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best thing for you to do, young man,\" the Merman said, \"is to go back to a quiet room. Try being alone again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought pumped Brett\u0027s pulse rate back up. He imagined himself alone once more in that little room with those metal walls and all that water ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who brought you in here?\" the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett hesitated. \"I don\u0027t want to cause any trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t,\" the medic reassured him. \"We can get the person who picked you up freed from regular duty to make your entry into life here a little easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scudi ... Scudi Wang picked me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! There are people waiting for you nearby. Scudi will be able to guide you. Lex,\" he spoke to a man out of Brett\u0027s line of vision, \"call down to Scudi at the lab.\" The medic returned his attention to Brett. \"There\u0027s no hurry, but you do have to get used to being alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice behind Brett said, \"She\u0027s on her way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of Islanders have a rough time of it down under at first. I\u0027d say every one, in some way or other. Some recover all at once, a few brood for weeks. You look like you\u0027re getting over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone on the other side of Brett lifted Brett\u0027s chin and pressed a container of water to his lips. The water felt cold and tasted faintly of salt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett saw Scudi rushing down the long passage, her small face twisted with worry. The Merman helped Brett to his feet, gripped his shoulder, then hurried toward Scudi. \"Your friend\u0027s had a stress flash.\" The man hurried past Scudi, speaking back at her. \"Put him through the solo drill before he learns to like the panic, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved her thanks, then helped Brett manage the walk back to her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should\u0027ve stayed,\" Scudi said. \"You were my first, and you seemed to be doing so well ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I was, too,\" he said, \"so don\u0027t feel bad. Who was that medic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shadow Panille. I work with his department in Search and Rescue - Current Control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he was a medic, they said -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is. Everyone in S and R holds that rating.\" Scudi took his arm. \"Are you all right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushed. \"It was stupid of me. I just felt I had to get some air, and when I got out into the passage ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault,\" she insisted. \"I forgot about stress flash and they\u0027re always telling us about it. I felt ... well, like you\u0027d always been here. I didn\u0027t think of you as a newcomer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The air in the passage felt so thick,\" Brett said. \"Almost like water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it all right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He inhaled a deep breath. \"Kind of ... wet, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It gets heavy enough to do your laundry in sometimes. Some Islanders have to carry dry bottles while they\u0027re adjusting. If you feel well now, we can report in. Some people are waiting for you.\" She shrugged at his inquiring look. \"You have to be processed, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, reassured by her presence but still nursing an abrupt hollow feeling. Islanders heard many stories of the way Mermen regulated everything in their lives - reports for this, tests for that. He started to ask her about this processing but was interrupted as a large group of Mermen clattered past carrying equipment - tanks, hoses, stretchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi called after them, \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re bringing in the accident survivors,\" one of them hollered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeiling speakers came alive then: \"Situation Orange! Situation Orange! All emergency personnel to your stations. This is not a drill. This is not a drill. Keep docking areas clear. Keep passageways clear. Essential duty stations only for regular personnel. Essential duty stations only. All others report to alternate stations. Medical emergencies only in the passages or trauma shed vicinity. Situation Orange. This is not a drill ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore Mermen dashed past them. One shouted back, \"Clear the passageways!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Scudi called after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Island that sank off Mistral Barrier. They\u0027re bringing in the survivors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett yelled, \"Was it Vashon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ran on without answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi pulled at his arm. \"Hurry.\" She directed him down a side passage and pulled up a large hatchway, which slid aside at her touch. \"I\u0027ll have to leave you here and report to my station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett followed her through a double-hatchway into a cafe. Booths with low-set tables lined the walls. More low tables were scattered throughout the room. Plasteel pillars in rows defined aisleways. Each pillar was set up as a serving-station. A booth in the corner held two people bent toward each other across the table. Scudi hurried Brett toward this booth. As they approached the figure on the right became clear. Brett missed a step. Every Islander knew that face - that craggy head with its elongated neck and its brace work: Ward Keel!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi stopped at the booth, her hand gripping Brett\u0027s. Her attention was on Keel\u0027s companion. Brett recognized the red-haired woman. He\u0027d glimpsed her on Vashon. Until he\u0027d met Scudi, he\u0027d considered Kareen Ale the most beautiful woman alive. Scudi\u0027s low-voiced introduction was not necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were supposed to be registration and processing personnel here,\" Ale said, \"but they\u0027ve gone to their stations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett swallowed hard and looked at Keel. \"Mr. Justice, they said a whole Island\u0027s been sunk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Guemes,\" Keel said, his voice cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAle looked at Keel. \"Ward, I suggest that you and young Norton go to my quarters. Don\u0027t stay long in the passages and stay inside until you hear from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must go, Brett,\" Scudi said. \"I\u0027ll come for you when this is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAle touched Scudi\u0027s arm and they hurried away. Slowly, painfully, Keel eased himself from the booth. He stood, letting his legs adjust to the new position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett listened to the people rushing through the passage outside the hatchway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaboriously, Keel began shuffling toward the exit hatch. \"Come along, Brett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they stepped into the aisle leading toward the exit, a hatch behind them hissed open, gushing the rich smells of garlic fried in olive oil and spices he couldn\u0027t name. A man\u0027s voice called out: \"You two! No one in the passages!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett whirled. A heavy set man with dark gray hair stood in the open hatchway to the kitchen. His rather flat features were set in a scowl, which changed into a forced smile as he looked past Brett and recognized Keel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Mr. Justice,\" the man said. \"Didn\u0027t recognize you at first. But you still shouldn\u0027t be in the passages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were instructed to vacate this place and meet the ambassador at her quarters,\" Keel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stepped aside and gestured toward the kitchen. \"Through here. You can occupy Ryan Wang\u0027s old quarters. Kareen Ale will be notified.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel touched Brett\u0027s shoulder. \"This is closer,\" he said. The man led them into a large, low-ceilinged room flooded with soft light. Brett could not find the light source; it seemed to wash the room equally in gentle tones. Thick, pale blue carpeting caressed Brett\u0027s bare feet. The only furnishings appeared to be plump cushions in browns, burnt red and dark blue, but Brett, knowing how Mermen swung things out of walls, suspected other furniture might be concealed behind the hangings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will be comfortable here,\" the man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do I have the pleasure of thanking for this hospitality?\" Keel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Finn Lonfinn,\" the man said. \"I was one of Wang\u0027s servants and now have the task of caring for his quarters. And your young friend is ... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brett Norton,\" Brett answered. \"I was on my way to registration and processing when the alarm sounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett studied the room. He had never seen a place quite like it. In some respects, it was vaguely Islander - soft cushions, all the metal covered by woven hangings, many recognizably of topside manufacture. But the deck did not move. Only the faint sigh of air pulsing through vents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have friends on Guemes?\" Lonfinn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The C/P is from Guemes,\" Keel reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonfinn\u0027s eyebrows lifted and he turned his attention to Brett. Brett felt required to give a reply. \"I don\u0027t think I know anyone from Guemes. We haven\u0027t been in proximate drift since I was born.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonfinn focused once more on Keel. \"I asked about friends, not about the C/P.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the man\u0027s tone, Brett heard the hard slam of a hatch between Merman and Islander. The word mutant lay in the air between them. Simone Rocksack was a Mute, possibly a friend of Mute Ward Keel ... probably not. Who could be friendly with someone who looked like that? The C/P could not be a normal object of friendship. Brett felt suddenly threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel had realized with an abrupt shock that Lonfinn\u0027s assumptions of obvious Merman superiority were barbed. This attitude was a common one among less-traveled Mermen, but Keel felt himself filled with disquiet at an abrupt inner awakening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was ready to accept his judgment! Part of me has assumed all along that Mermen are naturally better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unconscious thing, borne for years, it had unfolded in Keel like an evil flower, showing a part of himself he had never suspected. The realization filled Keel with anger. Lonfinn had been asking: \"Do you have any little friends on Guemes? How sad that some of your less fortunate playmates have been killed or maimed. But maiming and death are such an integral part of your lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say you were a servant,\" Keel said. \"Are you telling me these quarters are no longer occupied?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They belong rightfully to Scudi Wang, I believe,\" Lonfinn said. \"She says she doesn\u0027t care to live here. I presume they\u0027ll be leased before long and the income credited to Scudi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett gave the man a startled look and glanced once more around these spacious quarters - everything so rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill in shock at his inner revelation, Keel shuffled to a pile of blue cushions and eased himself onto them, stretching his aching legs in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky Guemes was a small Island,\" Lonfinn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky?\" The word was jerked from Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonfinn shrugged. \"I mean, how much more terrible if it had been one of the bigger Islands ... even Vashon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know what you mean,\" Keel said. He sighed. \"I\u0027m aware that Mermen call Guemes \u0027The Ghetto.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ... doesn\u0027t mean anything, really,\" Lonfinn said. There was an undertone of anger in his voice as he realized he had been put on the defensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What it means is that the larger Islands have been called upon to help Guemes from time to time - basic foods and medical supplies,\" Keel pressed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much trade with Guemes,\" Lonfinn admitted. Brett looked from one man to the other, detecting the subterranean argument boiling. There were things behind those words but Brett suspected that it would take more experience with Mermen before he understood just what those things were. He sensed only the fact of argument, the barely concealed anger. Some Islanders, Brett knew, made slanted references to Guemes as \"Ship\u0027s Lifeboat.\" There was often laughter in the label, but Brett had understood it to mean that Guemes held a large number of WorShipers - very religious, fundamentalist people. It was no surprise that the C/P was a native of Guemes. Somehow, it was right for Islanders to joke about Guemes, but it rankled him to hear Lonfinn\u0027s intrusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonfinn strode across the room and tested the controls on a hatch. He turned. \"The head\u0027s through this hatch and guest bedrooms are down the hallway here in case you wish to rest.\" He returned and looked down at Keel. \"I imagine that thing around your neck becomes tiresome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel rubbed his neck. \"It does indeed. But I know we all must put up with tiresome things in our world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonfinn scowled. \"I wonder why a Merman has never been C/P?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett spoke up, recalling Twisp\u0027s comment on this very question. He repeated it: \"Maybe Mermen have too many other things to do and aren\u0027t interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not interested?\" Lonfinn looked at Brett as though seeing him for the first time. \"Young man, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re qualified to discuss political matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the boy was really asking a question,\" Keel offered, smiling at Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Questions should be asked directly,\" Lonfinn muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And answered directly,\" Keel persisted. He looked at Brett. \"This matter has always been in dispute among \u0027the faithful\u0027 and their political lobby. Most of Ship\u0027s faithful topside think it would be a disaster to turn over the C/P\u0027s power to a Merman. They have so much power over other aspects of our otherwise dreary lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonfinn smiled without humor. \"A difficult political subject for a young man to understand,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett gritted his teeth at the patronizing attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonfinn crossed to the wall behind Keel, touched a depression there and a panel slid away. It revealed a huge port that looked out on an undersea courtyard with transparent ceiling and a watery center where clusters of small fishes flashed and turned among delicate, richly colored plants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must be going,\" Lonfinn said. \"Enjoy yourselves. This\" - he indicated the area he had just exposed - \"should keep you from feeling too enclosed. I find it restful myself.\" He turned to Brett, paused and said, \"I\u0027ll see that the necessary forms and papers are sent for you to sign. No sense wasting time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, Lonfinn departed, leaving by the same hatch they had entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett looked at Keel. \"Have you filled out these papers? What are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The papers fulfill the Merman need to feel they have everything pinned down. Your name, your age, circumstances of your arrival down under, your work experience, any talents you might have, whether you desire to stay ...\" Keel hesitated, cleared his throat. \"... your parentage, their occupations and mutations. The severity of your own mutation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett continued to regard the Chief Justice silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in answer to your other question,\" Keel continued, \"no, they have not required this of me. I\u0027m sure they have a long dossier on me giving all the important details ... and many unimportant tidbits, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett had fastened onto one thing in Keel\u0027s statement. \"They may ask me to stay down under?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They may require you to work off the cost of your rescue. A lot of Islanders have settled down under, something I mean to look into before going topside. Life here can be very attractive, I know.\" He ran his fingers through the soft nap of carpet as if for emphasis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett looked at the ceiling, wondering how it would be to live most of his life here away from the suns. Of course, people from down under did go topside lots of times, but still ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best disaster-recovery team is composed mostly of ex-Islanders,\" Keel said. \"So says Kareen Ale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard the Mermen always want you to pay your own way,\" Brett said. \"But it shouldn\u0027t take long to work off the cost of my ...\" He suddenly thought of Scudi. How could he ever repay Scudi? There was no coin for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mermen have a great many ways of attracting desirable and acceptable Islanders,\" Keel said. \"You appear to be someone they\u0027d be interested in having aboard. However, that should not be your chief concern of the moment. By any chance, do you have medical training?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just first aid and resuscitation through school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel drew in a deep breath and expelled it quickly. \"Not enough, I\u0027m afraid. Guemes went down quite a while ago. I\u0027m sure the survivors they\u0027re just now bringing in will require more expert attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett tried to swallow in a tight throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuemes, a whole Island sunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could carry a stretcher,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel smiled sadly. \"I\u0027m sure you could. But I\u0027m also sure you wouldn\u0027t be able to find the right place to take it. Either one of us would just be in the way. At the moment, we\u0027re just what they think of us - two Islander misfits who might do more harm than good. We\u0027ll just have to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe seldom get rid of an evil merely by understanding its causes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- C. G. Jung, Shiprecords\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a curse in the Histories,\" Bushka said, \"old as humans. It says, \u0027May you live in interesting times.\u0027 I guess we got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some time now, as the coracles cruised through the half-night of Pandora\u0027s open sea, Bushka had been telling Twisp what he\u0027d learned from Gallow and from members of Gallow\u0027s crew. Twisp could not see Bushka. Only the thin red light of the RDC\u0027s arrow glowed in the coracle. All else was darkness - not even stars overhead. A damp cloud cover had swept over them shortly after nightfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ll be more open land than you can possibly imagine,\" Bushka continued. \"As much land as you see water around you now. So they say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all bad for the Islands,\" Twisp said. \"And those rockets you say they\u0027re launching ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they\u0027re well-prepared,\" Bushka said. His voice came out of the darkness with a smug sound that Twisp did not like. \"Everything\u0027s ready for bringing down the hyb tanks. Warehouses full of equipment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard for me to imagine land,\" Twisp admitted. \"Where will they lift it out of the sea first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The place that the settlers here called \u0027Colony.\u0027 On the maps, it\u0027s a slightly curved rectangle. The curve is being widened and lengthened into an oval with a lagoon at its center. It was a complete city before the Clone Wars, walled in with plasteel, so it makes a good place to start. Sometime this year they\u0027ll pump it out and the first city will be exposed to the sky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waves will wipe it out,\" Twisp said. \"No,\" Bushka countered. \"They\u0027ve been five generations preparing for this. They\u0027ve thought of everything - the politics, economics, the kelp ...\" He broke off as one of the squawks uttered a sleepy bleat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men froze, listening expectantly. Was there a night-roaming hunt of dashers nearby? The squawks remained quiet. \"Bad dream,\" Bushka muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Guemes Island with its religious fanatics stood in the way of this land-colonization project, is that it?\" Twisp asked. \"Them and their \u0027stick-to-the-Islands-where-Ship-left-us\u0027 attitude?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka did not respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp thought about the things the man had revealed. A lifetime of fisherman\u0027s isolation clouded Twisp\u0027s imagination. He felt provincial, incapable of understanding matters of worldwide politics and economics. He knew what worked, and that seemed simple enough. All he knew was that he distrusted this grand scheme, which Bushka seemed half-enamored of in spite of the experience with Gallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no place in this plan for Islanders,\" Twisp noted. \"No, no place for mutants. They\u0027re to be excluded,\" Bushka said. His voice was almost too low to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who\u0027s to say what a mutant is?\" Twisp demanded. Bushka remained silent for a long time. Finally, he said, \"The Islands are obsolete, that much I can\u0027t argue with. In spite of everything else, Gallow\u0027s right about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp stared into the darkness where Bushka sat. There was a spot just to the left that felt a little darker than the rest. That\u0027s where Twisp aimed his attention. An image of Merman life came to him - their habitation, places Bushka had described. Home, he thought. What kind of person calls this home? Everything sounded regular and nearly identical, like some insect hive. It gave him the creeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This place you\u0027re guiding us to,\" Twisp asked, \"what is it? Why is it safe for us to go there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Green Dashers are a small organization,\" Bushka said. \"Launch Base One is huge - by the numbers alone our odds are better there than anyplace else in decent range.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is hopeless, Twisp thought. If Mermen had not found Brett already, what else could he do? The sea was too big and it had been a fool\u0027s errand trying to fix on the place where the wave wall hit Vashon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be dawn soon,\" Bushka said. \"We should be there shortly after dawn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp heard the spat-spattering of rain on the tarp. He checked his eelcells with the handlight and found that they were turning a noticeable gray. Right on cue there was a tremendous deafening lightning thunder flash behind them. In the aftershock stillness, he heard Bushka holler, \"What the fuck was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp flashed the handlight in that direction. Bushka had gone under the tarp head-first and somehow got himself turned around. He clutched the edges of the tarp, steadying himself, and in the glow from the handlight, his wide eyes punctuated his bleached face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just charged our batteries,\" Twisp said. \"We might take one more of those if it comes around. Then I\u0027ll bring in the antenna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit,\" Bushka snorted, \"fishermen are crazier than I thought. It\u0027s a wonder any of you come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We manage,\" Twisp said. \"Tell me, how did you become an expert on Mermen so fast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka emerged from the tarp. \"As a historian, I already knew a great deal about them before going down under. And then ... you learn fast when it\u0027s necessary for survival.\" There was the sound of chest-puffing behind his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurvival, Twisp thought. He extinguished the handlight and wished that he could see Bushka\u0027s face without having to flash the light on him. The man was not a total coward; that seemed evident. He had crewed in the subs, like many other Islanders putting in their service time. Obviously knew how to navigate. But then, most Islanders learned that in school. With all that, Bushka was driven to seek a life down under. According to him, it was because the Mermen had better historical records, some they had never even examined themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka was like some of the Guemes fanatics, Twisp realized. Driven. A seeker after hidden knowledge. Bushka wanted his facts from the source and he didn\u0027t care how he got there. A dangerous man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp renewed his alertness, sensitive to any shift in Bushka\u0027s position. The coracle would transmit such movement ... should Bushka try to take him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better believe it\u0027s happening,\" Bushka said. \"There\u0027ll be no place for Islands pretty soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Radio says Ward Keel\u0027s gone down under on some fact-finding mission,\" Twisp said. \"You suppose he knew about it all along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA foot scraped the deck as Bushka shifted his weight. \"According to Gallow, they did it without word topside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled between them for a time. Twisp kept his attention on the guiding arrow, a red glowing pointer. How could some of the things Bushka said be believed? The barrier above the sea was real, though. And there was no doubt Bushka had run-for-it fever - something truly big and ugly chased him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor his part, Bushka lay prisoned in his own thoughts. I should\u0027ve had the guts to kill them. But the thing Gallow represented was bigger than Gallow. No mistaking that. To a historian, it was a familiar pattern. Ship\u0027s surviving records reported a plenitude of violence, leaders who tried to solve human problems by mass killing. Until the madness of Guemes, Bushka had thought such things distantly unreal. Now, he knew the madness, a thing with teeth and shadows. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-13.html","bookId":2171,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:13 PM"}
