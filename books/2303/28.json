Erik exited the freeway and pulled into the first hamburger place they came to. He opted to stay in the car while Daisy and her brother went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes, he got out of the car to stretch his legs. He was hungry, too, he mused, but not for a cheeseburger and fries. He wanted something warm and fresh. The thought had no sooner crossed his mind than a couple of teenagers approached, heading for the restaurant. It took only moments to hypnotize the two of them and lead them into the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik fed quickly, released them from his spell, and was back in the car before Daisy and her brother returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bought you a burger and a Coke,\" Daisy said, thrusting a brown paper sack into his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik looked at her, one brow arched in amusement as he muttered his thanks, then pulled out of the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d think we could stop long enough to eat inside,\" Alex said. \"I don\u0027t know about you two, but I could use a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it,\" Daisy said, unwrapping her cheeseburger. \"I want to put as much distance between us and Rhys as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart girl,\" Erik murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know about it?\" Alex asked brusquely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just what Daisy told me,\" Erik replied mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" Alex said, frowning. \"Just what did she tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just that some pervert named Costain is after her, and that she\u0027s afraid of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all she said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik shrugged. \"Pretty much. The guy sounds like some kind of psycho to me, and that makes him dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can look after her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Erik said, unable to keep the sneer out of his voice. \"I saw how well you did that the last time you and Costain tangled. I don\u0027t want the same thing happening to Daisy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy glanced over her shoulder. Alex\u0027s jaw was so tight she thought it might crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the silence got unbearable, Daisy turned on the radio, then scanned the stations until she found one playing soft rock, hoping it would ease the tension in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t, but try as she might, she couldn\u0027t think of anything to say. Some time later, Erik pulled into a gas station. Daisy and Alex got out of the car to use the restroom and pick up some snacks, leaving Erik to fill the tank. While they were gone, Erik tossed the hamburger and Coke Daisy had bought him into the trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tank was full and he was standing by the driver\u0027s side door when Daisy and her brother emerged from the mini-mart. He felt a twinge of jealousy as he watched them talking and laughing together. He had never had any brothers or sisters. His parents, his wife, and his children were long dead. He had lived alone so long, he could scarcely remember what it was like to be part of a family, to share a house with people you loved, people who loved and cared about you in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you don\u0027t want anything?\" Daisy asked as she climbed into the passenger seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t eat much, do you?\" Alex asked, settling himself in the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I eat when I\u0027m hungry,\" Erik replied. Sliding behind the wheel, he started the car and pulled onto the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, they were back on the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was near dawn when Erik pulled off the freeway onto a side road. \"One of you will have to drive for a while,\" he said. \"I need to get some rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suits me,\" Alex said. Climbing out of the backseat, he stretched his back and shoulders. \"I was getting claustrophobic back there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik sent Daisy a meaningful glance as he took Alex\u0027s place in the backseat. She nodded, silently letting him know that she would make sure the windows stayed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked at her, then reached for the blanket on the floor. Drawing it up over his shoulders and head, Erik closed his eyes and felt himself falling into nothingness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex jerked a thumb over his shoulder. \"He\u0027s kind of strange, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy\u0027s heart skipped a beat, afraid that they were about to have a conversation she definitely didn\u0027t want any part of. \"Strange? No, I don\u0027t think so. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let\u0027s see. He sleeps all day. I\u0027ve never seen him eat. He wears a lot of black.\" Alex shrugged. \"Remind you of anyone? Or anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he\u0027s a little eccentric,\" Daisy said, struggling to keep her voice calm. \"He\u0027s an artist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy turned sideways in her seat. \"Just what are you trying to say? Or not say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if he wasn\u0027t hanging around with you, I\u0027d say he was a vampire. But I know if that was the case, you would have told me, because keeping a secret like that would put both of our lives in danger. And I know you\u0027d never do that, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy looked out the window so Alex couldn\u0027t see her face. She was a horrible liar and everyone in the family knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex grunted softly. \"You\u0027re hiding something, Daisy Mae, and I\u0027ll find out what it is, sooner or later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped it was later. Much later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to stop for gas. And I\u0027m ready for some breakfast,\" Alex muttered, glancing at his watch. \"Or lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex found a drive-through burger place for lunch. For appearance\u0027s sake, Daisy ordered a hamburger for Erik, even though she knew he wouldn\u0027t eat it. Twenty minutes later, they were back on the road again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Alex said between bites of his chili burger, \"how long have you known him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik? Not long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. A couple of weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two weeks? That\u0027s it? Geez, Daisy, the way you two have been carrying on...\" Alex shook his head. \"Two lousy weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed longer than that, Daisy thought. Sometimes it seemed as if she had known Erik forever...forever, she thought, smiling inwardly. He could very possibly live forever, as long as Alex and her father didn\u0027t find out what he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late afternoon when Alex pulled off the highway in search of a place for dinner. They hadn\u0027t had anything to eat except an ice cream cone since morning and she was starving. She wondered if Erik needed to feed and how he would manage it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she felt the tension growing inside her as Alex pulled into the parking lot of a buffet restaurant. The sun hadn\u0027t set yet. She really didn\u0027t want to see Erik go up in smoke, yet Alex would expect Erik to be hungry by now, since he hadn\u0027t eaten breakfast or lunch. Her heart was pounding with dread by the time Alex parked the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Alex could say anything, she reached over the backseat and shook Erik\u0027s shoulder. \"Hey,\" she called softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik woke immediately. Pulling the blanket away from his face, he looked at her and smiled. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re stopping for an early dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik looked out the window. It was an hour until sunset. \"Give me a minute,\" he said, glancing at Daisy\u0027s brother. \"My leg\u0027s asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll meet you inside,\" Daisy said. \"Come on, Alex, I\u0027m hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex didn\u0027t seem the least bit suspicious as he followed her into the restaurant. He told the cashier a third party would be joining them, paid the bill, and the two of them picked up their trays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she filled her plate with salad, Daisy wondered how Erik would get into the restaurant without being burned by the sun, and what excuse he would use for not eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trying to decide between ham or roast beef when Erik appeared behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he said, \"what looks good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex was standing in front of Daisy. He turned at the sound of Erik\u0027s voice, his gaze moving over the corn and potatoes on Erik\u0027s tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m having the ham,\" Daisy said brightly. \"The roast is too rare for my taste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik grinned at her. \"It looks just right for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found a table in a corner, away from the windows. Daisy and Erik sat side by side. Alex sat across from them, a curious light in his eyes as he watched Erik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much longer until we get home?\" Daisy asked, hoping her nervousness didn\u0027t show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik speared a slice of meat with his fork. \"We should be there by late tomorrow night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy stared at him. Was he really going to eat? Could he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at Alex, who had also chosen roast beef, then back at Erik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Medium rare,\" Alex said, taking a bite. \"Just the way I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded, though he hadn\u0027t eaten a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made small talk for a few minutes, then Alex went back for seconds, leaving Daisy and Erik alone at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" she asked. Erik hadn\u0027t eaten a thing, but Alex seemed totally oblivious to that fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little vampire magic,\" Erik said. \"I planted the suggestion in your brother\u0027s mind that I\u0027m eating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded. Had it not been necessary to allay Alex\u0027s growing suspicions, he would have waited for Daisy and her brother in the car. The sound of too many beating hearts, the scent of warm blood combined with the unpleasant odors of so much food, played havoc with his senses and his self-control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get in the restaurant without getting burned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I transported myself from the car to here.\" He would have preferred to do the same thing when he had followed her to the mall. It would have been less painful, but he wouldn\u0027t have been able to track her scent that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy nodded. While growing up, she and her brothers had heard numerous stories of the remarkable powers that vampires possessed. But it was one thing to hear about them, or read about them, and quite another to know that they weren\u0027t stories at all, but fact, and that the man sitting beside her was capable of things she had always regarded as myths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex returned a short time later, the plates on his tray piled high. \"Are you two finished already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite,\" Daisy said. \"I want to sample their chocolate cake. And maybe that apple pie. They both look really good.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-28.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
