She said she would rather play on the beach. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her mother said to her, “Rikka, if you will learn to knit, I will give you a ‘Wonder-Ball.’”\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A ‘Wonder-Ball!’ What is that, mother?” asked Rikka.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is a ball of yarn,” said her mother. “There are little presents or surprise gifts wound up in the ball. As you knit the yarn from the ball, the gifts fall out.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, I should like a Wonder-Ball, Mother,” cried Rikka.[74] “I will learn to knit and I will knit fast so that I can knit my presents from the ball.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rikka’s mother made her a “Wonder-Ball.” It was a very big, blue ball. She gave Rikka some shining needles and taught her how to knit.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rikka tried and tried, and at last she learned to knit. It was very hard at first, but she did not give up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The first gift she knit from her ball was a little silver pencil. She was much pleased with it.\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She knit hard every day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It seemed a long time before she came to the next gift.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then a pretty chain of red beads came out of the “Wonder-Ball.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She knit and knit away. The gifts she knit from the “Wonder-Ball” were many.\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She sang a little song as she worked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She called it her “Knitting Song.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Click, clack, click, clack,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On go the needles, forward and back,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Careful never a stitch to drop,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Busily knit with never a stop.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forward and back, forward and back,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bright little needles, click, click, clack.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [76]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Among her gifts was a little gold ring with a blue stone in it. She had also a wooden bird, a tiny doll, and a thimble. She called her thimble her “finger-hat.”\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rikka was very happy. She thanked her good mother many times for the lovely, big “Wonder-Ball.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rikka soon learned to knit very well. She liked to knit even when she had no “Wonder-Ball.” She knit a scarf for her father. She knit a jacket for her doll. “It is such fun to make things,” said busy little Rikka.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2821/77966.html","bookId":498,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:50:38 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 12:50:38 PM"}
