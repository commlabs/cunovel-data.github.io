{"id":31613,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII ANOTHER JOB","content":"It was early morning a few days later when Skippy and Tully set out on the first stage of their enterprise. The inlet was dark and shadowy, and the sweet soft breath of spring floated about their heads. In its wake, however, came the smell of mud and fish at low tide and the boy was glad to get out into the fresh salt air of the river.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s the only thing that makes me hate the inlet,” he said to Big Joe as they turned up toward the yacht club. “I get feelin’ choked, sorta—you know, sumpin’ like I imagine people feel when they go to jail.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now don’t ye be feelin’ spooky,” Tully admonished. “’Tain’t the spirit for a job like this. Sure, there’s somethin’ ’bout mentionin’ jail what gives me the creeps. So don’t be thinkin’ we’ll be gettin’ in any jams—’tis hard luck, so ’tis.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 135\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m sorry, Big Joe,” said Skippy contritely. “I—I didn’t say it for that, honest, because even Pop can tell you how the inlet always made me feel like that. I’m all right when I’m up on the barge; it’s only the inlet makes me feel that way. Just as soon as we strike the river I feel better.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s the talk, me boy. And I’m sorry for jumpin’ on ye so quick. I thought ye was nervous ’bout this job, so I did.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aw, no,” Skippy protested, but his quivering lip belied his words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tully did not see it, however, for he was intent on approaching the yacht club unobtrusively.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now if this ain’t a good break,” he said enthusiastically. “There’s a party o’ three goin’ out on a two days’ fishing trip at Snug Island. She’s called the Minnehaha, me pal tells me, and she’s a baby. Twenty-six footer! Guy that owns her is Crosley.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Crosley Warehouse where I worked last?” Skippy asked anxiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sure, and now don’t that beat all! Little Old Lady Luck’s playin’ with us, kid! Sure ’tis a break to make him hand over his bucks or sink in Watson’s Channel!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You wouldn’t let ’em do that, Big Joe?” Skippy asked fearfully. “You wouldn’t!”\n\u003cbr\u003e 136\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nah, Big Joe ain’t that hard hearted, much as I got it in for thim rich bugs. I’ll just be lettin’ thim think I’m doin’ thim a favor not lettin’ Watson’s Channel close ’em in, so I will.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do you s’pose Mr. Crosley’ll get wise we’re doin’ it a-purpose?” Skippy was beginning to weaken already.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And how’ll he be doin’ that, I’m askin’ ye? Me pal tipped me off they be due at dawn. We’ll be there and gone a half hour afore they show up. So don’t be startin’ worryin’, kid. Leave everythin’ to Big Joe, as if ye didn’t know nothin’ ’bout the business at all, at all. You don’t say nothin’. Be lookin’ dumb if anybody talks to ye.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will,” said Skippy, half-whimsically, and half-frightened. “I’ll be scared dumb so you needn’t worry that I’ll get nervous an’ give anythin’ away—gee whiz!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Big Joe laughed, then he said, “Awright, kid, D’ye be knowin’ Skinner and Crosley be pals?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Gee!” said Skippy. “Now I know why I couldn’t get a job. Skinner put ’em all wise, huh? Gee!”\n\u003cbr\u003e 137\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were silent after that and chugged steadily toward the yacht club. A ferry-boat was crossing far up the river and her lights blinked out over the dark water like a hundred evil eyes. Hundreds of boats anchored near shore bobbed up and down on the tide like a ghostly river army, and from the shore more lights winked down on them knowingly as if they knew their secret.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They crept into the slip alongside the yacht club; Big Joe had shut off the motor. At a sign from him, Skippy dropped the anchor and without a word, he got out and crept across the float and onto the club grounds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After the darkness hid him from view Skippy looked about, nervously. There was a little light gleaming from under the vast clubhouse porch and suddenly he saw Big Joe’s ponderous figure pass under it. Presently, he halted and held out his hand to a man approaching him from the other direction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Skippy sighed with relief and relaxed. At least Big Joe had met his comrade without accident. Besides, no one seemed to be about. He heard not a sound except the river lapping restlessly around the piling under the slip and the swish of anchored craft as they swayed on the tide.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It seemed to him that Big Joe was staying an interminable time, but as an actual fact, it was just seven minutes before he saw the man’s bulky figure coming stealthily toward him.\n\u003cbr\u003e 138\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Skippy weighed anchor without a sound and they pushed the kicker out of the slip with oars. A little distance below the club, Big Joe turned over his motor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Shiverin’ swordfish, kid,” he murmured with a chuckle, “all we do now is wait—wait so’s Crosley can get ’bout as far as Watson’s Channel. He’ll be gettin’ no further’n that—so he won’t.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Skippy shivered a little and leaned over the coaming to watch for logs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1707/50281.html","bookId":1149,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:31:31 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:31:31 AM"}
