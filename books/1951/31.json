Unfortunately, that wasn’t to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith’s call came in at close to one o’clock. Troy couldn’t disguise his pleasure in hearing from her. “Faith! This is a nice surprise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I apologize,” she said and hardly sounded like herself, “but I’m going to have to cancel our dinner date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy’s spirits did an automatic nosedive. “Oh?” He did his best to seem nonchalant, as though this was a minor disappointment. It wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone slashed my tires last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Troy gritted his teeth as anger surged through him. “Did you report it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What good will that do?” she cried. “I’ve reported the vandalism before and nothing seems to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy was too agitated to discuss this over the phone. “I’m on my way over to your place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Troy—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten minutes.” He hung up, grabbed his hat and coat and was out the door. Although this wasn’t technically an emergency, he turned on his lights but not the siren. He wished he could determine why Faith had been targeted—and how to stop it. But whatever it took, he was determined to put an end to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Faith opened the door, she looked pale and drawn, with dark shadows beneath her eyes. He wanted to pull her into his arms and comfort her but reminded himself that he was there as a professional, not as her friend—or would-be lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what happened,” he said in his most authoritative voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith led him to her living room and slumped down on the couch. “I was supposed to go to work this morning, but when I went out to the car, I saw that…that my tires were slashed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All four?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was no small expense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called the clinic and told them I couldn’t come in today. Then I contacted the auto service. They had to tow my car to the tire place…. I won’t have it back until tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Faith.” As the town’s sheriff, Troy felt responsible. “Did the neighbors see anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith shook her head. “I already asked. It must’ve happened after midnight, which is when the McCormicks next door went to bed. No one saw or heard a thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy closed his eyes in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was so upset, I phoned my daughter, and Jay Lynn insisted I spend the weekend with her. Frankly, Troy, I need to get away. I’m at the end of my rope. Someone doesn’t want me here and after today…after this morning, all I can say is I don’t want to be here, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t mean it,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do. I made a huge mistake the day I moved to Cedar Cove.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand tightened on his hat brim, crushing the felt. “It was exactly the opposite for me. It was one of the best days of my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Apparently you have a short memory,” she chided, then smiled weakly in his direction. “I was shocked when the Seattle house sold so quickly—but even more shocked when you said we shouldn’t see each other anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Troy could take back those words, if he could unsay them, he would. Breaking off the relationship with Faith had been one of the biggest blunders of his adult life, and he’d paid for it every day since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen,” Faith said, “I don’t mean to rehash old arguments. I’m tired and upset and a weekend away will do me good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy agreed, although he would’ve liked it a whole lot better if she’d decided to visit her son instead of Jay Lynn. Scott, at least, lived in town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there anything I can do?” Troy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed up at him, her bruised-looking eyes meeting his. “There’s nothing anyone can do. The best thing for me is to leave town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” he objected loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the weekend,” she amended. “What happens after that can wait. Now isn’t a good time for either of us to make a decision about…whether we have a future together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy disagreed with her. He wanted Faith with him. He wanted to marry her. But first he had to convince her that they did have a future together. A future in Cedar Cove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinc Wyse was not in favor of this idea of Mary Jo’s. If his sister wanted to move out of the house, fine; she was free to do so whenever she wished. That said, in his opinion the timing didn’t make any sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a young mother, Mary Jo needed to be home with her baby. It went without saying that she resented his attitude—but then that was par for the course. He knew that by today’s standards it was perfectly normal for a mother to return to work three months after giving birth. Their own mother had been a stay-at-home mom and he had strong feelings on the subject. Okay, maybe that wasn’t a popular stance and it certainly wasn’t one his sister shared. When he became a husband and father—he instantly dismissed that thought. Marriage wasn’t likely to happen for someone like him, not with his old-fashioned views. That saddened him but he might as well accept reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d found it more difficult than he would’ve believed to watch Mary Jo pack up and move across Puget Sound. Despite that, he rather liked Cedar Cove. He’d driven all around the area on Christmas Eve, searching for Mary Jo, and—for the most part—he’d had a good impression of it. His recent visits had confirmed that. It was a nice little town, welcoming and friendly. The only drawback was the distance. In the past week alone, he’d made four trips to the Kitsap Peninsula to see his sister and the baby. To check up on both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Mary Jo, not a single one of those trips had been necessary. But Linc wouldn’t sleep at night if he hadn’t personally seen to his sister’s and niece’s well-being. He’d always taken family responsibility seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only seemed right that he visit Noelle on her very first St. Patrick’s Day. Their family background—like that of so many Americans—was motley, with English, French and German that he knew of. He was sure there must be some Irish in there, too. Just in case, he’d bought her a plush leprechaun doll. But he had an even better excuse for this visit; he’d located a new sofa and chair in a closeout deal. He’d wanted to bring them himself, which saved delivery fees. The truth was, he looked forward to surprising his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo had him pegged as some sort of ogre and that just wasn’t true. He hoped this peace offering would help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he parked in front of the duplex, he saw Mack McAfee on a ladder, cleaning out the gutters. Linc hadn’t quite made up his mind about McAfee. Mack had been with Mary Jo during the most critical time of her life. Still, having him live right next door was a little too convenient. Linc wasn’t sure he approved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d made the mistake of voicing his concerns, and Mary Jo had nearly bitten his head off. He’d kept his trap shut ever since. Apparently, when it came to McAfee, his sister didn’t care for Linc’s advice. Fine. He’d keep his opinions to himself—and keep an eye on McAfee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Linc,” Mack called out. He climbed down from the ladder and thrust out his hand, which Linc willingly shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t suppose my sister’s home?” Linc already knew the answer. He asked because he wanted to know how closely the firefighter kept tabs on his little sister. This was one of those catch-22 situations. He wanted Mack to watch over her. At the same time, he wanted to be sure the guy wasn’t paying her more attention than warranted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a thin line, and Linc planned on being around often enough to see that Mack didn’t cross it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary Jo’s home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see you brought her some furniture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, at least he was observant, Linc thought a little sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think she’ll be pleased with the sofa,” Mack was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinc hoped so. Hard to tell with Mary Jo. Or with any woman, he realized. He simply didn’t understand women or know how to communicate with them. Over the years he’d had a number of relationships, all of which had come to an abrupt end. The way he figured it, the fault must lie with him. Mary Jo had often told him he was too domineering, too bullheaded and a chauvinist to boot. He’d honestly tried to change, tried to be more sensitive, but that hadn’t worked, either. As far as he could tell, he was destined to remain unmarried. Until Noelle, the fact that he’d never have kids hadn’t bothered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved his niece more than he ever could have foreseen. With Mary Jo and Noelle living in Cedar Cove, the house was strangely quiet and empty. Mel and Ned led busy lives; they were often out. They didn’t have the problems Linc did with women. They were both in relationships and he assumed they’d be married soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Linc wasn’t at the house, he was at work. He ran the car repair shop his father had opened nearly fifty years earlier. Because he was the oldest, he considered it his duty to hold the family business, as well as the family, together. Ever since their parents’ deaths, he’d done his utmost to manage the shop, keep the peace and make sure everyone was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s Mary Jo doing?” Linc asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you ask me directly?” she said. She stood in the doorway of her half of the duplex, arms crossed. “It’s not like I’m living in China, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.” For fear he might say or do something else to upset her, Linc shoved his hands into his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since you asked, I’m doing very well, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Noelle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinc cleared his throat and turned to Mack; the return stare told him he was on his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesturing to his truck, Linc said, “I brought you a housewarming gift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah…it seemed you could use more than one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Jo smiled. “That was nice of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinc felt the tension ease from his shoulders and the back of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed over the stuffed leprechaun, which was added to Noelle’s growing pile of toys. Then, with Mack’s assistance, he hauled the sofa and chair into Mary Jo’s living room. She indicated where she wanted them, then changed her mind not once but twice. He wasn’t annoyed, and neither was Mack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle had been asleep but woke shortly after Mary Jo was satisfied with the arrangement of the furniture. Sitting down on the new chair, Linc held his niece, who smelled deliciously of baby powder and shampoo, and kissed her forehead. She yawned and arched her back, raising her elbows as she did. Babies fascinated him. At first, when Mary Jo had brought Noelle home, he’d been terrified of hurting her—dropping her or squeezing too tight. Gradually he’d become more relaxed around the infant. It helped that she’d outgrown the colic. As it was now, he could hold this little one for hours and be content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to feed her?” Mary Jo asked Linc, after seeing Mack to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought…you know, breasts…” The words seemed to stumble all over themselves and he knew he was blushing furiously. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/92-pacific-boulevard-cedar-cove-9/page-31.html","bookId":1951,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM"}
