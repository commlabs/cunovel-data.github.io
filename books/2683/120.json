I think about calling Tamara, a society girl I had a fling with last time she was in the States, but instead debate the best way of putting a positive spin on the Jamie Fields situation if F. Fred Palakon ever calls. Thunderstorms start rumpling my hair and I dash into the Paul Smith store on Bond Street, where I purchase a smart-looking navy-gray raincoat. Everything But the Girl\u0027s \"Missing\" plays over everything, occasionally interrupted by feel-good house music, along with doses of Beck\u0027s \"Where It\u0027s At\" and so on and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m also being followed by a guy wearing wraparound black sunglasses who looks like he should be in a soap opera-handsome, with a too-chiseled chin and thick swept-up black hair-and resembles maybe a moddish Christian Bale, suspiciously blase in a long black Prada overcoat, seemingly up to no good and vaguely plasticine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegrets: I never should have turned down that Scotch ad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMental note: eyeliner on men seems fairly cool this season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Masako I\u0027m slumped in a velvet booth in back picking at sushi that tastes like ham, and the Christian Bale guy sits at a table for four up front in the deserted restaurant, grinning distantly, a camcorder sitting on an empty chair next to him, and doom music piped in through the stereo system fails to cheer anybody up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walk up to him holding a San Pellegrino bottle, he pays his check and takes a final sip of cold sake, smiling arrogantly at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want my autograph? Is that it?\" I\u0027m asking and then my voice gets babyish. \"Stop following me. Just leave me the f**k alone, okay?\" A pause, during which he gets up and I back away. \"Or else I\u0027ll pour this San Pellegrino all over your head-got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just answers silently with a so-what? expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as he glides confidently outside to where a boxy blue Jeep Commando waits at the curb in front of Masako, its windows tinted black, blocking out the face of the driver. Outside, I take note of various Tex-Mex restaurants, the postapocalyptic mood, my pseudoreality, then head back to the Four Seasons, where all I really want to do is take my shirt off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the Four Seasons obligatory paparazzi share cigarettes, glance idly at me as I stand there pretending to ruffle through my pockets for my room key while they wait for the occasional Town Car or limousine to roll up and dispense anyone snapworthy, which today does not include me. Inside: Ralph Fiennes is shaking hands with a twenty-year-old movie producer who I\u0027m sure someone I know has boned and Gabriel Byrne is simultaneously talking on a cell phone, being interviewed by People magazine and sipping a large cup of tea. In other words: it\u0027s all happening, it\u0027s all familiar. The only void: no message from Palakon, which doesn\u0027t relieve me in the way I imagined it would. I push the door to my suite open, turn on MTV-and with a ping, Everything But the Girl floats through the room, which right now is totally arctic. Shivering uncontrollably I push a bunch of Japanese fashion magazines scattered across the bed into a pile and then I\u0027m flopping down, pulling the covers over me, dialing the kitchen for a protein shake and to see what time the hotel\u0027s gym closes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement across the room causes me to whirl around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie Fields: legs slung over a floral-patterned swivel chair, wearing an ultrafashionable Prada camisole top, shimmery black disco pants, black stiletto shoes, black Armani sunglasses, and her face is masklike, but after my initial shock I\u0027m projecting something vaguely apologetic it and she confirms this by removing the sunglasses, stoplight-red onto Hard Candy polish on her nails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie notices how distracting they are. \"I know-it\u0027s ugly,\" she sighs, lighting a cigarette. \"It\u0027s for the movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one?\" I\u0027m asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs, exhaling. \"Both?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get in here?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m well acquainted with certain key staff members at the Four Seasons,\" she says casually. \"They know me. They let me do whatever I want. It\u0027s a perk. Let\u0027s leave it at that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause before asking, \"Are you going to start flailing around again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m sorry about all of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause. \"What happened back there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I just thought you were someone else,\" she mutters. \"Forget about it.
