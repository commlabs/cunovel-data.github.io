And he has reason to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel his head shift and now it\u0027s pressed against my back. \"I didn\u0027t fuck her. I know you believe I did, but I swear I didn\u0027t. I wasn\u0027t lying to you when I told you I hadn\u0027t been inside another woman since you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never known Jack Henry to lie to me. I think that\u0027s one reason the whole thing came as such a shock. That, and the fact that he knows how much I despise deceit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull away and flip over so I can see his face. \"You did something with her.\" And I know all the little naughty somethings he likes so much. \"And whatever it was happened a week after I left. Seven damn days. Do you want to know what I was doing on day seven? I wasn\u0027t out screwing around with some guy. I was in my apartment all alone, crying day and night because I was grieving the loss of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Laurelyn. You walked out on me without so much as a goodbye. Don\u0027t think for one second that I wasn\u0027t grieving the loss of us too. I thought I was never going to see you again and I was a total mess after you were gone. I stayed drunk the first week after. I was so fucking miserable and I just wanted to find a way to get over you. You said you thought Charlie might help you forget me. Well, I thought I needed number fourteen to make me forget you, so I picked that woman up in a hotel bar. She agreed to my conditions and I took her upstairs to the room I\u0027d rented. I planned on fucking her until you were out of my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t handle hearing this. It\u0027s too much. \"Stop. I don\u0027t want to hear this. It will end me if I have to picture you with another woman.\" I put my hands over my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs my wrists to pull them down. \"I had every intention of telling you about this woman, but the night you asked if there were others, I couldn\u0027t say the words. We had just found each other and I didn\u0027t want to ruin our reunion, so I planned on doing it later. But later never came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to know. I don\u0027t want to have the picture in my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will always come between us if I don\u0027t tell you everything. You\u0027ll always wonder what happened, so it\u0027s better to get it out of the way so it can\u0027t hurt us in the long run.\" He brings my hands to his mouth and kisses them. \"And I plan on it being a really long run—like, forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brace myself for the pain that\u0027s coming. It\u0027s like seeing a bat being swung at my face in slow motion. I know it\u0027s gonna hurt like hell and if it hits me hard enough, there\u0027s a good chance I might die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of never telling Laurelyn about the woman in the hotel—potential number fourteen—had crossed my mind. I seriously considered keeping that secret to myself but I always knew I couldn\u0027t deceive her that way. As time passed, the moment was never right—at least that\u0027s what I told myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admit it. That was my excuse and it got me by for a while, but now it\u0027s all come tumbling down on my head. Even in this moment, I want to back out because I\u0027m scared shitless, but I have no choice. What I\u0027m about to do could cost me the first and only woman I\u0027ve ever been in love with, but I don\u0027t think I could ever look straight at myself—or Laurelyn—if I don\u0027t tell her everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat and the sound echoes off every wall in our bedroom. It calls attention to how quiet it is and to the fact that I\u0027m about to tell her something that\u0027s going to cause her pain. \"I was so hammered that I could barely walk. All I could think about was you and how you left me without a goodbye. I understand why you did it, but it still hurt me terribly. I wanted the pain to go away, even if it was only for a few minutes. I thought fucking another woman would take away the pain I felt from losing you. But I was wrong; her touch made me sick. I couldn\u0027t even let her kiss me when she tried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to describe being with her from beginning to end. I\u0027d be envisioning the whole encounter in my head, so I\u0027m going to ask you the things I think are important for me to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s probably better than getting my play-by-play. \"Okay. I\u0027ll honestly answer any questions you have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she naked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, fuck! She wants details—in-depth ones. I hadn\u0027t planned on going into those kinds of specifics about my interaction with this woman. Now, I have no choice but to answer her because she has specifically asked. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezes her eyes shut for a moment before she opens them again. I think she\u0027s debating if she wants to keep going with this line of questioning, but she continues. \"Were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to admit being naked with another woman a week after Laurelyn left. Even if I didn\u0027t screw her, this doesn\u0027t look good for me. But it is what it is, and I\u0027m guilty, so now I get to pay the piper. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s biting her lip but not in a sexy way—it\u0027s from worry. \"Did you go down on her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe she thinks I\u0027d do that. \"Hell, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she go down on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not the way I planned on this conversation going. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you use your hand to make her come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s staring me right in the face doing that thing she does—invoking her human lie detector skills. \"No. I didn\u0027t touch her there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you did touch her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard. This isn\u0027t going to go over well. \"She put my hands on her tits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she touch your dick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! She\u0027s leaving no stone unturned. \"Yes,\" I whisper as I close my eyes. \"When she rolled the condom on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I open my eyes, I see the tears pooling in hers. I vowed to never be this person—the one to cause her tears—and I swear this is the last time it\u0027ll ever happen. I\u0027ll spend the rest of my life making her smile and laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single tear rolls down her cheek and I reach to wipe it away with my thumb, but she slaps my hand away. \"Did she make you come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head hard from side to side. \"No fucking way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say it like that? You said she put a condom on you. That means you got hard for her.\" Her eyes are narrowed at me. \"Just how close were you to being inside her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh heavily before answering. \"Close, but I couldn\u0027t do it. I had my eyes squeezed shut so I didn\u0027t have to look at her. All I could see was your face. I love you too much to ever be inside another woman. I swear I did not fuck her. Please believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My side of the bed wasn\u0027t even cold yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch her face as she studies mine, and I\u0027m terrified of what she\u0027s about to say. I decide it\u0027s time to plead for my life like I\u0027m standing in front of a firing line. \"We agreed we\u0027d never see each other again and you left without saying goodbye. I thought we were over forever. I would\u0027ve never gone looking for another woman if I\u0027d thought I had a chance in hell of having you back in my life. Please forgive me, L. I love you. You\u0027re the only woman I want. Ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuts her eyes and tears roll down her face. \"I believe you when you say you didn\u0027t have sex with that woman, but hearing the things you did with her is as painful as if you had. I can\u0027t imagine my heart hurting worse than it does right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns onto her side facing away from me, and I don\u0027t know where I stand. I have no idea what it means for her to believe me yet be so hurt by what I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to reach out to touch her, to comfort her. I\u0027m afraid she won\u0027t allow me, but I can\u0027t stop myself. I scoot closer and drape my arm over her waist. She struggles to get away but I pull her to me tightly. \"You\u0027re angry and I will take any punishment you see fit to give me because I fucked up big time, but I love you and this isn\u0027t going to end us. We\u0027re bigger than this stupid mistake of mine and we\u0027re going to push through and come out bigger and better on the other side because of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops resisting and relaxes, so I hold her in my arms. I can feel the shuddering of her body as she cries and I\u0027m terrified. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do if she calls off the wedding. It\u0027s a very real possibility. I reach for her left hand to see if she\u0027s wearing her ring, and I\u0027m relieved to feel it there. I bring it to my mouth and press it firmly against my lips. \"Please tell me you still want to be my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now isn\u0027t the time to ask me that question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck! This could be it for us. She may not be able to move past my stupid mistake. \"No, L. Please don\u0027t end us. I\u0027ll do whatever it takes to turn this around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I need time to think.\" She pushes my hand away as she sits up on the edge of the bed, her back to me. \"I want to go to Addison\u0027s for a few days so I can sort through this without looking at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want her at Addison\u0027s, not with that little bastard who wanted in her pants living right across the hall. \"Baby, please don\u0027t go there. Let me take you to Avalon and I\u0027ll stay in the guest house. You and Addison can have the house and I won\u0027t come back until you tell me I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll talk to Addison and let you know what I decide.\" She gets up from the bed and goes into the bathroom. There\u0027s a loud thud when she shuts the door and it\u0027s a reminder that she is closing herself off from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mobile rings. My mum. I\u0027m certain she\u0027s calling to check on Laurelyn after her incident in the restaurant, so I can\u0027t avoid her call. \"Hello, Mum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how\u0027s our girl feeling this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m glad she doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s going on between us. She would beat the shit out of me if she got wind of it. \"She\u0027s feeling much better and is taking a shower right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so grateful to hear that. She had me worried. I\u0027ve never seen anyone go so pale. Any idea what caused that to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has migraines and one came on after we left the restaurant. She got sick once we were home, so I think it could be associated with that.\" It\u0027s not a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds like a very probable explanation. We have plans to do wedding shopping today and Chloe wants to prepare some of the wedding food for her to sample this evening. Did she mention if she felt well enough to do that?\" I highly doubt it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-44.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
