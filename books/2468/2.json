{"id":82054,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eDETECTIVE-Sergeant Michael Celluci closed the heavy metal door quietly behind him and stepped cau?tiously into the shadowed apartment. A dim fan of light that spilled out from the office under the loft was swallowed up by the sixteen-foot ceiling in the main room. The building had been a glass factory before a recession had emptied it and urban renewal had filled it again with barely serviceable living space for the fashionable fringe of Toronto. The majority of the ten?ants dressed exclusively in black and most were in?volved in some way with \"the arts\"-although some of those ways were pretty peripheral in Michael Celluci\u0027s not at all humble opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis soft-soled shoes making no sound on the rug that defined a right-of-way along one wall, he moved toward the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what about the guy you can see? What\u0027s he, the union representative?\" The silence defined the re?sponse. \"I\u0027m sorry. I am taking this seriously. No, I am. Ask it innocuous questions until I get there.\" The old wooden office chair creaked alarmingly as it was tipped back on two legs. \"Ask it things you know it\u0027ll have to answer yes to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust under the edge of the loft, an arm\u0027s length from the chair, Celluci stretched out a hand to grab a sweatshirt-clad shoulder. Just before his fingers closed on fabric, they were captured in an unbreakable grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman holding him flashed him a disdainful nice try and kept talking into the phone. \"Look, how hard can it be? Did you used to be a man? Are you dead now? Were you once alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere you alive? Celluci mouthed as she pulled him around the edge of her chair and pushed him down onto a corner of the cluttered desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrows lowered, she acknowledged he\u0027d heard cor?rectly with a single nod, then tried to reassure her caller. \"It doesn\u0027t matter that they\u0027re stupid questions as long as it answers yes. I\u0027ll be there as soon as I can. I\u0027ll... \" Sighing, she settled back with an expres?sion Celluci recognized-the first time he\u0027d seen it, they\u0027d both been in uniform, and it had been aimed at him. There could be only one explanation for it now; the person on the other end of the line was actu?ally daring to give Vicki Nelson advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never taken advice well. Not when she\u0027d been in uniform and considered herself God\u0027s gift to the Metropolitan Toronto Police. Not when she\u0027d made detective. Not when retinitis pigmentosa had forced her to quit a job she\u0027d both loved and excelled at. Not during the time she\u0027d been a private investigator. And not since the change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I didn\u0027t know, he thought, watching her features shift from impatience to irritation, I\u0027d never realize what she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked much the same, only a little thinner and a lot paler. She acted much the same, having always been overbearing, arrogant, and opinionated. All right, so she didn\u0027t used to drink blood....\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"That\u0027s enough!\" Irritation had become annoyance and, from her tone, she\u0027d cut off a continuing mono?logue. \"I\u0027ll be there as soon as I can, and if you\u0027re not home when I arrive, I\u0027m heading straight back to Toronto.\" Hanging up as the last \"oh\" left her mouth, she turned her attention to Celluci and said, \"Henry has a ghost and would like me to get rid of it for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold fingers touched the back of Celluci\u0027s neck. \"Henry Fitzroy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t he still in Vancouver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilver-gray eyes narrowed as she gazed up at him. \"He is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ve just agreed to travel clear across the country to take care of his ...\" In spite of everything they\u0027d been through-in spite of demons, werewolves, mummies, and the reanimation of the dead, in spite of vampires-his lip curled. \"... ghost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And since you\u0027ve presented it to me as a fait ac?compli, can I assume anything I have to say be?comes irrelevant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows drew in slightly. \"This ghost is scaring people to death, Mike, and it\u0027s going to keep doing it until someone finds out why and stops it. Henry isn\u0027t trained for that kind of an investigation.\" When he opened his mouth, she lifted a hand in warning. \"And don\u0027t you dare say I\u0027m not either. I\u0027ll be stopping a killer. It doesn\u0027t matter that he\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. It wouldn\u0027t. But the ghost had little or nothing to do with his reaction. He leaped to his feet and pushed past her, out of the office and into the main room where he\u0027d have floor enough to pace. \"Do you know how far it is to Vancouver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About 4,500 kilometers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stomped to the door and back again. \"Do you realize how short the night is at this time of the year?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Less than nine hours.\" Her voice added a clear indication that she wasn\u0027t pleased about it either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And do you remember what happens when you\u0027re caught out in the sun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I barbecue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands spread, he rocked to a stop in front of her. \"So you\u0027re going to go 4,500 kilometers, in less than nine-hour shifts, with no sanctuary from the sun? Do you have any idea how insanely dangerous that is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been thinking about buying a used van and making a few minor modifications.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few minor modifications,\" he repeated incredu?lously, trying to bury fear with anger. \"You\u0027ll be a sitting duck all day, no matter where you park-a charcoal briquette just waiting to happen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with you? As a favor to Henry-fucking-Fitzroy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got slowly to her feet and glared up at him through narrowed eyes. \"Is that what this is really about? Henry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" And it wasn\u0027t; not entirely. \"This is about you putting yourself in unnecessary danger. Don\u0027t they have PI\u0027s in British Columbia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not ones who can deal with something like this and no one Henry trusts.\" She smiled, a little self-mockingly, then spread one hand against his chest and added, her words slowed to the rhythm of his heart?beat, \"I don\u0027t want to become a charcoal briquette. I could use your help, Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth snapped shut around the remainder of the diatribe. The old Vicki Nelson had never been able to ask for help. When Henry Fitzroy had given her his blood, he\u0027d changed her in more than just the obvious ways. Celluci hated the undead, romance-writing, royal bastard for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me think about it,\" he muttered. \"I\u0027m going to make coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki listened to him stomp into the tiny kitchen and begin opening and closing cupboard doors with more force than was strictly necessary. She drew in a deep breath, savoring the scent of him. He\u0027d always smelled terrific; a kind of heated, male smell that used to make her incredibly horny whenever she got a whiff of it. Okay, it still made her horny, she corrected with a grin. But now it also made her hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you ever throw your garbage out,\" he snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I? I don\u0027t create any of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t needed to raise his voice. She could\u0027ve heard him if he\u0027d whispered. She could hear his blood pulse through his veins. Sometimes she thought she could hear his thoughts. Although he might be hon?estly concerned about the dangers of travel, where it came right down to it, he didn\u0027t want to go to Vancou?ver with her because he didn\u0027t want to do Henry Fitz?roy any favors. Neither did he want her to go to Vancouver, and thus to Henry Fitzroy, without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinishing off the bit of bookkeeping she\u0027d been doing when Henry\u0027d called, Vicki saved the file and waited for Mike to make up his mind, wondering if he realized she had no intention of going without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Henry was being haunted by a ghost who played twenty questions with deadly results didn\u0027t sur?prise her. Nothing much surprised her anymore. There are more things in heaven and earth...\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She\u0027d had it printed on her business cards. Mr. Shakespeare had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Henry had called, wanting to hire her to solve his little mystery, had surprised her. He\u0027d been so definite when they\u0027d parted that they\u0027d never see each other again, that they couldn\u0027t see each other again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though he\u0027d been reading her thoughts, Celluci chose that moment to come back into the office and growl, \"I thought vampires were unable to share a territory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki\u0027s chin rose. \"I refuse to be controlled by my nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci snorted. \"Yeah. Right.\" He took a swallow of steaming coffee. \"Tell that to the vampire who used to live here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was willing to negotiate,\" Vicki protested, but she felt her lip curling up off her teeth. The other vampire had taunted her with the death of a friend and claimed downtown Toronto. When Vicki had fi?nally killed her, she\u0027d felt no regret, no guilt, and no need to tell Detective-Sergeant Michael Celluci the full details of what had happened. Not only because of what he was-not only because he was human- but because of who he was. He wouldn\u0027t have under?stood, and she didn\u0027t think she could stand it if he looked at her the way he\u0027d sometimes looked at Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she\u0027d told him only that she\u0027d won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she changed her incipient snarl into something closer to a smile. \"Henry and I will manage to get along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci hid his own smile behind the coffee mug. He recognized the tone and wondered if Henry had any idea of how little choice he was about to have in the matter. He didn\u0027t want Vicki going to Vancouver, but since she\u0027d already made up her mind, he couldn\u0027t stop her-nor was he suicidal enough to try. Since she was going, regardless, he didn\u0027t want her going alone. Besides, he\u0027d enjoy watching his bloodsucking, royal bastardness get run over by Vicki\u0027s absolute refusal to do what was expected of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. You win. I\u0027m going with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... things are slow right now, and I\u0027ve got the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspector Cantree snorted. \"You\u0027ve always got the time, Detective. I\u0027m just amazed you actually want to use some of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci shrugged. \"Something came up with a friend of Vicki\u0027s out west.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend of Vicki\u0027s. Ah.\" The inspector stared into the oily scum on top of his coffee, the heavy stoneware mug looking almost delicate in his huge hand. \"And how is \u0027Victory\u0027 Nelson these days? I hear she\u0027s been dealing with some strange cases since she got back in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci shrugged again. \"Someone has to. At least if they\u0027re calling her, they\u0027re not calling us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\" Cantree\u0027s eyes narrowed, and the look he shot at the other man was frankly speculative. \"She never struck me as the type to get involved in this paranormal, occult bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci only just stopped himself from shrugging a third time. \"Most of her work\u0027s the same old boring crap. Cheating spouses. Insurance fraud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most,\" Cantree repeated. It wasn\u0027t quite a ques?tion, so Celluci didn\u0027t answer it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspector Cantree had narrowly escaped becoming the enchanted acolyte of an ancient Egyptian god. The others who\u0027d been caught up in the spell had created their own explanations, but he\u0027d insisted on hearing the truth. As he\u0027d never mentioned it again, Celluci remained unsure of how much he\u0027d believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory hung in the air between them for a moment, then Cantree brushed it aside, the gesture stating as clearly as if he\u0027d said it aloud: Forty-seven homicides so far this year; I\u0027ve enough to deal with. \"Take your vacation, Detective, but I want your butt back here in two weeks ready to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki, we will never make it to Vancouver in that.\u0027\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it doesn\u0027t look like much... \" Hands on her hips, Vicki swept her gaze over the grimy blue van and decided not to mention that it\u0027d probably look worse in daylight. It looked bad enough under the security light in Celluci\u0027s driveway. \"... but it\u0027s mechanically sound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since when do you know anything about mechani?cally sound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t.\" She turned and grinned at him, meeting his eyes and allowing power to rise momentarily in hers. \"But nobody lies to me anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it had been used for deliveries, the van box had no windows to cover. Vicki\u0027d had a partition with wide rubber gaskets installed behind the seats and an?other just inside the rear doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it done fast enough, didn\u0027t you?\" Celluci brushed at a dusting of sawdust at the base of the front barrier and frowned at the inner bolts that en?sured there\u0027d be no unwelcome visitors. \"What hap?pens if there\u0027s an accident and I have to get you out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait until sunset and I\u0027ll get myself out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no ventilation, and it\u0027s likely to get hotter than hell in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I doubt I\u0027ll notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You doubt?\" His voice started to rise, and he forced it back down, the dark windows in the sur?rounding houses reminding him that the neighbors were still asleep and very likely wanted to remain that way. \"You\u0027re not sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure that I won\u0027t feel it. Other than that... \" There were a number of things about being a vampire she was having to discover as the situation came up. Henry had taught her how to feed without causing harm, how to gently change the memories of those who provided nourishment, and how to blend with the mortals who walked the day, but he\u0027d never taught her that swimming was out of the question because increased bone density caused her to sink like a rock-scaring the shit out of the lifeguard at the \"Y.\" Nor had he mentioned what traveling all day in the back of an enclosed van might do. \"The SPCV sug?gests leaving a rear window rolled down a bit and parking out of the sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci stared at her in confusion. \"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The society for the prevention of cruelty to vam?pires. It was a joke.\" She patted his arm. \"Never mind. What do you think of the bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peered past her shoulder. The bed had padded sides ten inches high. \"It looks like a coffin without a lid. I\u0027m not using it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suit yourself, but remember who\u0027s driving nights while you\u0027re sleeping.\" She mimed steering around a corner and did a fairly good impersonation of tires squealing against the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Vicki\u0027s driving style hovered between kamikaze and Montreal cabbie, Celluci shuddered and checked his watch. Unfortunately, if they planned on leaving before daybreak, they didn\u0027t have time to fight about either the bed or Vicki\u0027s driving-and if he couldn\u0027t do anything about the latter, he certainly wasn\u0027t going to insist on removing the padding from the former. \"Let\u0027s get going, then. It\u0027s four-twelve and sunrise is in less than forty-five minutes.\" When Vicki lifted both brows, he pulled a battered paperback out of his back pocket. \"Farmer\u0027s Almanac. It\u0027s got sunrise and sunset for the whole year. I decided it might be best to be prepared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" Vicki drew herself up to her full five-feet ten, her expression dangerous and purely human. This argument, or variations on the theme, long pre?dated the change. \"What\u0027s the matter, Mike? You still think I can\u0027t take care of myself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not between sunrise and sunset,\" he reminded her mildly, refusing to be drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki deflated. Unfortunately, he was completely and absolutely and inarguably correct. She hated that-not so much that he was right, but that it left her no room for argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he knew it. Eyes crinkling at the corners, he shoved the book back into his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping forward, she brushed the overlong curl of dark brown hair back off his forehead and murmured, \"Come evening, however, no one messes with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying in the coffinlike bed, vibrating along with the van\u0027s six-cylinder, no-longer-entirely-to-company-specs engine, enclosed in a warm darkness so deep it draped over her like black velvet, Vicki could feel the sun. The flesh between her shoulders crawled. Two years a vampire and she still hadn\u0027t gotten used to the ap?proach of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like that final instant, just before someone hits you from behind, when you know it\u0027s going to happen and you can\u0027t do a damned thing about it. Only it lasts longer. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci hadn\u0027t been impressed by the analogy, and she supposed she couldn\u0027t blame him-it didn\u0027t im?press her much either. While he\u0027d pulled the van up under the security light and methodically checked for pinholes that might let in the sun, she\u0027d almost gone crazy with the need to get under cover. He hadn\u0027t listened when she\u0027d told him she\u0027d already checked, but then, he\u0027d always believed she took foolish risks. Risks, she took. Foolish risks, never. Okay, hardly ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWondering why she was suddenly doing numbers from HMS Pinafore, she licked her lips and tasted the memory of Celluci\u0027s mouth against hers. He\u0027d wanted to wait for sunrise before he started driving, but Vicki\u0027d insisted he start right after she closed herself up in her moving sanctuary. She didn\u0027t think she could cope with both of them waiting for...\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that hour of the morning, traffic was heading into Toronto, not out of it and, for all its disreputable appearance, the van handled well. Fully aware he would not be able to explain the apparent corpse in the back should he be stopped by the OPP, Celluci drove a careful five kilometers over the limit and re?signed himself to being passed by nearly every other car on the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get your picture taken,\" he muttered as an old and rusty K-car buzzed by him. Unfortunately, the new Ontario government had recently pulled the photo radar vans, insisting they\u0027d shown no positive effects. Celluci had no idea where the idiots at Queen\u0027s Park had gathered their information, but in his personal experience, the threat of the vans had kept paranoid drivers actually traveling at slightly less than the limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped at Barrie for breakfast and a chance to stretch his legs. A tractor trailer accident held him for an hour just outside Waubaushene and by the time he stopped for lunch at the Centennial Diner in Bigwood, he\u0027d heard Sonny and Cher sing \"I Got You Babe\" on three different oldies stations and was wondering why he was putting himself through rock-and-roll hell for Henry-fucking-Fitzroy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should\u0027ve tried harder to talk her out of it.\" He yanked a tasseled toothpick out of his club sandwich. So what if there were no PI\u0027s on the West Coast Fitzroy could trust. \"How\u0027s he supposed to make new friends if he never talks to strangers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is anything wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci manufactured a smile and tossed it up to his teenage waitress. \"No. Nothing\u0027s wrong.\" Watching her watch him on her way back to the kitchen, he sighed. Great. Not only does he expect Vicki to risk her life traveling across three quarters of the country, but now he\u0027s got me talking to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flyspecked radio above the pie rack, Sonny Bono once again declared his love in the face of every?thing they said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"WaWa?\" Knuckles on her hips, Vicki rolled the kinks out of her shoulders. \"Why WaWa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci shrugged, eyes appreciatively following her movements. \"Why not WaWa? I thought you might want to see the goose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The goose?\" Slowly, she turned and peered up at the nine-meter-high steel sculpture silhouetted against a gray sky streaked with orange. \"Okay. I\u0027ve seen it. I hope we\u0027re not sharing the high point of your day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close,\" he admitted. \"How\u0027re you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like my body spent the day bouncing around in?side a padded box. Other than that, fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you, uh... \" He broke off in embarrassment as a car pulled into the small parking lot and a pair of children exploded out of the back and raced up the path toward the bathrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hungry?\" Stepping into the circle of his body heat, she grinned. \"Mike, you can say hungry in front of kids-they\u0027ll assume I\u0027ll be having a Big Mac, not Ronald MacDonald.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s disgusting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, it\u0027s given me an appetite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her upper arms, halting her advance. \"Forget it, Vicki, I\u0027m too old for a quickie in the back of a van.\" But his protest had little force, and after the kids and the car disappeared, he allowed himself to be convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later, as they climbed up into the front seats, Vicki reached out and caught a mosquito about to land on his back. \"Forget it, sister,\" she mut?tered, squashing the bug between thumb and forefin?ger. \"He gave at the office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re just past Portage la Prairie?\" Celluci looked up from the map of Manitoba with a scowl. He hadn\u0027t slept well, and the thermos of coffee Vicki\u0027d handed him when he\u0027d staggered out of the van could peel the residue off a garbage truck. He drank it anyway- after fifteen years drinking police coffee, he could drink anything-but he wasn\u0027t happy. The last thing he needed to be told was that they\u0027d gone consider?ably past the point where he\u0027d expected to take over. . \"You must\u0027ve been doing between a hundred and twenty-five and a hundred and thirty kilometers an hour!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s start with the speed limit being a hundred kilometers an hour and take it from there. It\u0027s not just a good idea,\" he added sarcastically, fighting to refold the map. \"It\u0027s the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki clamped her teeth down on a complaint that a hundred K to someone with her reaction time was ridiculously slow, and merely shrugged. Her opinions didn\u0027t make the speed limit any less the law. If he\u0027d suggested she\u0027d been driving unsafely, then she could\u0027ve given him an argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning back against the van, she stared out at the farmland surrounding the gas station parking lot. With the station closed and the only illumination coming from the stars and Celluci\u0027s flashlight, it seemed as though they were the last people alive in the world. She hated that feeling and she\u0027d felt it for most of the night as she\u0027d sped away from Lake Superior toward Kenora and the Ontario/Manitoba border. At 3 A.M. even Winnipeg was a little short of people up and about-except for a sleepy clerk at the 24-hour gas station/donut shop where she\u0027d filled the van and two transients spotted sleeping in the shelter of an over?pass. She\u0027d cut through the middle of Portage la Prai?rie rather than take the Trans-Canada Highway loop around, but it was still too early for anyone to be up and about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsed to living, and hunting, among three million people, at least one million of whom never seemed to sleep, the isolation made her feel vulnerable and exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me that.\" She reached down and snatched the partially folded map out of Mike\u0027s hands. \"All you have to do is follow the original creases. Why is that so difficult?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVulnerable, exposed, and in a really bad mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeeting Celluci\u0027s astonished glower with a half-apologetic wave of the map, she growled, \"All this scenery is beginning to get to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecognizing that on a perfectly straight, completely flat stretch of road no one was going to drive at one hundred kilometers an hour, the speed limit through Saskatchewan was one hundred and ten. Almost ev?eryone did one twenty. Considering his cargo, Celluci compromised at one fifteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lifetime\u0027s worth of wheat fields later, at 7:17 P.M. local time, he pulled into a truck stop just outside Bassano, Alberta, and turned off the engine wonder?ing if there was a Sonny and Cher revival going on he hadn\u0027t heard about. If he had to listen to \"I Got You, Babe\" one more time, he was going to have to hurt someone. Parking the van so that Vicki could exit without being seen, he walked stiffly across the asphalt to the restaurant. Sunset would be at 8:30, so he had little better than an hour to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoup of the day was beef barley. He stared down into the bowl and remembered all the meals he and Vicki had eaten together, all the gallons of coffee, all the stale sandwiches grabbed on the run. All at once, the thought that they\u0027d never again go out for dim sum, or chicken paprikas, or even order in a pizza while they watched Hockey Night in Canada left him feeling incredibly depressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there something wrong with the soup?\" A middle-aged woman in a spotless white apron peered down at him with some concern from behind the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The, uh, the soup\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to hear it. It don\u0027t come out of a can, you know. I make it myself.\" When he couldn\u0027t find an immediate response, she shook her head and sighed. \"Come on, buddy, cheer up. You look like you\u0027ve lost your best friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci frowned. He hadn\u0027t exactly lost her. Vicki remained everything to him she ever had been, except a dinner companion and weighed against the rest that shouldn\u0027t mean much. But, right now, it did. I thought I\u0027d dealt with this....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barely noticed when the waitress took the empty bowl away and replaced it with a platter of steak and home fries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampire, Nightwalker, Nosferatu-Vicki was no longer human. Granted, she\u0027d made a commitment to him in a way she\u0027d never been able to before the change, but, given immortality, how important could the few years of his life be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rhubarb pie tasted like sawdust and he left half of it on the plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoulders hunched and hands shoved into his jacket pockets, he headed back across the parking lot toward the van. Vaguely aware he was wallowing in self-pity, he couldn\u0027t seem to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the van\u0027s engine roared into life, it took him completely by surprise. Standing three feet from the front bumper, Celluci stared through a fine film of bug bodies smeared over the windshield and into the smug face of a young man in his late teens or early twenties. He didn\u0027t realize what was happening until the young man backed the van away from him, cranked the steering wheel around, and laid rubber all the way out to the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van was being stolen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinct sent him racing after it, but halfway across the parking lot, the fact he didn\u0027t have a chance of catching up penetrated and he rocked to a halt. He checked his watch. 8:27.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki would be awake in three minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d know immediately that something was wrong, that he wasn\u0027t driving. She\u0027d pull open the partition behind the seats .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... and their young car thief was about to be in for one hell of a surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching the grimy back end of the stolen van dis?appear into the sunset down a secondary road, Celluci started to laugh. His only regret was that he wouldn\u0027t be there to see that punk\u0027s face when Vicki woke up. He was still laughing when the waitress met him at the door of the restaurant, a worried frown creasing the smooth curves of her face. \"Wasn\u0027t that your van?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was.\" He grinned down at her, feeling better than he had in hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to use our phone to call the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you. But I would like another piece of that delicious rhubarb pie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompletely confused, she followed him across the restaurant and watched wide-eyed as he dropped onto a counter stool. She shook her head as he looked at his watch and snickered. He\u0027d seemed like such a nice man and although she was glad to see that whatever had been bothering him obviously wasn\u0027t bothering him any longer, she couldn\u0027t understand his attitude. \"But what about your van?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corners of Celluci\u0027s mouth curved up as he reached for a fork. \"It\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki lay in the darkness and sifted through sounds and scents and sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van was still moving. Celluci had insisted, for safety\u0027s sake, they be parked at least half an hour before sunrise and sunset. Somehow, considering the completely unnecessary fuss he\u0027d made over it, Vicki doubted he\u0027d changed his mind. Either he\u0027d lost his little book, he\u0027d been unable to get off the highway, or he wasn\u0027t the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of the engine-gas and oil and heated metal-laid over the lingering scent of Celluci clinging to the padding of the bed made an enhanced sense of smell next to useless. The three little pigs could be driving, and she wouldn\u0027t be able to sniff them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKneeling next to the plywood barrier, she filtered out the sounds of internal combustion and heard a stranger\u0027s heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe growled low in her throat. Resisting the urge to crash through the barrier and rip the stranger\u0027s heart out, Vicki silently pulled back the bolts. Anger wouldn\u0027t get her the answers she needed. Anger wouldn\u0027t discover what happened to Mike Celluci. First, I get some answers ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the young man behind the wheel, it seemed as though one moment the passenger seat was empty and the next there was a woman sitting in it, smiling at him. Her smile was terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pull over,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore frightened than he\u0027d ever been in his life, he braked and swerved onto the shoulder. By the time he fought the van to a standstill, his heart was pound?ing so violently, he could barely breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut off the engine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whimpered as he turned the key. He didn\u0027t know why, but he couldn\u0027t prevent the sound from escaping. When cool fingers grasped his chin and forced his head around, he whimpered again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the man who was driving this vehicle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were impossibly silver in the twilight. He didn\u0027t know what the rest of her looked like because all he could see were her eyes. \"He\u0027s, he\u0027s at Ruby\u0027s Steak House. Maybe five miles b-b-back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he been hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough not an imaginative young man, he had a sudden flash of what was likely to happen should he answer in the affirmative. His stomach spasmed, and his throat worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you puke,\" she told him, \"you\u0027ll eat it. Now answer my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was f-f-fine. Really.\" When she seemed to be waiting for more, he added, \"I looked b-b-back and he was laughing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laughing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Vicki released the young man\u0027s jaw. Why would Celluci be laughing? She\u0027d never suspected that he considered grand theft auto to be amusing. Okay, he stopped for supper and someone stole the van. Why would he think that was funny? Then she looked up at the streaks of gold and rose lingering on the hori?zon. All of a sudden, she got the joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Ruby\u0027s Steak House was only five miles back, this poor sucker had driven off with a sleeping vampire moments before sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she noticed him fumbling with the door latch, she grabbed his arm. \"Not so fast,\" she murmured, the threat softened but still there. \"What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"K-Kyle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was really quite attractive in an unshaven, out?law sort of way. Slender but with nice muscles. Pretty blue eyes. Her gaze locked on the pulse in his throat. \"How old are you, Kyle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"T-twenty-two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld enough. She let the Hunger rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle saw her smile change. Almost understood it. Her face was very pale. Her teeth, very white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I think young Kyle\u0027s decided to give up stealing cars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" Celluci grinned at her profile, just barely vis?ible in the pale green glow from the dashboard lights. \"What makes you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think he came to the decision when I pointed out how lucky he\u0027d been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. When he took this van, all he got was me.\" Vicki turned to face her companion, allowing the van to speed down the highway momentarily unguided. Her eyes gleamed, and her voice made promises for later. \"I merely reminded him that another time, he might drive off with something...\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunrise the next morning was at 4:56, Pacific Time. At 4:30, Vicki pulled over onto a deserted scenic view and stopped the van. Driving west through the Rock?ies, she\u0027d gained an hour of night. Since they\u0027d left home, she\u0027d gained three, but this would be the last, they\u0027d crossed into British Columbia during the night and would reach Vancouver before evening. From now on, sunrise and sunset would occur in the same time zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting around in the driver\u0027s seat, she stared into the shadows of her sanctuary. Celluci refused to sleep with the front partition up and she supposed she couldn\u0027t blame him although the song of his blood behind her was a constant distraction. Considering the demands of the road as it passed through two national parks and crossed most of a mountain range, it was fortunate that, having fed deeply from young Kyle, she\u0027d been able to keep most of her attention on her driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleep smoothed out the lines and shadows layered onto his face by fifteen years of police work and he looked much younger than his thirty-eight years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a scattering of gray hair at his right temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many years were they going to have? Fifty? Forty? And what was she going to do for the rest of eternity without him? Facing immortality, she found herself mourning his inevitable death while he contin?ued to live. Henry had warned her about falling into that kind of fatalistic despair, but it was a hard warning to remember while listening to a mortal heartbeat pounding out its few remaining years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, for God\u0027s sake, Vicki, get a grip! Leaning for?ward, she grabbed Celluci\u0027s shoulder and shook him hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wha...\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sunrise in twenty minutes, Mike. I\u0027ll leave you alone to put your face on.\" Getting out of the van, she walked over to the railing and stared up at the Rockies. Rising in majestic silhouettes against the gray, predawn sky, they looked so definitively like mountains they almost looked fake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow this is immortality, Vicki acknowledged. Next to these hunks of rock, I\u0027m just going to live a little longer than average. She heard Mike walk around from the other side of the van and said, \"I left a message on Henry\u0027s machine when I stopped for gas. He knows we\u0027ll get to his place today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Will he still be there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes narrowed, she pivoted on one heel. \"Why wouldn\u0027t he be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t know. Perhaps he\u0027s willing to recognize his limitations.\" Three nights on the road, had left Celluci tired and stiff and not all the glories of a spring dawn in the midst of some of the most beautiful sce?nery in the world were going to make an impression until he had a piss and a coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you so sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him not to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould\u0027ve seen that coming, he muttered silently, following Vicki to the van. He caught her wrist as she lifted her hand to rub the back of her neck. \"Did it ever occur to you that Henry Fitzroy knows better than you do what it means to be a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned within his grip although they both knew she could have easily broken it. \"Maybe he does, but Henry Fitzroy doesn\u0027t know what it means to be me, and I\u0027m not buying into\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;his territorial imperative crap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he could see the doubt in her eyes, he let it go. They\u0027d find out soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he heard the bolts shoot back and the front barrier move, Celluci threw the last of his burger to a gull patrolling the strip mall parking lot and rolled up the window. He couldn\u0027t see anyone in earshot, but the last thing they needed was an eavesdropper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver of her eyes flecked with lingering gold from the setting sun, Vicki\u0027s gaze swept past him. \"Where are we?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cariboo Street, east end of the city. I thought you\u0027d like to be awake when we arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki stared out the front window, across Vancou?ver, toward the ocean, toward Henry Fitzroy. Then she looked at Mike Celluci, really looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the strangest sensation that no one had ever seen him so clearly, and he could feel himself begin?ning to sweat. Just when he thought he couldn\u0027t stand another minute of it, she smiled, reached out, and brushed the long curl of hair off his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. That\u0027s pretty perceptive for a guy who tapes Baywatch.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-debt-vicki-nelson-5/page-2.html","bookId":2468,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:50 PM"}
