I drifted above the city of New Orleans, lulled by its lights and its voices. I wondered how Mona would handle this power, if she\u0027d be weeping again. I let myself believe there were no ghosts who could touch me up here or anywhere if I used all my considerable powers, no ghosts who could make me afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said No to hunger. I said to thirst Be still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped down silently into the realm of my fellow creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught sight of Quinn in the Rue Royale, pulling behind him a pile of suitcases, all dependent upon one huge rectangular bag equipped with excellent little wheels. He was whistling a melody by Chopin and walking very briskly, and I fell into stride beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the most dashing man on the street, Little Brother,\" I said. \"What\u0027s with all the suitcases?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to let us stay at the flat, Beloved Boss?\" he asked. His eyes were fired with love. In our short acquaintance, I\u0027d never seen him so happy. In fact, I\u0027d never seen him happy before at all. \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"Do we crowd you? Do you want us out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all, I want you there,\" I replied. \"I should have told you.\" We walked along together, me trying to keep up with his long legs. \"I\u0027m the worst of hosts and Coven Masters, to use the old lingo. Not a gentleman. A thoroughgoing Rasputin. Settle in. You had Clem bring clothes to the Ritz? (Yes.) Clever. Where\u0027s Princess Mona right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the bedroom, working on the computer we bought at sunset, first thing she had to have,\" he said with an airy gesture. \"She\u0027s recording every experience, every sensation, every subtle distinction, every revelation-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get it,\" I said. \"Hmmm. You\u0027ve both fed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Greedily, among despicable wretches, though I had to oversee the operation somewhat. She falls into states of utter paralysis. Perhaps if I wasn\u0027t there she wouldn\u0027t. Physically she\u0027s stronger than I am. I think it confuses her. It was a couple bums back of town, both drunk, nothing to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was her first human victim,\" I said. \"Particulars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The men were unconscious, it was a cinch for her. She\u0027s yet to confront the living breathing struggling type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, that can wait. As regards her being stronger than you, you know I can level the playing ground,\" I said quietly. \"I don\u0027t share the gift of my blood with many. But I\u0027ll share it again with you.\" Was there anything in the world I wouldn\u0027t have done for Quinn?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that,\" he answered. \"God, I love her. I love her so much it\u0027s overtaken everything else in my mind. I don\u0027t even think about Goblin being gone. I thought when Goblin was actually gone I\u0027d suffer some crippling emptiness. I was sure of it. It seemed bound to happen. But Mona\u0027s the partner of my soul, Lestat, just the way I used to dream it would be when we first met, when we were both kids, before the Blood ever came between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the way it\u0027s supposed to work, Quinn,\" I said. \"And Blackwood Farm? Have you any news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was fun walking along the street again. Feet on the summer pavements with the heat of the sun still rising from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" said Quinn. \"Tommy\u0027s staying the week. I\u0027ll be able to see him before he goes back to England. I wish he didn\u0027t have to go to school in England. Of course, they\u0027re making calls to anyone or everyone connected to Patsy. It\u0027s the damned medicine. I should have gathered up her medicine and thrown it in the swamp with her. Then they would have assumed that she\u0027d run away. I told them again that I murdered her. Jasmine just laughed. She said she wished she could murder Patsy right now. I think the only one who loves her, really loves her, is Cyndy, the Nurse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pondered the matter, perhaps for the first time since Quinn had done it only a few nights before. A body couldn\u0027t survive being dumped in Sugar Devil Swamp. Too many gators. It made me smile bitterly to remember that once others had tried to dispose of me in just the same way. But poor dead Patsy had lacked my resources when she tumbled down into the darkness. Her soul had fled to the Totality of Salvation, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked on together through a crush of valiant tourists. The town was drippingly hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week at this very time I\u0027d been a wanderer, hopelessly without companions, and then Quinn had come into my life, with a letter in his pocket, needing my help, and Stirling had tiptoed into my flat, daring me to discover him, and soon all of Blackwood Manor had materialized around me, Stirling became a player in my life, Aunt Queen had been cruelly lost on the very night I\u0027d made her acquaintance, and then our beloved Merrick, gone from us, and now I was being drawn into the knowledge of the Mayfairs, and I was what? Scared?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, Lestat. You can tell me the truth. I\u0027m your own self, remember? I was darkly and passionately thrilled by all this, and I felt those chills again, merely thinking of Rowan berating me with all that heat only an hour ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was Julien, who just wasn\u0027t going to appear right now and run the risk of Quinn seeing him too. I searched the early evening crowds. Where are you, you wretched coward, cheap second-rate phantom, accused blunderer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn turned his head just a little, never breaking his stride. \"What was that? You were thinking about Julien.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you all of it later,\" I said, and I meant it. \"But let me ask you, you know, about the time you saw the ghost of Oncle Julien?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What vibe did you get in your secret soul? Good ghost? Bad ghost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm, well, good, obviously. Trying to tell me I had Mayfair genes. Trying to save Mona from me, trying to keep us from breeding some awful mutation, which occurs now and then in the Mayfair family. A benign ghost. I\u0027ve told you the whole story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course,\" I replied. \"A benign ghost and an awful mutation. Has Mona mentioned the mutation? The lost child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beloved Boss, what\u0027s bothering you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nada,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow just wasn\u0027t the time to tell him. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the town house. The guards gave us a friendly nod. I gave them a generous tip. It was, for mortal men in long-sleeved shirts, quite unbearably hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could hear the clacking of the computer keys as we went up the iron stairs. Then the low chatter of the printer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona came charging out of the bedroom clothed in last night\u0027s white duds, page in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to this,\" she said. \" \u0027Though this experience is undeniably evil, in that it involves predation upon other human beings, it is without question a mystical experience.\u0027 So, what do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all you\u0027ve written?\" I asked. \"That\u0027s one paragraph. Write some more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" She ran back into the bedroom. Clack went the keys. Quinn followed her with the luggage. He winked at me, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into my bedroom, which was opposite theirs, shut the door, hit the button for the overhead light, and peeled off all my clothes with a shudder of utter disgust, threw them into the bottom of the armoire, put on a brown cotton turtleneck, black pants, and a lightweight black silk and linen jacket with a highly visible weave, a pair of completely smooth black shoes which had never been worn and looked like a modern sculpture, combed my hair until there was no dust in it and then stood there, awash in a moment of total stillness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I stretched out on my bed. Satin tufted tester above me. Satin counterpane below. Fairly shadowy. I turned my face into the down pillows, of which I always had a sizable heap, and with all my muscles sort of scrunched up against the modern world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a masculine thing to do, not a macho posture, not a show of strength to otherworldly entities, not a take-charge attitude at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was comforted by the sound of Mona\u0027s clicking away, the low note of Quinn\u0027s voice. Footsteps on the boards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing could take the edge off Rowan\u0027s angry words, those eyes like hematite, her entire frame trembling with her passion as she accused me. How could Michael Curry stay so close to that blaze and not get scorched?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, there was an agitation in me so great that only lying alone, scrunched up on the bed, could comfort me. Sleep. Sleep, but I could not. They weren\u0027t wicked enough for me, Quinn and Mona. No one was. I wasn\u0027t wicked enough for me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I had to see if the ghosts would come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA clock ticked somewhere. A clock with a painted face and curlicue hands. Not a huge clock. A clock that with its whole soul knew only how to tick and might tick for centuries, maybe had ticked for centuries, a clock to which people would look, and which people would dust, and which people wound with a key, and which people might come to love; a clock somewhere in this flat, perhaps in the back parlor, the only piece of all this furniture that could talk. I heard it. I knew what it was saying. Its code was lovely to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock at the door. Funny. It sounded as if it was right by my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in,\" I said. Damn fool that I am. But I wasn\u0027t fooled by the sounds I heard. That wasn\u0027t the door\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eopening. That wasn\u0027t the door being clicked shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulien stood at the foot of the bed. He came walking up along the side. Julien in his downtown black tailcoat and white tie, hair very white under the chandelier. His eyes were black. I\u0027d thought they were gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you knock?\" I asked. \"Why don\u0027t you just tear my world to pieces instead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want you to forget your manners again,\" he said in perfect French. \"You\u0027re atrocious when you\u0027re ill-mannered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want? To make me suffer? Join the crowd. I\u0027ve been tormented by much stronger creatures than you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t begun to understand what I can do,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made a \u0027disastrous mistake.\u0027 What was it?\" I asked. \"I wonder: do you even know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paled. His placid face became visibly enraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who sends you here to play with the living?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not the living!\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Temper, temper,\" I said mockingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was too angry to speak. It made him all the more vivid, blanched though he was with anger. Or was it sorrow? I couldn\u0027t bear the thought of sorrow. I had enough sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want her?\" I asked. \"Then tell her yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged as best I could, being all snuggled up on the counterpane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell her,\" I said. \"Who am I to say, \u0027Julien says you should expose yourself to the sun and thereby enter into the Totality of Salvation.\u0027 Or is it possible that my questions of last night were more than pertinent and you don\u0027t know where you come from? Maybe there is no Totality of Salvation. No Saint Juan Diego. Maybe you just want her with you in a spirit world where you wander, waiting for somebody who can see you, somebody like Quinn or even Mona herself or me. Is that it? She\u0027s supposed to want to be a ghost? I am showing you my best manners. This is my most polite voice. My mother and father\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould be pleased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a real knock on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe vanished. I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye. Had Stella been sitting to my left all this time?Mon Dieu! I was going mad all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coward,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up and crossed my legs, Indian style. \"Come in,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona burst into the room, dressed in a fresh long-sleeved rose-colored silk dress and rose satin stacked heels, a quivering page of paper once more held aloft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hit me with it,\" I declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027It is my ultimate goal to transmute this experience into a level of life participation which is worthy of the immense powers that have been bequeathed to me by Lestat, a level of life experience which knows no moral shrinking from the most obvious yet painful theological questions which my transfigured state has made utterly inescapable, the first of which is, obviously, How does God view my essential being? Am I human and vampire? Or vampire only? That is, is damnation, and I speak now not of a literal Hell with flames, but of a state which is defined by the absence of God-is damnation implicit and inherent in what I am, or do I still exist in a relativistic universe in which I may attain grace on the same terms as humans can attain it, by participating in the Incarnation of Christ, an historical event in which I totally believe, in spite of the fact that it is not philosophically fashionable, though what questions of fashion have to do with me now in this transcendent and often luminous condition is moot.\u0027 \" She looked at me. \"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think you ducked out of the paragraph on that \u0027fashionable question.\u0027 I think you should scrap the thing about fashionable and try to make a more solid finish, perhaps with some very concise statement about the level on which you believe in the Incarnation of Christ. And you can always use \u0027transcendent\u0027 and \u0027luminous\u0027 in another sentence. Also you misused the word \u0027bequeath.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool!\" She dashed out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, she left the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was already pounding the keyboard, the computer humming on one of my many Louis XV desks; her red eyebrows puckered, her green eyes locked to the monitor when I took up my position, arms folded, looking down on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, what, Beloved Boss?\" she asked without stopping her writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn was stretched out comfortably on the bed, staring at the tester. The whole flat was full of beds with testers. Well, six bedrooms, anyway, three on each side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call Rowan Mayfair and tell her you\u0027re all right. What do you think? Can you pull it off? The woman\u0027s suffering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bummer!\" Clackity-clack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mona, if you possibly could do it-for their sakes, of course. Michael is suffering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked sharply up at me and froze. Then, without taking her eyes off me, she lifted the phone to the right of her on the desk and she punched in the number so rapidly with her thumb I couldn\u0027t follow it. Her generation, with Touch-Tone phones. Big deal! I can write with a quill pen in a flurry of curlicues you wouldn\u0027t believe; let\u0027s see her do that. And I don\u0027t spill a drop of ink on the parchment, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, Rowan, Mona here.\" Hysterical crying on the other end. Mona overriding: \"I\u0027m just fine, I\u0027m hanging with Quinn, look, don\u0027t worry about me, I\u0027m all better, totally.\" A storm of literal questions. Mona overriding: \"Rowan, listen, I\u0027m feeling great. Yeah, a kind of miracle. Like I\u0027ll call you later. No, no, no (overriding again), I\u0027m wearing Aunt Queen\u0027s clothes, they fit me perfectly, yeah, and her shoes, really cool, like she has tons of these high-heel shoes, yeah, and I never wore shoes like this; yeah, fine, no, no, no, stop it, Rowan, and Quinn wants me to wear them, they\u0027re brand new, they\u0027re really great. Love you, love to Michael and everybody. Bye.\" Down with the phone over Rowan shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s done,\" I said. \"I really appreciate it.\" I shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat there white faced, the blood having fled her cheeks, staring into space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like a bully. I was a bully. I\u0027ve always been a bully. Everybody who knows me thinks I am a bully. Except perhaps Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn sat up on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, Ophelia?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I have to go to them,\" she said, her eyebrows knitted. \"I have no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I said. \"They just want off the hook. Now, admittedly, it\u0027s a very complex hook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no,\" she said, \"for my sake.\" Her voice and her face were suddenly pitiless. \"For what I have to find out,\" she continued coldly, shuddering all over as though a wind had blown through the room. \"I know she\u0027s lied to me. She\u0027s lied to me for years. I\u0027m afraid of how much she might have lied to me. I\u0027m going to make her tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was wrong of me, making you talk to her?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ophelia,\" said Quinn, \"take your time. It\u0027s yours to take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, had to happen, you were right,\" she said to me. But she was shaking. Tears standing in her eyes. Preternatural emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about the Woman Child,\" I said under my breath. Was I free to reveal it to Quinn? What I\u0027d seen: her monstrous woman offspring? \"Doll face,\" I said, \"why should we have secrets now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell him anything,\" she said, trying not to cry. \"Dear God, I . . . I . . . I\u0027m going to find them! If she knows where they are, if she\u0027s kept that from me. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn was watching all this, keeping his counsel. But years ago she\u0027d told him she had had a child, that she had had to give up that child. She had spoken of it to him as a mutation. But she had never explained the nature of that mutation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, to recap, in the Blood I\u0027d seen a grown woman, something decidedly not human. Something surely as monstrous as us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to lay it all out for us?\" I asked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now, not ready, not yet.\" She sniffled. \"I hate it, all of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just saw Rowan Mayfair,\" I said. \"I saw her at the Talamasca Retreat House. Something\u0027s deeply wrong with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course something\u0027s wrong with her,\" she said with an air of exasperation. \"I don\u0027t care what happens to her when she sees me. So she sees something that will never make human sense to her. I should care? I don\u0027t need to live with them the way Quinn lives with his family. I realize that now. It\u0027s impossible. I can\u0027t do what Quinn did. I need a legal name. I need some money. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about it a little longer,\" I said. \"There\u0027s no need to make such a decision right now. I got clear of Rowan and Michael tonight rather than disturb them, rather than create doubts that could harm them. It was hard. I wanted to ask them questions. But I had to give it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you care so much?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I care about you and Quinn,\" I said. \"You offend me. Don\u0027t you know that I love you? I wouldn\u0027t have made you if I couldn\u0027t love you. Quinn told me so much about you before I ever saw you and then I fell in love with you, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to know things from them,\" she said. \"Things they\u0027re holding back, and then I have to findmy daughter on my own. But I can\u0027t talk about it just yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your daughter?\" Quinn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the Woman Child, it\u0027s living-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop! Not now,\" said Mona. \"Leave me to my philosophy, both of you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuge shift of gears. Her eyes shot to the computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to banging on the keys. \"What\u0027s a better word than \u0027bequeathed\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bestowed,\" I responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn came up behind her and fastened a cameo at her neck without interfering with her ferocious writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not trying to make her into Aunt Queen, are you?\" I asked. She went on hammering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s Ophelia Immortal,\" he said. He didn\u0027t take offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left her. We went down the passage and out onto the rear balcony and down into the courtyard and found a couple of iron chairs. I realized I\u0027d never used these chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were pretty after a fashion, Victorian, ornate. I didn\u0027t own anything that wasn\u0027t pretty after a fashion, or downright beautiful, if I could help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garden enclosed us with its high banana trees and its night-blooming flowers. The music of the water in the fountain mingled with the distant sound of Mona writing, and Mona whispering as she wrote. I could hear the whine of the nightclub bands on the Rue Bourbon. I could hear the whole damned city if I tried. The sky was a faint lilac color now, overcast and reflecting the city glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think that,\" said Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, Little Brother?\" I woke from listening to distant sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see her as Aunt Queen\u0027s heiress,\" he said, \"don\u0027t you see? Everything that Aunt Queen wanted to give of her clothes, her jewelry, all those things, whatever she wanted to give to Jasmine she\u0027d already given, and there\u0027s plenty enough in bank boxes for Tommy\u0027s wife of the future or whoever little Jerome marries (Jerome was Quinn\u0027s son by Jasmine, let me remind you). And so I make Mona an heiress to maybe a tenth of the most extreme silk dresses. Jasmine never wore the extreme silk dresses anyway. And the glitter shoes which nobody really wants. And the shell cameos, which are common.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Aunt Queen somehow knew what had really happened to me, what I\u0027d become, as we always say so delicately; if she knew that Mona was with me, finally, that Heaven and Earth had been moved, and Mona was with me, she\u0027d want me to give those things to Mona. She\u0027d be pleased that Mona was tripping around in those shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened to all this and I understood it. I should have understood it before. But Mona\u0027s daughter, who and what was Mona\u0027s daughter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The clothes and shoes make her very happy,\" I said. \"Most likely she\u0027s been sick so long that all her own clothes are gone. Who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you see in the Blood when you made her? What was this Woman Child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I saw,\" I responded. \"A daughter of hers who was a full-grown woman, a monster in her own eyes. It had come from her. And it was torn from her. She loved it. She nursed it. I saw that. And then she lost it, just like she told you. It went away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was aghast. He\u0027d caught nothing like this from her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the Blood you go where nobody wants to go. That\u0027s the horror of it. That\u0027s the beauty of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could it really have been so freakish, so abnormal?\" he asked. His eyes veered away. \"You know, years ago, I told you . . . I went to dinner at the Mayfair house. Rowan showed me the place. There was some secret, some dark hidden story present there the whole time. I could see it in Rowan\u0027s silence and in Rowan\u0027s drifting. But I couldn\u0027t see it in Michael. And even now Mona won\u0027t tell us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinn, you won\u0027t tell her why you killed Patsy, either,\" I said. \"As we move on year by year in this life, we learn that telling doesn\u0027t necessarily purge; telling sometimes merely is a reliving, and it\u0027s a torment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back door opened with a splat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona came clattering down the steps, two pages in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God, I just love these shoes!\" she said, making a circuit of the courtyard. Then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood before us, looking like a waxen doll in the light from the upstairs windows, with one finger pointing, like that of a nun in school:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027I must confess that it has already become undeniably clear to me, though I have existed in this exalted state for only two nights, that the very nature of my powers and means of existence attest to the ontological supremacy of a sensualist philosophy having taken up residence within me, as I proceed from moment to moment and from hour to hour both to apprehend the universe around me and the microcosm of my own self. This requires of me an immediate redefining of the concept of mystical, which I have heretofore mentioned to include a state both elevated and totally carnal, both transcendent and orgasmic, which delivers me when drinking blood or gazing at a lighted candle beyond all human epistemological constraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Whereas the hermeneutics of pain had once completely convinced me of my own personal salvation, indeed, whereas I had once worked out a comprehensive Prayer of Quiet in which I had embraced Christ and his Five Wounds in order to endure the Finality which seemed inescapable for me, I now find myself approaching God on a totally undefined path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Can it be that being a vampire, and having a vampire soul as well as a human soul, I am therefore removed from human obligations and all human ontological conditions? I think not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027I think on the contrary that I am now responsible for the supreme human obligation: to investigate the highest use of my powers, for surely though I am vampire by my own free will and by a Baptism of Blood, I am still by birth, by maturity, by underlying physicality human, and must therefore share in the human condition despite the fact that I shall not in the ordinary scheme of things grow old or die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027To return to the inescapable question of Salvation, yes, I do remain rooted in a relativistic universe, no matter how spectacularly defined I have become as to form and function, and I find myself within the same dimension in which I existed before my transformation, and therefore I must ask: am I perforce outside the economy of grace established by Our Divine Savior in the very fact of his Incarnation, even before His Crucifixion, both events which I firmly believe to have occurred within human history and chronology, and to be knowable through both, and commanding a response in both?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Or can the Sacraments of Holy Mother the Church redeem me in my present state? I must conclude on the face of it, from my short experience, from the ecstasy and abandon which have so rampantly replaced all pain and suffering within the organism which I am, that I assume that I stand excommunicated from the Body of Christ by my very nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027But it could be that I am never to know the answer to this question, no matter how thoroughly I investigate the world and myself, and does not this very unknowing only bring me all the closer to full existential participation in humankind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027It seems wise to accept, in deepest humility and with an aim towards a validating spiritual perfection at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe onset, that I may never hope at any juncture of my wanderings, be they for untold centuries or for a few short years of near unendurable ecstasy, to know whether I share in the Savior\u0027s Redemption, and that that very unknowing may be the price I pay for my extra-human sensibility and inherently blood-thirsty triumph over the pain I once suffered, over the imminent death that once tyrannized me, over the ubiquitous threat of human time.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn piped up: \"I like the word \u0027perforce.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran up to him and started beating him about the head and shoulders with the pages, and kicking him with her high-heel shoes. He laughed under his breath and carelessly defended himself with one arm. \"Look, it\u0027s better than crying!\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hopeless Boy,\" she declared, erupting in streaks of laughter. \"You hopeless, egregious Boy! You are patently unworthy of all the philosophical considerations I have positively lavished upon you! And what, I ask, have you written since your Blood Baptism, why, the very ink has dried up in the circuits of your cruel little preternatural brain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute, quiet,\" I said. \"Someone\u0027s arguing with the guards at the gate.\" I was on my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, it\u0027s Rowan,\" said Mona. \"Damn, I should never have called her on her cell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cell?\" I asked. But it was very much too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caller ID,\" Quinn murmured as he rose and took Mona in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Rowan, most assuredly-breathless and frantic, and, followed by both guards, who were protesting heavily, she came racing back the carriageway and stopped dead, facing Mona across the courtyard. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10/page-11.html","bookId":2596,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM"}
