The clattering of heavy rain against the roof of the motorhome woke Michael who had fallen asleep a few minutes earlier, still lying next to Emma on the cold, hard floor. The sound of the rain was deafening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe allowed himself to cautiously roll over and peer out from underneath the blanket which had covered them both since they\u0027d been forced to try and disappear from view many hours earlier. The light was low and he slowly climbed to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis bones ached painfully as he stood upright. The water running down the windows blurred his view of the outside world. The sudden lack of visibility combined with the unexpected but welcome noise gave him enough cover to be able to risk moving around. He quickly worked his way around the sides of the motorhome, blocking each window with heavy curtains and boards. Also awake, Emma sat up and watched him in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d finished she too crawled out of the shadows and stood next to him. \u0027This is a real fucking mess,\u0027 he said under his breath as he peered out through a narrow crack between the curtains at the nearest window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There are thousands of bodies here.\u0027 He slowly walked the length of the motorhome and sat down in the driver\u0027s seat. Emma remained close behind. She crouched down next to him and grabbed hold of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So what do you want to do?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027 Michael gingerly lifted up another curtain edge and stared outside. All that he could see were corpses. Soaked by the heavy rain and tightly packed together, they were crammed into the field, surrounding the motorhome on every side. \u0027We have to do something.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ve got to be right on top of the base,\u0027 he said. \u0027There must be an entrance round here somewhere. These bodies wouldn\u0027t be here if there wasn\u0027t something attracting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re out in the middle of nowhere, for Christ\u0027s sake.\u0027 \u0027So what do you suggest?\u0027 Michael didn\u0027t answer immediately. His attention had been caught by a group of bodies about a hundred meters away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor no apparent reason they seemed to be fighting, almost ripping each other apart. An unstoppable reaction to the sudden outburst of movement and violence quickly spread through much of the rest of the gathering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All we can do is wait,\u0027 he replied. \u0027We either wait for the soldiers to appear again and try and get their attention or we wait until this crowd starts to thin out and try and get away from here.\u0027 \u0027When\u0027s that likely to happen?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No idea. Sometime in the next six months I should think.\u0027 She didn\u0027t appreciate his answer. \u0027Be serious,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027We can\u0027t just sit here indefinitely, can we?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If we can\u0027t get out of here then we don\u0027t seem to have much choice.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-47.html","bookId":2558,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:53:30 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:53:30 AM"}
