They were healing but would remain scarred. The disfigurement did not matter in and of itself. He was not vain. And once the Change began and he was transformed, the scars and loss of a hand would not matter. He would be renewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut until then, these scars would attract attention. He did not like the idea of people staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it would not be for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, it might be a very long time if he did not locate that baby. He had to return to the mainland - now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the bathroom and made his way through the front room, feeling stronger, and somewhat steadier on his feet, but still nowhere near who he had been forty-eight hours ago. He needed to lean on the furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" the cow said as he passed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remained on the floor beside her dead dog, caressing the fur of its carcass. How long would she stay there? Until it rotted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer her. Instead he opened the front door and stepped outside. The air was icy but still, and the sky a speckled black dome. With so little light pollution here, he could make out the crowded stars and dust lanes of the Milky Way arching above him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf his plans held, all this would change - day would become night, and the stars would mutate into new formations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe South Fork of Long Island glowed faintly straight ahead and to his right. He raised his arms to each side, spreading them like wings. He stood swaying, a human cross, then willed himself to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried harder, but remained earthbound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnease filtered through him. Was it because he was still so weak?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his arms and stared at the stump of his left wrist. Or had the loss of his hand affected his mastery over gravity? Through the years he\u0027d used that mastery judiciously and with caution - it wouldn\u0027t do to be seen floating in the air - and had found it of limited use. An occasional convenience. But now, when he needed it, it had deserted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing out there?\" the cow called from behind him. \"Come in here right now before you catch your death of cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he would not catch his death from a cold or any other infection. Viruses and bacteria had no chance against his immune system. But a too-low body temperature could stop his heart like anyone else\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was just as well he couldn\u0027t lift in his weakened condition. The ability might fail him while airborne. He needed more strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could go back inside and begin slow work on the cow with a knife. No one would hear her screams as he fed on her agony and fear. But he saw no guarantee that would be enough. He would most likely have to take the boat back to the mainland anyway. That meant witnesses. And if evidence were found in the house, he would be subjected to the inconvenience of a police investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll reasons why he rarely harmed anyone himself. So much better to induce someone else to commit an atrocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatient ... he must be patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the house. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-75.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
