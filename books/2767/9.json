{"id":86003,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t placate me, Alex,\" Peterson says with a snort. \"I\u0027ve had it up to here with your antics,\" she says, her hand waving above her head. She glares at Brittany and Colin. I think she\u0027s going to let them bitch at me until I hear her say, \"And don\u0027t think you two are any better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany seems stunned at the scolding. Oh, but she was perfectly content watching Mrs. P. bitch me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be partners with him,\" Little Miss Perfecta blurts out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin steps forward. \"She can partner up with me and Darlene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost smile when Mrs. P.\u0027s eyebrows rise so high I think they\u0027re about to run up her forehead and never stop. \"And what makes you two so special you think you can change my class structure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo, Peterson!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nadine, I\u0027ll take it from here,\" Aguirre says to Mrs. P., then points to a picture of our school framed on the wall. He doesn\u0027t let the two north siders answer Mrs. P.\u0027s question before he says, \"Our motto at Fairfield High is Diversity Breeds Knowledge, guys. If you ever forget, it\u0027s etched into the stones at the front entrance, so the next time you pass by it take a minute to think about what those words mean. Let me assure you as your new principal my goal is to bridge any gap in the school culture that negates that motto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so diversity breeds knowledge. But I\u0027ve also seen it breed hatred and ignorance. I\u0027m not about to taint Aguirre\u0027s rosy picture of our motto, because I\u0027m starting to believe our principal actually believes the crap he\u0027s spouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Aguirre and I are on the same page. In light of that . . .\" Peterson fires me a fierce look--one so convincing she probably practices it in front of a mirror. \"Alex, stop goading Brittany.\" She fires the same look to the two on the other side of the room. \"Brittany, stop acting like a diva. And Colin ... I don\u0027t even know what you have to do with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m her boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d appreciate it if you\u0027d keep your relationship out of my classroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But--,\" Colin starts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeterson cuts him off with a wave of her hand. \"Enough. We\u0027re done here and so are all of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin grabs the diva\u0027s hand and they both file out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I walk out of Aguirre\u0027s office, Peterson puts a hand on my elbow. \"Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop and look at her. Into her eyes, which have sympathy written all over them. It doesn\u0027t sit well in my gut. \"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see right through you, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to wipe that sympathy off her face. The last time a teacher looked at me like that, it was in first grade right after my dad was shot. \"It\u0027s the second week of school, Nadine. You might want to wait a month or two before you make a statement like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckles and says, \"I haven\u0027t been teaching that long, but I\u0027ve already seen more Alex Fuenteses in my classroom than a lot of teachers will see in a lifetime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I thought I was unique.\" I put my hands over my heart. \"You wound me, Nadine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to make yourself unique, Alex? Finish school and graduate without dropping out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the plan,\" I tell her, although I\u0027ve never admitted it to anyone before. I know my mom wants me to graduate, but we\u0027ve never discussed it. And, to be honest, I don\u0027t know if she actually expects it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m told they all say that at first.\" She opens her purse and pulls out my bandanna. \"Don\u0027t let your life outside of school dictate your future,\" she says, getting all serious on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shove the bandanna into my back pocket. She has no clue how much my life outside of school leaks into the life I lead inside of school. A redbrick building can\u0027t shield me from the outside world. Hell, I couldn\u0027t hide in here even if I wanted to. \"I know what you\u0027re gonna say next. . . if you ever need a friend, Alex, I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong. I\u0027m not your friend. If I were, you wouldn\u0027t be a gang member. But I\u0027ve seen your test scores. You\u0027re a smart kid who can succeed if you take school seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSucceed. Success. It\u0027s all relative, now, isn\u0027t it? \"Can I go to class now?\" I ask, because I have no comeback to that. I\u0027m ready to accept that my chem teacher and new principal might not be on my side . . . but I\u0027m not sure they\u0027re on the other side, either. Kinda blows my theories out of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, go to class, Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m still thinking about what Peterson said when I hear her call after me, \"And if you call me Nadine again, you\u0027ll have the pleasure of getting another detention slip and writing an essay on respect. Remember, I\u0027m not your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I walk into the hallway, I smile to myself. That woman sure does wield those blue detention slips and threats of essays like weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 11 Brittany\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s only a half hour left in gym. As I change into my gym clothes, I think of what happened in Dr. Aguirre\u0027s office. Mrs. Peterson was blaming me as much as she blamed Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex Fuentes is already ruining my senior year, and it\u0027s hardly even begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I pull up my gym shorts, the sound of tap-tap-tapping on the hard cement floor alerts me that I\u0027m not alone in the locker room. I clutch my gym shirt to my chest as Carmen Sanchez comes into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be my lucky day,\" she says, staring me down and looking very much like a cougar ready to attack. Although cougars don\u0027t have long, straight brown hair . . . they sure do have claws. And Carmen\u0027s claws are painted bright red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe steps closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to step back. Actually, I want to run. But I don\u0027t, mainly because she\u0027d probably follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" she says, her mouth quirked in a wicked grin. \"I always wondered what color bra Brittany Ellis wore. Pink. How fitting. I bet it was as expensive as your dye job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to talk about bras and dye jobs, Carmen,\" I tell her while I pull my gym shirt over my head. I swallow hard before I add, \"You want to kick my ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When a ho moves in on my man, I get territorial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want your man, Carmen. I have my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please. Girls like you want every guy to like them, just so you can have them when you decide you want them.\" As she\u0027s talking, she\u0027s getting more riled up. I\u0027m in trouble. \"I heard you talkin\u0027 shit about me. You think you\u0027re all that, Miss High and Mighty. Let\u0027s see what you look like with a busted lip and a big, black eye. Would you come to school with a garbage bag over your head? Or would you stay holed up in your big house and never come out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Carmen as she walks toward me. Really look at her. She knows deep down how much importance I put on controlling the image I portray, while she doesn\u0027t care if she\u0027s suspended ... or expelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me!\" she yells, then shoves my shoulder. It collides with the locker behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I wasn\u0027t listening because I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m supposed to answer. The consequences of me coming home bruised and having been in a fight are insurmountable. My mom will be furious and blame the entire thing on me for not preventing it from happening. I hope to God she doesn\u0027t start talking about sending Shelley away again. When stressful stuff happens, my parents talk about sending Shelley away. As if magically all of the Ellises\u0027 external problems will be solved if Shelley disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think Coach Bautista will come here looking for me? You want to be suspended?\" I know, lame questions. But I\u0027m trying to buy time here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckles. \"You think I give a shit about being suspended?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot really, but it was worth a try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of cowering next to my locker, I stand tall. Carmen tries again to push my shoulder, but this time I manage to swat her arm away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about to get into my first fight. A fight I\u0027m bound to lose. My heart feels like it\u0027s going to burst out of my chest. My whole life I\u0027ve avoided situations like these, but this time I have no choice. I wonder if I can pull the fire alarm to avoid this, like I\u0027ve seen in the movies. But of course I don\u0027t see one of those little red boxes anywhere near me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carmen, leave her alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both turn to the sound of a girl\u0027s voice. It\u0027s Isabel. A nonfriend. A nonfriend who just might save my face from getting bashed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isa, stay out of my business,\" Carmen growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabel comes toward us, her dark brown hair in a high ponytail that sways when she walks. \"No chingues con ella, Carmen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Por que no?\" Carmen asks. \"Because you think you\u0027re BFFs with blondie here now that you both wave stupid-ass pom-poms together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsa puts her hands on her hips. \"You\u0027re mad at Alex, Carmen. That\u0027s why you\u0027re acting like a perm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mention of Alex, Carmen goes rigid. \"Shut up, Isa. You don\u0027t know anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmen turns her fury on Isabel and yells at her in Spanish. Isabel doesn\u0027t back off, she stands tall in front of Carmen and spouts Spanish right back at her. Isabel is a short girl and probably weighs less than I do, so I\u0027m shocked she\u0027s standing up to Carmen. But she\u0027s holding her own. I can tell by the way her words make Carmen back off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach Bautista appears behind Carmen. \"You three having a party and didn\u0027t invite the rest of the class?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were having a little chat,\" Carmen says, not missing a beat and acting as if we\u0027re all friends hanging out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, I suggest you chat after school instead of during class. Miss Ellis and Miss Avila, join the rest of your classmates in the gym. Miss Sanchez, go to where you\u0027re supposed to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmen points her red-painted fingernail at me. \"Later,\" she says, then walks out of the locker room, but not before making Isabel move out of the way for her to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I say softly to Isabel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answer is a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 12 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You almost done with the Honda? It\u0027s time to close up,\" my cousin Enrique says to me. I work at his auto body shop every day after school ... to help my family put food on our table, to get away from the Latino Blood for a few hours, and because I\u0027m damn good at fixing cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovered in grease and oil from working on the Civic, I roll out from under the car. \"It\u0027ll be done in a sec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. The guy\u0027s been on my ass to have it fixed for three days now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tighten the last bolt and walk over to Enrique as he wipes his dirty hands on a shop cloth. \"Can I ask you somethin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I have a day off next week? There\u0027s this chem project at school,\" I explain, thinking of the topic assigned to us today, \"and we\u0027re supposed to meet with--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peterson\u0027s class. Yeah, I remember those days. She\u0027s a real hard-ass.\" My cousin shudders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had her?\" I ask, amused. I wonder if her parents are parole officers. That woman sure likes discipline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I forget? You\u0027re not a success unless you develop a treatment for a disease or save the earth,\" Enrique says, doing a pretty decent imitation of Mrs. P. \"You don\u0027t forget a nightmare like Peterson. But I\u0027m sure havin\u0027 Brittany Ellis as a partner--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marcus came by and told me \u0027bout her, says he\u0027s in class with you guys. He\u0027s jealous you got a hot partner with long legs and big . . .\" Enrique moves his hands in the air, mock feeling her chest. \"Well, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift my weight from one foot to the other. \"What about takin\u0027 time off Thursday?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-9.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
