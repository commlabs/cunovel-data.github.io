{"id":4307,"no":70,"title":"CHAPTER XIX.","content":"“The sun had set in rich magnificence:\n\u003cbr\u003e The west was a region of golden light,\n\u003cbr\u003e Inscrutable in lustre, involving\n\u003cbr\u003e The imagination in its ocean\n\u003cbr\u003e Of effulgence: while from its distant shores\n\u003cbr\u003e Of miraculous brightness, came floating,\n\u003cbr\u003e On mid air, light fleeces of gold. Slowly\n\u003cbr\u003e The silent moments stole a chill o’er this\n\u003cbr\u003e Enchantment, the bright wand’rers disappeared;\n\u003cbr\u003e The western paradise closed her gates;\n\u003cbr\u003e And gray twilight, sat on the mountain side.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The morning after the festival given for the birth-day, Mrs. Montgomery, partly from having taken cold, and partly from fatigue, felt far from well, and consequently remained in bed the entire of the day. Julia sat with her grandmother all the morning. After dinner,[190] Frances relieved guard, and begged of her sister, as the evening was fine, to take a little walk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lord L. was dining with Lord Borrowdale. Henry had quitted Lodore-House that morning, saying, that he was setting out to join the Euphrasia, which, it appeared by the papers, was shortly expected in the Sound.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Julia, therefore, walked out quite alone, she directed her steps towards the desolate vale, where her mother had first found poor Edmund. She seated herself. Her eyes rested on the western hill. It was topped by a few scattered trees, the grouping and even the ramifications of which, were accurately traced out by the bright glow of the heavens behind them. The eastern side of the slope was in shadow, and the woods that clothed it hung to the very waters’ edge, while the lake at its foot, reflecting the crimson clouds above, appeared a sheet of fire. The dazzle of the sun’s immediate presence being removed,[191] (for he had just dropped behind the hill,) the relieved eye could now view with delighted leisure, all the beauty, magnificence, and infinite variety of the scene, wherein, each moment, changes were wrought, imperceptible in their approaches, but in their effects, picturesque and splendid, as the most vivid descriptions of enchantment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Amid the clouds, cloud-formed castles turreted with gold, and temples, sustained by pillars which seemed of fire, arose, spread, united, brightened, divided, and sunk again. Imagination could fancy them dissolving in the intensity of their own lustre. Where these had been, mimic vessels now appeared, of fleecy whiteness, sailing on the liquid gold. These melted next, and waves of clouds, rolling themselves together heap on heap, rose to mountains ranged across the west, and shutting out almost all its glories. Yet on their purple summits, there seemed to linger floating forms, still of[192] vivid hues, though each moment losing something of their brightness, till, gradually, they became of a sombre grey, as, one by one, they clothed themselves in mist, and, blending with the deepening shadows, disappeared. The upper sky, however, was still streaked with alternate grey and gold, which the face of the water, faithfully as a mirror, reflected. The real mountains which surrounded the lake, and the little islands which lay slumbering on its surface, had become masses of an almost jetty black, and there was little light remaining any where, when a solitary row-boat put off from the opposite shore. As it crossed one of the illumined paths, which reflected from the sky still appeared on the water, the working of its oars was, for the moment, visible, together with the strongly defined form of one who, with folded arms, stood erect at its bow. Julia certainly saw, for the moment described, as we see with the mind’s eye what crosses us in[193] thought, the boat, and the figure, for the appearance they made at the time afterwards floated on her memory. Yet she remained motionless.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/795/59054.html","bookId":145,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:16:42 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:16:42 AM"}
