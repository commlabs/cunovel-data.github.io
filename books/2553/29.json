Not one damn bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed his burning eyes. Somewhere outside this sealed office in the subbasement of SimGen\u0027s Basic Research building, the sun was preparing to rise. Luca hadn\u0027t slept in twenty-three hours, but he wasn\u0027t the least bit physically tired. The fatigue weighing on him like a lead-lined shroud was mental, from hammering his brain for an explanation as to how such a simple op could go so fatally wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doyou understand, Portero?\" said the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt belonged to Darryl Lister, Luca\u0027s old CO, the man who\u0027d brought him into SIRG. Just like back in the service, Lister was his direct superior, and the next stop up the ladder from Luca. Lister was understandably upset about being awakened ahead of his alarm clock with the news that two of their men were dead. He\u0027d hung up on Luca, then called him back half an hour later - after checking with the SIRG higher-ups, no doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then maybe,\" Lister continued, \"just maybe you can helpme understand how six pros go out to process a couple of soft-shelled yuppies, and two come back in body bags, while the yups are still walking around. You were running the op. Explain, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLister\u0027s tone surprised Luca. He sounded nothing like the Captain he\u0027d known back in their Special Forces days. Hell, they\u0027d stalked through Kabul and Baghdad together; he was one of the few men in the world Luca respected. Why was he coming on so managerial?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCouldn\u0027t worry about that now. Had to give him answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca once more reviewed the set-up, groping for a flaw. He\u0027d handpicked the men, all seasoned SIRG operatives. Using a bogus identity he\u0027d personally rented the vans from two different companies -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;could have used unmarked SimGen vehicles but didn\u0027t want to chance a trace. Then last night, after weeks of surveillance on Sullivan and Cadman, a golden opportunity: the two of them together driving through Westchester in the dead hours of the morning. A couple of quick calls and everyone was in position, waiting for it to go down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, so good. Not a hint that it was going to go down the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reran his mental tape of what he\u0027d learned from debriefing the survivors. According to Snyder and Lowery - the wheel man and his back-up in the first van - the hit on Sullivan\u0027s car had been perfect: over the rail and down the slope. As planned, they\u0027d driven away and left their rented van at a body shop that knows how to keep a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that the story murked up. The two survivors of the wet team, Cruz and Hooper, had spent too much time recovering from their doses of Mace to see anything. And they were still limping from the tap dance the Cadman woman had done on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca shook his head, torn between rage and admiration. Some kind of broad, that Romy. He couldn\u0027t help but admire the way she\u0027d engineered the raid on that sim whorehouse. And then she\u0027d made asses of two of his best men. Maybe they were still alive thanks to her. He could use someone like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Cruz and Hooper could finally see and walk again, they\u0027d found Ricker and Green dead; they\u0027d gathered up the corpses and hauled ass out of there in the second van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I put Ricker in charge,\" Luca said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good choice,\" Lister replied. \"I\u0027d have done the same. But Ricker is dead, and that\u0027s what disturbs me, Portero. How does Ricker wind up with a cracked skull? Who do you know who could take Ricker in hand-to-hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right. He was a fucking animal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo argument there. Ricker wasn\u0027t just big and tough, he was experienced and smart. No one was going to take him down without a struggle, and not without him taking one or two down with him. But according to Cruz and Hooper, they never heard a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ricker\u0027s body...his throat had been crushed - that explained the silence - and his head had been smashed. Looked like he\u0027d leaned out of a speeding subway and got clocked by a support girder. Same with Green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, if Luca wasn\u0027t so sure it was impossible, he\u0027d think someone had grabbed Ricker and Green by their necks and smashed their heads together...like a bully brother breaking his sister\u0027s dolls. But who could manhandle two guys as fit and jacked as Ricker and Green like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn icy length of barbed wire dragged along Luca\u0027s spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to what you\u0027ve told me,\" Lister said, \"Ricker and the team didn\u0027t know where they were going until less than an hour before they hit the road. Even you didn\u0027t know. So how did whoever took them out know? Sounds to me like they were already there waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or they were followed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why follow them at all? Unless...shit! The Japs! I bet it\u0027s the Japs! That goddamn Kaze Group has been sticking its dirty fingers deeper and deeper into the biotech pie, and now - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it\u0027s the Japs,\" Luca said. \"They\u0027ve got no reason to protect Sullivan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they just want to keep us off balance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca began to feel an unsettling suspicion. He hesitated, as if uttering the words might turn the possibility into a reality. But Lister - and SIRG - had to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think there\u0027s a new player in the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get an idea like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A gut feeling. And the fact that we\u0027ve never had to deal with a countermove like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause while Lister digested that. \"Who on earth...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea - yet. But I\u0027m going to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do that. But don\u0027t lose us any more men in the process. Whoever these people are, they play rough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rough,\" Luca said, clamping his jaw. \"They don\u0027t know rough. Not by half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And somethingyou should know,\" Lister said. \"Word from upstairs is that this was a bad idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad?\" Anger dueled with a sudden stab of cold fear. \"It was approved! What the hell are they trying\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful what you say, Portero. The wrong people might hear and you could find yourself back where you came from, living on your pension while pimping for your mother - and happy to be allowed to do so. Comprende?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLister\u0027s unexpected attack rocked Luca. \"What?What did you just say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage flared through him, making him want to reach through the phone and kill. He didn\u0027t care about the swift and inevitably deadly reprisal from SIRG, he wanted to crush Lister\u0027s larynx, wanted to see his eyes bulge, his face turn purple while Luca screamed in his ear that yes, my mother was a whore, but only because she had to be and she\u0027s not anymore, and yes, she doesn\u0027t know who my father was, but...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Lister said. \"That was uncalled for. I\u0027m just...you wouldn\u0027t believe the pressure that\u0027s coming down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca said nothing. All right, so SIRG was squeezing Lister, big time. That still didn\u0027t give him the right...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Lister said. \"Whatever you thought they said before, they now say the lawyer is not key. If he goes, he can be replaced in minutes by another lawyer, maybe a better one, who might cause even more problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLister paused, as if expecting a comment. They\u0027re right, Luca grudgingly admitted. No shortage of lawyers. But he said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLister went on: \"The sims - thisparticular group of sims - are key. No other group has come forward looking to unionize, only these. Why, we don\u0027t know. Why, we don\u0027t care. Point is, SIRG wants the focus of your efforts from now on to be the Beacon Ridge sims. Are we clear on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalmer now, Luca already was germinating an idea. A simple plan. A one-man job. And he knew just the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time there\u0027d be no slip-ups because he\u0027d take care of it himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause this had become personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy Cadman had made him look bad. Hurt his reputation. Now she was going to hurt. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-29.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
