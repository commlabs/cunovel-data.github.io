This work gives a short guide to every Shakespeare play, and also his two epic poems. Asimov organizes the plays as follows: Greek Roman Italian The English Plays The last two categories are treated broadly; \u0027Italian\u0027 applies to neighbouring countries, and both Hamlet and Macbeth are listed with \u0027The English Plays\u0027. Asimov gives a detailed justification for doing this. Within each category, the plays are arranged chronologically, making allowance for the several not based on actual events. Asimov notes how much is real history, and describes who the original people were, where applicable. He traces those characters who appear in more than one play, and provides maps to explain key geographical elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/asimov-s-guide-to-shakespeare.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/asimov-s-guide-to-shakespeare.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:37 AM"}
