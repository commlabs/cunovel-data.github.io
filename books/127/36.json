It\u0027s nonsense.\"There was a short, rebellious silence, and then Lepold said, \"Everyonebelieves it just the same. I mean all this talk about the Prophet HariSeldon and how he appointed the Foundation to carry on his commandmentsthat there might some day be a return of the Galactic Paradise: and howanyone who disobeys his commandments will be destroyed for eternity. Theybelieve it. I\u0027ve presided at festivals, and I\u0027m sure they do.\"\"Yes, they do; but we don\u0027t. And you may be thankful it\u0027s so, for accordingto this foolishness, you are king by divine right ?and are semi-divineyourself. Very handy. It eliminates all possibilities of revolts andinsures absolute obedience in everything. And that is why, Lepold, you musttake an active part in ordering the war against the Foundation. I am onlyregent, and quite human. You are king, and more than half a god ?to them.\"\"But I suppose I\u0027m not really,\" said the king reflectively.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, not really,\" came the sardonic response, \"but you are to everyone butthe people of the Foundation.

Verisof said only those blessed with the GalacticSpirit could?\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Verisof said! Verisof, next to Salvor Hardin, is your greatest enemy.\n\u003cbr\u003e Stay with me, Lepold, and don\u0027t worry about them. Together we will recreatean empire-not just the kingdom of Anacreon-but one comprising every one ofthe billions of suns of the Empire.
