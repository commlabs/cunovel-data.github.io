The construction workers tore Alison Lamarr\u0027s bathroom apart and disconnected the plumbing. Bureau crime scene specialists wrapped the whole tub in heavy plastic while the builders took out the window and removed the end wall down to floor level. The crane crew fixed canvas slings under the wrapped tub and brought their hook in through the hole in the end of the building and eased the heavy load out into the night. It swung through the chill air and dropped slowly down to a wooden crate lashed to a flatbed truck idling on the road. The truckers pumped expanding foam into the crate to cushion the cargo and nailed the lid down tight and drove straight to the airport in Spokane. The crate was loaded into a waiting plane and flown direct to Andrews Air Force Base, where a helicopter collected it and took it on down to Quantico. Then it was off-loaded by a forklift and set down gently in a laboratory loading bay and left waiting there for an hour while the Bureau\u0027s forensic experts figured out exactly how to proceed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At this point, the cause of death is all I want,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sitting on one side of a long table in the pathology conference room, three buildings and five floors away from the Behavioral Science facility. Harper was sitting next to him, and then Poulton next to her, and then Reacher at the end of the row. Opposite them was Quantico\u0027s senior pathologist, a doctor called Stavely, which was a name Reacher thought he recognized from somewhere. Clearly the guy had some kind of a famous reputation. Everybody was treating him with deference. He was a large red-faced man, oddly cheerful. His hands were big and red and looked clumsy, although presumably they weren\u0027t. Next to him was his chief technician, a quiet thin man who looked preoccupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We read the stuff from your other cases,\" Stavely said, and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning I\u0027m not exactly filled with optimism,\" Stavely said. \"New Hampshire is a little remote from the action, I agree, but they see plenty down in Florida and California. I suspect if there was anything to find, you\u0027d know about it by now. Good people, down there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better people up here,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely smiled. \"Flattery will get you anywhere, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not flattery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely was still smiling. \"If there\u0027s nothing to find, what can we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to be something,\" Blake said. \"He made a mistake this time, with the box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So maybe he made more than one mistake, left something you\u0027ll find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely thought about it. \"Well, don\u0027t hold your breath, is all I\u0027m saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he stood up abruptly and knitted his thick fingers together and flexed his hands. Turned to his technician. \"So are we ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thin guy nodded. \"We\u0027re assuming the paint will be dried hard on the top surface, maybe an inch, inch and a half. If we cut it away from the tub enamel all around we should be able to slide a body bag in and scoop her out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Stavely said. \"Keep as much paint around her as you can. I don\u0027t want her disturbed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician hurried out and Stavely followed him, evidently assuming the other four would file out behind him, which they did, with Reacher last in line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE PATHOLOGY LAB was no different from the others Reacher had seen. It was a large low space, brightly lit by an illuminated ceiling. The walls and the floor were white tile. In the middle of the room was a large examination table sculpted from gleaming steel. The table had a drain canal pressed into the center. The drain was plumbed straight into a steel pipe running down through the floor. The table was surrounded by a cluster of wheeled carts loaded with tools. Hoses hung from the ceiling. There were cameras on stands, and scales, and extractor hoods. There was a low hum of ventilation and a strong smell of disinfectant. The air was still and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gowns, and gloves,\" Stavely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to a steel cupboard filled with folded nylon gowns and boxes of disposable latex gloves. Harper handed them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably won\u0027t need masks,\" Stavely said. \"My guess is the paint will be the worst thing we smell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey smelled it as soon as the gurney came in through the door. The technician was pushing it and the body bag lay on it, bloated and slick and smeared with green. Paint seeped from the closure and ran down the steel legs to the wheels and left parallel tracks across the white tile. The technician walked between the tracks. The gurney rattled and the bag rolled and wobbled like a giant balloon filled with oil. The technician\u0027s arms were smeared with paint to his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take her to X ray first,\" Stavely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy steered the gurney in a new direction and headed for a closed room off the side of the lab. Reacher stepped ahead and pulled the door for him. It felt like it weighed a ton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lined with lead,\" Stavely said. \"We really zap them in there. Big, big doses, so we can see everything we want to see. Not like we have to worry about their long-term health, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician was gone for a moment and then he stepped back into the lab and eased the heavy door closed behind him. There was a distant powerful hum which lasted a second and then stopped. He went back and came out pushing the gurney again. It was still making tracks across the tile. He stopped it alongside the examination table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roll her off,\" Stavely said. \"I want her facedown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician stepped beside him and leaned across the table and grasped the nearer edge of the bag with both hands and lifted it half off the gurney, half onto the table. Then he walked around to the other side and took the other edge and flipped it up and over. The bag flopped zipper-side down and the mass inside it sucked and rolled and wobbled and settled. Paint oozed out onto the polished steel. Stavely looked at it and beyond it to the floor, which was all crisscrossed with green tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Overshoes, people,\" he said. \"It\u0027ll get everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stepped away and Harper found pairs of plastic footwear in a locker and handed them out. Reacher slipped his on and stepped back and watched the paint. It seeped out through the zipper like a thick slow tide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the film,\" Stavely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician ducked back to the X-ray room and came out with large gray squares of film which mapped Alison Lamarr\u0027s body. He handed them to Stavely. Stavely fanned through them and held them up against the light from the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Instant,\" he said. \"Like Polaroid. The benefits of scientific progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuffled them like a dealer and separated one of them and held it up. Ducked away to a light box on the wall and hit the switch and held the film against the light with his big fingers splayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at that,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a photograph of the midsection from just below the sternum to just above the pubic area. Reacher saw the outlines of ghostly gray bones, ribs, spine, pelvis, with a forearm and a hand lying across them at an angle. And another shape, dense and so bright it shone pure white. Metal. Slim and pointed, about as long as the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A tool of some sort,\" Stavely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The others didn\u0027t have anything like that,\" Poulton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc, we need to see it right away,\" Blake said. \"It\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shook his head. \"It\u0027s underneath her body right now, because she\u0027s upside down. We\u0027ll get there, but it won\u0027t be real soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long as it takes,\" Stavely said. \"This is going to be messy as hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clipped the gray photographs in sequence on the light box. Then he walked the length of the ghostly display and studied them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her skeleton is relatively undamaged,\" he said. He pointed to the second panel. \"Left wrist was cracked and healed, probably ten years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was into sports,\" Reacher said. \"Her sister told us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely nodded. \"So we\u0027ll check the collarbone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved left and studied the first panel. It showed the skull and the neck and the shoulders. The collar-bones gleamed and swooped down toward the sternum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Small crack,\" Stavely said, pointing. \"It\u0027s what I\u0027d expect. An athlete with a cracked wrist will usually have a cracked collarbone too. They fall off their bike or their Rollerblades or whatever, throw out their arm to break their fall, end up breaking their bones instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But no fresh injuries?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shook his head. \"These are ten years old, maybe more. She wasn\u0027t killed by blunt trauma, if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hit the switch and the light behind the X rays went out. He turned back to the examination table and knitted his fingers again and his knuckles clicked in the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s go to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled a hose from a reel mounted on the ceiling and turned a small faucet built into its nozzle. There was a hissing sound and a stream of clear liquid started running. A heavy, slow liquid with a sharp, strong smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Acetone,\" Stavely said. \"Got to clear this damn paint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used the acetone sluice on the body bag and on the steel table. The technician used handfuls of kitchen towel, wiping the bag and pushing the thick liquid into the drain. The chemical stink was overpowering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ventilator,\" Stavely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician ducked away and twisted a switch behind him and the fans in the ceiling changed up from a hum to a louder roar. Stavely held the nozzle closer and the bag began to turn from wet green to wet black. Then he held the hose low down on the table and set up a swirling rinse under the bag straight into the drain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, scissors,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician took scissors from a cart and snipped a corner of the bag. Green paint flooded out. The acetone swirl caught it and it eddied sluggishly to the drain. It kept on coming, two minutes, three, five. The bag settled and drooped as it emptied. The room went quieter under the roar of the fan and the hiss of the hose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, the fun starts here,\" Stavely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed the hose to the technician and used a scalpel from the cart to slit the bag lengthwise from end to end. He made sideways cuts top and bottom and peeled the rubber back slowly. It lifted and sucked away from skin. He folded it back in two long flaps. Alison Lamarr\u0027s body was revealed, lying facedown, slimy and slick with paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely used the scalpel and slit the rubber around the feet, up alongside the legs, around the contours of the hips, up her flanks, close to her elbows, around her shoulders and head. He pulled away the strips of rubber until the bag was gone, all except for the front surface, which was trapped between the crust of paint and the steel of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crust of paint was top down to the table, because she was upside down. Its underside was bubbled and jellified. It looked like the surface of a distant alien planet. Stavely started rinsing its edges, where it was stuck to her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t that damage her?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shook his head. \"It\u0027s the same stuff as nail polish remover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skin turned greenish white where the paint washed off. Stavely used his gloved fingertips to peel the crust away. The strength in his hands moved the body. It lifted and fell, slackly. He pushed the hose underneath her, probing for stubborn adhesions. The technician stood next to him and lifted her legs. Stavely reached under them and cut the crust and the rubber together, peeling it away up to her thighs. The acetone ran continuously, rinsing the green stream into the drain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely moved up to the head. Placed the hose against the nape of her neck and watched as the chemical flooded her hair. Her hair was a nightmare. It was matted and crusted with paint. It had floated up around her face like a stiff tangled cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to have to cut it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded, somber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had nice hair,\" Harper said. Her voice was quiet under the noise from the fan. She half turned and backed off a step. Her shoulder touched Reacher\u0027s chest. She left it there a second longer than she needed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely took a fresh scalpel from the cart and traced through the hair, as close to the paint crust as he could get. He slid a powerful arm under the shoulders and lifted. The head came free, leaving hair matted into the crust like mangrove roots tangled into a swamp. He cut through the crust and the rubber and pulled another section free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you catch this guy,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the plan,\" Blake said back, still somber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roll her over,\" Stavely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved easily. The acetone mixed with the slick paint was like a lubricant against the dished steel of the table. She slid face up and lay there, ghastly under the lights. Her skin was greenish white and puckered, stained and blotched with paint. Her eyes were open, the lids rimed with green. She wore the last remaining square of the body bag stuck to her skin from her breasts to her thighs, like an old-fashioned bathing suit protecting her modesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely probed with his hand and found the metal implement under the rubber. He cut through the bag and wormed his fingers inside and pulled the object out in a grotesque parody of surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A screwdriver,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician washed it in an acetone bath and held it up. It was a quality tool with a heavy plastic handle and a handsome chromed-steel shaft with a crisp blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matches the others,\" Reacher said. \"From her kitchen drawer, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s got scratches on her face,\" Stavely said suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was using the hose, washing her face. Her left cheek had four parallel incisions running down from the eye to the jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she have these before?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Harper and Reacher said together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s that about?\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she right-handed?\" Stavely asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Poulton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarper nodded. \"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher closed his eyes and trawled back to her kitchen, watched her pouring coffee from the jug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right-handed,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" Stavely said. He was examining her arms and hands. \"Her right hand is larger than the left. The arm is heavier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake was leaning over, looking at the damaged face. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they\u0027re self-inflicted,\" Stavely said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely was circling the head of the table, looking for the best light. The wounds were swelled by the paint, raw and open. Green, where they should have been red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be sure,\" he said. \"You know that. But probability suggests it. If the guy did them, what are the chances he would have put them in the only place she could have put them herself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He made her do it,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how. But he makes them do a hell of a lot. I think he makes them put the paint in the tub themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The screwdriver. It\u0027s to get the lids off with. The scratches were an afterthought. If he\u0027d been thinking about the scratches, he\u0027d have made her get a knife from the kitchen instead of the screwdriver. Or as well as the screwdriver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake stared at the wall. \"Where are the cans right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Materials Analysis,\" Poulton said. \"Right here. They\u0027re examining them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So take the screwdriver over there. See if there are any marks that match.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician put the screwdriver in a clear plastic evidence bag and Poulton shrugged off his gown and kicked off his overshoes and hurried out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" Blake said. \"Why make her scratch herself like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anger?\" Reacher said. \"Punishment? Humiliation? I always wondered why he wasn\u0027t more violent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These wounds are very shallow,\" Stavely said. \"I guess they bled a little, but they didn\u0027t hurt much. The depth is absolutely consistent, all the way down each of them. So she wasn\u0027t flinching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe ritual,\" Blake said. \"Symbolic, somehow. Four parallel lines mean anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head. \"Not to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did he kill her?\" Blake asked. \"That\u0027s what we need to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he stabbed her with the screwdriver,\" Harper said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sign of it,\" Stavely said. \"No puncture wounds visible anyplace that would kill a person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the final section of the body bag peeled back and was washing paint away from her midsection, probing with his gloved fingers under the acetone jet. The technician lifted the rubber square away and then she lay naked under the lights, collapsed and limp and utterly lifeless. Reacher stared at her and remembered the bright vivacious woman who had smiled with her eyes and radiated energy like a tiny sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it possible you can kill somebody and a pathologist can\u0027t tell how?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this pathologist,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut off the acetone stream and let the hose retract into its reel on the ceiling. Stepped back and turned the ventilation fan back to normal. The room turned quiet again. The body lay on the table, as clean as it was ever going to get. The pores and folds of skin were stained green and the skin itself was lumpy and white like something that lives at the bottom of the sea. The hair was spiky with residue, roughly hacked around the scalp, framing the dead face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fundamentally two ways to kill a person,\" Stavely said. \"Either you stop the heart, or you stop the flow of oxygen to the brain. But to do either thing without leaving a mark is a hell of a trick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you stop the heart?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Short of firing a bullet through it?\" Stavely said. \"Air embolism would be the best way. A big bubble of air, injected straight into the bloodstream. Blood circulates surprisingly fast, and an air bubble hits the inside of the heart like a stone, like a tiny internal bullet. The shock is usually fatal. That\u0027s why nurses hold up the hypodermic and squirt a little liquid out and flick it with their nail. To be sure there\u0027s no air in the mix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d see the hypodermic hole, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, maybe not. And definitely not on a corpse like this. The skin is ruined by the paint. But you\u0027d see the internal damage to the heart. I\u0027ll check, of course, when I open her up, but I\u0027m not optimistic. They didn\u0027t find anything like that on the other three. And we\u0027re assuming a consistent MO here, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded. \"What about oxygen to the brain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suffocation, in layman\u0027s terms,\" Stavely said. \"It can be done without leaving much evidence. Classic thing would be an old person, wasted and weak, gets a pillow held over the face. Pretty much impossible to prove. But this isn\u0027t an old person. She\u0027s young and strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. He had suffocated a man once, way back in his long and checkered career. He had needed all of his considerable strength to hold the guy\u0027s face down on a mattress, while he bucked and thrashed and died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d have fought like crazy,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I think she would,\" Stavely said. \"And look at her. Look at her musculature. She wouldn\u0027t have been a pushover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher looked away instead. The room was silent and cold. The awful green paint was everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she was alive,\" he said. \"When she went in the tub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reasoning?\" Stavely asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no mess,\" Reacher said. \"None at all. The bathroom was immaculate. What was she, one twenty? One twenty-five? Hell of a dead weight to heave into the tub without making some kind of a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he put the paint in afterward,\" Blake said. \"On top of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head. \"It would have floated her up, surely. It looks like she slipped right in there, like you get into a bath. You know, you point your toe, you get under the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d need to experiment,\" Stavely said. \"But I think I agree she died in the tub. The first three, there was no evidence they were touched at all. No bruising, no abrasions, no nothing. No postmortem damage either. Moving a corpse usually damages the ligaments in the joints, because there\u0027s no muscle tension there to protect them. At this point, my guess is they did whatever they did strictly under their own power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except kill themselves,\" Harper said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely nodded. \"Suicide in bathtubs is pretty much limited to drowning while drunk or drugged, or opening your veins into warm water. Obviously, this isn\u0027t suicide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they weren\u0027t drowned,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely nodded again. \"The first three weren\u0027t. No fluid of any kind in the lungs. We\u0027ll know about this one soon as she\u0027s opened up, but I would bet against it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how the hell did he do it?\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely stared down at the body, something like compassion in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now, I have no idea,\" he said. \"Give me a couple of hours, maybe three, I might find something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No idea at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I had a theory,\" Stavely said. \"Based on what I read about the other three. Problem is, now I think the theory is absurd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What theory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStavely shook his head. \"Later, OK? And you need to leave now. I\u0027m going to cut her up, and I don\u0027t want you here for that. She needs privacy, time like this.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-blind-jack-reacher-4/page-18.html","bookId":2342,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:26 AM"}
