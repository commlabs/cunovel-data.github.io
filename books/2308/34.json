To an alien. She was carrying his child.No matter that she loved him with all her heart and soul, she knew her life would be forever changed from this night on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to glance at him, only to find him watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not getting cold feet, are you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance.\" Not a chance in a billion, he mused as he returned his attention to the road. He\u0027d waited two centuries for this woman. \"I just want you to be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single light glowed from within the church when they drove up. There were no other cars in the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait here,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting out of thecar, he walked around the building to the back door. He had calledthe minister and let him know they were coming. Opening the door, he stepped inside a small room located to the left of the pulpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving silently, he peered into the chapel. The minister, Keith Anderson, was sitting on the front pew, Bible in hand. There was no one else in the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing out the way he came, Alex returned to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara opened the door. \"Is everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As far as I can tell, Keith\u0027s alone in there.\" He smiled at Kara and offered his hand. \"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready.\" Picking up the package that held her dress, Kara took Alex\u0027s hand and slid out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson stood up when they entered the church. He smiled at Kara. \"You may change in there,\" he said, pointing to the room Alex had recently occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" She smiled at Alex. \"I\u0027ll only be a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded, then glanced around the church again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re quite alone,\" Anderson said. He sat down, gesturing for Alex to join him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really appreciate this,\" Alex said, sitting down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything I can do to help?\" the minister asked. \"Anyone I can call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your fiancee looks familiar. She\u0027s not a movie star or anything, is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name seems familiar, too. Kara Crawford.\" Anderson frowned. \"I know I\u0027ve heard that name somewhere recently.\" He grinned. \"She didn\u0027t win the lottery, did she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex laughed. \"No, nothing like that. So, how did you like my last book?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent, as always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always seem surprised that I enjoy your books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it just seems odd somehow, a man of the cloth reading about vampires and werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are more things on heaven and earth\u0027,\" Anderson quoted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded. \"Indeed, there are,\" he mused wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be arrogant indeed for us to believe that we\u0027re the only beings in the entire galaxy. For all I know, there might be vampires on other planets. Who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who, indeed,\" Alex agreed, and then stood, his breath catching in his throat, as Kara stepped into the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was beautiful, he thought, more beautiful than anything he had ever seen. She wore a simple dress made of white silk, and white heels. Her hair fell loose around her shoulders, adorned with a single white rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kara, you\u0027re lovely,\" he murmured as he went to stand beside her. \"So lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. So are you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, he had never looked more handsome than he did now. The black suit fit as though it had been custom-made. The color complemented his dark hair and eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready?\" Anderson asked. \"Since this is to be a rather unorthodox ceremony, I\u0027ve dispensed with the need for witnesses, if that\u0027s all right with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well.\" He looked at Kara. \"You understand that without a license, this is simply a religious ceremony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, if you\u0027ll take Kara\u0027s right hand in yours, we\u0027ll begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to face Kara, Alex took her hand in his. He could feel her trembling. He gazed into her eyes and knew, without searching her mind, what she was thinking. He could feel the love radiating from her, the trust. Joy mingled with excitement. He knew what she was feeling because he was feeling the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage is a holy ordinance, instituted of God,\" the minister said. \"It is not to be entered into lightly, or foolishly, or without sincere intent.\" He looked at Alex. \"From this day forward, there is to be no other woman in your life, only Kara.\" His gaze shifted to Kara\u0027s face. \"And for you, there is to be no other man, only Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minister paused, giving them time to ponder his words. And then he went on. \"We are met here this day to join Kara Elizabeth Crawfordin marriage to Alexander J. Claybourne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kara, will you have this man as your lawfully wedded husband? Will you love him and honor him, sustain him in sickness and in health, and keep yourself only unto him so long as you both shall live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara met Alexander\u0027s eyes, gave his hand a squeeze, as she said, \"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, Alexander, will you have this woman as your lawfully wedded wife? Will you love her and honor her, sustain her in sickness and in health, and keep yourself only unto her so long as you both shall live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex took a deep, calming breath, wondering if he would be able to speak. Two hundred years he had waited for this moment. \"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you a ring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Reaching into his pocket, Alex withdrew a plain gold band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may place the ring on her finger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now it was Alex who trembled as he slid the ring onto Kara\u0027s finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Repeat after me. With this ring, I thee wed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With this ring, I thee wed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson glanced at Kara, and she shook her head. She\u0027d had no chance to buy Alex a ring and couldn\u0027t help wondering when he\u0027d found the opportunity to buy one for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, by the power vested in me, I pronounce that you are now man and wife.\" The minister smiled at Alex. \"You may kiss the bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart pounding with happiness, Alex drew Kara into his arms. \"I love you,\" he murmured. \"I shall love you as long as I live.\" And then, with all the tenderness at his command, he kissed her. And kissed her. And kissed her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you both all the happiness in the world,\" the minister said. He shook Alex\u0027s hand, then gave Kara a kiss on the cheek. \"I hope whatever trouble you two are in will be swiftly settled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Kara said, blinking back her tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded as he shook the minister\u0027s hand. \"Thank you.\" Reaching into his pocket, he withdrew a hundred dollar bill and pressed it into the minister\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t take this,\" Anderson said. \"It\u0027s too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t enough,\" Alex said as he wrapped his arm around Kara\u0027s shoulders. \"Believe me, it isn\u0027t nearly enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall accept it on behalf of the church,\" Anderson said. \"And I shall remember you daily in my prayers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another farewell, Kara and Alex left the church. Kara couldn\u0027t stop smiling. She was Alexander\u0027s wife. Mrs. Claybourne. Happiness bubbled upinside her like champagne bubbles. Married to Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped her into the car, then drew her into his arms and kissed her again. \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" he whispered. \"You\u0027re mine now. Truly mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always been yours,\" she replied solemnly. \"Even when I didn\u0027t know you, I think I was waiting for you to find me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her again, a deep kiss filled with promise, and then he switched on the engine and drove toward the bank. It was time to meet Hamblin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch paced back and forth in front of the bank, his gaze constantly shifting up and down the street. He\u0027d been a fool to agree to this, a fool to believe Claybourne would keep his word. The man_hell, he wasn\u0027t a man at all_had probably lit out for parts unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at his watch. Five to ten. How many more nights was he going to waste his time by coming here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of headlights drew his attention. Squinting, one hand fisted around the gun inside his coat, he stepped intothe shadows as the car drew up to the curb. If he ever got his hands on the money Claybourne promised him, he was going to get out of this business. It was too hard on the nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blew out a sigh of relief as Claybourne stepped out of the car.\" \u0027Bout time you showed up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I would.\" Alex reached into his shirt pocket and withdrew an envelope. \"I hope a check is satisfactory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d prefer cash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you would, but it\u0027s difficult for me to get to the bank during working hours. Don\u0027t worry,\" Alex said, offering him the envelope, \"this check\u0027s as good as the last one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It better be.\" Mitch took the envelope, opened it, and glanced at the check. One hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Just thinking about that much money, combined with the other hundred thousand in his savings account, made his heart race with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better get out of town,\" Alex suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way,\" Mitch said with a grin. \"Thanks for everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Alex said wryly. \"I hope you enjoy the Porsche.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been a pleasure knowing you, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Profitable, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch laughed. \"You got that right. So long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex grunted softly as he watched the kid slide into the Porsche and drive away. He\u0027d miss the car, he mused, but what the heck, he could buy another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he thought of Kara, waiting for him around the corner, and he forgot about Mitch and Barrett, forgot everything but the fact that this was his wedding night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive up the mountain seemed to take forever. Kara felt a glow in her heart each time she looked at Alexander. Her husband. For better or worse . . . She felt a twinge of unease as she wondered if things would ever be better, if they would ever be free of Barrett, able to get on with their lives without always looking over their shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not having regrets already, are you?\" Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\" She scooted closer, pressing herself against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worrying about Barrett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I can\u0027t help it. Do youthink he\u0027ll ever give up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I hope so.\" Bending toward her, his gaze on the road, he kissed her cheek. \"I love you, natayah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words, the husky tremor in his voice, chased all thoughts of Dale Barrett from her mind. Placing her hand on Alex\u0027s knee, she ran her fingertips up and down his hard-muscled thigh. \"Can\u0027t you drive a little faster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep that up, and I\u0027ll probably run us off the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" She let her hand caress his inner thigh, smiled when his foot pressed down on the accelerator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vixen,\" he growled. Wrapping his arm around her shoulders, he drew her even closer, until there was no space between them at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the cavern a short time later. Switching off the engine, Alex alighted from the car and walked around to open the door for Kara. Taking her hand, he helped her out, then swung her into his arms and carried her to the entrance of the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re home, Mrs. Claybourne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Claybourne,\" she repeated. \"It sounds wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched the rock face and the portal opened. With ease, he carried her inside, then paused in the corridor, gazing down into her eyes. \"Did I tell you how beautiful you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but tell me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are beautiful, Kara Claybourne. The most beautiful woman I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Alex Claybourne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her as he carried her into the kitchen, where he plucked a bottle of champagne from the shelf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I tell you how much I love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" he said as he carried her down the corridor toward the bedroom. \"I shall tell you that each day of our life together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I shall say it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bedroom, he placed the champagne on the table, then lowered Kara slowly to the floor, delighting in the warmth of her body sliding against his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try to make you happy, Kara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already make me happy.\" Gazing up at him, a smile curving her lips, she slid his jacket off his shoulders and tossed it on a chair, \"So happy.\" She began to unbutton his shirt, pleased that he wore nothing underneath as her fingers encountered warm male flesh. He trembled at her touch, and her smile grew wider. It gave her a feeling of power, of pleasure, to know that her touch excited him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTugging his shirttail from his trousers, she slipped the shirt from his shoulders and tossed it after his suit coat, then scattered kisses over his chest, laughing softly as he sucked in a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not playing fair,\" he said, and she felt his hands at her back, unzipping her dress, sliding it down her arms until it pooled at her feet. He removed her camisole, then cupped her breasts in his hands. \"Beautiful,\" he murmured. \"So beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly it was a contest to see who could finish undressing who first. It ended a tie, with both of them laughing breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then their eyes met and the laughter died in their throats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kara.\" Whispering her name, he swept her into his arms and carried her to the bed, his lips dropping kisses on her eyelids, the tip of her nose, her cheeks, her brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweeping the covers aside with one hand, he placed her on the bed and sank down beside her, hardly able to believe that she was his now, truly his. Forever his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Mr. Claybourne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll live happily ever after, won\u0027t we? Just like in the fairy tales?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Like Beauty and the Beast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Like Snow White and the Prince.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded. \"A good comparison, for you are truly the fairest of them all.\" She cupped his face in her hands and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he argued softly, his hands lightly caressing her, \"you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrapped her arms around his neck and drew him down until his body covered hers. \"Kiss me, my prince. Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wish is my command, princess,\" he replied, and slanting his mouth over hers, he kissed her with all the love and passion in his soul, kissed her until her toes curled and her heart sang a new song. Kissed her so she would never doubt his love, or his devotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe worshipped her silently with his hands and his lips, stoking the fires of desire, until she drew him inside her, surrounding him with velvet heat. And two became one, and that one soared upward, reaching for the heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara sobbed his name as heat flowed through her, bathing her in a warm glow, like sunshine on a summer day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for the first time in more thantwo hundred years, Alexander Claybourne welcomed the sun, felt its heat explode within him as he cried Kara\u0027s name, his body convulsing with pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocked in each other\u0027s arms, they fell asleep.
