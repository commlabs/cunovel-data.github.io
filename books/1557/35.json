I asked for my lawyer. The interview is over. The end. El fin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say so. Get me a phone, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re entitled to call an attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s who I plan on calling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren thought about this. She didn\u0027t want Cingle warning Hunter. \"You mind if I dial the number for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suit yourself,\" Cingle said. \"I\u0027ll need a phone book though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know your attorney\u0027s home number by heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took another five minutes. Loren dialed and handed her the phone. She could always check the call log later, make sure she didn\u0027t sneak another call in. She turned off the microphone and moved into the monitoring room. Cingle, wise in the ways of the camera, turned her back to the lens, just in case someone could read lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren started working the phones. First she tried the cop sitting in front of Hunter\u0027s residence in Irvington. He informed her that Matt and Olivia Hunter still weren\u0027t home. Loren knew that this was not good news. She started a quiet search because she didn\u0027t want to sound off too many alarm bells yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d need to get a subpoena for both Matt and Olivia Hunter\u0027s recent credit card transactions- run it through TRW. If they were on the run, they\u0027d probably need to access money at an ATM or check into a motel- something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the monitoring screen, Loren could see that Cingle had finished her phone call. Cingle held the phone up to the camera and signaled for someone to hit the audio switch. Loren complied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle said, \"My attorney is on his way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit tight then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren switched off the intercom. She leaned back. Exhaustion was starting to set in. She was nearing the wall. She needed a little shut-eye or her brain would start going hazy. Cingle\u0027s attorney wouldn\u0027t be here for at least half an hour. She crossed her arms, threw her feet on the desk, and closed her eyes, hoping to doze for just a few minutes, just until the attorney showed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone rang. She startled up and put it to her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Ed Steinberg. \"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The private eye talking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. She\u0027s waiting for her lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her wait then. Let them both wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, what\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The feds, Loren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re meeting them in an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joan Thurston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made her drop her feet to the floor. \"The U.S. attorney herself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the flesh. And some hotshot SAC from Nevada. We\u0027re meeting them at Thurston\u0027s office to discuss your phony nun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren checked the clock. \"It\u0027s four in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mistress of the Obvious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean, I\u0027m surprised you\u0027d call the U.S. attorney that early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t have to,\" Steinberg said. \"She called me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ed Steinberg arrived, he looked at Loren and shook his head. Her hair was frizzed out from the humidity. The sweat had dried, but she was still a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look,\" Steinberg said, \"like something I once left in the bottom of my gym locker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flattering, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned at her with both his hands. \"Can\u0027t you- I don\u0027t know- do something about your hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, this a singles\u0027 club now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evidently not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ride from the county prosecutor\u0027s office to the U.S. attorney\u0027s was three blocks. They entered via the well-guarded private underground garage. There were very few cars at this hour. The elevator dropped them on the seventh floor. The stencil on the glass read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUNITED STATES ATTORNEY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOAN THURSTON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUNITED STATES ATTORNEY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg pointed at the top line and then the bottom line. \"Kinda redundant, no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the power of the office, the waiting room was done up in Early American Dentist. The carpet was threadbare. The furniture managed to be neither fashionable nor functional. There were a dozen different issues of Sports Illustrated on the table and nothing else. The walls seemed to plead for a paint job. They were stained and barren, except for the photographs of past U.S. attorneys, a remarkable lesson in what not to wear and how not to pose when taking a picture for posterity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo receptionist was sitting guard at this hour. They knocked and were buzzed into the inner sanctum. It was much nicer in here, a totally different feel and look, like they\u0027d stepped through a wall into Diagon Alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned right and headed toward the corner office. A man- an enormous man- stood in the corridor. He had a buzz cut and a frown. He stood perfectly still and looked as if he could double as a squash court. Steinberg stuck out his hand. \"Hi, I\u0027m Ed Steinberg, county prosecutor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquash Court took the hand but he did not look happy about it. \"Cal Dollinger, FBI. They\u0027re waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the end of that conversation. Cal Dollinger stayed where he was. They turned the corner. Joan Thurston greeted them at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the early hour U.S. Attorney Joan Thurston looked resplendent in a charcoal gray business suit that seemed to have been tailored by the gods. Thurston was mid-forties and, in Loren\u0027s view, excessively attractive. She had auburn hair, broad shoulders, tapered waist. She had two sons in their early teens. Her husband worked at Morgan Stanley in Manhattan. They lived in ritzy Short Hills with a vacation home on Long Beach Island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short: Joan Thurston was what Loren wanted to be when she grew up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning,\" Thurston said, which felt weird because outside her windows, the skies were still night black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook Loren\u0027s hand firmly, meeting her eye and softening it with a smile. She gave Steinberg a hug and buss on the cheek. \"I\u0027d like you to meet Adam Yates. He\u0027s the FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Las Vegas office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam Yates wore freshly ironed khakis and a bright pink shirt that might be the norm on Worth Avenue in Palm Beach but not Broad Street in Newark. He wore loafers without socks, his legs too casually crossed. He had that whole Old World, came-over-on-the-Mayflower thing going on, what with the receding ash-blond hair, the high cheekbones, the eyes so ice blue she wondered if he was wearing contacts. His cologne smelled like freshly cut grass. Loren liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please sit,\" Thurston said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurston had a spacious corner office. On one wall- the least noticeable wall- was a smattering of diplomas and awards. They were put out of the way, almost as if to say, \"Hey, I need to put them up but I don\u0027t like to put on airs.\" The rest of the office was personal. She had photographs of her children and her husband, all of whom- big surprise- were gorgeous. Even the dog. There was a white guitar autographed by Bruce Springsteen hanging behind her head. On the bookshelf were the usual assortment of law books, along with autographed baseballs and footballs. All the local teams, of course. Joan Thurston had no photographs of herself, no news clippings, no Lucite-block awards in view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren sat down carefully. She used to tuck her heels underneath her to gain a few inches, but she\u0027d read a business self-help book about how women sabotage their own careers, and one of the rules said that a woman must never sit on her heels. It looked unprofessional. Usually Loren forgot that rule. Something about seeing Joan Thurston brought it all back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurston came around and half-sat/half-leaned against the front lip of her desk. She folded her arms and focused her attention on Loren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what you have so far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren glanced at Ed Steinberg. He nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have three dead people. The first, well, we don\u0027t know her real name. That\u0027s why we\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This would be Sister Mary Rose?\" Thurston asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you stumble across her case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that the death was originally ruled of natural causes,\" Thurston said. \"What made you look into it deeper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg took that one. \"The Mother Superior personally asked Investigator Muse to look into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loren is an alum of St. Margaret\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that, but what made this Mother Superior... what\u0027s her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother Katherine,\" Loren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother Katherine, right. What made her suspect foul play in the first place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure she suspected anything,\" Loren said. \"When Mother Katherine found Sister Mary Rose\u0027s body, she tried to resuscitate her with chest compressions and discovered that she had breast implants. That didn\u0027t mesh with Sister Mary Rose\u0027s history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she came to you to find out what was up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurston nodded. \"And the second body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Max Darrow. He was a retired Vegas police officer now residing in the Reno area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked at Adam Yates. He stayed still. So, Loren thought, this would be the game. They\u0027d roll over and maybe, just maybe, the feds would award them with a tiny doggie treat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurston asked, \"How did you connect Max Darrow to Sister Mary Rose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fingerprints,\" Loren said. \"Darrow\u0027s fingerprints were found in the nun\u0027s private quarters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darrow was found dead in his car. Shot twice at point-blank range. His pants were down around his ankles. We think the killer tried to make it look like a prostitute rolled him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, we can go into the details later,\" Thurston said. \"Tell us how Max Darrow connects to the third victim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The third victim is Charles Talley. For one thing, both Talley and Darrow lived in the Reno area. For another, they were both staying at the Howard Johnson\u0027s near Newark Airport. Their rooms were next door to one another\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s where you found Talley\u0027s body? At the hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me. A night custodian found him in the stairwell. He\u0027d been shot twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same as Darrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Similar, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time of death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still being worked on, but sometime tonight between eleven P.M. and two A.M. The stairwell had no air-conditioning, no windows, no ventilation- it had to be over a hundred degrees in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why Investigator Muse here looks like that,\" Steinberg said, gesturing with both hands as if he were presenting a soiled prize. \"From being in that sauna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren shot him a look and tried to hold back from smoothing her hair. \"The heat makes it more difficult for our ME to pinpoint a better time frame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else?\" Thurston asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren hesitated. Her guess was that Thurston and Yates probably knew- or at least, could readily learn- most of what she\u0027d already told them. So far, this had all been about getting up to speed. All that she really had left- all that she\u0027d have that they probably wouldn\u0027t- was Matt Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg held up a hand. \"May I make a suggestion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurston turned toward him. \"Of course, Ed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to have any jurisdictional hassles here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither do we.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why don\u0027t we just pool our resources on this one? Totally open communication both ways. We tell you what we know, you tell us what you know. No holding back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurston glanced at Yates. Adam Yates cleared his throat and said, \"We have no problem with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know the real identity of Sister Mary Rose?\" Steinberg asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates nodded. \"We do, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren waited. Yates took his time. He uncrossed his legs, tugged at the front of his shirt as if trying to get some air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your nun- well, she\u0027s not even close to being a nun, believe me- was one Emma Lemay,\" Yates said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name meant nothing to Loren. She looked at Steinberg. He, too, had no reaction to the name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates continued: \"Emma Lemay and her partner, a cretin named Clyde Rangor, disappeared from Vegas ten years ago. We did a fairly massive search for both of them but turned up nothing. One day they were there, the next- poof- they were both gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg asked, \"How did you know we found Lemay\u0027s body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lockwood Corporation had her silicone implants marked. The NCIC now puts everything they can into the national database. Fingerprints, you know about. DNA and descriptions, those have been in there for a while. But now we\u0027re working on a national database for medical devices- any kind of joint replacements, surgical implants, colostomy bags, pacemakers- mostly to help identify Jane and John Does. You get the model number, you put it in the system. It\u0027s new, pretty experimental. We\u0027re trying it out on a select few that we\u0027re very anxious to locate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this Emma Lemay,\" Loren said. \"You were anxious to locate her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates had a good smile. \"Oh, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Loren asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten years ago Lemay and Rangor agreed to turn on a nasty perennial RICO top-ten asswipe, guy named Tom \u0027Comb-Over\u0027 Busher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Comb-Over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what they call him, though not to his face. Been his nickname for years, actually. Used to be, he had this comb-over going. You know, when he started going bald. But it just kept growing. So now he kinda twirls it around and around, looks like he stuck a cinnamon swirl on top of his head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates chuckled. Nobody else did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurston said, \"You were talking about Lemay and Rangor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. So anyway, we nailed Lemay and Rangor on pretty serious drug charges, pressed them like hell, and for the first time, we got someone on the inside to flip. Clyde Rangor and Comb-Over are cousins. They started working with us, taping conversations, gathering evidence. And then...\" Yates shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you think happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The most likely scenario was that Comb-Over got wind of what was up and killed them. But we never really bought that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because there was evidence- lots of it, actually- that Comb-Over was searching for Lemay and Rangor too. Even harder than we were. For a while it was like the race was on, you know, who\u0027d find them first. When they never turned up, well, we figured we lost the race.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This Comb-Over. He still on the streets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about Clyde Rangor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no idea where he is.\" Yates shifted in his chair. \"Clyde Rangor was a major whack-job. He managed a couple of strip clubs for Comb-Over and had a rep for enjoying the occasional, uh, rough session.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How rough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates folded his hands and placed them in his lap. \"We suspect that some of the girls didn\u0027t recover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you say didn\u0027t recover-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One ended up in a catatonic state. One- the last one, we think- ended up dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren made a face. \"And you were cutting a deal with this guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, you want us to find someone nicer?\" Yates snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I really need to explain to you how trading up works, Investigator Muse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg stepped in. \"Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to imply...\" Loren bit back, her face reddening, upset with herself for sounding so amateurish. \"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else is there? We don\u0027t know where Clyde Rangor is, but we believe that he can still provide valuable information, maybe help us take Comb-Over down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about Charles Talley and Detective Max Darrow? Any idea how they fit in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charles Talley is a thug with a record for brutality. He handled some of the girls in the clubs, made sure they kept in line, didn\u0027t steal much, shared their, uh, tips with the house. Last we heard he was working for a dump in Reno called the Eager Beaver. Our best guess is, Talley was hired to kill Emma Lemay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By this Comb-Over guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Our theory is that somehow Comb-Over found out that Emma Lemay was pretending to be this Sister Mary Rose. He sent Talley here to kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about Max Darrow?\" Loren asked. \"We know he was in Lemay\u0027s quarters. What was his role?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates uncrossed his legs and sat up. \"For one thing, we think Darrow, though a fairly solid cop, might have been crooked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice drifted off. He cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And for another,\" Loren prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates took a deep breath. \"Well, Max Darrow...\" He looked at Thurston. She didn\u0027t nod, didn\u0027t move, but Loren got the impression that, as she had done with Steinberg, Yates was looking for an okay. \"Let\u0027s just say that Max Darrow is connected into this case in another way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited. Several seconds passed. Loren finally said, \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates rubbed his face with both hands, suddenly looking exhausted. \"I mentioned before that Clyde Rangor was into rough trade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that we think he killed his last victim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The victim was a small-time stripper and probable hooker, named... hold on, I have it here...\"- Yates pulled a small leather notepad from his back pocket, licked his finger, flipped through the pages-\"named Candace Potter, aka Candi Cane.\" He snapped the notebook shut. \"Emma Lemay and Clyde Rangor disappeared soon after her body was found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how does that fit in with Darrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Max Darrow was the homicide investigator in charge of the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a second,\" Ed Steinberg began. \"So this Clyde Rangor murders a stripper. Darrow catches the case. A few days later, Rangor and his girlfriend Lemay vanish. And now, what, ten years later, we get Darrow\u0027s fingerprints at Emma Lemay\u0027s murder scene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That pretty much sums it up, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more silence. Loren tried to digest this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s the important thing,\" Yates continued, leaning forward. \"If Emma Lemay still had materials pertinent to this case- or if she left information on the whereabouts of Clyde Rangor- we believe that Investigator Muse is in the best position to find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates turned toward her. \"You have a relationship with her colleagues. Lemay lived with the same group of nuns for seven years now. The Mother Superior clearly trusts you. What we need you to concentrate on is that angle- in finding out what Lemay knew or what she had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg looked at Loren and shrugged. Joan Thurston moved around her desk. She opened a mini-fridge. \"Anybody want a drink?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t reply. Thurston shrugged, grabbed a bottle, began to shake it. \"How about you, Adam? You want something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tossed him a bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ed? Loren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both shook their heads. Joan Thurston twisted off the cap and took a deep sip. She moved back in front of her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, time to stop the dance,\" Thurston said. \"What else have you learned, Loren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren. Already calling her Loren. Again she checked with Steinberg. Again he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We found several connections between all of this and an ex-con named Matt Hunter,\" Loren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurston\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Why does that name ring a bell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s local, from Livingston. His case made the papers years back. He got into a fight at a college party-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right, I remember,\" Thurston interrupted. \"I knew his brother Bernie. Good lawyer, died much too young. I think Bernie got him a job at Carter Sturgis when he got out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt Hunter still works there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s involved in this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are connections.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told them about the phone call from St. Margaret\u0027s to Marsha Hunter\u0027s residence. They did not seem all that impressed. When Loren started filling them in on what she\u0027d learned this very night- that Matt Hunter had, in all likelihood, gotten into a fight with Charles Talley at the Howard Johnson\u0027s- they sat up. For the first time Yates started jotting notes in the leather pad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finished, Thurston asked, \"So what do you make of it, Loren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truth? I don\u0027t have a clue yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should look at this guy Hunter\u0027s time in prison,\" Yates said. \"We know Talley was in the system too. Maybe they met along the way. Or maybe Hunter somehow got involved with Comb-Over\u0027s people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Thurston said. \"Could be that Hunter is the one cleaning up the loose ends for Comb-Over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren kept quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t agree, Loren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This may sound hopelessly naive, but I don\u0027t think Matt Hunter is working as some kind of hit man. He has a record, yes, but that\u0027s from a fight at a frat party fifteen years ago. He had no priors and has been clean ever since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not tell him that they\u0027d gone to school together or that her \"gut\" didn\u0027t like it. When other investigators used that rationale, Loren wanted to gag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how do you explain Hunter\u0027s involvement?\" Thurston asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It might be a more personal thing. According to the front-desk guy, his wife was staying at the hotel without him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it\u0027s a lovers\u0027 quarrel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThurston looked doubtful. \"Either way, we all agree that Matt Hunter is involved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg said, \"Definitely.\" Yates nodded hard. Loren stayed still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And right now,\" Thurston continued, \"we have more than enough to arrest and indict. We have the fight, the call, all that. We\u0027ll get DNA soon linking him to the dead man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren hesitated. Ed Steinberg did not. \"We got enough to arrest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And with Hunter\u0027s record, we can probably get a no-bail situation. We can put him in the system and keep him there for a little while, right, Ed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d bet on it, yeah,\" Steinberg said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pick him up then,\" Joan Thurston said. \"Let\u0027s get Hunter\u0027s ass back behind bars pronto.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-35.html","bookId":1557,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM"}
