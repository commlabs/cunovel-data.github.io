He saw a C on a seducer being whipped by demons … another R on a thief perpetually bitten by snakes … an A on a corrupt politician submerged in a boiling lake of tar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These letters,” Langdon said with certainty, “are definitely not part of Botticelli’s original. This image has been digitally edited.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned his gaze to the uppermost ditch of the Malebolge and began reading the letters downward, through each of the ten ditches, from top to bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC … A … T … R … O … V … A … C … E … R\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Catrovacer?” Langdon said. “Is this Italian?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna shook her head. “Not Latin either. I don’t recognize it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A … signature, maybe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Catrovacer?” She looked doubtful. “Doesn’t sound like a name to me. But look over there.” She pointed to one of the many characters in the third ditch of the Malebolge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Langdon’s eyes found the figure, he instantly felt a chill. Among the crowd of sinners in the third ditch was an iconic image from the Middle Ages—a cloaked man in a mask with a long, birdlike beak and dead eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plague mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a plague doctor in Botticelli’s original?” Sienna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely not. That figure has been added.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And did Botticelli sign his original?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon couldn’t recall, but as his eyes moved to the lower right-hand corner where a signature normally would be, he realized why she had asked. There was no signature, and yet barely visible along La Mappa’s dark brown border was a line of text in tiny block letters: la verità è visibile solo attraverso gli occhi della morte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon knew enough Italian to understand the gist. “ ‘The truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna nodded. “Bizarre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them stood in silence as the morbid image before them slowly began to fade. Dante’s Inferno, Langdon thought. Inspiring foreboding pieces of art since 1330.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon’s course on Dante always included an entire section on the illustrious artwork inspired by the Inferno. In addition to Botticelli’s celebrated Map of Hell, there was Rodin’s timeless sculpture of The Three Shades from The Gates of Hell … Stradanus’s illustration of Phlegyas paddling through submerged bodies on the river Styx … William Blake’s lustful sinners swirling through an eternal tempest … Bouguereau’s strangely erotic vision of Dante and Virgil watching two nude men locked in battle … Bayros’s tortured souls huddling beneath a hail-like torrent of scalding pellets and droplets of fire … Salvador Dalí’s eccentric series of watercolors and woodcuts … and Doré’s huge collection of black-and-white etchings depicting everything from the tunneled entrance to Hades … to winged Satan himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it seemed that Dante’s poetic vision of hell had not only influenced the most revered artists throughout history. It had also, apparently, inspired yet another individual—a twisted soul who had digitally altered Botticelli’s famous painting, adding ten letters, a plague doctor, and then signing it with an ominous phrase about seeing the truth through the eyes of death. This artist had then stored the image on a high-tech projector sheathed in a freakishly carved bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon couldn’t imagine who would have created such an artifact, and yet, at the moment, this issue seemed secondary to a far more unnerving question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy the hell am I carrying it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Sienna stood with Langdon in the kitchen and pondered her next move, the unexpected roar of a high-horsepower engine echoed up from the street below. It was followed by a staccato burst of screeching tires and car doors slamming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePuzzled, Sienna hurried to the window and peered outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black, unmarked van had skidded to a stop in the street below. Out of the van flowed a team of men, all dressed in black uniforms with circular green medallions on their left shoulders. They gripped automatic rifles and moved with fierce, military efficiency. Without hesitation, four soldiers dashed toward the entrance of the apartment building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna felt her blood go cold. “Robert!” she shouted. “I don’t know who they are, but they found us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown in the street, Agent Christoph Brüder shouted orders to his men as they rushed into the building. He was a powerfully built man whose military background had imbued him with an emotionless sense of duty and respect for the command chain. He knew his mission, and he knew the stakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe organization for whom he worked contained many divisions, but Brüder’s division—Surveillance and Response Support—was summoned only when a situation reached “crisis” status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his men disappeared into the apartment building, Brüder stood watch at the front door, pulling out his comm device and contacting the person in charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Brüder,” he said. “We’ve successfully tracked Langdon through his computer IP address. My team is moving in. I’ll alert you when we have him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh above Brüder, on the rooftop terrace of Pensione la Fiorentina, Vayentha stared down in horrified disbelief at the agents dashing into the apartment building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell are THEY doing here?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran a hand through her spiked hair, suddenly grasping the dire consequences of her botched assignment last night. With the single coo of a dove, everything had spiraled wildly out of control. What had begun as a simple mission … had now turned into a living nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the SRS team is here, then it’s all over for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVayentha desperately grabbed her Sectra Tiger XS communications device and called the provost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir,” she stammered. “The SRS team is here! Brüder’s men are swarming the apartment building across the street!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe awaited a response, but when it came, she heard only sharp clicks on the line, then an electronic voice, which calmly stated, “Disavowal protocol commencing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVayentha lowered the phone and looked at the screen just in time to see the comm device go dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the blood drained from her face, Vayentha forced herself to accept what was happening. The Consortium had just severed all ties with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo links. No association.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve been disavowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shock lasted only an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the fear set in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hurry, Robert!” Sienna urged. “Follow me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon’s thoughts were still consumed by grim images of Dante’s underworld as he charged out the door into the hall of the apartment building. Until this instant, Sienna Brooks had managed the morning’s substantial stress with a kind of detached poise, but now her calm demeanor had grown taut with an emotion Langdon had yet to see in her—true fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hallway, Sienna ran ahead, rushing past the elevator, which was already descending, no doubt summoned by the men now entering the lobby. She sprinted to the end of the hall and, without looking back, disappeared into the stairwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon followed close behind, skidding on the smooth soles of his borrowed loafers. The tiny projector in the breast pocket of his Brioni suit bounced against his chest as he ran. His mind flashed on the strange letters adorning the eighth ring of hell: CATROVACER. He pictured the plague mask and the strange signature: The truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon strained to connect these disparate elements, but at the moment nothing was making sense. When he finally came to a stop on the staircase landing, Sienna was there, listening intently. Langdon could hear footsteps pounding up the stairs from below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there another exit?” Langdon whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Follow me,” she said tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna had kept Langdon alive once already today, and so, with little choice but to trust the woman, Langdon took a deep breath and bounded down the stairs after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey descended one floor, and the sounds of approaching boots grew very close now, echoing only a floor or two below them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is she running directly into them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Langdon could protest, Sienna grabbed his hand and yanked him out of the stairwell along a deserted hallway of apartments—a long corridor of locked doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s nowhere to hide!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna flipped a light switch and a few bulbs went out, but the dim hallway did little to hide them. Sienna and Langdon were clearly visible here. The thundering footsteps were nearly upon them now, and Langdon knew their assailants would appear on the staircase at any moment, with a direct view down this hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need your jacket,” Sienna whispered as she yanked Langdon’s suit jacket off him. She then forced Langdon to crouch on his haunches behind her in a recessed doorframe. “Don’t move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is she doing? She’s in plain sight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers appeared on the staircase, rushing upward but stopping short when they saw Sienna in the darkened hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Per l’amore di Dio!” Sienna shouted at them, her tone scathing. “Cos’è questa confusione?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men squinted, clearly uncertain what they were looking at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna kept yelling at them. “Tanto chiasso a quest’ora!” So much noise at this hour!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon now saw that Sienna had draped his black jacket over her head and shoulders like an old woman’s shawl. She had hunched over, positioning herself to obstruct their view of Langdon crouched in the shadows, and now, utterly transformed, she hobbled one step toward them and screamed like a senile old woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the soldiers held up his hand, motioning for her to return to her apartment. “Signora! Rientri subito in casa!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna took another rickety step, shaking her fist angrily. “Avete svegliato mio marito, che è malato!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon listened in bewilderment. They woke up your ailing husband?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other soldier now raised his machine gun and aimed directly at her. “Ferma o sparo!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna stopped short, cursing them mercilessly as she hobbled backward, away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men hurried on, disappearing up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot quite Shakespearean acting, Langdon thought, but impressive. Apparently a background in drama could be a versatile weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna removed the jacket from her head and tossed it back to Langdon. “Okay, follow me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Langdon followed without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey descended to the landing above the lobby, where two more soldiers were just entering the elevator to go upstairs. On the street outside, another soldier stood watch beside the van, his black uniform stretched taut across his muscular body. In silence, Sienna and Langdon hurried downstairs toward the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe underground carport was dark and smelled of urine. Sienna jogged over to a corner packed with scooters and motorcycles. She stopped at a silver Trike—a three-wheeled moped contraption that looked like the ungainly offspring of an Italian Vespa and an adult tricycle. She ran her slender hand beneath the Trike’s front fender and removed a small magnetized case. Inside was a key, which she inserted, and revved the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, Langdon was seated behind her on the bike. Precariously perched on the small seat, Langdon groped at his sides, looking for handgrips or something to steady himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not the moment for modesty,” Sienna said, grabbing his hands and wrapping them around her slender waist. “You’ll want to hold on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon did exactly that as Sienna gunned the Trike up the exit ramp. The vehicle had more power than he would have imagined, and they nearly left the ground as they launched out of the garage, emerging into the early-morning light about fifty yards from the main entrance. The brawny soldier in front of the building turned at once to see Langdon and Sienna tearing away, their Trike letting out a high-pitched whine as she opened the throttle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerched on the back, Langdon peered back over his shoulder toward the soldier, who now raised his weapon and took careful aim. Langdon braced himself. A single shot rang out, ricocheting off the Trike’s back fender, barely missing the base of Langdon’s spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna made a hard left at an intersection, and Langdon felt himself sliding, fighting to keep his balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lean toward me!” she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon leaned forward, centering himself again as Sienna raced the Trike down a larger thoroughfare. They had driven a full block before Langdon began breathing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho the hell were those men?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna’s focus remained locked on the road ahead as she raced down the avenue, weaving in and out of the light morning traffic. Several pedestrians did double takes as they passed, apparently puzzled to see a six-foot man in a Brioni suit riding behind a slender woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon and Sienna had traveled three blocks and were approaching a major intersection when horns blared up ahead. A sleek black van rounded the corner on two wheels, fishtailing into the intersection, and then accelerating up the road directly toward them. The van was identical to the soldiers’ van back at the apartment building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna immediately swerved hard to her right and slammed on the brakes. Langdon’s chest pressed hard into her back as she skidded to a stop out of sight behind a parked delivery truck. She nestled the Trike up to the rear bumper of the truck and killed the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid they see us!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Langdon huddled low and waited … breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van roared past without hesitation, apparently never having seen them. As the vehicle sped by, however, Langdon caught a fleeting glimpse of someone inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the backseat, an attractive older woman was wedged between two soldiers like a captive. Her eyes sagged and her head bobbed as if she were delirious or maybe drugged. She wore an amulet and had long silver hair that fell in ringlets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Langdon’s throat clenched, and he thought he’d seen a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the woman from his visions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe provost stormed out of the control room and marched along the long starboard deck of The Mendacium, trying to gather his thoughts. What had just transpired at the Florence apartment building was unthinkable. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inferno-robert-langdon-4/page-9.html","bookId":2415,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:24 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:24 AM"}
