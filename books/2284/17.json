I’m going to call my buddy David back and ask him to get a team in there, okay? You’ll have to give David official permission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk nodded. “Anything that’ll help,” he said. He looked back at Abby. “It will help, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call him. That detective. Tell him I’ll sign anything he needs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk left the two of them, striding for the bar. He stopped and turned back. “You two just saw all that and don’t need a drink?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re coming,” Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Malachi. “Honestly, it can’t be Dirk. You figure someone’s kidnapping people, taking them on a pirate ship. With the women, he’s making them behave like captives—forcing them to have sex as if they’d been seized by pirates. And because he has a pirate ship, you’re thinking Dirk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “Abby, yes, obviously, I’m thinking Dirk. Helen worked for him, Helen is gone. And he runs a pirate ship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If someone is going to search the Black Swan, shouldn’t it be us?” Abby asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get permission from your friend,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby whirled around and ran, catching up with Dirk just before he got to the door. He seemed perplexed but told her she was welcome on the ship anytime, any day. He handed her his keys; the gate down at the dock where the Black Swan berthed would be locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran back to Malachi. “Let’s go!” She dashed by him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” he called after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Faster to walk than to find a parking place on the river. Come on!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only a matter of blocks to the marina. Abby used the key Dirk had given her to open the gate. She waited for Malachi, and tried not to remember how she’d seen the body here earlier. There was no crime scene tape; it wouldn’t have served much purpose. She assumed the techs had looked for anything they possibly could, considering that the body had floated in the river for a day or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi entered behind her. “Relock it,” he warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did. They hurried on down the dock. Malachi passed by her and jumped onto the deck of the Black Swan. The little gangplank that tourists used to board was on the ship, taken up at night to discourage anyone who might make it onto the dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi stretched out his hand. She hesitated only briefly and accepted it to join him on board the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDock lights lit up the main part of the forecastle and performance area. Abby hurried on to the restaurant area and the restrooms. Employee lockers were in an anteroom. She turned on lights as she went in and heard Malachi behind her, searching the snack stand and environs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found Helen’s locker, which was open. But on inspection of its contents yielded nothing except for a sweater, a makeup bag, a brush and Helen’s costume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated, Abby closed the locker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were open and she decided to search them, as well. She felt awkward—as if she were sticking her nose where she really had no right—but Blake Stewart and Jack Winston worked with Helen. They were friends, and Blake had been in love with Helen. It had to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut their lockers yielded nothing, either. There was a small costume and prop area next to them. She went through the swords and guns used by the players, touching each one. None was real. The blades were plastic, although they’d been artfully created to appear real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left the lockers, disappointed, and discovered that Malachi was no longer in the snack shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Malachi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Down in the magazine!” he called to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried to the below deck and found him by one of the hammocks against the inner hull, placed there for the use of the cast and crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe.” He handed her a folded pamphlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a tour map,” she said. “Actually, this particular map is printed and put out by a friend of mine. You might have met him at the Dragonslayer yesterday. I went to high school with him—he was a major player in our drama department and a huge history buff. He does ghost tours here in the city and they’re supposed to be some of the best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roger English,” Malachi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. You did meet him, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. His name is on the map. It’s advertising for his tours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you think Helen might have had it? The map, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “I do. Because this looks like a woman’s handwriting—small, neat, lots of curlicues. I know there’s a young woman working on the crew, but the probability that it’s Helen’s is high. And she’s marked something. Here.” He pointed at a location on the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me see it, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby took the map from him. It had real streets and real places, but they were sketched out cartoon-style. There was a checkmark on the map and in the border was written, “Meet here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby shook her head. “That isn’t any particular place, but there’s an old church nearby. It was deconsecrated years ago and was a restaurant and nightclub for a while. Right now, it’s just empty. A private restoration group bought it about a year ago, but they haven’t started working on it yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Interesting,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you thought people were being snatched on the river,” Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do believe the victims are being taken out to the river. But...we have nothing that tells us where they’re being taken from. They’re dying on it, yes—but how are they getting there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rupert Holloway was supposed to be meeting friends right here at the riverfront,” she reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but no one saw him here. Or, even if he was taken down here, it doesn’t mean the women were kidnapped on the river. Can we go there? You know this part of the city.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course we can go there. But that precise area is just the sidewalk,” Abby said. “Except that...well, I could talk to Roger. He knows Savannah even better than I do. Maybe he can see something that I’m not seeing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me more about Roger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said, he’s a friend from high school. I’m positive he’s not a suspect. If he were going to kill anyone, it would be over a prime role in a pirate movie or in an argument on the history of Savannah. Roger, well, I’ve known him all my life. And I can’t see him taking any...any physical trophies. He passed out at school when we were donating blood during an emergency blood drive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi’s phone rang, and he answered it. “David,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he went on, “we’re down in the magazine. Coming up. We’ll leave it to your fine crew now, my friend.” He ended the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Investigators are here. They can finish. I think we might have found something useful. He folded the map and put it in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not going to give it to the cops?” she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll tell David the location, and he can send a car to check it out. I say we leave the rest of this to the experts and head back. I might have a surprise for you,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, I’m not really in the mood for surprises. I have had the longest two days in history.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled slowly. Abby realized she was getting to like that smile; she was even coming to understand his strange ways. He could be unerringly polite, especially when someone else was acting like an idiot, and manage to get what he needed. He gave information out, but held on to what he felt he needed. Close to him, alone down in the magazine, she was aware of how attractive he was. Old-fashioned courtesy, combined with rugged masculinity, would make him appealing to most women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she was one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back. She tried to remind herself that he’d made a fool of her a few times, and yet...he’d seemed so puzzled that she’d felt that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll talk to David as we leave. Let’s get back to the Dragonslayer.” He looked at his watch. “It’s after nine now. I’m ready for that drink Dirk suggested. And I won’t be driving to my hotel. I can easily walk, but I won’t have to. I’m sure I can catch a ride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Malachi!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard his name shouted. He stepped past her and hurried up to the deck. As she followed him, he turned back for her, helping her make the hop-over to the dock. David was at the gate with a five-man crew of investigators, and they walked down to meet him, opening the gate to allow them all entrance before handing him the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything?” David asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No blood or guts,” Malachi said, waiting until David’s team went by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had, he said, “We found a map. May or may not have been Helen’s.” He produced it and showed David. “You might want a man or two to check out the area.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the middle of a sidewalk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So Abby told me. But it is marked on the map,” Malachi said. “Okay if I hang on to this?” When David nodded, he folded it, returning it to his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There may be something in the area—a restaurant, someplace Helen might’ve gone to meet someone,” Abby explained. “And, actually, it could have been anyone’s map, but since we’re grasping at straws here...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let her voice fade. David shook his head, lowering it. “Yeah. We are grasping at straws, but we need to grasp quickly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s why I suggested searching the Black Swan—tonight,” Malachi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But then you beat me to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We haven’t got the forensic talents to find what your crew might,” Malachi told him. “We just did a run-through. After all, we already spent hours on the ship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm. I’m reconsidering the map. How about handing it over?” David asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-alive-krewe-of-hunters-10/page-17.html","bookId":2284,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:48:37 PM"}
