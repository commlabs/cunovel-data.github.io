I wait a beat before reaching out to take it but once I stand up I let it go. She\u0027s a witch, someone whispers into my ear. Who is she? I ask. She\u0027s a witch, the voice says. Like all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlair takes my hand again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I realize what she wants but it\u0027s not until I see Blair\u0027s car that it finally announces itself clearly. It\u0027s a black Mercedes with tinted windows not unlike the one that had followed me across Fountain or the one that cruised by the Doheny Plaza all those nights or the one that tailed the blue Jeep whenever it was parked on Elevado or the one that followed me in the rain to an apartment on Orange Grove. And in the distance the same blond guy I saw at the Santa Monica pier with Trent and at the bar in Dan Tana\u0027s and crossing the bridge at the Hotel Bel-Air, and talking to Rain outside Bristol Farms one morning last December is leaning against the hood of the car and stops shading his eyes with his hand when he sees me staring at him. I thought he was maybe looking at the graves but then I realize he\u0027s watching us. He turns away when Blair nods at him. I keep staring at the car while I feel Blair\u0027s fingers lightly stroking my face. Just go where she says, the voice sighs. But she\u0027s a witch, I whisper back, still staring at the car. And her hand is a claw ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your face,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t look like anything has happened to you,\" she whispers. \"And you\u0027re so pale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many things Blair doesn\u0027t get about me, so many things she ultimately overlooked, and things that she would never know, and there would always be a distance between us because there were too many shadows everywhere. Had she ever made promises to a faithless reflection in the mirror? Had she ever cried because she hated someone so much? Had she ever craved betrayal to the point where she pushed the crudest fantasies into reality, coming up with sequences that only she and nobody else could read, moving the game as you play it? Could she locate the moment she went dead inside? Does she remember the year it took to become that way? The fades, the dissolves, the rewritten scenes, all the things you wipe away - I now want to explain these things to her but I know I never will, the most important one being: I never liked anyone and I\u0027m afraid of people.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-51.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
