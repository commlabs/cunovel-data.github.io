He started digging around in his wheelchair\u0027s side bag until he found a Ziploc full of marijuana. He got out a fivedollar bill and a paper and started rolling himself a joint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So tell me about it,\" he said. \"What\u0027s with the flies? Why the sudden interest in country music?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him about my last two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no confidentiality issues when I talk to Garrett. It\u0027s not so much that he\u0027s incredibly honourable about keeping secrets. It\u0027s more that Garrett doesn\u0027t ever remember what I say long enough to tell anybody. If it\u0027s not about programming or Jimmy Buffett or drugs, Garrett never bothers to save it into the old hard drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finished talking, Garrett shook his head slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blew smoke up toward the parrot. The parrot leaned into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You scare me sometimes, little bro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett scratched his jaw line under the beard, using all ten fingertips. \"I see you sitting in that chair, drinking and talking about your cases. All you need is a cigar and about a hundred extra pounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start, Garrett. I\u0027m not turning into Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"If you say so, man. You keep playing detective, hanging out in the Sheriff\u0027s old territory, working with his friends on the force—the Man\u0027s dead, little bro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurder solved. You can take off the Superman cape, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to muster some irritation but the tequila and the easy chair were working against me. I stared at the tips of my deck shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I like being known as Jackson Navarre\u0027s kid every time I work a case? You think that makes it easier on me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett took a toke. \"Maybe that\u0027s exactly what you like. Saves you the trouble of growing up and being something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother, the expert on growing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Yeah, well—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned back farther in the recliner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett noticed how short his joint was getting and reached behind him to get a roach clip out of the ashtray. His left leg stump peeked out briefly from his denim shorts. It was smooth and thin and pink, like part of a baby. There were no signs of scars from the train tracks that had long ago severed Garrett\u0027s lower third.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember Big Bill?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett\u0027s favourite strategy. When in doubt, bring up something embarrassing from Tres\u0027 childhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gee, no I don\u0027t. Why don\u0027t you remind me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Bill had been a roan stud Dad used to keep out at the ranch in Sabinal. Randiest, meanest sonofabitch stallion ever born. The horse, I mean, not my dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sheriff had insisted that I learn to ride Big Bill when I was a kid on the theory that I could then handle any horse in the world. Each time I tried, Big Bill would intentionally head for lowlying tree branches to try and knock me off. On our third ride together he succeeded, and I\u0027d gripped the reins so tightly as I fell that I couldn\u0027t let go when I hit the ground. My hands stayed wrapped around the leather straps as Big Bill galloped on for a good quarter mile, dragging me through as many cactus patches as he could find. When I returned home with half the back forty stuck to my clothes and my hair, my father had judged the ride \"a little too wild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found his saddle at the ranch last month,\" Garrett said. \"Had it polished up. I\u0027ve got it back in my bedroom if you want to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the biker women, no doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett tried to look modest. \"Actually it made me think of my little brother. I still got this image of you, man—nineyearold kid being dragged behind a runaway horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I get the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you now, twentyeight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twentynine,\" I said. \"There\u0027s a difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett laughed. \" \u0027Scuse me if I don\u0027t feel sorry for you. Just seems to me you got time to try some different things, little bro. Maybe you could get yourself a life that doesn\u0027t get you shot at so often and your girlfriends pissed off and your old brother kicked out of bars when you come to visit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m good at my work, Garrett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That what your boss says—you\u0027re good at your work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Garrett said. \"Like I said, you never could let go when you needed to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saying I should\u0027ve been like you—hop a freight car every time things at home started to get bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a mean thing to say, but Garrett didn\u0027t react. He just kept smoking and looking at a point somewhere above my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while the heavy metal music from the downstairs neighbour started up again, rattling the halfempty tequila bottle on Dad\u0027s army footlocker that Garrett used as a coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett looked down at the floor with tired resignation, then he reached over to pick a new CD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hope you can sleep to music,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Navarro, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda\u0027s dad shook my hand with both of his ^r and most of the rest of his body. This was a good trick, considering that to do it he had to put his walking stick in the crook of his arm and lean on his good leg and still keep from falling over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navarre,\" I said. \"But call me Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillis Daniels kept shaking my hand. His face was bright red, beaming like he\u0027d just run the Iron Man triathlon and loved every minute of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Course. Navarre. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" I said. \"San Antonio. Navarro. Historical connection. I get that all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were standing in the doorway of Silo Studio on Red River near Seventh. The studio was a singlestory refurbished warehouse with metalframed windows and brown stucco outer walls the texture of shredded wheat. The main door was at the rear of the building, where the parking lot was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Widower\u0027s Two it Step 119\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were standing right in the doorway, me on my way in and Mr. Daniels on his way out and the guy with a dollyful of electrical equipment waiting two feet behind Daniels shit out of luck. Daniels didn\u0027t seem to notice him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man squinted and leaned his face into mine, like a preacher about to offer me important words of comfort as I filed out of church. He smelled like wet leather and Pert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize for last night,\" he said. \"Hard situation, Cam getting out of control like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI surely didn\u0027t mean to misjudge you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t mention it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam was fired, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded amiably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy with the dolly cleared his throat loudly. Daniels kept beaming at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the solid red flannel shirt and black jeans and the curly gray hair now minus straw hat, Daniels looked even more like Santa Claus than he had the night before. He was mighty perky for somebody over sixty who\u0027d played music until two that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know you do look Hispanic,\" he decided. \"I suppose that\u0027s why I thought Navarro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the dark hair. Bit of a swarthy complexion. You don\u0027t mind me saying so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. Swarthy. Maybe I should have kept the parrot. Gotten myself a cutlass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you might be coming to our party tomorrow night,\" he continued. \"I surely hope you can make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do my best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe nodded at each other, both smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed to the parking lot, the way he\u0027d been heading. \"You\u0027re not helping with the recording today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked surprised, then chuckled and let out a whole string of little no\u0027s. \"Just dropping off Miranda. Old man like me couldn\u0027t keep up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said his goodbyes with more handshaking and smiling and then finally noticed the guy with the dolly. Daniels made a big deal about getting out of his way and telling him to have a good day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Daniels drive off in a little red Ford sedan. The guy with the dolly disappeared around the corner of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crouched down and looked at the cement steps at my feet. Nothing. I looked up at the sides of the walls. The bullet hole was a puttycoloured gouge in the brown stucco, about four feet up, just inside the doorway. My index finger fit up to the first joint. The rim of the hole was scarred where the police had removed the slug but I could still get the basic trajectory. I looked south and up. Parking garage next door. Probably the third floor. Probably a .22—a stupid shot from so far away, more effective at scaring than killing, unless you got lucky. The police might\u0027ve been up there looking for casings. Still . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a fiveminute excursion next door. I had a nice talk with a parking attendant about garbage collection days, then went up to the third floor and found what I wanted on the first try, right by the elevator. I put my prize in my backpack and walked back to Silo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe studio\u0027s lobby was a remodelled loading dock. There was one door on the far wall marked PRIVATE and a sickly ficus tree in the corner that apparently doubled as an ashtray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to the ficus tree, an Anglo guy in a sleeveless Hole Tshirt and Op shorts was leaning against the wall, reading Nashville Today. His head bobbed up and down like he was listening to a Walkman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gold records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up with just his eyes, his face still bent over the magazine. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s supposed to be gold records on the walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scratched his nose, then made a small sideways nod to the door marked PRIVATE, the only other exit from the room. \"Studio\u0027s that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I might\u0027ve gotten lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis obligations to building security fulfilled, he went back to his magazine and his invisible Walkman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked down a long hallway with several cheaply panelled doors on either side. Each had an identical PRIVATE sign. Someone must\u0027ve gotten them on sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hallway ended in a black curtain so thick it could\u0027ve been sewn together from flack jackets. I squeezed around the edge into a large circular room where I could hear Miranda singing but at first couldn\u0027t see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place smelled like burnt Styrofoam. Ducttaped cords ran along the floor, overhead among the fluorescent lights, up the walls that were apparently constructed from egg carton material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpaced here and there around the recording area were gray portable partitions, poofy and overstuffed so they looked more like vertical pillows than walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the centre of a V made by two of these was Miranda Daniels. She wore huge black headphones that doubled the size of her head. One large boxy mike was pointed toward her face and another angled down toward her guitar, and with all the wires and cords and the people looking at her from the glassedin control room I couldn\u0027t shake the impression that I was watching some kind of execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI skirted the room and walked up five steps into the control area, where Milo Chavez and three other guys were standing at a recording console that looked suspiciously like a Star Trek energizer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda was midsong—one of the faster numbers I\u0027d heard the night before. The sound was crisp and clear from the two shoeboxsize wall speakers, but it seemed thin with just Miranda\u0027s voice and the guitar. The studio acoustics seemed to suck all the excess sound out of her voice so the words just evaporated as soon as they left her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo glanced at me briefly, mumbled a greeting, then continued glaring through the Plexiglas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the engineers was hunched so low over the console I thought at first he was asleep. His head was cocked sideways, his ear only an inch from the knobs like he wanted to hear the sound they made when he turned them. The other engineer was keeping a close eye on the computer monitor. More accurately, he was keeping a close finger on it, tapping the little coloured bars as they flickered, like that would somehow affect them. You could see from the greasy smudges on the monitor that he did that a lot. The third man was standing slightly back from the console. From his demeanour and the orders he gave the engineers I guessed he was the new producer, John Crea\u0027s replacement, but he looked more like a vice principal—blue polyester shirt, doubleknit slacks, white socks with dress shoes. His hair was gray but worn too long, seventies conservative. He had his meaty, furry arms crossed and a frown on his face that made me want to apologize for coming in tardy. A little goldtinted American flag was pinned on his shirt pocket. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-17.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
