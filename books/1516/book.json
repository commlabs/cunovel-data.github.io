Published in 1995, the fantasy novel is set in a universe parallel to our own and tells of Lyra Belacqua\u0027s journey north in search of her missing friend, Roger Parslow, and her imprisoned father/uncle, Lord Asriel, who has been conducting experiments with a mysterious substance known as Dust. Winner of the Carnegie Medal in 1996, the novel has been adapted into a Hollywood feature film, released in 2007 as The Golden Compass along with an accompanying video game. Both the trilogy and the film adaptation have faced controversy, as some critics assert that the story presents a negative portrayal of organized religion and religion in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-golden-compass-his-dark-materials-1.jpg","author":"Philip Pullman","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-compass-his-dark-materials-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:38:42 AM"}
