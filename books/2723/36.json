Mr. Fisher would take us, and he was always pitting the boys against one another. \"Twenty dollars for the first one to get a hole in one.\" \"Twenty dollars for the winner.\" Steven loved it. I think he wished Mr. Fisher was our dad. He actually could\u0027ve been. Susannah told me my mother had dated him first, but my mother had handed him over to Susannah because she knew they\u0027d be perfect together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fisher included me in the mini golf competitions, but he never expected me to win. Of course I never did. I hated mini golf anyway. I hated the little pencils and the fake turf. It was all so annoyingly perfect. Kind of like Mr. Fisher. Conrad wanted so badly to be like him, and I used to hope he never would. Be like him, I mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I had been to Putt Putt was when I was thirteen and I\u0027d gotten my period for the first time. I was wearing white cutoffs, and Steven had been scared. He\u0027d thought I had cut myself or something--for a second, I\u0027d thought so too. After that, after getting my period by the fourth hole, I never wanted to go back. Not even when the boys invited me. So going with Cam felt like I was reclaiming Putt Putt, taking it back for my twelve-year-old self. It had even been my idea to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother said, \"Can you be home early? I want us to spend a little time together, maybe watch a movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How early? You guys go to bed at, like, nine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother took her sunglasses off and looked at me. She had two indentations on her nose where her glasses had been. \"I wish you\u0027d spend more time at the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m at the house right now,\" I reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe acted like she didn\u0027t hear me. \"You\u0027ve been spending so much time with this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eperson--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you liked him!\" I looked at Susannah for support, and she looked back at me sympathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother sighed, and Susannah broke in then, saying, \"We do like Cam. We just miss you, Belly. We completely accept the fact that you have an actual life.\" She adjusted her floppy straw hat and winked at me. \"We just want you to include us a little bit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled in spite of myself. \"Okay,\" I said, lying back down on the towel. \"I\u0027ll come home early. We\u0027ll watch a movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done,\" my mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and put my headphones on. Maybe she had a point. I had been spending all my time with Cam. Maybe she really did miss me. It was just, she couldn\u0027t take for granted that I was going to spend every night at home like I had every other summer. I was almost sixteen, practically an adult. My mother had to accept that I couldn\u0027t be her bean forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey thought I was asleep when they started talking. But I wasn\u0027t. I could hear what they were saying, even over the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conrad\u0027s been behaving like a little shit,\" my mother said in a low voice. \"He left all these beer bottles out on the deck this morning for me to clean up. It\u0027s getting out of hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah sighed. \"I think he knows something\u0027s up. He\u0027s been like this for months now. He\u0027s so sensitive, I know it\u0027s going to hit him harder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s time you told the boys?\" Whenever my mother said \"Don\u0027t you think,\" all she really meant was, \"I think. So you should too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the summer\u0027s over. That\u0027s soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beck,\" my mother began, \"I think it might be time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll know when it\u0027s time,\" Susannah said. \"Don\u0027t push me, Laur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew there was nothing my mother could say that would change her mind. Susannah was soft, but she was resolute, stubborn as a mule when she wanted to be. She was pure steel underneath all her softness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to tell them both, Conrad knows already and so does Jeremiah, but I couldn\u0027t. It wouldn\u0027t be right. It wasn\u0027t my business to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah wanted it to be some kind of perfect summer, where the parents were still together and everything was the way it had always been. Those kinds of summers don\u0027t exist anymore, I wanted to tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter thirty - five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround sunset, Cam came and picked me up for mini golf. I waited for him on the front porch, and when he pulled into the driveway, I ran up to his car. Instead of going to the passenger side, I walked right around to the driver\u0027s side. \"Can I drive?\" I asked. I knew he\u0027d say yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head at me and said, dryly, \"How does anybody ever say no to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI batted my eyelashes at him. \"No one ever does,\" I said, even though it wasn\u0027t true, not even a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the car door, and he scooted over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBacking out of the driveway, I told him, \"I have to be home early tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\" He cleared his throat. \"And, um, can you slow down a little? The speed limit is thirty-five on this road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I drove, he kept looking over at me and smiling. \"What? Why are you smiling?\" I asked. I felt like covering my face up with my T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Instead of a ski-slope nose, you have, like, a little bunny slope.\" He reached over and tapped it. I slapped his hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate my nose,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam looked perplexed. \"Why? Your nose is cute. It\u0027s the imperfections that make things beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if that meant he thought I was beautiful. I wondered if that was why he liked me, my imperfections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ended up staying out later than I\u0027d planned. The people in front of us took forever on each hole; they were a couple, and they kept stopping to kiss. It was annoying. I wanted to tell them, Mini golf is not where you go to hook up. That\u0027s what the drive-in\u0027s for. And then after, Cam was hungry, so we stopped for fried clams, and by that time it was after ten, and I knew my mother and Susannah would already be asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let me drive home. I didn\u0027t even have to ask; he just handed me the keys. In the driveway when we got home, I turned off the ignition. All of the lights in the house were off except for Conrad\u0027s. \"I don\u0027t want to go inside yet,\" I told Cam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you had to be home early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. I do. I\u0027m just not ready to go inside yet.\" I turned on the radio, and we sat there for five minutes listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Cam cleared his throat and said, \"Can I kiss you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished he hadn\u0027t asked. I wished he\u0027d just done it. Asking made everything feel awkward; it put me in a position where I had to say yes. I wanted to roll my eyes at him but instead I said, \"Um, okay. But next time, please don\u0027t ask. Asking someone if they want to kiss you is weird. You\u0027re supposed to just do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI regretted saying it right away, as soon as I saw the look on Cam\u0027s face. \"Never mind,\" he said, red-faced. \"Forget I asked.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-36.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
