Not much furniture, but tidy and dry - what more could anyone want?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot water and a shot of whiskey - Irish, to be sure. I was suddenly so cold, my bones ached. Which made no sense. The storm hadn\u0027t done one thing to dissipate the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll put your clothes in the dryer.\" Adam held out a hand. I stared at it, confused. \"Your shirt, cher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted me to strip in the living room?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth quirked at my sudden shyness, but he didn\u0027t point out that he\u0027d already seen everything, touched and tasted it, too. Instead he nodded to the nearest door. \"Bathroom\u0027s right there. Take a shower, toss out your things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot water?\" My voice quivered with hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam nodded. \"I live here year-round. Could do without electric, but why? Bought a generator first thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI practically ran into the bathroom, which was small but functional. I turned on the water, tossed my clothes through the door. As I waited for the steam to rise, my gaze flickered over the countertop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaving cream, razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, blow-dryer. I guess that solved the mystery of the un-wet hair, though why Adam had taken time to dry his locks while I wandered the swamp, I had no idea. Maybe he caught chills easily. He should try wearing a shirt and shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing into the shower, I nearly moaned as the water hit my skin. Though I would have liked to stand under the stream for an hour, I made do with fifteen minutes. Then I dried off, wrapped my hair in one towel and my body in a second, and went searching for Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood at the front window. Night had descended completely. The thought of going out in that storm, walking alone through the dark, was too much. I would never be able to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy clothes were gone, presumably whirling around the dryer with his. The image of our things all tangled together and warm made me think of other warm things that should be tangled together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the matter with me? Was I suddenly obsessed with sex because it had been so long since I\u0027d had any, or was I obsessed because I\u0027d had it with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, and our gazes met across the tiny room. He\u0027d donned gray sweatpants and a bright yellow T-shirt, which made his skin appear more bronzed and his eyes more blue. I was so out of my league.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he returned. \"I\u0027ll get you somethin\u0027 to wear while de dryer does its thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t protest. There was no way I could be in the same room with Adam wearing only a towel and not be distracted by thoughts of him tearing it off of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, would that be so bad? What were we going to do all night? Play chess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him down the hall, standing in the doorway as he rooted through a dresser. The bedroom was as sparse as the living room - nothing but a queen-size bed and a place to store clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost the towel. The swish of the terry cloth down my legs, the slight thunk as it hit the floor, were taint, yet his head went up like a deer sensing danger in the forest His eyes widened, and he dropped the T-shirt in his hand back into the drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bed looks comfortable,\" I observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed the floor, stopping just in front of me. Reaching up, he tugged the towel turban from my head. My damp, wildly curling hair tumbled free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than de ground,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning flashed so brightly, I still saw the flare after it faded. Thunder shook the earth; the windows rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gonna be a long night, cher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led me to the bed, and we passed the long night together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI awoke in that hour when the moon dies and the sun is bom - the darkest time. The storm had raged outside, wild and primitive. Inside we\u0027d done our best to imitate nature. I was both exhausted and exhilarated. Achy and alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head. Adam\u0027s face was so close, his breath caressed my cheek. I resisted the urge to brush back his hair and kiss his brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust sex, I reminded myself. I had a job to do, a vow to fulfill, a life to lead. One that did not include a reclusive former Special Forces officer with too many secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t believe he\u0027d murdered a man with his bare hands. How could he, and then touch me so gently in the night? There was violence in him certainly, but not insanity. At least not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at the thought and shifted to glance out the window. My heart seemed to leap into my throat I wanted to call for Adam, but I couldn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wolf stared through the glass. Huge, black, beautiful. A shaft of excitement, of joy almost, shot through me that I\u0027d at last found something I was searching for. And then I saw the beast\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolves have brown eyes - dark, light, sometimes hazel. They do not possess orbs of blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what really freaked me out was the white surrounding the iris. I could swear those eyes were human -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were Adam\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up with a gasp, trying to catch my breath, finally succeeding. I looked to the right. The wolf was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBracing myself, I looked to the left. Adam continued to sleep undisturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my palm to my chest; my heart threatened to burst through my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dream, that was all. There hadn\u0027t really been a wolf with human eyes staring at me with just a hint of desire -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;though I had to say his expression had been more famished than carnal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay down, spent a few moments breathing in and out, trying to make my heart return to a normal pace, hoping I didn\u0027t wake Adam with my foolishness. After his performance, he had to be more tired than I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory calmed me. I shifted closer, enjoying the warmth, the scent of his skin, the rhythm of his breathing. I hadn\u0027t realized how much I hated sleeping alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drifted, perched on the precipice of sleep, when a tap at the window brought me wide awake again. My eyes snapped open. I expected the wolf; I did not expect Simon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft sob escaped my mouth. Just a dream again, had to be. Simon was dead. He could not be outside Adam\u0027s window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed at Simon seeing me in bed with another man, even if it was a dream Simon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped on the glass, crooked his finger, so I slipped from beneath the covers and padded naked across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon appeared exactly the same as he had the day he\u0027d died. Tall and a bit gaunt - he\u0027d always forgotten to eat unless I reminded him - his blond hair and blue eyes appeared almost Nordic. I hadn\u0027t known he was British until he opened his mouth. That accent had been my undoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d met him he was well respected in his field. By the time he died he was a laughingstock, referred to as \"The Wolfman\" by people who\u0027d once admired him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days before his death he finally told me why he was willing to risk everything to find something no one else believed in. He\u0027d seen a werewolf as a child in England - out on the moors, in the fog - and ever since, he\u0027d been unable to forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d rationalized away the sighting as too much American Werewolf in London for a twelve-year-old mind He\u0027d been understandably angry that the one person in the world who should believe him, didn\u0027t, and when he\u0027d received a call that a werewolf had been seen hi northern Wisconsin, he\u0027d gone alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t believed him, and he\u0027d died for it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon laid his palm against the glass. Droplets of ram ran down, skirting his fingers. I lifted my hand and pressed it to the windowpane, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I missed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"D-baby,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the two of us knew that nickname.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here, Simon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over his shoulder as if someone had called him, then returned his gaze to mine. \"I have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back. Weird. He wasn\u0027t wet, and the rain was still coming down. Or maybe not so weird after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promised,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d sworn till death do us part, but in my heart that meant forever. A love like ours just didn\u0027t go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt it now, swelling inside of me, making my eyes tear and my chest tighten. \"Don\u0027t leave me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never have. I\u0027ll be with you until the end of time. You took a vow, D-baby. Remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d come to remind me of the vow and not our love? Dream Simon or not, I wanted to slug him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t forgotten,\" I snapped. \"Why do you think I\u0027m here? I\u0027ve been chasing legends every which way ever since you died. I haven\u0027t found one damn thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to believe in order to see, not the other way around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d told me that countless times, but faith, for me, was tough. I was a scientist; I needed proof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be safe,\" he whispered; then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jolted as if I\u0027d been startled awake. However, I wasn\u0027t in bed; I was standing at the window. I couldn\u0027t have been sleeping. Unless I\u0027d been sleepwalking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I leaned close, my nose brushed the glass. Nothing was out there but the night. I inched back, and my gaze caught on the imprint of a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart gave one hard thud before I came to my senses. I\u0027d touched the window in my sleep, that was all. To prove it, I fit my palm to the outline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fingertips on the glass extended half an inch past my own. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-15.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
