Straining their eyes, the alarmed passengers could descry land. Indeed, the reef was an outlying part of it. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All eyes were turned upon the captain, as Mr. Holdfast was now called.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I had had men enough to stand watch, this would not have happened,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is there any hope, Mr. Holdfast?” asked Montgomery Clinton, clasping his hands in terror.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Plenty of it,” answered the mate, curtly, “but we must leave the ship.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Under his direction the remaining boat—for Captain Hill and his companions had only taken away one—was lowered. Steering clear of the reef, they found themselves in a cove, bordered on three sides by land. By the light, now rapidly increasing, they saw grass and trees, and the sight gladdened them in spite of the grave peril that menaced them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They put in the boat as large a supply of stores as they dared, and then rowed ashore. Landing the passengers, Holdfast selected Jack and Harry, and went back to the ship for a further supply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We must lay in as much as we can, for we don’t know how long we are to remain here,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the second trip had been made, it was decided to rest for a time and eat breakfast.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The little group gathered on a bluff looking out to sea, and, sitting down, ate heartily. By this time the sun had made its appearance, and it bade fair to be a pleasant day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Have you any idea where we are, Mr. Holdfast?” asked Mr. Stubbs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I only know that we are on an island. There is no mainland near here,” answered the commander.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It seems to be a large one, then. While you were gone with the boys, I ascended a tree, and, looking inland, could not see the ocean in that direction.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I feel like exploring the island,” said Harry; “who will go with me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Curious to see what kind of a new home they had, all set out. First, however, the professor asked:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How long before the ship is likely to go to pieces, Mr. Holdfast?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not under a day or two in this weather,” was the answer. “Later in the day I will board her again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They struck inland and walked for about two miles. There were trees and plants such as they had never seen before, and the songs of unknown birds floated out upon the air. It was certainly a delightful change from the contracted life they had been leading upon shipboard.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you think the island is inhabited?” asked Harry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know no more about it than you do, my lad,” answered Holdfast.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Suppose we should meet with a pack of savages armed with spears!” suggested Harry, with a side look at Clinton, who was walking by him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, good gracious! Mr. Holdfast, do you think we will?” asked that young gentleman, nervously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We must do the best we can. I take it we are all brave, and would be willing to fight.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After a considerable walk, they reached a grove of trees, bearing a different leaf from any to which they were accustomed. They did not appear to produce fruit of any kind, but were comely and afforded a grateful shade. This was the more appreciated, because the sun had begun to make its heat felt, and a feeling of languor diffused itself over all.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I move we squat here a while,” said Mr. Stubbs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well,” said the mate. “We have all day before us, and I am afraid a great many more to come, in which we may explore the island.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All threw themselves on the grass without ceremony.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They returned to the shore about noon, and sitting down on the bluff, ate heartily of the stores they had brought with them from the ship. They had brought no water, but, fortunately, discovered a spring on their homeward walk, which promised a constant supply of refreshing drink.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This seems a great deal like a picnic,” said Harry, as they sat down on the grass with the food in the center.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am afraid it will prove a larger picnic than we care for,” remarked the professor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When dinner was over, if their informal meal can be dignified by that name, Mr. Holdfast said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think we had better make another trip to the ship, and bring back what we can. We shall need a further supply of provisions, and there will be other things that will occur to us as likely to be needed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “May I go with you, Mr. Holdfast?” asked Harry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” answered the mate; “I will take you and Jack, and Mr. Stubbs, too, may come, if he will.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am quite at your command, captain,” said the Yankee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nothing suited Harry better than to make one of the expeditions. He and Jack clambered up the ship’s sides, and chased each other in boyish fun. Jack had no fear of a stern rebuke from Mr. Holdfast, who had a sympathy with the young. He would not have dared to take such liberties with Captain Hill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How long do you think the ship will hold together, Mr. Holdfast?” asked Stubbs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For a week, perhaps, unless the sea becomes rough, and dashes her against the reef with violence.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At present she seems motionless.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, she is not at present receiving any damage. It will be a sad day when she goes to pieces,” continued the mate, gravely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, but it will hardly make our position worse. There is no chance of our making any use of her, I take it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don’t quite understand me,” said Holdfast. “A sailor gets to feel an attachment for the craft he sails on, and she seems to him something like a living creature. This is my first voyage on the old Nantucket, but it will grieve me to see her disappear.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was not easy to decide of what the boat’s load should consist. In the main, provisions were taken as an article of first necessity. Some clothing, also, was selected, and among the rest, at Harry’s instance, an extra pair of Mr. Clinton’s trousers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was decided not to make another trip to the ship that day. Mr. Holdfast expressed the opinion that the Nantucket was not in any immediate danger of going to pieces, and there was much other work in hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you know anything about the climate here, Mr. Holdfast?” asked the professor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t think it is ever cold. It is too far south for that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I mean as to the chance of rain. I am told that in these tropical places, rain comes on very suddenly at times.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suspect that this is the dry season, professor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Still, it may be wise to provide ourselves with some shelter.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “True; have you anything to suggest?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It occurred to me that we might procure some of the sails, and use as a roof covering to shield us from the heat of the sun, and from any unexpected showers.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A good idea. I am glad you mentioned it. On the whole, I think I will make one more trip to the ship this afternoon for the special purpose of bringing back materials for a roof. Then we can put it up to-night.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Better bring hatchets, if there are any on board, some nails and cordage.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Also well thought of. You are a practical man, professor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We shall all have to think for the general benefit. I am sorry I can’t do more work, but I never was handy with tools.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am,” said Stubbs. “In fact, most Yankees are, and I am a Yankee. You can command my services, Mr. Holdfast, in any way that you see fit.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Holdfast made another trip to the vessel, and brought back quite an expanse of sailcloth. All hands, with the exception of Mr. Clinton, went to work at once, and by sunset a considerable space was roofed over, which the little company regarded with complacency.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Aren’t you going to have any sides or doors?” asked Clinton.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That can be considered hereafter,” said Holdfast. “I don’t think we shall need any, since the probability is that the island is not inhabited.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next morning a great surprise awaited them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It might have been because it was the first night on land, or perhaps because they were unusually fatigued, but at any rate the little party slept unusually late. The first one to awake was Harry Vane. It took very little time for him to dress, since he had only taken off his coat. He glanced at his slumbering companions, who were scattered about in different postures.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ll go up to the spring, and have a wash,” Harry decided. “I won’t wake anybody, for there’s no hurry about waking up.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Returning from the spring, Harry for the first time looked in the direction of the ship. What he saw filled him with amazement. The wreck which he had thought deserted, was alive with men. He saw a dozen on deck, including two who were obviously not sailors. He could not immediately discern the figures, and ran hastily to the top of the bluff. Then he made the startling discovery that these intruders were the captain and his companions, who had abandoned the ship in the expectation that it was doomed, and, after floating about in the long boat, had by a wonderful coincidence drifted to the very point which they themselves had reached.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The news was too important to keep, and he returned to the encampment, and entering, approached the mate, who was sleeping soundly. He leaned over and shook him gently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Holdfast!” he cried.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The mate slowly opened his eyes and started up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What’s the matter?” he asked. “Has anything happened?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ve got great news for you, Mr. Holdfast. Captain Hill has arrived.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What!” exclaimed the mate, in amazement. “Arrived—where?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is at this moment on the Nantucket, with all the men that accompanied him in the long boat.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Uttering an expression of amazement, Mr. Holdfast sprang from the ground, and hastily made his way to the edge of the bluff.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “By Jove!” said he, “you’re right. I never heard of anything more wonderful.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harry could not tell from the expression of his face whether he considered the news good or not.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Go and wake up the rest, Harry,” he said. “They will be surprised, too.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is needless to say that the news produced surprise and excitement. All hurried to the edge of the bluff.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Will they come on shore, do you think?” asked Harry of the mate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They will have to; but I shall at once go out to the ship and report to my superior officer. You and Jack may go with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is needless to say that both boys were very glad to accept this invitation. The rest of the party remained on shore and watched the boat’s course.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What will be the issue of this, Mr. Stubbs?” asked the professor, thoughtfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am afraid there will be friction. The captain is a natural despot, and he will undertake to control us.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He can have no authority after the ship is wrecked.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He will claim it, as sure as my name is Stubbs. The fact is, I am rather sorry he hadn’t managed to drift to another island. Mr. Holdfast is a much more agreeable man to deal with.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I agree with you. As a passenger, I shall not recognize the captain’s authority on shore.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nor I.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile, the mate and the two boys had pulled to the ship, and, securing the boat, scrambled on deck.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good-morning, Captain Hill; I am glad to meet you once more,” said the mate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Humph!” growled the captain, not over politely. “When did you reach here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yesterday morning.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where are the rest of the party?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We have a little camp just back of the bluff.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I see you have been removing articles from the ship,” continued the captain, in a tone of disapproval.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Certainly,” answered the mate. “We need them, and I didn’t know how long the ship would last.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It seems in no immediate danger of going to pieces.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Things look more favorable than they did yesterday morning. What sort of a trip did you have in the boat?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A curious question to ask,” said the captain, captiously. “We were in danger of being swamped more than once.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We had better have remained on board the Nantucket with you, Mr. Holdfast,” said Appleton, the Melbourne merchant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Captain Hill chose to take offense at this remark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You were quite at liberty to stay, Mr. Appleton,” he said. “I didn’t urge you to go with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “True, Captain Hill; but I trusted to your opinion that the ship was unsafe.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The captain looked angry, but did not make any reply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the sailors Mr. Holdfast was warmly greeted. He was much better liked than the captain, being a man of even temper and reasonable in his demands.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2964/81598.html","bookId":385,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:34:06 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:34:06 AM"}
