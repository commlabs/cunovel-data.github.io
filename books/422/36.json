How Iring fought and died","content":"\u0026nbsp;Then shouted the Margrave Iring, the lord of the Danefolk’s land: \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ever on quest of honour have I set mine heart and hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And have done my best endeavour where surges of fight tossed high.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bring me mine harness! My prowess against yon Hagen I try.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thou shalt do it to thy destruction!” did Hagen scornfully say.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thou shouldst better bid these Hunfolk to shrink yet farther away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Though twain, yea, three of you rushing essay to win this hall,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Back grievously hurt will I send them; adown this stair shall they fall.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not for thy threats I refrain me!” cried Iring with shining eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Full oft ere this have I ventured on as perilous emprise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Alone will I withstand thee, and not with words, but the sword.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What care I for all thy vaunting, O thou tongue-valiant lord?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then with speed was the good thane Iring sheathed in knightly mail\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Irnfried of Thuringia, a heart unused to quail,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Hawart the strong, with a thousand warriors in battle-array,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stood eager to go where Iring the hero led the way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then looked the viol-minstrel, and beheld that huge war-band\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That would press on after Iring, armed all with shield and brand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And upon their heads had they settled and laced the helmets bright.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then was the valiant Volker exceeding wroth at the sight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Seest thou, friend Hagen,” he shouted, “how Iring cometh on,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He that but now made proffer to meet thee in battle alone?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Is it seemly that heroes be liars? contempt upon such I pour.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, armed at his side come onward a thousand knights or more!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Liar me thou no liars!” Hawart’s liegeman replied.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Unto you did I give a promise, and by that will I abide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 279}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My word shall not be broken for any craven fear!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Be Hagen never so grimly, alone will I meet him here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thereat did Iring bow him at his friends’ and liegemen’s feet:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Suffer ye me unholpen,” he said, “yon knight to meet.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Right sorely loth they consented, for known to them well was the might\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of Hagen the Burgundian, the overweening knight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So long did he entreat them that at last they needs must yield.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When his friends and his faithful vassals beheld him steadfast-willed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And marked how he thirsted for honour, at the last they let him go.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then did begin a grapple most grim ’twixt foe and foe.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Iring the knight of Daneland a casting-spear upswung;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For a fence of his breast the hero his shield before him flung:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Swift to the meeting with Hagen to the door of the hall he sprang;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then burst forth ’twixt those champions a mighty battle-clang.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The hands of the twain, ere they grappled, sped the javelins’ flight:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They pierced through the strong-knit bucklers, they rang on the hauberks bright,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That high above their helmets the splintered spear-staves flew;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And swiftly the two grim warriors their swords from the scabbards drew.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Measureless might had Hagen the dauntless above all men;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet starkly did Iring smite him, that the castle rang again:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through the halls and the towers of the palace did their blows’ wild echoes thrill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet the Dane with his uttermost striving might compass not his will.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So Iring turned him from Hagen, who was woundless yet of his blows,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now with the viol-minstrel in conflict did he close.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He weened, as he hailed grim sword-strokes, he should smite his foeman down;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But of fence exceeding cunning was that champion of renown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So starkly smote the minstrel, that the studs were whirled through the air\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By Volker’s strong hand stricken from the shield that Iring bare.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So he left him standing unwounded, for a terrible foe was he:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then turned he, and leapt upon Gunther, the Lord of Burgundy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So champion clashed with champion, giants in battle-might,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gunther and Iring, and starkly each the other they smite;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 280}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet neither could redden the armour of other with gushing blood,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the strong-knit links of the harness the edge of the steel withstood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From Gunther he swiftly hath turned him, and now upon Gernot he springs;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He smiteth his mail, and he heweth flashes of flame from the rings.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Gernot the lord Burgundian with such stark fury fought,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That to death’s sheer brink his prowess the valiant Iring brought.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But he sprang from the Prince—as a panther’s swift was the leap of the thane—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And four good knights Burgundian with four great strokes hath he slain;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the noble host of the vassals from Worms over Rhine they came.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never ere then so hotly did the wrath of Giselher flame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “By the living God, Sir Iring,” the young prince Giselher cried,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Unto me shalt thou make atonement for these that here have died\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even now by thy battle-brand stricken!” He leapt upon his foe,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he lashed with a stroke so mighty that the Dane reeled back from the blow:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As hurled from the hands of the smiter, backward he fell in blood,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That it seemed unto all beholders that the warrior stalwart and good\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Should never strike in battle another stroke of brand:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet Iring the while unwounded lay of Giselher’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In sooth, so rang his helmet, so clashed the sword on his head,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That stunned he lay, and his senses awhile were utterly fled;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And indeed for a space he knew not whether he yet lived on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even this unto him had the prowess of valiant Giselher done.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he came to himself, and out of the darkness his soul awoke\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the swoon wherein it had sunken at the falling of that great stroke,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then thought he: “Behold, I am living! Moreover, wound have I none.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now know I Giselher’s prowess, the might of the valiant one!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Around him the feet of the foemen he heard, as they moved to and fro.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had they known that he lived, right swiftly had they ended him, I trow!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The voice of Giselher heard he withal as he stood hard by;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he pondered how from the foemen that ringed him round he should fly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 281}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the blood like a very madman upsprang to his feet the knight—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well might he thank his fleetness for speeding thence his flight!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As out through the door he darted, lo, there did Hagen stand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the Dane hailed blows upon him with swift and sudden hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Hagen thought: “Thou art surely now in the clutches of death!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Except the Foul Fiend help thee, thou drawest thy latest breath!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet indeed had he wounded Hagen with a stroke through his helm that clave:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That deed had he done with Waske, a mighty battle-glaive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Hagen the grim-hearted of the wound so dealt was ware,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In his grip with tenfold fury his war-glaive hissed through the air\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In such wise that Hawart’s liegeman must needs give back from his face,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Hagen, as down the stairway he fled, still held him in chase.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Over his head his buckler he swung up, Iring the strong,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To screen him: yet had the stairway been even thrice so long,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No time had Hagen left him to strike one stroke of sword.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ha, how the red sparks streaming from his ringing helmet poured!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet back unto friends and kinsmen unwounded Iring returned;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And so soon as the Lady Kriemhild the wondrous tidings learned\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How against Hagen of Troneg her champion had borne him in fight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For this that Daughter of Princes poured forth her thanks to the knight:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now God reward thee, Iring, thou thane renowned and bold!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To mine heart hast thou brought comfort, and made me joyful-souled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, I see on the battle-harness of Hagen a bloody stain!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for joy took Kriemhild the buckler herself from the hand of the thane.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Small cause wilt thou have to thank him,” cried Hagen in fierce disdain:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let but thy valorous champion essay the deed again;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If alive he win back ever, a hero indeed shall he be;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And as for the wound he hath dealt me, small joy shall it be unto thee!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the little scratch I have gotten that mine harness reddeneth,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It hath but enkindled my fury unto many a warrior’s death:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Against the liegeman of Hawart mine anger it doth but whet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Small scathe thy champion Iring hath done unto Hagen yet!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 282}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For a space in the breeze fresh-blowing stood Iring of Danish land:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He cooled his limbs in his harness, he loosed his helmet-band.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All round him the folk stood praising his might and his chivalry,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the heart of the Lord of the Marches thereat beat proud and high.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then once again spake Iring: “Good friends, I pray you go\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And bring new arms: I am purposed again to essay yon foe,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If I haply may still the boaster, and abase the arrogant head.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sore hacked was his shield, but a better they gave him in its stead.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Soon stood the knight full-armoured in stronger warrior-gear:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He grasped in his battle-fury a stubborn-shafted spear,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he set his face unto Hagen to defy him to fight once more;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then leapt to meet him the hatred of that murder-wolf of war.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For Hagen the thane would wait not for the coming of Iring’s feet,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But hurling javelins before him he sprang his foe to meet\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Down all the length of the stairway: his fury was passing great.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah, little did Iring’s prowess avail in the hour of fate!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As the swords hewed through the bucklers, it was as a fierce wind blew\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The
