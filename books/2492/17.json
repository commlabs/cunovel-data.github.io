He did, for the most part. But I thought of Alex as more, overwhelming. He overwhelmed all of us with his physique. But that personality hadn\u0027t gotten big like the rest of him. He was still the same awkward sex and tech-obsessed guy we\u0027d met last year. In a package like a super hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your car, Hart?\" Alex asked and I sighed. I guess I was gonna hear it today. Bry and I were the only ones that actually had cars, Jade borrowed her aunt\u0027s and Mia brought hers but it was The Toaster. It was a two guy or three girl ride. We had stuffed Archer in there with the chicks one time but he hadn\u0027t cared. There was no awkward turtle male-female vibe goin\u0027 on there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s getting a conversion. I\u0027m using my credit, ya asswipes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis joined the conversation, \"Your grandpa has the credit for that hot rod we saw at his place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a Camaro. A 1974 LT-1, clueless,\" Jonesy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher shrugged. \"Not a car worshiper, so bite me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bite you?\" Jonesy asked, tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem interested, Jones,\" Alex said with a sly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knock it off, muscle head,\" Jonesy said, dismissing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher grinned at Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, \"How\u0027d he get the Camaro,\" He looked at Jonesy with a smirk, \"to the conversions center?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drove it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit?\" John asked with a stunned expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said slowly, \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he use fossil fuel to get there, Caleb?\" Archer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher frowned. \"That\u0027s a huge fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah, he\u0027s got some in the garage just in case the neighborhood gets outta line,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy laughed, shaking his head. \"I think he keeps those \u0027grandfathered\u0027 cards around like a deck and flips them out to the Person in Authority when he needs to. End of story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry walked up to us looking around. \"Where are the girls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re coming,\" I said, lifting my pulse. I\u0027d just got a pulse from Jade. She was finishing something lame for Griswold then she\u0027d be here. I relayed that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s she doing for Griswold?\" John asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, hadn\u0027t asked. Was all about the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie, Tiff and Jade walked up. Bry asked, \"Where\u0027s Mia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three girls gave him a speculative look and his face turned a little red under their scrutiny. \"What?\" he asked, jamming his hands in his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your noticeable interest, dillweed,\" Tiff mentioned delicately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia walked up right behind them, saw all the awkwardness and said, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy smiled and Bry shot him a warning look. \"Bry was busy pining for you, wonderin\u0027 about your location so he could stalk you with accuracy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t believe it, even from Jones. So low. Bry\u0027s mouth was moving but no sound was coming out. Mia looked at him in amusement and Bry looked ready to murder Jonesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So... you wanted to know where I was, huh?\" she asked him and his face became redder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I\u0027m just worried about you guys with the jackasses that go here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia shrugged a slim shoulder and flicked her hair behind her shoulder and Bry blushed. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had it bad. The girls knew their charms and they circled us dudes like lionesses with prey in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie stalked over to Jonesy, her hips rolling smoothly on her weapons-for-heels. Jade floated over to me, her lips a raspberry perfection in the middle of her kissable face. Eyes like green quartz captured me. I was helpless to look away even as in my peripheral vision I saw Mia stroll over to Bry and lay a hand on his muscular forearm. I watched his Adam\u0027s apple bob in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff watched with blatant suspicion as the females prowled toward the boys. And in seeing our reactions had some kind of epileptic eye-rolling fit where the whites of her eyes were the only sign of life in her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humph!\" she huffed, folding her arms over her hoodie. \"Idiots,\" she muttered under her breath. But It didn\u0027t matter because Jade was up on her tiptoes, pressing those berry lips to mine, her small hands balancing on shoulders made strong and broad through working out, beating my body into submission on the mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit. The mat. Judo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled away in a hurry. \"What?\" Jade asked, completely unaccustomed to me pulling away. That\u0027s because it didn\u0027t ever happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have judo today,\" I smacked my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, you forgot your brain today, Hart?\" Tiff asked, pointing at Jade, then rudely pointing at her own crotch. \"Or are you just letting the little head... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tiff!\" Bry yelled and she smiled. She was all about diggin\u0027 on whatever flustered people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother. John smiled at her. There weren\u0027t enough opposites in the world. But they were polar. John kinda liked how snarky she was. I found her kinda annoying but she was like a dude in a girl\u0027s body. It was weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about ready to sail out the school doors when Buddy walked up. Without the losers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood thinkin\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Sophie standing by Jonesy, his face hardening. Alarm bells began to sound in my head. Hell, I\u0027d have to be late and do some really crappy drills now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t leave a potential mess. Jonesy and Buddy squared off and the other dudes backed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you fuck off, Buddy?\" Jonesy asked in a pleasant voice, the girls gasping at the strength of his wording right outta the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy smiled. Nothing got a guy juiced like another one telling him where to go without any preliminaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around for adults. Seeing none, he got chest to chest with Jones, two inches taller and about the same weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, \"Hey, there\u0027s... Jonesy, don\u0027t do this. She isn\u0027t your girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy leveled the first dirty look he\u0027d ever given John like a laser. John glowered back like, rein it in you anger management addict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex told John, \"Don\u0027t mediate, let it play out, Terran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry slapped his forehead and Tiff said, \"Pound. His. Ass. Jones.\" She smacked her fist into her open palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved Jade behind me, she had an ability to be a magnet for violence and it wasn\u0027t finding her when I was around. I took in the group and saw that Bry had done a similar maneuver with Mia. Tiff was way too close to the potential fight and John and Alex were hanging back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Sophie that got in the middle. Chicks needed to stay the hell away when guys started swinging. It was simple logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed to really evade females. Logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy hissed at Sophie, \"Back off, Soph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said quietly. He flicked his eyes to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like me, not really. I\u0027m just a girl that won\u0027t let you date and dump her, Jones. Get over yourself,\" she shrugged like it didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did to Jonesy. I could see the struggle of it on his face, contorting his features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy gave a smirk even as Sophie\u0027s arm wound around his waist. \"Who\u0027s gonna fuck off now, Jones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy sprung at him from the balls of his feet, his fist popping out and jabbing toward him like a spring, Buddy flinging his head in a smooth avoidance maneuver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Sophie was too close and as she stumbled to remove herself from the fight, tottering on her heels, the side of his fist caught her in the face and she went down flat. Buddy couldn\u0027t save her but Jonesy was the most graceful person I knew and he dropped after her, swinging in an arc to catch her before she landed on the floor. He took the brunt of the fall and rolled her on top of him and then to his side. It was actually beautiful to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Buddy and Jonesy hadn\u0027t been in the middle of trying to beat the snot out of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy began whaling on Jonesy and I waded in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee how that worked out? No judo... work out anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy was using his fists to punch back defensively but couldn\u0027t do much because an unconscious Sophie was prone beside him. It didn\u0027t take a rocket scientist to figure out he didn\u0027t want her hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuz he could hurt Buddy. Jonesy was what Gramps called a scrapper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slammed my foot into the pinch of Buddy\u0027s torso, that tender spot where ribs ended and organs roamed. Yeah, that works pretty good on incapacitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sprung up and turned on me, crouching defensively. I had a heartbeat to realize that Buddy knew more than he let on and then he was after me in an aggressive flurry of arm swipes and jabs that made my judo training come to the surface in a defensive roar. I used the sides of my hands like I\u0027d been taught and swung from my core, centered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeliberate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he came. There was a crowd growing but I saw them as background, it took all my concentration to engage my opponent. Who was definitely a martial arts guy. No doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything melted away as I fought him, and to my intense shame, I didn\u0027t even have a bead on Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe punished my ribs with his hands and I struck him hard with the instep of my foot in the middle of his chest and he flew back and landed with practiced hands, his butt never hitting the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d landed like a cat. Nine lives. I moved forward again and then suddenly Chen was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice, Hart,\" some random kid said. Carson came up and clapped Buddy on the back. Buddy shrugged it off. Probably thinking about his unconscious girlfriend with her head in Jonesy\u0027s lap. Nice turn-of-events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen gave Buddy and I looks. She took in Sophie in a heap, Jonesy pushing her hair back, her cheek swelling with a red mark like an angry comma on her face. I looked at Jonesy and saw that he had tears in his eyes. His heart in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what I would have felt like if I hit Jade. Accident or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around for her and didn\u0027t see her. Panic struck. Where was Jade?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Chen\u0027s next words stole my thoughts away from Jade and back to her. \"My office, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Hart. Now.\" She walked away knowing we\u0027d follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t. I needed to know Jade was okay. I searched the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere! I saw a flash of black hair and pink. Someone was with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho? I moved between kids, parting them like a human sea and as she was revealed so was Brett. He had a hold of her wrist, its delicate diameter captured in his big hand and all I could think of was last year. Him dragging her off for his molestathon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s eyes got wide and she yelled, \"No Caleb, it\u0027s not what you think!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking? Who the hell said anything about that? I was a roaring inferno of male rage, my female threatened by a known threat. A primal siren sounded and that\u0027s what I listened to. It led my fist straight to his face, my other one following like a loved one, one right on top of the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil he was on the ground, Jade screaming. Someone huge picked me up from behind and I knew how to get out of that. But I couldn\u0027t move, whoever it was had arms of steel. I literally couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I took heart. I looked down at Brett, a bleeding disaster at my feet and smiled, spitting out the blood from my own mouth as I did, where it hit the floor with a splat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Settle down, Hart!\" Alex bellowed in my ear. \"Chen\u0027s gonna call the cops,\" he said more quietly. I settled down and he let me drop. I stood on my own without those crushing arms of his holding me and looked at Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back. I didn\u0027t like the look on her face. She looked scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s not what I\u0027d been gunning for. I didn\u0027t want Brett touching Jade. Period. It wasn\u0027t complicated. He was a proven asshole with bad intent and he wasn\u0027t going to train those plans on Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here,\" I said to her, using my palm to gesture for me, cupping my hands toward myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated and I had an awful moment where I thought she wouldn\u0027t. Then she gingerly stepped over Brett and came into my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen literally shoved students aside. Her rage was a palpable thing. A living, breathing thing in the commons. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d ever had that level of rage directed at me before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, in the spirit of new experiences...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade held onto me like I was the last solid thing in the world. I treated her the same. I glued her onto my body, tucking her underneath my chin as I faced off with Chen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get away from Miss LeClerc, Mr. Hart.\" She looked at me, her words vibrating with unmasked hatred. It was a little confusing. So I had a fight, big deal. Was it really worth her foaming at the mouth like a rabid bat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t hurt me,\" Jade said in a voice that trembled. I stroked her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously! Mr. Hart is so nonviolent. Jade, move away from him. Now.\" She did, her fingers reluctantly trailing down my chest as she backed away. I looked for guy support and found Bry\u0027s eyes. He gave me a nod. He knew what the deal was. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-screams-death-4/page-17.html","bookId":2492,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM"}
