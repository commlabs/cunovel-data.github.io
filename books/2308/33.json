Kara\u0027s wound, though sore, seemed to be healing nicely, and Alex was certain it was because he\u0027d given her his blood. His own wounds had always healed swiftly, leaving no scar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara glanced at Alex. She should have been weak, suffering from the blood she\u0027d lost, but when Alex had checked her this morning, the gunshot wound had appeared to be no more serious than a scratch. Certainly it was far less painful than the awkward silence between her and Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at him now, thinking how handsome he was, how much she loved him. But she loved his baby, too, and she wasn\u0027t going to get rid of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we should drop Gail off at the Ralstons\u0027,\" Kara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex glanced at her. It was the first time she\u0027d spoken directly to him since last night. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Kara!\" Gail leaned over the seat. \"I want to stay with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara shook her head. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we might still be in danger from Barrett,\" Kara said. She turned in the seat so she could face Gail. \"It\u0027ll only be for a little while, sweetie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But_\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Gail, don\u0027t argue with me. Not now. I\u0027ll keep in touch with you, I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a huff, Gail sank back on the seat and stared out the window. A short time later, she was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m healing so fast because of you, aren\u0027t I? Because you gave me your blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s twice you\u0027ve saved my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at her briefly, then turned his attention to the road once again. He\u0027d saved her life. Would he also be the one to take it from her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence in the car lengthened, grew awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara stared out the window, one hand resting protectively over her stomach. Alien or human, she already loved the child in her womb. She would fight Alex, Barrett, the whole world, if necessary, but no one was going to harm her child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling Alex\u0027s gaze on her face, she slowly turned to face him. When he spoke, she knew he\u0027d been reading her mind again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t really think I\u0027d hurt the child, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not really. But I know you don\u0027t want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kara, that\u0027s not true.\" His hands tightened on the steering wheel. \"I\u0027d like nothing more thanto have children with you. Dozens of children. But I don\u0027t want to put your life at risk.\" He glanced at her again. \"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I\u0027m nauseous in the morning, but that\u0027s normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all? You don\u0027t feel sick or anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She scooted across the seat and placedher hand on his thigh. \"Couldn\u0027t we be happy about this until we have reason to worry? I\u0027ve never been pregnant before. I don\u0027t want anything to spoil it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try,\" Alex said. He covered her hand with his. \"But I can\u0027t promise not to worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a small wedding chapel in Eagle Flats,\" Alex said. \"Will you marry me, Kara? Will you be my wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Alex, oh, yes.\" She leaned toward him and kissed him on the cheek. \"Everything will be all right. I know it will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, he put his arm around her shoulders and drew herclose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time they reached Darnell, Gail was resigned to staying with Mrs. Zimmermann, but she still wasn\u0027t happy about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Alex pulled into the driveway, Gail got out of the car and slammed the door, then ran into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara squeezed Alex\u0027s hand as he helped her out of the car. \"You look like you\u0027re about to be thrown to the lions,\" she remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like it, too,\" Alex replied. He\u0027d spent years avoiding people whenever possible. He wasn\u0027t looking forward to seeing Kara\u0027s grandmother again, or answering the questions that would inevitably follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, come on,\" Kara said, grinning at him. \"We might as well get it over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena Corley studied Alex through shrewd eyes when Kara introduced him. \"You\u0027re the man from the hospital,\" she said. \"The author.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s a pleasure to see you again, Mrs. Corley,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena Corley slanted a glance in Kara\u0027s direction. \"Have you known my granddaughter long?\" Lena asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said you met in the hospital. You donated some blood, I believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex glanced at Kara. \"I. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Corley, would you mind setting the dining room table? The dishes are in the cabinet against the wall.\" Nancy smiled as she gave Alex a little push. \"Alex, why don\u0027t you make yourself at home? My husband will be here soon. Kara, would you mind helping me in the kitchen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling his gratitude, Alex escaped to the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking Kara into the kitchen, Nancy dragged her to the table and practically pushed her into a chair. \"He\u0027s gorgeous!\" she exclaimed. \"Where on earth did you meet him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story,\" Kara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the Reader\u0027s Digest condensed version.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a married woman, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know, and I love my husband, but good grief, girl, he\u0027s out of this world!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara couldn\u0027t help it, she laughed. \"You\u0027ve got that right,\" she replied. \"Listen, I met him while I was in the hospital. We became friends, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara felt her cheeks redden. \"All right, maybe we\u0027re more than friends.\" She hesitated a moment. \"Nancy, I\u0027m pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy sat back in her chair, her expression almost comical. \"Well, I guess you are more than friends. When\u0027s the baby due?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara shook her head. \"I\u0027m not sure.\" She was carrying an alien baby. Would her term be nine months, or would the time be longer or shorter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, except for a little morning sickness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll pass. Have you told Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, but my grandmother doesn\u0027t know, and I\u0027d rather not tell her just yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can keep a secret.\" Nancy shook her head. \"Well, what a day this has been. Guess I\u0027d better fix dinner. Jim will be home soon.\" She pulled some potatoes out of the fridge. \"Wanna help me peel these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, listen, since your grandmother doesn\u0027t know about the baby, she probably doesn\u0027t know you and Alex are . . . I mean . . . anyway, Alex can sleep on the hide-a-bed in the den.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara nodded. \"That will be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evening passed pleasantly. Nancy\u0027s husband and Alex seemed to hit it off and the conversation at the dinner table was relaxed and easy, as if they\u0027d all been friends for years instead of hours. At one point, Nancy mentioned that her sister was expecting a baby, which led the women into a discussion of pregnancy and childbirth. Kara listened avidly, only then realizing how very little she actually knew about having a baby. She\u0027d never realized babies required so many things_baby clothes, cribs, diapers, bottles, playpens, high chairs_the list seemed to go on and on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner, they watched television for a while. About nine o\u0027clock Nana and Mrs. Zimmermann retired to their beds. Nancy and her husband said good-night an hour later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gail, I think it\u0027s time we called it a night, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only ten o\u0027clock!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but it won\u0027t hurt you to go to bed early for once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all right. Good-night, Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara kissed Alex on the cheek. \"See you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone in the living room, Alex switched off the TV, then went out into the backyard. Head back, he stared up at the moon, basking in its cool light, sighing as he felt his body rejuvenate itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very idea scared the hell out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex? Are you awake?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Is anything wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I\u0027m just lonely for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome to me, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back into the house; moments later, Kara was sitting beside him on the sofa. He drew her into his arms, holding her close, grateful beyond words that she was alive and well, that they were together again, as they were meant to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need for words between them. He knew her thoughts as he knew his own. Wrapped in his arms, secure in his embrace, she quickly fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her all through the night, content to hold her, to look at her, to walk in her dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the coming of dawn, he woke her with a kiss. \"You\u0027d better go back to your room,\" he said.\"I don\u0027t want to upset your grandmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, either. See you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed him once, twice, and then, reluctantly, slipped out of his arms and went back to her own room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left for Eagle Flats at dusk. Kara hugged Nana, assuring her that she wouldn\u0027t be gone long, and then went to say good-bye to Gail, who was still sulking because she couldn\u0027t go with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember, Gail, not a word to anyone about Alex. And please don\u0027t say anything about the baby to Nana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" Gail said, her expression sullen. \"Are you going to marry him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you wanted a big wedding in a church, with bridesmaids and flowers and stuff like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t always have everything we want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gail, please don\u0027t make this difficult. Maybe when this mess is straightened out, we\u0027ll have that church wedding, and you can be my maid of honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just saying that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gail, have I ever lied to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m not lying now. Take care of Nana for me. I\u0027ll call when I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" With a sniff, Gail threw her arms around her sister and hugged her tight. \"Be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-bye, Gail,\" Alex said, coming up to stand beside Kara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Bye. You\u0027d better take good care of my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, don\u0027t worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA last hug, a last wave, and they were on their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your side?\" Alex asked after a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine. A little sore is all.\" She slid across the seat and rested her head on his shoulder. \"How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never told me how you managed to get away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bribed Hamblin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again? How much did it cost you this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hundred and fifty grand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have that much money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I never realized there was so much money to be made from writing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been a lucrative career,\" Alex said, grinning. \"I\u0027m supposed to meet Hamblin at the bank at ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long are we going to stay in Eagle Flats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Not long. As soon as you feelup to it, we\u0027ll leave. Where would you like to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t stay in Moulton Bay as long as Barrett\u0027s looking for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara nodded. \"He doesn\u0027t seem like the type to give up, does he?\" She stared ahead at the road for a few minutes, then asked, \"What about Gail, and Nana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once we\u0027re settled, you can send for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded her agreement even though she wasn\u0027t crazy about the idea of moving. She liked it here. Her job was here . . . her job! She hadn\u0027t thought about her job in weeks. When they reached Eagle Flats, she\u0027d have to call her boss and try to explain. Or maybe just call and quit, if they hadn\u0027t already replaced her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, she realized she no longer had to work. She was about to become the wife of a rich man. The thought made her smile. She could stay home, be a housewife. And a mother . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long are women pregnant on ErAdona?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nine months, just like here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she mused, that was a relief. \"Are you hoping for a boy or a girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. So long as it\u0027s healthy. So long as you survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like a boy,\" she said. \"One with black hair and dark eyes, just like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like you . . .Her words echoed in his mind. Just like you. Would his child have to live forever in the shadows, unable to run and play in the sun? Would they have to hide it away from the world? Would it even survive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, you promised not to worry until there was something to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reading my mind, natayah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, just the expression on your face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be in Eagle Flats soon. You haven\u0027t changed your mind about marrying me, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She glanced at her attire, and frowned. \"I would like to be married in something a little nicer than jeans and a sweater. Do you think we could go shopping tonight, and get married tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you wish.\" He smiled at her, his heart filled with love and tenderness. \"What would you like me to wear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A black suit, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what will you wear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I always dreamed of getting married in a long white dress in a church filled with flowers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt you always dreamed of marrying a human male, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have to settle for less than your dreams, Kara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re every dream I\u0027ve ever had,\" she said fervently. \"Anyway, we can have a big wedding later, if it\u0027s all right with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you don\u0027t want to marry me,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve been nothing but trouble since you met me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kara! You\u0027re the best thing that\u0027s ever happened to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at him. \"And I feel the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Kara,\" he said softly. \"Forgive me for being such a fool. It\u0027s just that I feel you deserve so much more than you\u0027re getting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I complaining?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But then, you never do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. So, it\u0027s all settled. We\u0027ll shop tonight and get married tomorrow. And live happily ever after, just like Cinderella and the prince.\" She stared at him as a new thought crossed her mind. \"Alex, we can\u0027t get married! We don\u0027t have a license.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a minister who will marry us, Kara. He\u0027s a big fan of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Eagle Flats mall wasn\u0027t overly large, but it had several nice shops. Alex bought a black suit and tie, a white shirt, new shoes and socks, then sat on a hard-backed chair while Kara tried on dresses. It took her an hour to find one she liked, and then she refused to let him see it, saying it was bad luck for the groom to see the bride\u0027s dress before the wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was near midnight when they reached the cavern. They put away the groceries they\u0027d bought just before they left town, then settled in front of the fireplace. Only then did Alex recall he was supposed to meet Hamblin at the bank. He swore under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" Kara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex shrugged. \"Nothing. I was supposed to meet Hamblin at the bank at ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can do it tomorrow, can\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded. Tomorrow would have to be soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was near dawn when they went to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara snuggled up to Alex, her head pillowed on his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow night, she mused sleepily. Tomorrow night she would be Mrs. Alexander J. Claybourne. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deeper-than-the-night/page-33.html","bookId":2308,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:00 PM"}
