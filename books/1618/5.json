Will his shirt be open?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly she lifted her chin. A dozen tiny buttons marched up the broad, flat plane of the man’s belly and chest. A collar rested just below his throat, its points draping long and loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strong chin. Dark stubble on a strong chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God, oh God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man holding her looked down, and time stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHazel eyes pinned her. They were steady and bright, the color of his velvet jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThick waves of chestnut brown hair rested over his collar. Just then the wind tousled it from his brow. A high brow framing . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my. So handsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis features were fine, chiseled into clear skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicity felt a zing, like a single firework crackling through her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re awake.” His voice was low, accented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicity let her head sink back, relaxing onto his arm. She felt a big, stupid grin spread like molasses over her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows furrowed as he contemplated her. Still she couldn’t wipe the dumb smile from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you still drunk, lass?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLass. He called me lass!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s hope not,” she murmured. Exhaling something like a dreamy sigh, she nuzzled into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow strange, though. Were they somehow at the Renaissance Faire, in Golden Gate Park? Nothing really looked familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmmm. She studied him. Ren faire guy. Made sense. His accent could use a little work, though. But, man, he was hot. She could play along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething struck her, and she glanced around. There were no roads. “Where are we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah!” the man at their side exclaimed. “Our fair maiden has decided to join the land of the living.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are currently trying to get our hides safely out of England,” the man holding her said evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“England?” She scrunched her brow. “Is that part of the fantasy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If only!” The red- haired man barked a laugh. “A fantasy. That’s rich . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” her guy said, “ ’tis England indeed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngland? She stiffened, her heart kicking up a notch. He couldn’t be serious. How the hell could she have landed in England? Unless they’d kidnapped her. But how? Her apartment had actual bars on the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’d I get here? Did Livvie set this up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think she’s still feeling her wine,” the red- haired man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she protested. She’d been mustering outrage, but confusion made her voice small. “I’m not drunk.” She inhaled deeply, and trying to gather herself, focused on the rhythmic sway of the horse’s gait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorse. What was up with the horses, anyway? Clearly these guys weren’t kidnappers. Two horses weren’t exactly the fastest getaway. A kid on a skateboard could pass them. If there’d been any roads. Which there weren’t. Here in England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut of course there were roads in England. So why weren’t there any roads here? Even in those British movies where everyone hied to their country manors by carriage, there were roads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this? This looked like . . . like the land of Robin Hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart slammed harder in her chest as she tried to make sense of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d made a wish. She’d made a wish and ended up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just needed to figure out where here was. She craned her head. Bucolic fields stretched gently before them, like paradise. He’d said England, but there was nothing modern, as far as the eye could see. She’d traveled to some pretty remote spots in her life, and still, you could always see something. Distant cars, power lines, something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut here there were just horses, and men in fancy velvet coats, and lush landscape all around. Just like Robin Hood. Or like a fairy tale. Some strange world offering a snapshot from the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be the past? She gave a breathy laugh. No way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t have been transported from the real world, from her world. She was supposed to show up for the morning shift. She’d waited weeks for that cute coffee shop to have an opening. And who’d water all her plants?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe her mind was playing tricks on her. She could only manage shallow breaths now, as though her chest had shrunk. She did another scan of the countryside. Impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo cars, no airplanes, no telephone wires. No modern world. Anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hang on,” she said suddenly. She was losing it. People didn’t just land in fairy tales. She’d call Livvie, get a reality check. “A phone. Do you have a phone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have we a what?” the red-haired man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Telephone?” she asked in disbelief. “No? You don’t . . . You don’t know a Maid Marian, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tele . . .” The man holding her glared. “Is that French?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve never heard of a phone,” she muttered, her heart thundering now. “But you speak English, right? Here in . . . England? Where you don’t have phones?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngland. She studied the sword dangling from the red-haired man’s hip. Old England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had she done? That crazy candle. How would she ever get back? And what about Livvie? Livvie would be so worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly crap. Could it really be the past? Didn’t they have all kinds of wars in the past? And plagues? Oh God, plagues. Why hadn’t she paid more attention in history class?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, be cool. Maybe it wasn’t what it seemed. She didn’t seem to be in any immediate danger. How to handle it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strained eyes and ears for some sign of life, but there was nothing. Hell, there weren’t really even any sounds, apart from the horses. And the breathing of the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the man, behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally managed a deep breath. The man behind her. He sure was hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm down. The universe was telling her something. She just needed to open herself to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose matchmaking dummies had told her she was unmatchable, and the universe had proved them wrong. She apparently did have a true love. He just happened to be . . . medieval dude. Hunky medieval dude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was the past. How bad could it be anyway? People had survived it. No phones, no television. It seemed kind of nice, actually. Simpler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely she could find a way to get word to Livvie—somehow. She’d figure that out later. Her aunt would be so mad if she found out that Felicity had spun out worrying about her instead of just relaxing into the experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head back for another look at the man behind her. She knew one thing—she couldn’t do any better on the One True Love front. He sure was good-l ooking. Seemed like a gentleman. Intense, intelligent eyes. Clean and well-dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he had a castle. Maybe he hung out with princes and stuff. Maybe he was a prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” she said breathily. “Do you have a castle? In England? England . . .” She shook her head, marveling. “Will we get to see stuff like Big Ben, and the Tower of London?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s pray not,” the red-haired man muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man at her back frowned. “I hadn’t counted on needing three, not two, mounts.” He pinned her with narrowed eyes. “ ’Twould be a long journey to Scotland, with you riding pillion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you, Will,” the other man said. “Riding is folly. Our journey is too long. One month in which Cromwell can sniff us out with his dogs? I think not. A boat it must be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scotland?” She pushed up and away from his chest, craning her neck. “I thought you said England. I’ve always wanted to see Scotland too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In time,” he said brusquely. “For now, it’s England. At least until we sort our transportation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re Scottish?” She glanced down at his tartan-clad legs and smiled. “Do you have a kilt too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know,” she said gesturing to his legs, “one of those hot . . . man . . . skirts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. “Aye, I’m a Scotsman, and aye, I’ve a breacan feile.” He spoke slowly and with great effort, as though moderating his patience. “Now, tell us where to bring you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis companion only chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring me?” She had nowhere to be except right where she was. San Francisco was probably still just a stretch of waterfront wilderness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye,” her handsome man said. “We’ll do that much, lass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir eyes locked. Lass. He’d said it again. He’ll wear his kilt and call me lass. Butterflies danced in her belly. “Can you ride horses when you wear your kilt . . . whatchamacallit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low growl escaped him. “Where should I—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, that,” she said, coming back to herself. “I’ve got no place to go. I think . . . I think I’m supposed to be here. What’s your name?” she asked innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-haired man cleared his throat. “Dare we—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rollo,” her man answered, “William Rollo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rollo,” she repeated, sounding the name slowly. “What kind of name is Rollo? It doesn’t sound Scottish. Shouldn’t it be something like MacRollo instead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ ’Tis an old name,” he clipped out. “A Norse name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hail Rollo the Viking!” the red- headed man jested. “Your forefather became none other than the Duke of Normandy, was it? That would’ve been, what, eight hundred years ago?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My Viking . . .” Felicity sighed. She would never mock Livvie or her candles ever again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a Viking,” Rollo snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis companion laughed. “Oh, but you seem quite barbarous to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough.” Rollo nudged their horse into a brisker walk. “Who are you, woman? And where do I deposit you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring him, Felicity turned to the red-headed man. “Are you Scottish too, then? Or do you live here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared, amused, as if she were nuts. “Good luck with this one, Will.” He chuckled. “The name is Ormonde, dear lady. James Butler, the Marquis of Ormonde, so pleased to make your acquaintance. And, if you’re one of Cromwell’s lackeys, I’m afraid I’ll have to kill you now.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-highlands-highlands-4/page-5.html","bookId":1618,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:11 PM"}
