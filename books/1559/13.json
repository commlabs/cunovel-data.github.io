Then I went to the library, closed myself in, hunted out The Princess Bride. It was in pretty good shape, I realized as I checked the binding, which is when I saw it was published by my publishing house, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. This was before that; they weren’t even Harcourt, Brace \u0026amp; World yet. Just plain old Harcourt, Brace period. I flicked to the title page, which was funny, since I’d never done that before; it was always my father who’d done the handling. I had to laugh when I saw the real title, because right there it said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou had to admire a guy who called his own new book a classic before it was published and anyone else had a chance to read it. Maybe he figured if he didn’t do it, nobody would, or maybe he was just trying to give the reviewers a helping hand; I don’t know. I skimmed the first chapter, and it was pretty much exactly as I remembered. Then I turned to the second chapter, the one about Prince Humperdinck and the little kind of tantalizing description of the Zoo of Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s when I began to realize the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that the description wasn’t there. It was, and again pretty much as I remembered it. But before you got to it, there were maybe sixty pages of text dealing with Prince Humperdinck’s ancestry and how his family got control of Florin and this wedding and that child begatting this one over here who then married somebody else, and then I skipped to the third chapter, The Courtship, and that was all about the history of Guilder and how that country reached its place in the world. The more I flipped on, the more I knew: Morgenstern wasn’t writing any children’s book; he was writing a kind of satiric history of his country and the decline of the monarchy in Western civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my father only read me the action stuff, the good parts. He never bothered with the serious side at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout two in the morning I called Hiram in Martha’s Vineyard. Hiram Haydn’s been my editor for a dozen years, ever since Soldier in the Rain, and we’ve been through a lot together, but never any phone calls at two in the morning. To this day I know he doesn’t understand why I couldn’t wait till maybe breakfast. “You’re sure you’re all right, Bill,” he kept saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Hiram,” I began after about six rings. “Listen, you guys published a book just after World War I. Do you think it might be a good idea for me to abridge it and we’d republish it now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure you’re all right, Bill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, absolutely, and see, I’d just use the good parts. I’d kind of bridge where there were skips in the narrative and leave the good parts alone. What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bill, it’s two in the morning up here. Are you still in California?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI acted like I was all shocked and surprised. So he wouldn’t think I was a nut. “I’m sorry, Hiram. My God, what an idiot; it’s only 11:00 in Beverly Hills. Do you think you could ask Mr. Jovanovich, though?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow or the next day, no big deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll ask him anything, only I’m not quite sure I’m getting an accurate reading on exactly what you want. You’re sure you’re all right, Bill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be in New York tomorrow. Call you then about the specifics, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could you make it a little earlier in the business day, Bill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and we hung up and I called Zig in California. Evarts Ziegler has been my movie agent for maybe eight years. He did the Butch Cassidy deal for me, and I woke him up too. “Hey, Zig, could you get me a postponement on the Stepford Wives? There’s this other thing that’s come up.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-13.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
