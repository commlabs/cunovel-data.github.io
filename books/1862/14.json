Mary-Lynnette found\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomfort in Rowan\u0027s nearness, in her levelheadedness.She\u0027d never had a friend before who was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecompletelyher equal, who found it as easy to take care of people as to be taken care of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they reached the gas station, they could see thatthe little group was now clustered around Mary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynnette\u0027s car. Jeremy was peering under the hood.Mark and Jade were back, hand in hand, but there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas no sign of Tiggy. Kestrel was leaning against a gas pump, and Ash was talking to Jeremy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the werewolf walks into the second doctor\u0027s office and he says, \u0027Doc, I think I have rabies.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the doctor says ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for bluffing him, Mary-Lynnette thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan, eyes shut and shoulders tensed, said, \"Ash,that isn\u0027t funny.\" She opened her eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said to Jeremy. \"He doesn\u0027t mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does, but it doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027ve heard worse.\" Jeremy bent over the engine again. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereplaced a cap with careful, even twists. Then he looked up at Mary-Lynnette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette didn\u0027t know what to say. What\u0027s the etiquette when you\u0027ve just discovered that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomebody\u0027s a werewolf? And that it may be their duty to eat you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes filled. She was completely out of control today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy looked away. He shook his head slightly. His mouth was bitter. \"That\u0027s what I figured. I thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027d react this way.

Ash and the sisters looked around reflexively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette said, \"\u0027We\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My family. They first settled here because it was so far out of the way. A place where they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewouldn\u0027t bother anybody, and nobody would bother them. Of course, they\u0027re all gone now.

We don\u0027t like the Night World,either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy gave another faint smile-that smile thatshowed mostly in his eyes. \"I know,\" he said to Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re related to Mrs. Burdock, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was our aunt,\" Kestrel said, her golden gaze fixed unwaveringly on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy\u0027s expression changed slightly.

He looked as if he were leaning against the car for support. \"Who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edid it?\" Then he glanced back at Ash, and Mary-Lynnette saw a gleam of teeth. \"Wait you think I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It did cross our minds at one point,\" Ash said. \"Actually, it seemed to keep crossing them. Back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand forth. Maybe we should put in a crosswalk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette said, \"Ash, stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re saying you didn\u0027t do it,\" Mark said to Jeremy, at the same time as Rowan said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, Kestrel thinks it was a vampire hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was soft, but once again, everybody looked around. The street was still deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no vampire hunter around here,\" Jeremy said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then there\u0027s a vampire,\" Jade said in an excited whisper. \"There has to be, because of the way\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Opal was killed. And the goat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The goat . . . ? No, don\u0027t even tell me. I don\u0027t wanttoknow.\" Jeremy swung Mary-Lynnette\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehood shut. He looked at her and said quickly, \"Everything\u0027s fine in there. You should get the oilchanged\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esometime.\" Then he turned to Rowan. \"I\u0027m sorry about your aunt. But if thereis a vampirearound here, it\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomebody staying hidden. Really hidden. Same if it\u0027s a vampire hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We already figured that out,\" Kestrel said. MaryLynnette expected Ash to chime in, but Ash\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas staring across the street broodingly, his hands in hispockets, apparently having given up on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econversation for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t seen anything that could give you a due?\" Mary-Lynnette said. \"We were going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elookaround town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met her eyes directly. \"If I knew, I\u0027d tell you.\" There was just the slightest emphasis on the last word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I could help you, I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, come along for the ride. You can put your head out of the window,\" Ash said, returning to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did it. Mary-Lynnette marched over, grabbedhim by the arm, and said to the others, \"Excuse us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hauled him in a series of tugs to the back of the gas station. \"You jerk!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, look...................\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut upl\"She jabbed a finger at his throat. It didn\u0027t matter that touching him set off electrical explosions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just gave her another reason to want to kill him. She found that the pink haze was a lot like anger when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou kept shouting through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to be the center of every drama, don\u0027t you?

Even if itmeans hurting somebody who\u0027s only had rotten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreaks all his life. Well, not this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rowan said you guys think all werewolves are low class. And you know what that is? Where I come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom, they call that prejudice. And humans have it, too, andit is not a pretty picture. It\u0027s about the most\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehateful thing in the world. I\u0027m ashamed to even stand there while you spout it off.\" Mary-Lynnette realized\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was crying. She also realized that Mark and Jade were peering around the edge of the gas station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh was flat against the boarded-up window, armsup in a gesture of surrender. He looked at a loss for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewords and ashamed. Good, Mary-Lynnette thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should you keep poking him that way?\" Mark said tentatively. Mary-Lynnette could see Rowan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eandKestrel behind him and Jade. They all looked alarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be friends with anybody who\u0027s a bigot,\"she said to all of them. She gave Ash a jab for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemphasis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not,\" Jade said virtuously.\"Wedon\u0027t be lieve that stupid stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We really don\u0027t,\" Rowan said. \"And Mary-Lynnette-our father is alwaysyellingat Ash for visiting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe wrong kind of people on the Outside. Belonging to a dub that admits werewolves, havingwerewolves\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor friends. The Elders all say he\u0027s too liberal about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. \"Well, he\u0027s got a funny way of showing it,\" Mary-Lynnette said, deflating slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just thought I\u0027d mention that,\" Rowan said.\"Now we\u0027ll leave you alone.\" She herded the others\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback toward the front of the station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were gone, Ash said, \"Can I move now, please?\" He looked as if he was in a very bad\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette gave up. She felt tired, suddenlytired and emotionally drained. Too much had happened\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the last few days. And it kept happening, it never let up, and ... well, she was tired, that\u0027s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027d go away soon, it would be easier,\" shesaid, moving away from Ash.

His name is Quinn. And if my sistersand I don\u0027t go back with him, the whole town is in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrouble. If he thinks anything irregular is going onhere ... You don\u0027t know what the Night Peoplecan do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette could hear her heart beating distinctly.

Nobody would suspect there was anything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eirregular about you.

The sun brought out hidden warm tonesin his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehair, making it a shimmering blond somewherebetween Jade\u0027s and Kestrel\u0027s. His eyes were shadowed,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esome dark color. He stood lanky and elegantas ever, but with one hand in his pocket and a pained\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t frown; you\u0027ll spoil your looks,\" she said. \"For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t patronize mel\" he yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette was startled.

That seemed to be the end of his confession:but.Of course, he didn\u0027t really need to say\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore. Mary-Lynnette, arms folded over her chest, stared at a curved piece of glass on the ground and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etried to think of other phrases that started with in.Besides the obvious. She couldn\u0027t come up with any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe resisted the impulse to nudge the glass with her foot. \"I\u0027m a bad influence on your sisters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said that to protect you. To try and protect you.\"\"I can protect myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve noticed,\" -he said dryly. \"Does that help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You noticing? No, because you don\u0027t really believe it. You\u0027ll always think I\u0027m weaker than\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou, softer ...even if you didn\u0027t say it, I\u0027d know you were thinking it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh suddenly looked crafty. His eyes were as greenas hellebore flowers. \"If you were a vampire, you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewouldn\u0027t be weaker,\" he said. \"Also, you\u0027d know what I was really thinking.\" He held out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want a sample?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette said abruptly, \"We\u0027d better get back. They\u0027re going to think we\u0027ve killed each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let them,\" Ash said, his hand still held out, but Mary-Lynnette just shook her head and walked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was scared. Wherever she\u0027d been going with Ash, she\u0027d been getting in too deep. And she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewondered how much of their conversation had been audible around front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she rounded the corner, her eyes immediately went to Jeremy. He was standing with Kestrel by\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe gas pump. They were dose together, and forjust an instant Mary-Lynnette felt something like startled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen her inner voice asked, Are you insane? You can\u0027t be jealous over him while you\u0027re worrying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhether he\u0027s jealous over you, and meanwhile worrying about what to do with your soulmate.... It\u0027s good\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eif he and Kestrel like each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care; I can\u0027t wait anymore,\" Jade was saying to Rowan on the sidewalk. \"I\u0027ve got to find\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She thinks Tiggy\u0027s gone home,\" Rowan said, seeing Mary-Lynnette. Ash went toward Rowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel did, too. Somehow Mary-Lynnette was left beside Jeremy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, she didn\u0027t know the etiquette. Sheglanced at him-and stopped feeling awkward. He was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewatching her in his quiet, level way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he startled her. He threw a look at thesidewalk and said, \"Mary-Lynnette, be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Be careful. \"It was the same tone he\u0027d used whenwarning her about Todd and Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette followed his gaze ... to Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" Mary-Lynnette said. She didn\u0027t know how to explain. Even his own sisters hadn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebelieved Ash wouldn\u0027t hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy looked bleak. \"I know guys like that.Sometimes they bring human girls to their clubsand you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t want to know why. So just just watch yourself, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a nasty shock. Rowan and the girls had saidsimilar things, but coming from Jeremy it sank in,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomehow. Ash had undoubtedly done things in his life that ... well, that would make her want to kill him if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe knew. Things you couldn\u0027t just forget about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be careful,\" she said. She realized her fists were clenched, and she said with a glimmer of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehumor, \"I can handle him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy still looked bleak. His brown eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edark and his jaw was tight as he looked at Ash. Underhis quietness, Mary-Lynnette could sense leashed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epower. Cold anger. Protectiveness. And the fact that he didn\u0027t like Ash at all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were coming back. \"I\u0027ll be all right,\" Mary-Lynnette whispered quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAloud, Jeremy said, \"I\u0027ll keep thinking about the people around town. I\u0027ll tell you if I come up with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette nodded. \"Thanks, Jeremy.\" She tried to give him a reassuring look as everybody got into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood watching as she pulled out of the gas station. He didn\u0027t wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, so we go home,\" Mark said. \"And then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody answered. Mary-Lynnette realized that she had no idea what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we\u0027d better figure out if we still have anysuspects,\" she said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something else we\u0027ve got to do, first,\" Rowan said softly. \"We vampires, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette could tell just by the way she said it. But Mark asked, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to feed,\" Kestrel said with her most radiant smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey got back to Burdock Farm. There was no sign of the cat. The four vampires headed for the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewoods, Jadecalling for Tiggy, and Mary-Lynnette headed for Mrs. B.\u0027s rolltop desk. She got engraved\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estationery only slightly mildewed at the edges-and a silver pen with a fussy Victorian pattern on it. \"Now,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said to Mark as she sat at the kitchen table. \"We\u0027re going to play List the Suspects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing in this house to eat, you know,\" Mark said. He had all the cupboards open. \"Just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethings like instant coffee and green Jujyfruits. The ones everybody leaves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I say, your girlfriend is undead. Come on. Sit down and concentrate.\" Mark sat down\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand sighed. \"Who have we got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should have gone to find out what the dealwas with that horse,\" Mark said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette stopped with her pen poised overthe stationery. \"You\u0027re right, that must be connected. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforgot about it.\" Which just goes to show you, detective work doesn\u0027t mix with 1-with idle dawdling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" she said grimly. \"So let\u0027s assume that whoever killed the horse was the same person\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho killed Aunt Opal and the goat. And maybe the sameperson who broke the gas station window-that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehap pened last night, too. Where does that get us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it was Todd and Vic,\" Mark said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not being helpful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious. You know how Todd is always chewing on that toothpick. And there were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoothpicks stuck in the goat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToothpicks... now, what did that remind her of? No, not toothpicks, the bigger stakes. Why couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe remember ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her forehead, giving up. \"Okay...I\u0027llput Todd and Vic, vampire hunters, with a question\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emark. Unless you think they\u0027re vampires themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope,\" Mark said, undeterred by her sarcasm. \"I think Jade would\u0027ve noticed that when she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edrank their blood.\" He eyed her thoughtfully. \"You\u0027re the smart one. Who doyou think did it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea.\" Mark made a face at her, andshe doodled a stake on the stationery. The doodle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echanged into a very small stake, more like a pencil,held by a feminine hand. She never could draw\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God. Bunny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bunny did it?\" Mark asked ingenuously, preparedto be straight man for a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mary-Lynnette said,\"Yes.I mean-no, I don\u0027t know. But those stakes in the goat-the big ones I\u0027ve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseen herusingthem. She uses them on her nails. They\u0027re cuticle sticks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ...\" Mark looked dismayed. \"But I mean ... Bunny . C\u0027mon. She can\u0027t kill a mosquito.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette shook her head, agitated. \"Rowan said she had a lamia name. And she said something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrange to me-Bunny-the day I was looking for Todd and Vic.\" It was all coming back now, a flood of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ememories that she didn\u0027t particularly want. \"She said, \u0027Good hunting.\"\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mare, it\u0027s from The Jungle Book .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. It was still weird for her to say. And she\u0027s almosttoosweet and scared-what if it\u0027s all an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eact?\" When Mark didn\u0027t answer, she said, \"Is it any more unlikelythan Todd and Vic being vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So put her down, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette did. Then she said, \"You know, there\u0027s something I keep meaning to ask Rowanabout\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow they wrote to Mrs. B. from thatisland-\" She broke off and tensed as the back door banged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I the first one back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Rowan, windblown and glowing, slightlybreathless. Her hair was a tumbling chestnut loud around\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s everybody else?\" Mary-Lynnette asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We separated early on. It\u0027s the only way, you know, with four of us in this small of an area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Small!\" Mark looked offended. \"If Briar Creekhas one good thing-and I\u0027m not saying it does it\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan smiled. \"For a hunting range, it is small,\"she said. \"No offense. It\u0027s fine for us-we never got to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunt at -all on the island. They brought our mealsto us, tranquilized and completely passive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette pushed away the image this evoked. \"Urn, you want to register a guess on Whodunit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0Rowan sat down in a kitchen chair, smoothing a wisp of brown hair off her forehead. \"I don\u0027t know.

But what about the guy who helped yousmuggle letters off the island? He would know where your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaunt lived, right? He could see the address on the letters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crane Linden.\" Rowan smiled, a sad little smile. \"No, he wouldn\u0027t know.
