Sixteen hundred kilometers of the Obvodnoy Canal, of coming to see her at Kirov, of his tent in Luga, of her holding on to his back, of the hospital room, of St. Isaac’s, of her eating ice cream, of her lying in the sled as he pulled her, nearly out of life. Sixteen hundred kilometers of her giving her food to everyone, of her jumping up and down on the roof under German planes. There were some memories of last winter from which Alexander flinched, recalling them all nonetheless. Her walking alongside him after burying her mother. Her standing motionless in front of three boys with knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo images continually sprang to his mind in a restless, frantic refrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTatiana in a helmet, in strange clothes, covered with blood, covered with stone and beams and glass and dead bodies, herself still warm, herself still breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTatiana on the bed in the hospital, bare under his hands, moaning under his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anyone could make it, would it not be the girl who every morning for four months got up at six-thirty and trudged through dying Leningrad to get her family their bread?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if she had made it, how could she not have written to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl who kissed his hand, who served him tea, and who gazed at him, not breathing as he talked, gazed at him with eyes he had never seen before — was that girl gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas her heart gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease, God, Alexander prayed. Let her not love me anymore, but let her live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a hard prayer for Alexander, but he could not imagine living in a world without Tatiana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnwashed and undernourished, having spent over four days on five different trains and four military jeeps, Alexander got off at Molotov on Friday, June 19, 1942. He arrived at noon and then sat on a wooden bench near the station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander couldn’t bring himself to walk to Lazarevo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not bear the thought of her dying in Kobona, getting out of the collapsed city and then dying so close to salvation. He could not face it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd worse — he knew that he could not face himself if he found out that she did not make it. He could not face returning — returning to what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander actually thought of getting on the next train and going back immediately. The courage to move forward was much more than the courage he needed to stand behind a Katyusha rocket launcher or a Zenith antiaircraft gun on Lake Ladoga and know that any of the Luftwaffe planes flying overhead could instantly bring about his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not afraid of his own death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was afraid of hers. The specter of her death took away his courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Tatiana was dead, it meant God was dead, and Alexander knew he could not survive an instant during war in a universe governed by chaos, not purpose. He would not live any longer than poor, hapless Grinkov, who had been cut down by a stray bullet as he headed back to the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWar was the ultimate chaos, a pounding, soul-destroying snarl, ending in blown-apart men lying unburied on the cold earth. There was nothing more cosmically chaotic than war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tatiana was order. She was finite matter in infinite space. Tatiana was the standard-bearer for the flag of grace and valor that she carried forward with bounty and perfection in herself, the flag Alexander had followed sixteen hundred kilometers east to the Kama River, to the Ural Mountains, to Lazarevo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor two hours Alexander sat on the bench in unpaved, provincial, oak-lined Molotov.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo go back was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo go forward was unthinkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he had nowhere else to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed himself and stood up, gathering his belongings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alexander finally walked in the direction of Lazarevo, not knowing whether Tatiana was alive or dead, he felt he was a man walking to his own execution. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bronze-horseman-the-bronze-horseman-1/page-56.html","bookId":1855,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:28 PM"}
