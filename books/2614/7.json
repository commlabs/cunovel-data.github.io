I must.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, after our conversation in the library, I found myself sitting primly next to my mother, dressed in my finest pale green gown, my red hair drawn up into an elegant style. Mother looked very lovely in her sapphire blue gown as she sat reading her book. May and Father stood near the fireplace, attempting to ward off the drafty chill that haunted the library. We were all quite relieved with our decision to return home, yet anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun had barely set below the mountains when Ilona announced that dinner would soon be ready and that the Prince had returned. So far, the mysterious Prince Vlad had yet to make an appearance and I was quite relieved. I was not looking forward to seeing him after the nightmares I had experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plucked absently at the lace of my dress, my thoughts turning to the journey home. I was desperate to see the old house nestled among the lovely green trees. I wanted to see Andrew and his beautiful wife rush out to greet us and feel their embrace. Perhaps they would throw a lovely party for us. That would be so grand. I would wear my new gown that Mother had bought me in Paris. The dark green one with the flouncy ribbons. Of course, I would have to make a point of acting charitable around Nigel. It would be hard, but I would do anything to escape marrying Prince Vlad. I could perhaps find a way to avoid marrying altogether if I was clever enough. For now, I had to convince my family I was sincere. Perhaps I would write Nigel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swung open and Prince Vlad swept into the room clad all in black, his long reddish hair hanging over his shoulders. Again, I was struck by the intensity of his green eyes. He immediately settled his gaze on me, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How beautiful you look, Lady Glynis, on this most lovely of nights,” Prince Vlad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, sir,” I responded automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Prince Vlad, we are so glad to see you,” Father said as he swiftly placed himself between the Prince and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Earl Wright, good evening. Good evening Lady May, Countess Wright.” Prince Vlad greeted them all as a true gentleman should. “I am so sorry I was called away early this morning. I meant to be here to show you my castle. Some of the areas of my home are quite beautiful and rich with history.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We did look around a bit,” I said rather lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain those bright green eyes settled on me. “Did you? And did you like my home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt unnerved by his tone and almost could not look him in the eye. I forced myself to raise my chin. I felt so bare and exposed under his gaze. “Yes, I suppose. There were many interesting…things.” I thought for a moment of the presence I had felt dwelling in the bowels of the castle and felt a chill down my spine. I immediately dismissed these thoughts, afraid to study them any further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, many interesting things. This castle holds a great history within its walls. And a great many ghosts.” He smiled at us and disregarded Father’s skeptical gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Vlad was such an impressive figure, tall and strong, all dressed in black with his long flowing hair. He seemed almost inhuman: like a god. And like those gods of old, his mouth had cruelty to its curve that frightened me. When he spoke, his voice seemed to vibrate through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I had met Lord Byron, I had felt a great attraction to the poet and had behaved outrageously girlish. With Prince Vlad, I felt an overwhelming magnetism that seemed to pull on me, yet at the same time repulsed me whenever I drew too near to him or felt his gaze upon me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dinner is ready. We should go and sit down before it begins to cool. Ilona and her helpers have worked hard all day to make you a feast.” Prince Vlad motioned us toward the door. “Come, come, all is ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I tried to linger and be the last one to depart. I did not want to go near the Prince. My father realized my discomfort and tried hard to keep the Prince distracted. Inevitably, his green eyes seemed to constantly find me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walked along the corridor, there was a metallic clatter upon the stone floor. Prince Vlad bent down to retrieve what had fallen. My family had already passed on through the doors into the dining room, and I hurried to pass the kneeling Prince. As I neared him, he looked up at me and his gaze caught mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glynis,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared down into his eyes and saw the passion burning in them. The passion he had for me. The deep dark desire that hungered deep inside of him. The intensity of his gaze burned into my soul, and I stood there transfixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not be afraid,” he said as he slowly stood. In his long hand was a golden chain on which a gold dragon dangled from the links.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped, unable to understand how something from my dreams had entered reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad’s sensuous mouth spread into a smile as he held out his arm to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling beguiled, I slipped my hand into the crook of his arm, allowing him to lead me into the dining room. As we entered, I could see the shocked expressions on my family’s face. I slowly withdrew my hand from the Prince’s arm. I recovered myself and slid into the chair he drew back for me. I was seated next to him, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs our dinner began, he turned all his attention to me. Though his English was heavily accented, he made a great effort to speak well, often searching for the right words. I tried to concentrate on eating, but Prince Vlad kept asking me questions. My father tried to divert his attention, but the Prince seemed determined to cast all his attention on me despite my discomfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you enjoy Buda, Lady Glynis?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it was very lovely,” I responded, trying to take a bite of food before he asked another question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We especially enjoyed the beauty of the cathedrals.” My mother smiled sweetly at him. “Which church do you attend in Buda?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have my own personal chapel on my estate,” Vlad said smoothly, returning his gaze to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” My mother was quite persistent. “We saw many grand estates when we were in Buda. Which was yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Prince returned his gaze to her slowly, his green eyes quite intense. “Near the Danube, dear lady. Lady Glynis, did you enjoy the shops?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay cleared her throat and managed to say, “We both did, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you now?” the Prince said in such a way that May reddened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly took another bite of my meal and tried to look busy chewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father sat down his fork and looked directly at the Prince. He wore an expression that said he was done with the games. “Prince, Vlad, I think it only right that I inform you that we plan to leave at dawn. I have already spoken with my driver and guide.” His posture was stiff and his voice cool. He seemed very uncomfortable with Prince Vlad’s behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage erupted in the Prince’s eyes and darkened his features. It literally made me jump in my chair and my spoon clattered to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this you say?” His voice was a veritable roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said we are leaving in the morning, sir. My wife and daughters are tired of our long sojourn and I believe it is best we start our journey home,” my father responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not understand. When I wrote to Sir Stephen, my dearest friend in Buda, I thought I made it very clear that I was interested in a marriage contract with your family.” Vlad’s voice was dark and he was staring straight at my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I know, sir.” My father took a breath. “Perhaps once you arrive in England, we can discuss a marriage between you and my daughter at length.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can speak of it now!” Prince Vlad’s lips were drawn tight beneath his mustache and his strong hands gripped the table. “I am a man of wealth, a man of prestige from a fine family. I have a title. I have power. Why is it you will not grant me your daughter’s hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, you are not known in England. We must consider our daughter’s social standing!” My mother’s temper flared hot, and her eyes were bright with emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps when you are established in England-“\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense!” Vlad cut off my father’s words with an angry snort. “I have told you my plans. I will go to England. I will be accepted there and your daughter will be my princess. Sir Stephen, my dear friend, made it very clear that you were desperate for a husband for your temperamental daughter!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not insult my daughter!” My father was on his feet at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember thinking that the Prince’s comment was actually not far removed from the truth, but my father was now quite furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Vlad also rose to his feet, lowering his tone when he spoke. “It is not my desire, Lord Edric, to insult the woman I desire to be my wife, but your absolute disregard for what is right and proper has made my tongue loose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is right and proper is that we find a suitable husband for our daughter.” My father’s voice was now very sharp. “Surely you must understand our dilemma. Had we known the condition of this castle we never would have journeyed here. We expected an estate such as those we visited in Buda. Our daughters are our greatest treasures. We cannot let Glynis simply marry you because we traveled here under a false impression.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is my ancestral home! How dare you insult it! My house in Buda is very nice, very modern. I can easily provide your daughter with a lifestyle suitable to her station in life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buda is not the place for my daughter,” my mother said firmly. “She belongs in England with her family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are leaving tomorrow, Prince Vlad. I expect you to respect our decision.” My father was curt in his manner, and I felt proud of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Vlad took several deep breaths, then slowly sat down in his chair. “Very well.” He turned his gaze toward me. “You may leave, but Glynis stays.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never!” My mother’s voice was sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely not,” my father’s voice chorused with my Mother’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Vlad gazed at my father evenly, and said, “I will ask you once more, Earl Wright, and your answer had best be the proper one. Will you leave Glynis here to be my bride?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father very calmly regarded the Prince as he tossed down the napkin he had been clutching tightly in one hand. “I would never leave my daughter here. I do not appreciate your damned impertinence. We have decided. We are leaving tomorrow with both our daughters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Vlad chucked deep in his throat. “Very well. You have decided your own destiny. Leave tomorrow morning. But remember, your fate was of your own choosing.” His words were ominous and I shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Antoinetta, Glynis, May, come along. Good evening, Prince Vlad, we shall retire now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had never heard my father speak so forcibly before and it made me proud, yet afraid. I could feel Prince Vlad’s eyes on me as I trailed behind Father. Impulsively, just as I was about to pass through the doorway, I turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis feet were propped up on the corner of the table while he stared at me with wild glee in his eyes. He chuckled to himself, his eyes reflecting the red color of the flames in the fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sleep well, Glynis,” he called after me, and threw back his head, howling with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fled after father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, my mother double-checked the bolt on my door. “All is packed, correct?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Mother. All save my traveling clothes and nightgown.” I sat on the bed brushing out my long red hair. “I shall be ready as soon as it is morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will be glad to be away from this ghastly place. That horrible Prince Vlad frightened me so. But your father was quite strong, and I was very proud of him.” Mother walked over and laid a kiss on my cheek. “We shall soon be away from this place and all will be as it should be. Now, sleep well, my dearest, and make sure to bolt the door behind me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her to the door, kissed her cheek fondly, then shut and locked the door behind her. I was relieved that soon we would depart from this place, yet I felt unsettled and wary. I glanced warily about, studying the shadows. The floor was cold against my bare feet and I hurried to the bed. Leaping onto it, I snatched up the covers, drawing them tight over my body. The bed still smelled odd, but I was so cold and tired, I did not mind. I curled up under the covers, nestling down. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-7.html","bookId":2614,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM"}
