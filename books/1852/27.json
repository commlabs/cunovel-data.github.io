It will give me something to do, Alec, and I\u0027l ask others to do the actual work. I\u0027l just direct them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t have the heart to deny her. \"You won\u0027t lift a finger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Before she could waylay him again, he told her to let go of his leg, else he\u0027d drag her with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t look as if she believed that threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to sigh over her attitude. Then he put her out of his mind and turned his attention to more important considerations. It was only later in the day, when Gavin caught up with him, that he recal ed Jamie\u0027s remark about helping her sister get comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d thought she meant for a long day\u0027s visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d obviously meant forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAye, he understood well enough when Gavin announced that Lady Kincaid had given her sister sanctuary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fergusons had declared war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec knew Daniel had to be fighting angry. He sent Gavin back home to keep an eye on his wife, placed another trusted soldier in charge of continuing the hunt, and then headed for Ferguson land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was able to intercept Daniel near the border separating their lands. Alec rode alone—a deliberate choice, that—but Daniel had a smal army with him. all were armed for battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec forced his stal ion to a halt and waited for Daniel to make the first move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t long in coming. Daniel drew his sword, threw it into the air so the tip of the blade would imbed itself in the ground directly in front of Alec\u0027s stal ion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe action was a symbol that war had been declared. Now Daniel waited for Alec to repeat the ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel\u0027s expression was impassive, yet quickly changed to a look of real astonishment when Alec shook his head, refusing to throw his weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dare refuse to do battle?\" Daniel bel owed. He was so angry the veins stood out on the sides of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right I do,\" Alec bel owed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Daniel\u0027s turn to shake his head. \"What game are you playing, Alec?\" he demanded to know, though he no longer sounded as if he were spitting hot embers out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027l not fight a war I don\u0027t want to win,\" Alec stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to win?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the hel not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daniel, do you honestly believe I want two Englishwomen in my household?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat question took some of Daniel\u0027s anger away. \"But—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I won, I\u0027d have Mary living with Jamie for the rest of my days. You ask too much of me, friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t agree to give my wife sanctuary?\" Daniel asked. A hint of a smile mel owed his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not,\" Alec returned in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wife dared to protect Mary from me, Alec. From me . And my wife let her. Hid behind her back like a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re English, Daniel. Your error was in forgetting that fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tis the truth,\" Daniel admitted with a sigh. \"I did forget. I don\u0027t wish my wife to act the coward, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s shameful the way she makes her little sister—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She isn\u0027t a coward, Daniel,\" Alec interjected. \"She\u0027s been trained to act that way. Jamie had all her sisters believing she would protect them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel grinned. \"They\u0027re both daft.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, they are,\" Alec agreed. \"We\u0027ve been friends too long to let women force a breach between us. I\u0027ve come to you in good faith, Daniel, to ask…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enay, to demand you return to my holding and col ect your wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I just been given a command?\" Daniel asked, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I stil ache for a fight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will accommodate you,\" Alec drawled. \"But the rules will have to be changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel was intrigued by the laughter in Alec\u0027s voice. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winner takes both brides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel threw back his head and shouted with laughter. Alec had helped him save face in front of his men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d all owed him to back down without looking like a loser. \"You wouldn\u0027t give up your prize, Alec, but it warms my heart to know you aren\u0027t having such an easy time with your wife, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll settle in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have my doubts about Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A firm hand is all that\u0027s needed, Daniel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel dismissed his soldiers before answering Alec\u0027s comment. \"A firm hand and a gag, Alec. The woman hasn\u0027t quit complaining since we reached my home. Do you know, she actually took exception to the fact I have a mistress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec smiled. \"They\u0027re funny that way,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I\u0027l let her stay with Jamie…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There would be war then, Daniel. Mary belongs to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have seen the pair of them, Alec.\" He withdrew his sword from the ground, replaced it in his sheath before adding, \"Your wife was protecting Mary, all the while hurling insults at me. She called me a pig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been called worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, but only by men, and they didn\u0027t live long enough to boast of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My wife has a temper,\" Alec admitted, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish some of it would rub off on Mary. The woman acts like a frightened rabbit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in the midst of tracking down Angus\u0027s attackers when I was informed of this problem,\" Alec said, turning the topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We heard what happened,\" Daniel answered. \"What say I ride with you on this hunt? I understand the mountain barons were responsible?\" Daniel asked, referring to the band of men who\u0027d been cast out of their clans and had formed a unit of their own. They were called barons because it was a title the English valued, and therefore the most offensive name the Highlanders could come up with. It was fitting as well , for like the English, these mountain men were also blackguards who fought without honor or conscience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome to come along, Daniel, but first you must take Mary home. You can catch up with us near the Peak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Alec nor Daniel spoke again until they\u0027d reached Alec\u0027s home. Jamie was standing next to her sister in the center of the courtyard. She smiled when she saw her husband until she got a good look at his face. Her smile faded away then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God, Daniel looks as if he wants to kil me,\" Mary whispered, moving closer to her sister\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smile, Mary, it will confuse him,\" Jamie instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec dismounted and slowly advanced toward his wife. He certainly wasn\u0027t smiling. God\u0027s truth, his expression could have curdled milk. Jamie took a deep breath. \"Have you finished your hunt, Alec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored her question. \"Did you give Lady Ferguson sanctuary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sanctuary?\" Jamie repeated. \"I hadn\u0027t quite thought of it in that light, husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger in his tone burned her like a hot iron. Jamie\u0027s temper ignited. How dare he criticize her in front of their guests? \"Mary asked me if she could stay here, and I gave her permission,\" she said. \"If you want to cal it sanctuary, then by all means do so. I would protect Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protect her from her own husband?\" Alec asked, looking incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the husband happens to be an unfeeling clout, aye,\" Jamie answered. She paused to frown up at Daniel, then turned back to her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has abused her tender feelings, Alec. What would you have had me do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have you mind your own affairs,\" Alec snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was cruel to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, he was,\" Mary shouted, catching her sister\u0027s fever. \"If it isn\u0027t convenient for me to stay here, then I\u0027l find my way back to England.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just might lead the way,\" Jamie muttered. She folded her hands together and waited for Alec to respond to that threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d end up in Normandy,\" Alec predicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Jamie could answer, Alec turned to Mary. He glared at her until she left his wife\u0027s side; then he hauled Jamie into his arms. His grip was like steel. Jamie didn\u0027t resist, knowing how futile that would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, she\u0027d just spotted Father Murdock standing on the steps, watching them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe certainly didn\u0027t want a man of the cloth to think she was unladylike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going home with you, Daniel,\" Mary shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat chal enge didn\u0027t go unanswered. Daniel moved with astonishing speed for such a big man. Before Mary could let out a full scream, she found herself face down over her husband\u0027s lap in the saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie desperately tried to maintain her dignity through this monstrous situation. Poor Mary was draped over the saddle like a sack of barley. It was a humiliation, aye, but Jamie stil wished Mary wouldn\u0027t carry on so. Her bel ows of outrage were drawing even more attention to her sorry plight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stand idle while he shames her this way,\" Jamie whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes you can,\" Alec stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec, do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to interfere and neither are you,\" he answered. \"Mary\u0027s getting off lightly, Jamie. Daniel\u0027s temper is almost as fierce as my own. Your sister has disgraced her husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie watched Daniel and Mary until they\u0027d disappeared across the planks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t really hurt her, will he, Alec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fear was very evident. Alec thought it unreasonable. \"He won\u0027t beat her, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re worrying about,\" he answered. \"Mary\u0027s his problem now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She forgot her horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t be needing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie was staring up at Alec\u0027s mouth, remembering what it felt like to be kissed by him. It was such a foolish thought, especial y now, what with Mary\u0027s problem stil to be solved, but she couldn\u0027t seem to help herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I shal take her horse over to her tomorrow,\" Jamie said, wondering how she could get him to kiss her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of her and started to walk away. She didn\u0027t want him to leave just yet. \"Alec? You said Daniel\u0027s temper was almost as quick as your own, yet you told me you didn\u0027t have a temper. \u0027Tis an odd contradiction, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You misunderstood,\" Alec answered. \"I told you I wouldn\u0027t lose my temper with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started down the hil . Jamie picked up her skirts and chased after him. \"When do you lose your temper, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t resist the temptation. His wife was so incredibly easy to bait. He didn\u0027t turn around because he didn\u0027t want her to see his smile. \"When it\u0027s something that matters to me. Something important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gasp made his smile widen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jamie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" She sounded as if she wanted to throttle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t inconvenience me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the last insult she was going to take from him. \"Look, Kincaid, it isn\u0027t necessary to harp on the fact that you find me so vastly inferior. I understand your meaning clearly,\" she announced. \"If I were to run away, you wouldn\u0027t even come after me, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course you wouldn\u0027t come after me. I\u0027m too insignificant to bother with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I wouldn\u0027t come after you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie had to lower her gaze to the ground lest he turn around and see how much his words had hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did she care if he came after her or not? The man was a Scottish barbarian, she reminded herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d send someone after you.\" He finally turned around and caught her in his arms. \"But since you aren\u0027t going anywhere, the question isn\u0027t important, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m beginning to dislike you immensely, Alec Kincaid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really should do something about your temper, English.\" He brushed his hand across her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to stay out of trouble while I\u0027m gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as much of a good-bye as she was going to get, she supposed, when he mounted his steed and left her staring after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand touched her cheek where Alec had stroked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she straightened her shoulders and jerked her hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost hated him. Almost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered he\u0027d given her permission to rearrange his kitchens. It was only a little chore, she realized, but it was stil a beginning. He would come to depend on her eventual y, when he saw how much nicer his home was going to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie straightened her shoulders and started up the hil . She\u0027d best get started right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled with new enthusiasm.

The recounting always began the same way, too, with the announcement that the Kincaid warrior had just been given the last rites, he had, and was only a breath away from death. That beginning always gained just the amount of astonishment each storytel er wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe members of the clans attending the annual spring festival at Gil ebrid\u0027s holding heard the news a short half-day after they\u0027d been told Angus was dead. Lydia Louise, Angus\u0027s younger sister and only relative, save for his wife, Elizabeth, was in quite a state. She wept first with true anguish over her brother\u0027s untimely death, then wept with acute relief over his miraculous recovery. By long day\u0027s end, the confused woman had to be given a sizable dose of heavy wine and forceful y put to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of the McPherson clan attended the festival. The old chieftain\u0027s only child, a son of just three wee months, was doing so poorly the clan was convinced he was dying. The bairn, given a stubborn streak he\u0027d inherited from his father, had suddenly taken an extreme dislike to his mama\u0027s milk.
