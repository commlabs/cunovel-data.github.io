Are you listening, Bateman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No he wasn\u0027 t,\" Evelyn says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes he was, but his name wasn\u0027t Stash last time. It was Horseshoe or Magnet or Lego or something equally adult,\" Price sneers. \"I forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Timothy, what are you going on about?\" Evelyn asks tiredly. \"I\u0027m not even listening to you.\" She wets a cotton ball, wipes it across her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we were at Odeon.\" Price sits up with some effort. \"And don\u0027t ask me why, but I distinctly remember him ordering the tuna cappuccino.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carpaccio,\" Evelyn corrects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Evelyn dear, love of my life. I distinctly remember him ordering the tuna cappuccino,\" Price says, staring up at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said carpaccio,\" she counters, running the cotton ball over her eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cappuccino,\" Price insists. \"Untilyou corrected him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t even recognize him earlier tonight,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh but I do remember him,\" Price says, turning to me. \"Evelyn described him as \u0027the good-natured body builder.\u0027 That\u0027s how she introduced him. I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shut up,\" she says, annoyed, but she looks over at Timothy in the mirror and smiles flirtatiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean I doubt Stash makes the society pages of W, which I thought was your criterion for choosing friends,\" Price says, staring back, grinning at her in his wolfish, lewd way. I concentrate on the Absolut and cranberry I\u0027m holding and it looks like a glassful of thin, watery blood with ice and a lemon wedge in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on with Courtney and Luis?\" I ask, hoping to break their gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god,\" Evelyn moans, turning back to the mirror. \"The really dreadful thing about Courtney is not that she doesn\u0027t like Luis anymore. It\u0027s that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They canceled her charge at Bergdorf\u0027s?\" Price asks. I laugh. We slap each other high-five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Evelyn continues, also amused. \"It\u0027s that she\u0027s really in love with her real estate broker. Some little twerp over at The Feathered Nest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Courtney might have her problems,\" Tim says, inspecting his recent manicure, \"but my god, what is a... Vanden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh don\u0027t bring this up,\" Evelyn whines and starts brushing her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vanden is a cross between... The Limited and... used Benetton,\" Price says, holding up his hands, his eyes closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I smile, trying to integrate myself into the conversation. \"Used Fiorucci.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Tim says. \"I guess.\" His eyes, now open, zone in on Evelyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Timothy, lay off,\" Evelyn says. \"She\u0027s a Camden girl. What do you expect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh god,\" Timothy moans. \"I am so sick of hearing Camden -girl problems. Oh my boyfriend, I love him but he loves someone else and oh how I longed for him and he ignored me and blahblah blahblahblah - god, how boring. College kids. It matters, you know? It\u0027s sad, right Bateman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Matters. Sad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, Bateman agrees with me,\" Price says smugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh he does not.\" With a Kleenex Evelyn wipes off whatever she rubbed on. \"Patrick is not a cynic, Timothy. He\u0027s the boy next door, aren\u0027t you honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No I\u0027m not,\" I whisper to myself. \"I\u0027m a f**king evil psychopath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh so what,\" Evelyn sighs. \"She\u0027s not the brightest girl in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hah! Understatement of the century!\" Price cries out. \"But Stash isn\u0027t the brightest guy either. Perfect couple. Did they meet on Love Connection or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave them alone,\" Evelyn says. \"Stash is talented and I\u0027m sure we\u0027re under estimating Vanden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a girl...\" Price turns to me. \"Listen, Bateman, this is a girl - Evelyn told me this - this is a girl who rented High Noon because she thought it was a movie about\" - he gulps - \"marijuana farmers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just hit me,\" I say. \"But have we deciphered what Stash - I assume he has a last name but don\u0027t tell me, I don\u0027t want to know, Evelyn - does for a living?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First of all he\u0027s perfectly decent and nice,\" Evelyn says in his defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man asked for chocolate chip sorbet for Christ sakes!\" Timothy wails, disbelieving. \"What are you talking about?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-8.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
