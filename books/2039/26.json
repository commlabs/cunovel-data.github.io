Her feelings weren\u0027t that hard to understand, considering that she\u0027d been a prisoner there, serving as Storm King\u0027s forced mistress-not unlike my own experiences now. Just as she tried to ignore what Roland and I did for a living, she also tried to ignore the gentry blood in me, treating me as though I were fully human and often refusing to hear otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, I was a bit surprised that she took everything better than Roland did when we got back to Tucson. I knew they had discussions when I wasn\u0027t around. He filled her in on what had happened in Yellow River, how I\u0027d been practicing magic on the sly, and how I was now the reigning monarch of a fairy kingdom. He told her about Leith too. If she was shocked by any of it, if she was repulsed by it and hated me for what I\u0027d become...well, she never let on. She was just...well, my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set me up in my old bedroom. It hadn\u0027t changed much over the years and even still had the same glow-in-the-dark stars I\u0027d stuck to the ceiling. When I\u0027d put them there in my youth, she had fretted that they\u0027d never come off without ripping out part of the paint. So, I guess she\u0027d never bothered in all these years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoland knew someone who knew someone who came and did a field surgery on my shoulder, removing the bullet and leaving me with pain meds and antibiotics. That was about all I saw of Roland in those initial days of recovery. It was my mom who stayed with me the most, talking about anything that wasn\u0027t Otherworldly and making sure I had entertainment in the form of books and TV. I could pay little attention to those diversions, though, not when my mind was on so many other things. I would turn the events of the previous weeks over and over in my head until I grew too weary to string any coherent thoughts together. When I reached that exhausted point, I would usually just let my mind go blank for a while. It was oddly soothing, particularly since I so often woke up from nightmares about Leith. An empty mind was sometimes welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was my mother I went to when my period came. She\u0027d already bought a pregnancy test too, just for peace of mind. When it came out negative, I stared sobbing. My mom held me in bed and rocked me the whole time, saying, \"I know, baby, I know.\" It was odd because I didn\u0027t even know why I was crying. The negative test was a good thing, and I was glad there were no loose ends with Leith. As she held me-the first time I\u0027d really let anyone touch me since Art\u0027s house-I suddenly wondered how she had felt when she was pregnant with me. Had she been repulsed by the thought of the half-gentry child forced on her? Had she wanted to get rid of me but been unable to in the Otherworld? I shuddered, not wanting to ponder that too much. Thinking I was cold, she went and got me a sweater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a few days later that Roland and I finally talked. I was more mobile then and had come downstairs to make a bowl of cereal in the kitchen. He strolled in and joined me, sitting at the table with his coffee. His face seemed to have more lines than the last time I\u0027d seen him. My fault, no doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said when the silence grew too hard to bear. \"I...I should have told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up from his cup. \"Which part exactly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of it. Everything. I...\" I sighed. \"You were always so mad that I was spending time in the Otherworld at all. I thought you\u0027d be upset if you knew the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, believe me, I\u0027m much more upset to hear it now than I would have been then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said again, not knowing what else to say. \"It all just happened so fast. There was that fight with Aeson-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know. Kiyo gave me the details of that, though he too was a bit surprised to find out you can conjure up hurricanes worthy of Storm King now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I\u0027m a long way from that. And once I started learning the magic...I just can\u0027t stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Roland sighed. \"He\u0027s been by a couple of times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a moment to realize he meant Kiyo, not Storm King. \"I\u0027m not ready to see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" There was a pause, and I think it took a lot for Roland to say his next words. \"He\u0027s not so bad. Relatively speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a sad half-smile. \"Yeah, he\u0027s great.\" And I meant it...but something was bothering me about Kiyo, something that kept nudging me in the back of my head. I continued to ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what happens now?\" Roland asked. \"What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared in surprise. \"Well...what else would I do? The same thing I\u0027ve been doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, running back and forth between the worlds, trying to act like you have some semblance of a normal life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone of his voice hurt me. \"What do you expect me to do? And it\u0027s not like our lives have ever been normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"This is different. You can\u0027t do this. You can\u0027t literally live in two worlds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI munched on my cereal for a moment to give me a chance to think. \"I don\u0027t really see that I have a choice. That land is bound to me. If I neglect it, it dies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoland said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on! You think I should do that? Abandon it and let all those people suffer? You\u0027re as bad as Art.\" The mystery of what had happened to Art\u0027s body and to Abigail was...well, a mystery. No one had told me exactly, save that it had \"been taken care of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoland\u0027s eyes flashed with anger. \"No, I\u0027m nothing like him. Don\u0027t ever make that mistake. But the gentry aren\u0027t our people. They aren\u0027t your people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are now,\" I said, surprising myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, his entire posture weary and defeated. \"I don\u0027t know what to think anymore. I don\u0027t know what to think of you. I don\u0027t even feel like I know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all these years together, he\u0027d never raised a hand to me. But in that moment, it was like he\u0027d slapped me. \"What does that mean?\" I asked. I meant to sound defiant. Instead, my words came out very small and very scared, much like a pleading child\u0027s. I remembered how grateful I\u0027d been to see him at Art\u0027s. My father. My protector. \"Do you not...do you not love me anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d started to walk away but paused to look back. His blue eyes took me in for several moments. \"Of course. I will always love you. You\u0027re my daughter. But...I\u0027m not sure if things can ever be the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoland walked out of the kitchen, and that\u0027s when I realized it was time for me to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim nearly knocked me over when I got back to my own house. My mom had called him to tell him I was okay when I\u0027d first come to her place, but between my recovery week and the week at Art\u0027s with no contact, Tim had done a fair amount of freaking out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened? Are you okay? I dealt with Lara while you were gone. You would have been proud.\" I smiled, more pleased that he\u0027d called her by her first name instead of \"bitch secretary.\" \"Do you want me to make you something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like my mom,\" I teased. \"Always wanting to feed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"You\u0027re too skinny. And I don\u0027t say that lightly, considering the kinds of girls I go after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right both about me and his choice in women. They\u0027d fed me at Art\u0027s, but I\u0027d hardly eaten any of it. I\u0027d lost a lot of weight, and while part of me wanted to bulk back up by tapping the bag of Milky Way candy bars in my pantry, I knew I should probably be delving into some serious nutrition for a change. So, I dispatched Tim to cook up some steak stir-fry, a request he was more than eager to accomodate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the rest of the day restless and bored, unsure of what to do with myself. I did some laundry, despite Tim\u0027s protests that he could do it, and scarfed down lots of his stir-fry. The animals were all there, which led me to believe Kiyo was still staying there too. After I\u0027d refused to see him at my parents\u0027, I half-expected him to have moved out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, I wasn\u0027t sure what to do now. I didn\u0027t plan on going to the Otherworld anytime soon, and there was no way-as I told Lara later on the phone-that I could take any new jobs for a while. This made both Tim and her nervous about my accounting, but I knew my savings account was at least temporarily secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy magic I left completely alone. I wasn\u0027t going near that, even though there were times the air and the water vapor around me would call to me like a siren\u0027s song, and I\u0027d burn to touch them. The one bit of magic I did use was shamanic: I tried to summon Volusian. He didn\u0027t come. I wasn\u0027t sure what to think of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was almost grateful for nightfall so that I could go to bed and stop trying to figure out things to pass the time. I wondered if this apathy was just a natural consequence of the trauma I\u0027d been through, some kind of numbed state. TV, my puzzles, even Tim\u0027s cheery chatter...none of it could hold my attention. I wasn\u0027t bored, exactly. I just wasn\u0027t very engaged with the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, just as I used to do, I dreamed of the Thorn Land. The dream was so vivid and real. It was like I\u0027d stepped outside my own home to go walking in the foothills, like my soul was traveling on without my body. The air was sharp and clean, filled with the fragrance of desert flowers. The sun was warm and merciless-yet comforting in its familiarity. And the colors...the colors made my dream self want to weep. Peaches and greens and all the colors of the cacti flowers looking up at the clear blue, blue of the sky. For the first time since my capture and rape, I felt at peace. I felt whole and healed in the dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up with a longing in my chest, like there was a piece of me missing. The sharpness of it startled me-and scared me a little. Tossing on a robe, I made my way out to the kitchen, hoping coffee and breakfast would shake off that all-consuming desire to run to the Otherworld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiyo,\" I exclaimed. He sat at the table with coffee, both dogs at his feet. I had a weird deja vu from coffee with Roland yesterday and suspected there was \"a talk\" in store for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie,\" he said, looking up from the paper. His eyes were warm and chocolate-brown, filled with so much love. He rose from his chair and approached me, arms open. I started to go into his embrace but something made me shrink back, some protective instinct of my body\u0027s to keep itself safe. I knew he wasn\u0027t Leith. I knew Kiyo loved me...but there was just something within me that was afraid to touch anyone else. My mother was the only one I\u0027d allowed to hug me so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadness and hurt flashed through Kiyo\u0027s eyes at my rejection, but he seemed to understand. Awkwardly, he simply gave me a soft touch on the arm, which I allowed with only a slight flinch. We both sat down-after I\u0027d fetched coffee-and he drank me in with those intense eyes, like he hadn\u0027t seen me in years. Of course, these last two weeks or so had certainly felt like years to me, so perhaps that wasn\u0027t such a bad comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ve missed you so much. I\u0027ve been so worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay. I was in good hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your shoulder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave it a slight shrug. \"Stiff. But mending. I could probably go over to the Otherworld and get someone to patch it right up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face instantly darkened. \"I think you need to stay away from there for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ. Not you too. I\u0027m that land\u0027s ruler. I have to go back.\" A flash of the dream came back to me. It was more than some subconscious musing, I knew. The Thorn Land and I were tied. We couldn\u0027t stay apart. I had known that being away from it would cause it to die, and now I was realizing that I might die without it as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There has to be a way. I was talking to Maiwenn, and she\u0027s going to look into it. Surely, somewhere in the pages of their history, someone gave up their kingdom without dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a good idea?\" I asked. \"Me giving it up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" he said, shocked. \"You\u0027ve never wanted it. You\u0027ve said so a hundred times. It\u0027d be better for everyone. The next person bound to the land probably wouldn\u0027t transform it into a desert. You\u0027d be free, able to go on with your life here, free of the magic....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my eyes. \"I\u0027ll never be free of that either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he agreed, stiffness in his voice, \"but there\u0027ll be less temptation outside of the Otherworld. Why the hell didn\u0027t you tell me you were learning all that stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did tell you! I told you about Dorian sending Ysabel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I saw you do in there...that was nothing like what you said she taught you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happened fast...I didn\u0027t realize it half the time myself, and I didn\u0027t want to upset you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one learns that fast,\" he muttered. I remembered Shaya\u0027s words. Storm King did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m apparently not all-powerful. I lost hold of Volusian during that ordeal. He didn\u0027t come when I called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I thought you knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knew what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s bound to Dorian now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared for several seconds. \"Oh my God. I thought that might happen...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo stared back. \"You did? Then why the hell did you send him to Dorian? Why not send him to warn me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For exactly that reason! If Volusian broke from my control, I knew Dorian could probably bind him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose. But I feel like you\u0027ve just given Dorian a nuclear warhead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say it, but I had a feeling Kiyo was more upset that it was Dorian I\u0027d contacted for help and not him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s how you found me, right? Volusian told Dorian, who then told you and Roland?\" I\u0027d heard it from Roland but wanted to hear it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo nodded. \"We\u0027d been looking for you as soon as you disappeared after the battle. None of us had a clue what had happened. We got Roland involved a few days later to help with a hunt in this world, but none of us...\" He shook his head. \"None of us had any idea that that\u0027s what had happened to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwkward silence fell, each of us thinking about the things neither of us would give voice to. My imprisonment. My rape. I lowered my eyes, playing with the edge of the coffee cup. The memories were like a rollercoaster. Sometimes they\u0027d sink way down low into the bottom of my mind. Other times, they\u0027d flare up sharply, pushing to the forefront of my mind and unleashing all the dizzying, horrible feelings of fear, violation, and helplessness that ordeal had caused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly looked up sharply and met Kiyo square in the eyes. \"Why didn\u0027t you let me kill Leith when I had the chance?\" With a shiver, I remembered the vengeance burning within me and the storm swirling around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question clearly caught Kiyo off-guard. \"What? You know why. Because of the political fallout...because you\u0027re not the kind of person given to revenge....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t I?\" I demanded. I was suddenly angry at him, and it occurred to me right then that I\u0027d been suppressing a lot of it this whole week. \"You have no right to talk about when revenge is right. You didn\u0027t go through what I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said, trying to be gentle. \"I don\u0027t doubt he deserved a horrible punishment. I can only imagine how it was for you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. There is no way you can imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s more than just revenge, though. Do you know what\u0027s happened in the wake of this? Katrice is massing her armies, Eugenie. The monarchs haven\u0027t had an all-out war in ages. This could get very bad. People are going to die. I wanted to save you from that...wanted to save you from being her target.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright. Then why didn\u0027t you kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Kiyo exclaimed at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never lowered my gaze, astonished at the coldness in my voice. \"You said he deserved a horrible punishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, imprisonment or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Imprisonment? Are you crazy? He\u0027s a prince. We couldn\u0027t have kept him without the same \u0027political fallout.\u0027 He would have walked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going to war is worse, believe it or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you still should have killed him,\" I repeated. \"Everyone keeps going on about how you\u0027re \u0027just\u0027 a kitsune. You aren\u0027t technically aligned with anyone. Maybe she would have put a hit out on you, but she wouldn\u0027t have gone to war against you alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo\u0027s eyes were wide. \"Are you listening to yourself? This is insane! You\u0027re condemning me for not killing a man that was on his knees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That man did horrible, awful things. He didn\u0027t deserve to walk away unpunished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo\u0027s shock had given away to anger. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re holding me responsible for this. And you know what? This is the magic talking. The more of it you use, the more it changes you. This is why you need to stay away from the Otherworld! For your own protection. Before you turn into someone you don\u0027t want to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, now you want to protect me! Look, you of all people should understand. I can\u0027t stay away from the Otherworld. I can\u0027t stay away from this world. I don\u0027t belong anywhere! And yet...I belong everywhere. There\u0027s no good fit for me. I\u0027m split, Kiyo. I thought you\u0027d get that. You told me before that you did. You\u0027re the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It...it\u0027s different somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not good enough. You\u0027re being a hypocrite,\" I exclaimed. \"You make decisions for both of us based on what\u0027s convenient at any given time. You think you can handle it one way but that I can\u0027t. That\u0027s not fair. You can\u0027t make different rules for each of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to protect you,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m strong enough to handle the things you can?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his hands. \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe I\u0027m the one who isn\u0027t strong enough to make the tough decisions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dorian is.\" It was out before I could stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead silence, round two, descended on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo finished his coffee. \"I see. So that\u0027s what this is really about.\" He stared around, taking in the house and the cats sprawled everywhere. \"Maybe...maybe it\u0027s time I pack up my things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed my arms. \"I think that\u0027s a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might take me a day or two to collect these guys, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine.\" I kept perfect control in my voice, focusing all my energy on sounding flat. If I slipped up, I might start crying or begging him to stay. I might apologize for being so harsh and holding him responsible for not letting me kill Leith. It wasn\u0027t fair for me to blame Kiyo and laud Dorian...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...and yet I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo stood up, saying he\u0027d come back to do a thorough packing when I wasn\u0027t around since that might be easier on both of us. I agreed. Tension engulfed us as he moved toward the door. I\u0027d hurt him; I knew it. And truthfully, I didn\u0027t fully know if I was making the worst mistake of my life here in breaking up with Kiyo. True, we had been fighting a lot, with him not understanding the choices I\u0027d been having to make. The heart of it was, though, that I felt he\u0027d had the opportunity to protect me...and hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie,\" he said, hovering near the back door. \"I know you were hurt. I know you suffered-and still do. And I guess I can see why you think what Dorian did was noble. But it\u0027s not. There are big consequences to this, and someday-probably soon-you\u0027re going to regret what he did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, still obstinate. \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No matter what you think of me, it\u0027s not too late. You can make amends with Katrice. You can stop this.\" There was a desperate, pleading look in his eyes, and I wondered if it was because of his desire for peace or the agony of leaving me. My own hurt over him leaving was steadily growing, but something in his words halted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make amends? What\u0027s that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know...apologize...blame it on Dorian. Maiwenn might negotiate....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy anger spun back up. \"I am not going to grovel to the woman whose son raped me. And I\u0027m not going to let Dorian get punished for something I should have done myself.\" Maiwenn didn\u0027t even deserve mentioning. \"I\u0027ll face the consequences, Kiyo. I\u0027m the Thorn Queen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a small, sad smile. \"Are you sure? Or are you the Storm Queen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you told Leith. Back in the kitchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" So much of those memories were fragmented, but I was certain I\u0027d recall that. \"I told him I was the Thorn Queen a few times-but good God. Not Storm Queen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you. Once you said Storm Queen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, anger returning. \"You made a mistake. They sound alike. Easy to mishear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile twitched; his sadness grew. \"Not with my hearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo left after that-to where, I didn\u0027t know. It didn\u0027t matter. My heart was broken, and thinking about him too much was only going to make things worse. Instead, I knew I had to leave too. I had to get out of here-and I knew exactly where I had to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to go to my kingdom. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2/page-26.html","bookId":2039,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM"}
