recognize the primary governing force.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;For example, take a careful look at Human history.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Humans have been known to submit to many constraints:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;to rule by Autarchs, by Plutarchs, by the power seekers of the many Republics, by Oligarchs, by tyrant Majorities and Minorities, by the hidden suasions of Polls, by profound instincts and shallow juvenilities.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And always, the governing force as we wish you now to understand this concept was whatever the individual believed had control over his immediate survival.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Survival sets the pattern of imprint.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;During much of Human history (and the pattern is similar with most sentient species) Corporation presidents held more survival in their casual remarks than did the figurehead officials.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We of the ConSentiency cannot forget this as we keep hatch on the Multiworld Corporations.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We dare not even forget it of ourselves.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Where you work for your own survival, this dominates your imprint, this dominates what you believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Instruction Manual Bureau of Sabotage\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever do what your enemy wants you to do, McKie reminded himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this moment, Aritch was the enemy, having placed the binding oath of Legum upon an agent of BuSab, having demanded information to which he had no right.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The old Gowachin\u0027s behavior was consistent with the demands of his own legal system, but it immediately magnified the area of conflict by an enormous factor.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie chose a minimal response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here because Tandaloor is the heart of the Gowachin Federation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch, who\u0027d been sitting with his eyes closed to emphasize the formal client-Legum relationship, opened his eyes to glare at McKie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remind you once that I am your client.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigns indicating a dangerous new tension in the Wreave servant were increasing, but McKie was forced to concentrate his attention on Aritch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You name your self client.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Very well.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The client must answer truthfully such questions as the Legum asks when the legal issues demand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch continued to glare at McKie, latent fire in the yellow eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Now, the battle was truly joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie sensed how fragile was the relationship upon which his survival depended.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Gowachin, signatories to the great ConSentiency Pact binding the species of the known universe, were legally subject to certain BuSab intrusions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But Aritch had placed them on another footing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If the Gowachin Federation disagreed with McKie/Agent, they could take him into the Courtarena as a Legum who had wronged a client.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;With the entire Gowachin Bar arrayed against him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie did not doubt which Legum would taste the knife.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His one hope lay in avoiding immediate litigation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That was, after all, the real basis of Gowachin Law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving a step closer to specifics, McKie said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Bureau has uncovered a matter of embarrassment to the Gowachin Federation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch blinked twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As we suspected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie shook his head.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They didn\u0027t suspect, they knew.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He counted on this:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that the Gowachin understood why he\u0027d answered their summons.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If any Sentiency under the Pact could understand his position, it had to be the Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;BuSab reflected Gowachin philosophy.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Centuries had passed since the great convulsion out of which BuSab had originated, but the ConSentiency had never been allowed to forget that birth.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was taught to the young of every species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once, long ago, a tyrannical majority captured the government.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They said they would make all individuals equal.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They meant they would not let any individual be better than another at doing anything.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Excellence was to be suppressed or concealed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The tyrants made their government act with great speed \u0027in the name of the people.\u0027\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They removed delays and red tape wherever found.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was little deliberation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Unaware that they acted out of an unconscious compulsion to prevent all change, the tyrants tried to enforce a grey sameness upon every population.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thus the powerful governmental machine blundered along at increasingly reckless speed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It took commerce and all the important elements of society with it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Laws were thought of and passed within hours.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Every society came to be twisted into a suicidal pattern.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;People became unprepared for those changes which the universe demands.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were unable to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the time of brittle money, \u0027appropriated in the morning and gone by nightfall,\u0027 as you learned earlier.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In their passion for sameness, the tyrants made themselves more and more powerful.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;All others grew correspondingly weaker and weaker.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;New bureaus and directorates, odd ministries, leaped into existence for the most improbable purposes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;These became the citadels of a new aristocracy, rulers who kept the giant wheel of government careening along, spreading destruction, violence, and chaos wherever they touched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In those desperate times, a handful of people (the Five Ears, their makeup and species never revealed) created the Sabotage Corps to slow that runaway wheel of government.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The original corps was bloody, violent, and cruel.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gradually, the original efforts were replaced by more subtle methods.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The governmental wheel slowed, became more manageable.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Deliberation returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over the generations, that original Corps became a Bureau, the Bureau of Sabotage, with its present Ministerial powers, preferring diversion to violence, but ready for violence when the need arises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were words from McKie\u0027s own teens, generators of a concept modified by his experiences in the Bureau.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Now, he was aware that this directorate composed of all the known sentient species was headed into its own entropic corridors.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Someday, the Bureau would dissolve or be dissolved, but the universe still needed them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The old imprints remained, the old futile seeking after absolutes of sameness.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was the ancient conflict between what the individual saw as personal needs for immediate survival and what the totality required if any were to survive.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And now it was the Gowachin versus the ConSentiency, and Aritch was the champion of his people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie studied the High Magister carefully, sensitive to the unrelieved tensions in the Wreave attendant.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Would there be violence in this room?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was a question which remained unanswered as McKie spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have observed that I am in a difficult position.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I do not enjoy the embarrassment of revered teachers and friends, nor of their compatriots.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yet, evidence has been seen . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let his voice trail off.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gowachin disliked dangling implications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch\u0027s claws slid from the sheaths of his webbed fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your client wishes to hear of this evidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore speaking, McKie rested his hand on the latch of the box in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many people from two species have disappeared.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Two species:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gowachin and Human.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Singly, these were small matters, but these disappearances have been going on for a long time - perhaps twelve or fifteen generations by the old Human reckoning.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Taken together, these disappearances are massive.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We\u0027ve learned that there\u0027s a planet called Dosadi where these people were taken.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Such evidence as we have has been examined carefully.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It all leads to the Gowachin Federation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch\u0027s fingers splayed, a sign of acute embarrassment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Whether assumed or real, McKie could not tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does your Bureau accuse the Gowachin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the function of my Bureau.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We do not yet know the location of Dosadi, but we\u0027ll find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch remained silent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He knew BuSab had never given up on a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie raised the blue box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Having thrust this upon me, you\u0027ve made me guardian of your fate, client.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You\u0027ve no rights to inquire as to my methods.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I will not follow old law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was my argument that you\u0027d react thus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rhythmic \"death flexion\" swept over the Wreave and her fighting mandibles darted from her facial slit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the first movement from her, McKie whipped open the blue box, snatched out book and knife.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He spoke with a firmness his body did not feel:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she makes the slightest move toward me, my blood will defile this book.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He placed the knife against his own wrist.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Does your Servant of the Box know the consequences?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The history of the Running Phylum would end.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Another Phylum would be presumed to\u0027ve accepted the Law from its Giver.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The name of this Phylum\u0027s last High Magister would be erased from living thought.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gowachin would eat their own eggs at the merest hint that they had Running Phylum blood in their veins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch remained frozen, right hand raised.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McKie, you are revealed as a sneak.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Only by spying on our most sacred rituals could you know this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you think me some fearful, pliable dolt, client?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I am a true Legum.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A Legum does not have to sneak to learn the Law.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;When you admitted me to your Bar you opened every door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, muscles quivering, Aritch turned and spoke to the Wreave:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ceylang?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had difficulty speaking while her poison-tipped fighting mandibles remained extruded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your command?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Observe this Human well.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Study him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You will meet again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I obey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may go, but remember my words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie, knowing the death dance could not remain uncompleted, stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ceylang!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, reluctantly, she looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do observe me well, Ceylang.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I am what you hope to be.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And I warn you:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;unless you shed your Wreave skin you will never be a Legum.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He nodded in dismissal.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Now, you may go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a fluid swish of robes she obeyed, but her fighting mandibles remained out, their poison tips glittering.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Somewhere in her triad\u0027s quarters, McKie knew, there\u0027d be a small feathered pet which would die presently with poison from its mistress burning through its veins.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Then the death dance would be ended and she could retract her mandibles.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But the hate would remain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door had closed behind the red robe, McKie restored book and knife to the box, returned his attention to Aritch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Now, when McKie spoke, it was really Legum to client without any sophistry, and they both knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would tempt the High Magister of the renowned Running Phylum to bring down the Arch of Civilization?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie\u0027s tone was conversational, between equals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch had trouble adjusting to the new status.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His thoughts were obvious.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If McKie had witnessed a Cleansing Ritual, McKie had to be accepted as a Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But McKie was not Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yet he\u0027d been accepted before the Gowachin Bar . . . and if he\u0027d seen that most sacred ritual . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, Aritch spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you see the ritual?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was performed by the Phylum which sheltered me on Tandaloor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dry Heads?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they know you witnessed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They invited me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you shed your skin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They scraped me raw and preserved the scrapings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch took some time digesting this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Dry Heads had played their own secret game of Gowachin politics and now the secret was out.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had to consider the implications.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What had they hoped to gain?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wear no tattoo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never made formal application for Dry Heads

this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They encourage it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what motivated them to . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch glanced at a veiled alcove at the far end of the sanctum, back to McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A likeness to the Frog God?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027d take more than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch mused aloud:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dry Heads supported Klodik in his crime when you . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not crime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stand corrected.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You won Klodik\u0027s freedom.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And after your victory the Dry Heads invited you to the Cleansing Ritual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Gowachin in BuSab cannot have divided allegiance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But a Legum serves only the Law!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"BuSab and Gowachin Law are not in conflict.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the Dry Heads would have us believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many Gowachin believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Klodik\u0027s case was not a true test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealization swept through McKie:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch regretted more than a lost bet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He\u0027d put his money with his hopes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was time then to redirect this conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am your Legum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch spoke with resignation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Legum wishes to hear of the Dosadi

lap.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"We\u0027re dealing with differences in values, changes in values.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie did not believe for an instant this was the tenor of Gowachin defense, but Aritch\u0027s words gave him pause.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Gowachin combined such an odd mixture of respect and disrespect for their Law and all government.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;At the root lay their unchanging rituals, but above that everything remained as fluid as the seas in which they\u0027d evolved.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Constant fluidity was the purpose behind their rituals.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You never entered any exchange with Gowachin on a sure-footed basis.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They did something different every time . . . religiously.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was their nature.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;All ground is temporary.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Law is made to be changed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That was their catechism.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;To be a Legum is to learn where to place your feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dry Heads did something different,\" McKie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis plunged Aritch into gloom.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His chest ventricles wheezed, indicating he\u0027d speak from the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The people of the ConSentiency come in so many

many.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The unknowns between us defy counting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As well count the drops of water in a sea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch grunted,

regard.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They slew the ritual deviant out of hand.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It required enormous restraint on their part to deal with another

it:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"No matter how painful, life must adapt or die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a profound revelation about how Gowachin applied their insight to themselves.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Law changed, but it changed on a foundation which could not be permitted the slightest change.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Else, how do we know where we are or where we have been?\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But encounters with other species changed the foundation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Life adapted . . . willingly or by force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie spoke with

review boards composed of such people reject many experimental proposals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie saw the direction of the argument.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He spoke with

you concerned about the free destiny of your volunteers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful how you judge us, McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There is a fundamental tension between science and freedom - no matter how science is viewed by its practitioners nor how freedom is sensed by those who believe they have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie was reminded of a cynical Gowachin aphorism:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;To believe that you are free is more important than being free.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your volunteers were lured into this

done on Dosadi, but he was beginning to suspect it\u0027d be something repulsive.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He could not keep this fear from his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We return to the question of expected benefits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Legum, we have long admired your species.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You gave us one of our most trusted maxims:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No

on Dosadi?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Would he dare such a gambit?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Just how bad was this Dosadi fiasco?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo test the issue, McKie asked:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What benefits did you expect?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I insist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch slumped.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His chairdog accommodated to the
