My men are unsettled. Very unsettled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe port shields were open. Lagrange I was six hours gone, and Lagrange II\u0027s ruddy light, deepened to crimson in setting, flushed the Captain\u0027s face and tinged his short gray hair with red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCimon, whose attitude toward the crew in general and the Captain in particular was one of controlled impatience, said, \"What is the trouble, Captain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been here two weeks, Earth time. Still no one leaves without suits. Always irradiate before you come back. Anything wrong with the air?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as far as we know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not breathe it then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain, that\u0027s for me to decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flush on the Captain\u0027s face became a real one. He said, \"My papers say I don\u0027t have to stay if ship\u0027s safety is endangered. A frightened and mutinous crew is something I don\u0027t want\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you handle your own men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Within reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what really bothers them? This is a new planet and we\u0027re being cautious. Can\u0027t they understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two weeks and still cautious. They think we\u0027re hiding something. And we are. You know that. Besides, surface leave is necessary. Crew\u0027s got to have it. Even if it\u0027s just on a bare rock a mile across. Gets them out of the ship. Away from the routine. Can\u0027t deny them that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me till tomorrow,\" said Cimon contemptuously. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-47.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
