I gave it all of my trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then came the sudden plunge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shaken as he let me go, and I had to stop myself from stumbling until the dizziness passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood on a terrace. A partially open glass door separated us from a lighted room. It was tastefully furnished in rather routine modern furniture-beige velvet chairs and couches, with the inevitable large television, muted lamps and scattered tables of iron and glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo very pretty young brunette women were inside, one busy with a suitcase on the coffee table, and the other in front of a nearby mirror, brushing her long hair. They wore skimpy silk dresses, both pretty fashionable, revealing a great deal of their dark olive skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat put his arm around me again and gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does your mind tell you?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the Mind Gift loose, casting for the one at the mirror, and caught the whisper of murder at once. The other was even more accustomed to it, and it seemed that both of the women were party to a crime that was actually happening now somewhere at a distance from this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an elegant hotel, this building. Through a door I saw the bedroom. I caught the scent from a gin drink on one of the tables, I caught the scent of fresh flowers, and of course I caught the overwhelming scent of Fair Game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thirst rose in me. The thirst clouded my eyes. I tasted blood as though I were already drinking it, and I felt the abysmal and desperate emptiness that I always feel before I feast. Nothing will ever fill you. Nothing will ever make this abominable hunger go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair Game exactly,\" said Lestat in a low voice. \"But we don\u0027t let them suffer, no matter how rough we want to get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Sir,\" I answered deferentially. \"May I have the one in front of the mirror?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I can see her face in the mirror, and she\u0027s cruel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped the door open and we came into the cool refreshing air of the room. The thirst was too hot for it. The thirst was hopeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once, the women cried out in protest. Where had we come from? Who were we? Vulgar words, threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a remnant of my rational mind, I saw that the suitcase was filled with money, but what did it matter? How much more interesting was a huge vase of flowers near the far window, bursting with color. How much more interesting the blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat drifted past me and caught the woman who ran to the right with both his arms. The rush of furious words from her came to an abrupt stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other woman darted to the sofa, and I saw the gun there that she wanted so desperately to reach. I had her before she could lay her hand on it, and I crushed her against me, looking into her black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a string of curses in Spanish, and the thirst in me rose even more violently, as if her curses had drawn it out. I brushed her thick black hair back from her neck and ran my thumb over the artery. She was maddened, full of hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, I bit into the fount of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Maker\u0027s lessons came back to me. Love her sins, follow the path with her, make her evil your evil and you will do no evil. I struggled to obey as her mind was broken open. I probed for the murders and I found them, rampant, savage and always over the white powder; and the wealth that had drawn her out of the deep filthy slums of her birth to finery and fortune, to those who toasted her beauty and her cunning; and murder after murder of those as covered in blood as herself. Yes, love you, I whispered, love the sheer will and the ever present anger; yes, give it to me, the rage in the warm sweet blood flowing, and suddenly there came, towards me, her unbounded love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout language, she said, Surrender. Without language, she said, I see it!, and it was all of her life, without pagination, and her ripened soul expanded, and there was a terrifying recognition of circumstance and inevitability, her crimes pulled up by the roots from her heart as though by the hand of Heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the hunger in me was sated, I was filled by her, I had had her, and I drew back, kissing the puncture wounds, lapping the tiny trickles of blood that I\u0027d spilled, healing the evidence, even as the drowsiness overcame me and then gently, gently I set her down on one of the indifferent chairs. I kissed her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt down before her. I forced my tongue between her lips and, opening her mouth, I sucked on her tongue and sank my teeth into it delicately, and there came again a small rush of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally there was no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed her large empty eyes with my left fingers. I felt her eyes through their lids as her blood washed through me. I bent and kissed her breasts. The blood sent shock after shock through me. I let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the usual daze, I turned and saw Lestat waiting, the royal figure, studying me, musing it seemed, his yellow hair looking almost white in the lamplight, his violet eyes wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did it right that time, Little Brother,\" he said. \"You spilled not a single drop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was so much I wanted to say. I wanted to talk of her life, the great overreaching scope of it that I had so deeply tasted, the score she kept with fate; and how hard I\u0027d tried to do what my Maker had told me to do, not merely to devour the blood but devour the evil, dip my tongue deep down into the evil, but she was beside the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a victim. She who had never been a Subject was now Past Tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood had me. The warmth had me. The room was a phantasm. Lestat\u0027s woman lay dead on the floor. And there was the suitcase of money, and it meant nothing, could buy nothing, could change nothing, could save no one. The flowers were bold and brilliant, pink lilies dripping with pollen, and dark red roses. The room was complete and final and still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one will mourn them,\" said Lestat softly. His voice seemed distant, beyond my reach. \"No need to find a hasty grave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of my Maker. I thought of the dark waters of Sugar Devil Swamp, the thick duckweed, the voice of the owls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething changed in the room, but Lestat didn\u0027t know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come back to me,\" said Lestat. \"It\u0027s important, Little Brother, not to let the blood weaken you afterwards, no matter how sweet it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. But something was happening. We weren\u0027t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see the dim figure of my double forming behind Lestat. I could see Goblin, designed as I was designed. I could see the crazed smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat pivoted. \"Where is he?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Goblin, I forbid it,\" I said. But there was no stopping him. The figure moved towards me with lightning speed, yet held itself together in human form. Right before my eyes he was seemingly as solid as I was; and then I felt the tingling all through my limbs as he merged with me, and the tiny stabs on my hands and my neck and my face. I struggled as if I were caught in a perfect net.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom deep inside me there came that orgasmic palpitation, that walloping sensation that I was one with him and nothing could part us, that I wanted it suddenly, yes, wanted him and me to be together always, yet I was saying something different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get away from me, Goblin. Goblin, you must listen. I was the one, the one who brought you into being. Listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was useless. The electric shivers wouldn\u0027t stop, and I saw only images of the two of us as children, as boys, as men, all of it moving too fast for me to focus, to repudiate or confirm. Sunlight poured through an open doorway; I saw the flowered pattern of linoleum. I heard the laughter of toddlers, and I tasted milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I was falling or about to fall, that Lestat\u0027s firm hands were holding me, because I wasn\u0027t in the room with the sunlight, but it was all that I could see, and there was Goblin, little Goblin frolicking and laughing, and I too was laughing. Love you, all right, need you, of course, yours, us together. I looked down and saw my chubby childish left hand, and I held a spoon in it and was banging with the spoon. And there was Goblin\u0027s hand on top of mine. And over and over came that bang of the spoon against wood, and the sunlight, how beautifully it came in the door, but the flowers on the linoleum were worn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as violently as Goblin had come, he withdrew. I glimpsed the humanoid shape for no more than a second, the eyes huge, the mouth open; then his image expanded, lost its conformity and vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe draperies of the room swayed, and the vase of flowers suddenly toppled, and I heard dimly the dripping of the water, and then the vase itself hit the soft rug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a fog, I stared at the wounded bouquet of flowers. Pink-throated lilies. I wanted to pick them up. The tiny wounds all over me stung me and hurt me. I hated him that he had made the vase fall over, that the lilies were spilt now on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the women, first one and then the other. They appeared to be sleeping. There was no death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Goblin, my very own Goblin. That verbless thought stayed with me. My familiar spirit, my partner in all of life; you belong to me and I belong to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat was holding me by the shoulders. I could barely stand. In fact, if he had let me go I would have fallen. I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off the pink-throated lilies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t have to make the flowers fall,\" I said. \"I taught him not to hurt things that were pretty. I taught him that when we were small.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinn,\" said Lestat, \"come back to me! I\u0027m talking to you. Quinn!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t see him,\" I said. I was shaking all over. I stared at the tiny wounds on my hands, but they were already healing. It was the same way with the pinpricks on my face. I wiped at my face. Faint traces of blood on my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the blood,\" said Lestat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you see it?\" I asked. I was growing stronger. I struggled to clear my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the shape of a man,\" Lestat said, \"a man faintly sketched in blood, sketched in the air, just for an instant, and then there was a swirling cloud of tiny drops, and I saw it pass through the open door as rapidly as if it were being sucked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know why I came looking for you,\" I said. But I realized he couldn\u0027t really see the spirit that Goblin was. He\u0027d seen the blood, yes, because the blood was visible, but the spirit who had always appeared to me was invisible to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t really hurt you,\" he said, his voice tender and kind. \"It can\u0027t take any real volume of blood from you. It took just a tiny taste of what you took from the woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027ll come again whenever he wants, and I can\u0027t fight him, and each time, I could swear, it\u0027s a little more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI steadied myself, and he released me, stroking my hair with his right hand. That casual gesture of affection coupled with his dazzling appearance -- the vibrant eyes, the exquisitely proportioned features -- entranced me even as the trance induced by Goblin slowly wore away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He found me here,\" I said, \"and I don\u0027t even know where I am. He found me here, and he can find me anywhere, and each time, as I told you, he takes a little more blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely you can fight him,\" Lestat said, encouragingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was concerned and protective, and I felt such an overwhelming need of him and love for him that I was about to cry. I held it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I can learn to fight him,\" I said, \"but is that enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, let\u0027s leave this graveyard,\" he answered. \"You have to tell me about him. You have to tell me how this came about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that I have all the answers,\" I said. \"But I have a story to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him out onto the terrace into the fresh air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go to Blackwood Manor,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know of another place where we can talk in such peace. Only my aunt is there tonight and her lovable entourage, and maybe my mother, and they\u0027ll all leave us completely alone. They\u0027re utterly used to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Goblin?\" he asked. \"Will he be stronger there if he does come back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was as strong as ever only moments ago,\" I responded. \"I think that I\u0027ll be stronger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Blackwood Manor it is,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain there came his firm arm around me and we were traveling upwards. The sky spread out, full of clouds, and then we broke through to the very stars. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blackwood-farm-the-vampire-chronicles-9/page-4.html","bookId":2595,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:08 PM"}
