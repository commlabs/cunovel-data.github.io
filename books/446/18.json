But no aberration is important, any more....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m trying to help him—\" Norma began.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can\u0027t help him, child,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. Her eyes were closed: she looked as if she were preparing, at last, for death. \"You feel too closely for him: you can\u0027t see him clearly enough to know what help he needs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I\u0027ve got to—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing is predicated on necessity but action,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"Certainly not success.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Norma went to the desk, leaned over it, looking down into the still, blank face. \"It\u0027s too soon to give up,\" she said tensely. \"You\u0027re just backing down, and there\u0027s no need for that yet—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You think not?\" The face was still.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There are lots of rumors, that\u0027s true,\" Norma said. \"But—even if the worst comes to the worst—we have time. They aren\u0027t here yet. We can prepare—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course,\" the voice said. \"We can prepare—as I am doing. There is nothing else for us, not any more. Idealism has taken over, and what we are and what we\u0027ve done can go right on down the drain. Norma, you\u0027re a bright girl—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Too bright to sit around and do nothing!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you don\u0027t understand this. Maybe you will, some day. Maybe I\u0027ll have a chance—but that\u0027s for later. Not now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Norma almost reached forward to shake some sense into the old woman. But she was Dr. Haenlingen, after all—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Norma\u0027s hand drew back again. \"You can\u0027t just sit back and wait for them to come!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is nothing else to do.\" The words were flat, echoless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Besides,\" Norma said desperately, \"they\u0027re only rumors—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She never finished her sentence. The blast rocked the room, and the window thrummed, steadied and then suddenly tinkled into pieces on the carpeted floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Norma was standing erect. \"What\u0027s that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Haenlingen had barely moved. The eyes, in dimness, were open now. \"That, my dear,\" the old woman said, \"was your rumor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The blast was repeated. Ornaments on the desk rattled, a picture came off the far wall and thudded to the carpet. The air was filled with a fine dust and, far below, Norma could hear noise, a babel of voices....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027re here!\" she screamed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Haenlingen sat very still, saying nothing. The eyes watched, but the voice made no comment. The hands were still, flat on the desk. Below, the voices continued: and then Dr. Haenlingen spoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027d better go,\" the calm voice said. \"There will be others needing help—and you will be safer underground, in any case.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you—\" Norma began.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I may be lucky,\" Dr. Haenlingen said. \"One of their bombs may actually kill me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her mouth open in an unreasoning accession of horror, Norma turned and fled. The third blast rattled the corridor as she ran crazily along it.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2155/60934.html","bookId":446,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:18:36 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:18:36 AM"}
