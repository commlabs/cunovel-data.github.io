For her seventh birthday, Katarina and her Uncle Eddie traveled to Austria…to steal the crown jewels. When Kat turned fifteen, she planned a con of her own—scamming her way into the best boarding school in the country, determined to leave the family business behind. Unfortunately, leaving “the life” for a normal life proves harder than she’d expected. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSoon, Kat\u0027s friend and former co-conspirator, Hale, appears out of nowhere to bring Kat back into the world she tried so hard to escape. But he has a good reason: a powerful mobster has been robbed of his priceless art collection and wants to retrieve it. Only a master thief could have pulled this job, and Kat\u0027s father isn\u0027t just on the suspect list, he is the list. Caught between Interpol and a far more deadly enemy, Kat’s dad needs her help. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eFor Kat, there is only one solution: track down the paintings and steal them back. So what if it\u0027s a spectacularly impossible job? She\u0027s got two weeks, a teenage crew, and hopefully just enough talent to pull off the biggest heist in her family\u0027s history--and, with any luck, steal her life back along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/heist-society-heist-society-1.jpg","author":"Ally Carter","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/heist-society-heist-society-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:38 AM"}
