Some soldiers bowed, the ones who were not currently on duty, while others hastened toward the battlefield. Gawyn eyed some of these. Too young, too new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers were Dragonsworn, and who knew what to make of them? There were Aiel among the Dragonsworn, which made sense to him, since all Aiel seemed basically Dragonsworn to him. But there were also Aes Sedai among the Dragonsworn ranks. He didn’t think much of their choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn shook his head and continued on. Their camp was enormous, though it contained virtually no camp followers. Food was brought in daily through gateways in wagons—some pulled by those unreliable metal machines from Cairhien. When those wagons left, they carried away clothing for washing, weapons to be repaired and boots to be mended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made for a very efficient camp; one not heavily populated, however, as almost everyone spent long hours on the battlefield fighting. Everyone but Gawyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he was needed, and that what he did was important, but he couldn’t help feeling wasted. He was one of the finest swordsmen in the army, and he stood on the battlefield for a few hours a day, killing only the occasional Trolloc stupid enough to charge two Aes Sedai. What Gawyn did was more like putting them out of their misery than fighting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene nodded farewell to Silviana, then turned her horse toward the command tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Egwene . . \" Gawyn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only want to check on things\", she said calmly. \"Elayne was supposed to have sent new orders\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need sleep\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems that all I do these days is sleep\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you fight on the battlefield, you are easily worth a thousand soldiers\", Gawyn said. \"If sleeping twenty-two hours a day were required to keep you in good enough shape to protect the men for two, I’d suggest you do it. Fortunately, that isn’t required—and neither is it required that you run yourself as hard as you do\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel her annoyance through the bond, but she snuffed it out. \"You are right, of course\". She eyed him. \"And you needn’t feel surprised to hear me admit it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn’t surprised\", Gawyn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can feel your emotions, Gawyn\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was from something else entirely\", he said. \"I remembered something Sleete said a few days back, a joke I didn’t understand until now\". He looked at her innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, finally, earned a smile. A hint of one, but that was enough. She didn’t smile much these days. Few of them did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In addition\", he said, taking her reins and helping her dismount as they reached the command tent, \"I’d never given much thought to the fact that a Warder can, of course, ignore the Three Oaths. I wonder how often sisters have found that convenient?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope not too often\", Egwene said. A very diplomatic answer. Inside the command tent, they found Gareth Bryne looking down through his now customary gateway; it was being maintained by a mousy Gray whom Gawyn didn’t know. Bryne stepped to his map-littered desk, where Siuan was attempting to bring order. He made a few notes on a map, nodding to himself, then looked to see who had entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother\", Bryne said, and took her hand to kiss her ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The battle seems to be going well\", Egwene said, nodding to Siuan. \"We have held here well. You have plans to push forward, it seems?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can’t loiter here forever, Mother\", Bryne said. \"Queen Elayne has asked me to consider an advance farther into Kandor, and I think she is wise to do so. I worry that the Trollocs will pull back into the hills and brace themselves. You notice how they’ve been pulling more of the bodies off the field each night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn could sense her displeasure; she wished the Aes Sedai had the strength to burn the Trolloc carcasses with the One Power each day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They’re gathering food\", Bryne said. \"They might decide to move eastward and try to get around us. We need to keep them engaged here, which might mean pushing into those hills. It would be costly, normally, but now . . \". He shook his head, walking over and looking down through his gateway onto the front lines. \"Your Aes Sedai dominate this battlefield, Mother. I’ve never seen anything like it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a reason\", she replied, \"that the Shadow did everything in its power to bring down the White Tower. It knew. The White Tower has the ability to rule this war\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We’ll need to watch for Dreadlords\", Siuan said, shuffling through papers. Scouting reports, Gawyn suspected. He knew little of Siuan Sanche, despite having spared her life, but Egwene commonly spoke of the woman’s greed for information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\", Egwene said. \"They will come\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Black Tower\", Bryne said, frowning. \"Do you trust the word from Lord Mandragoran?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With my life\", Egwene said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asha’man fighting for the enemy. Why wouldn’t the Dragon Reborn have done something? Light, if all of the remaining Asha’man side with the Shadow . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene shook her head. \"Bryne, I want you to saddle up riders and send them to the area outside the Black Tower where gateways can still be made. Send them, riding hard, to the sisters still camped outside the Black Tower\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want them to attack?\" Gawyn asked, perking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They are to retreat back as far as it takes to make gateways, and then they are to join us here. We can’t afford any further delays. I want them here\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tapped the table with one finger. \"Taim and his Dreadlords will come. They have stayed away from this battlefield, instead focusing on Lord Mandragoran. That lets them dominate their battlefield as we have this one. I will choose more sisters to send to the Borderlander army. We will have to confront them eventually\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn said nothing, but drew his lips tight. Fewer sisters here meant more work for Egwene and the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, Egwene said, \"I need to . . \". She trailed off, seeing Gawyn’s expression. \"I suppose I need to sleep. If I am needed, send to . . . Light, I don’t know where I’m sleeping today. Gawyn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have you in Maerin Sedai’s tent. She’s on duty in the rotation after this, so that should give you some hours of uninterrupted sleep\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless I’m needed\", Egwene reminded him. She walked toward the tent flaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course\", Gawyn said, following her out, but shaking his head toward Bryne and Siuan. Bryne smiled back, nodding. On a battlefield, there was little that would absolutely require the Amyrlin’s attention.
