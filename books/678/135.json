Seeing his reflection, he supposed it to be another dog, outside, and said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I can chew up any such milksoppy pup as that, and I will.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo he ran out-of-doors and around to the side of the house where he fancied the enemy was. It so happened that at that moment a Bulldog sat there sunning his teeth. The Spaniel stopped short in dire consternation, and, after regarding the Bulldog a moment from a safe distance, said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know whether you cultivate the arts of peace or your flag is flung to the battle and the breeze and your voice is for war. If you are a civilian, the windows of this house flatter you worse than a newspaper, but if you’re a soldier, they do you a grave injustice.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis speech being unintelligible to the Bulldog he only civilly smiled, which so terrified the Spaniel that he dropped dead in his tracks.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864/947.html","bookId":678,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 9:31:09 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 9:31:09 AM"}
