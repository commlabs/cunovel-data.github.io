I will live and spend the rest of my life loving you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d better,” I said, wiping away my tears. “Or I’ll kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. Our palms met, and we held each other, knowing we might never let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day Kyrin was released from the hospital, healthy and whole, was the same day he and Lilla were exonerated of all charges.
