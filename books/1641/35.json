As of 2494 CE it was still a time of peace and prosperity, but Earth had begun to overreach its logistical ability to control her colonies. Several factors led to the destabilization of the more distant, or as later called, ―Outer\" Colonies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. There were widely varying standards for recruitment to the Outer Colonies. ―Colonization contractors\" were more interested in staking claims to valuable resource rights than providing the most-skilled personnel. Some people were illegally conscripted, and others were law-breakers granted pardons if they agreed to go—all of which led to these colonists being less than absolutely loyal to Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Some colonists struck out on their own, procuring by legal or illegal means transport to farther-flung worlds, partially or wholly outside Earth‘s control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Continued taxes, levies, and restricted trade practices by the CMA increased friction as the Outer Colonies received only a fraction of the benefits they were taxed for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation was a problem of physical as well as psychological dimensions. Mathematically the volume of the sphere increases as its radius cubed, and so the number of Outer Colonies grew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven such a numerical advantage and the fact that they encapsulated the Inner Core worlds, there was the belief that Earth and her close colonies were literally surrounded by increasingly hostile forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany now think this was a skewed perception, and that given diplomacy and enough time, Earth and her Inner Colonies could have established more harmonious relationships with her farther-flung cousins. Others point out, however, that had there been no military action, the Outer Colonies might have risen to power and threatened the core worlds at the worst possible moment in human history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll theoretical analysis aside, the United Earth government and her colonies developed new\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epolicies and an increased military presence that would provoke further unfortunate responses from the Outer Colonies . . . and lead to an undeclared Civil War.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor that, Earth would need more ships and crews . . . and officers to lead them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSECTION THREE: LUNA OFFICER CANDIDATE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCHOOL (2489–2493 CE)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole’s academic record at the Academy at Mare Nubium speaks for itself.

Cole was indeed the cadet who had the liaison with the admiral‘s daughter, but not the father of her child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany questions, however, central to understanding Cole remain unanswered. Did Admiral Volkov make him marry his daughter or did Cole—compelled by a sense of chivalry—offer to marry the disgraced young lady and provide a father for her unborn child?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole‘s admirers would say that he stepped up and did the noble thing: a young man with a sense of honor and morality (regardless of any possible indiscretions).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole‘s detractors, though, would claim this incident highlights his strategic and opportunistic nature: a cunning junior officer currying favor with the admiral at his most vulnerable moment, which would result in rapid promotion and assignment to choice (if remote) postings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr could it have been a little of both?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the reasons, Cole remained married to Inna for many years thereafter, fathering two more sons and one daughter (DNA analysis proves these were his), and he remained a loving father to all four children, writing to them often, and providing birthday gifts and support to them for the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a two-week honeymoon, Cole was reassigned for duties in the Outer Colonies aboard the UNSC destroyer Las Vegas .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSECTION FOUR: THE OUTER COLONY INSURGENCY:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE CALLISTO INCIDENT (2494 CE)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor decades prior to the end of the Colonial era (c. 2490 CE) Earth-based military forces had focused on colonization logistics, settling minor trade disputes, and perhaps chasing off the odd pirate. UNSC officers had studied how to engage in glorious, large-scale (but as yet hypothetical) battles against enemy states—not how to cope with an emboldened insurgency that could hide in the very populations they were sworn to protect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne event in particular (among a dozen similar incidents in the Outer Colonies),\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe Callisto Incident would shape Preston Cole’s early career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distant colony Levosia had been suspected of diverting refined selenium and technetium (used in the manufacture of FTL drives), which would yield huge profits on the black market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from lost taxes, however, Earth realized it could not allow insurgent forces access to FTL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eengine components. Therefore, Central Command (CENTCOM) ordered the Navy to blockade and search all ships in the system for suspected contraband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UNSC corvette Callisto stopped and boarded a trading vessel. The merchant crew was skittish due to rumors of impressments during similar searches in the Outer Colonies (a rumor started, we suspect, by insurgent sympathizers). A weapon was drawn and shots exchanged, resulting in the death of three naval officers and twenty-seven merchant crewmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo contraband was discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sparked outrage throughout the system. Thirty-seven days later, the Callisto ordered a similar merchant vessel to stand to and be searched. The merchant ship allowed the officers to board with all due courtesies. When the officers entered the cargo bay, they found it empty. The bay doors opened and the officers were blasted into space. The merchant crew then swarmed into the unsuspecting Callisto and murdered the remainder of the its crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Callisto was taken and its computer system gutted and replaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe insurgency was now armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response, a UNSC battle group of three light destroyers was sent to hunt down the Callisto.
