\u0026nbsp;But I said no prayers. \u0026nbsp;For I saw no phantom-ship. \u0026nbsp;And I brought my own ship safe to port. . . . \u0026nbsp;Hark, the wind comes again. \u0026nbsp;Like voices on it! \u0026nbsp;Hark!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The wind came crying from the sea. \u0026nbsp;Again it p. 244forced the casement open; as I reached the window, momentarily I saw the garden illumined by the moon. \u0026nbsp;I saw dark shadows hurrying to the house; I forced the window to, believing for the instant that I had seen only the shadows of the wind-tossed trees; remembering then Blunt’s threat to take me from the house, I feared.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When I re-lit the candles, my grandfather perceived my concern, and caught me by the arm, muttering, “What did ye see? \u0026nbsp;Or think to see?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I answered, “Shadows, maybe, or men—Blunt’s men.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Blunt’s men? \u0026nbsp;Or do ye think ’em ghosts? \u0026nbsp;Why do ye look so white, lad? \u0026nbsp;Why should Blunt’s men come here this night? \u0026nbsp;Look again!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Returning to the window, opening the casement, and peering down, I saw only the leaping shadows of the trees, much as those dark, hurrying figures. \u0026nbsp;I called back to him, “Shadows—only shadows!” and secured the casement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We sat in silence then by the fire. \u0026nbsp;The storm was nearing its height; wave of sound following upon wave of sound as breaker upon breaker; the house appeared to reel under the succession of shocks, always the voices sounded on the wind. \u0026nbsp;p. 245If there were sound below, if drunken voices, menacing voices, were uplifted, as seemed to me, I could not be assured; the wind usurped all sounds, in or without the house. \u0026nbsp;My grandfather lay back in his chair with his hands clutching its arms; I saw him lift his right hand from time to time, and eye it shaking with the palsy, the red gems leaping into flame upon it; for all his will and his professed hardihood, I believed that the terror of the night grew on him, even as on me. \u0026nbsp;He leaned forward at last, and quavered, “What’s death, d’ye think, lad? \u0026nbsp;What comes after?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How can I answer? \u0026nbsp;Who should tell?” I said, being in no mood now to preach faith or penitence to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You’re honest!” he said, nodding. \u0026nbsp;“Charles would have turned priest. \u0026nbsp;Charles would have talked of Judgment Day. \u0026nbsp;Ay, you’re honest! \u0026nbsp;Eighty years I’ve lived, and till these weeks past never thought of what came after; or of to-morrow but as to-day or yesterday. \u0026nbsp;I never thought of myself as dead. \u0026nbsp;John”—with sudden starting terror—“doesn’t that show it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What, sir—what?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When we die and rot and the worms have us, it’s not the end of us. \u0026nbsp;We’re never able to think of ourselves as dead!

\u0026nbsp;Show the light!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And while I held the candle, I saw in the recess a little iron door built into the stone; he set a key at last in the lock, and opening the door drew out a black box. \u0026nbsp;This box was deep, but of no great length; it was heavy, for he nigh dropped it when he pulled it out; he clutched it to his breast and bore it to his chair with him. \u0026nbsp;He p. 248cried to me, “Pull the curtain back. \u0026nbsp;Hide the panels! \u0026nbsp;Come and see!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He sat with the black box resting on his knees; it seemed of ebony, and was bound plainly with silver. \u0026nbsp;He set the key in the lock, and lifted the lid. \u0026nbsp;Leaning over him, I saw that the contents of the box were packed in black silk. \u0026nbsp;At his word, I aided him to lift this package out, and set the box down at his feet. \u0026nbsp;The silk reeked with spices; with clawing fingers he unfolded the wrapper of silk, till it draped about his knees to the hearth—a flag of black silk it seemed, wrought with a design in silver thread and ringed with silver. \u0026nbsp;And suddenly the grim thing shrouded in this black silken flag, broidered with the death’s head and cross bones, lay bare to me; for he gripped between his palms a white skull. \u0026nbsp;Now this skull was fashioned into the form of a casket overwrought with silver, having a silver lid upon the crown, and in the sockets of the eyes two blue jewels burning to the reflection of the candles and the fire with an unholy light. \u0026nbsp;The jaws were banded with silver, so that the skull resting on his palms, grinned at me, as shuddering I drew back, and dared not look upon the old man’s face and feared his laughter. \u0026nbsp;Lowering the skull upon his knees, he touched the silver crown of it with his p. 249fingers; the lid flew up; and instantly, at the wonder of it, I cried out, for it seemed that fire burned from the casket—a miracle of light and colour, as the flame upon the hearth and from the candles gave life to the gems within. \u0026nbsp;My grandfather’s fingers seemed to dip in fire. \u0026nbsp;He laughed to himself; he drew out wonderful gems; held them gorgeous and glowing on his palms; he let them fall back into the skull.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He muttered, “Only a little store, only a little store,—and yet half the years of my sinning, child, are told in this odd little box. \u0026nbsp;I had it fashioned to my fancy; they’re rare gems for its eyes. \u0026nbsp;D’ye understand what’s hid in it? \u0026nbsp;D’ye understand there’s not a man but would sell his soul for what’s in this little box? \u0026nbsp;D’ye see this white stone—this big white stone? \u0026nbsp;Did ever the moon or the sun shine like it? \u0026nbsp;Was ever blood so red as this red stone, or leaf so green as this, or ever the Main so blue? \u0026nbsp;Ay, there’s diamonds, there’s rubies, emeralds and sapphires; and there’s wonderful pearls. \u0026nbsp;And thirty years and odd went to fill this box. \u0026nbsp;Gold and plate, and many a precious thing that was scarce safe to sell—ivory and silks and spices—ay, they’re all told in the stones of this little box. \u0026nbsp;There’s been blood on these stones—many of ’em. \u0026nbsp;They’ve been plucked from white necks and dead fingers—ay, many of them!
