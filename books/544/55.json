In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter\u0027s room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come. -- He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy\u0027s hair.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, \"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out, \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth was forced to go. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\u0027!c?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/73/4087.html","bookId":544,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 1:10:02 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 1:10:02 AM"}
