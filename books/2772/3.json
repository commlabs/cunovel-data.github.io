{"id":86650,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Trish,\" Trish says, with an edge to her voice that implies don\u0027t talk to me unless I want you to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin doesn\u0027t look up from her book as she says in a small voice, \"I\u0027m Erin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt clears his throat. \"I\u0027m Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Maggie,\" I say, unable to resist a glance at Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks like he\u0027d rather go diving in shark or piranha-infested waters than be in this van. He stares at the floor mat. \"I\u0027m Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m Lenny,\" the guy who passed gas says, practically bouncing into the van and slipping into the spot next to Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb winces. \"Dude, if you fart again I\u0027m gonna kick your ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb, no threatening the other members of the group,\" Damon orders from the front seat. \"Lenny, let\u0027s keep it flatulence-free for now. Cool?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stifle a nervous giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try,\" Lenny says, giving Damon a thumbs-up. But as soon as we turn out of the parking lot, I hear Lenny say to Caleb, \"Wanna pull my finger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to look. Instead of pushing Lenny\u0027s finger away from his face or, better yet, ignoring him, Caleb grabs Lenny\u0027s finger and bends it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it,\" I tell Caleb as Lenny winces and tries to wrest his hand free. \"You\u0027re hurting him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened to Caleb to make him lash out so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb releases Lenny\u0027s finger. Lenny shoots Caleb a look that says he\u0027ll retaliate later, then scoots to the other side of the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked for it,\" Caleb says smugly as Lenny examines his bruised finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna sue you if it\u0027s sprained,\" Lenny warns. \"I play the guitar, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb smirks, then looks at me shaking my head. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn back around. I won\u0027t look at Caleb again. Not until I have to, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to me, Matt pulls out his cell phone and starts texting with his one hand. His palm cradles the phone while his thumb taps the keypad. I can\u0027t imagine it\u0027s easy for him, but he seems to be managing fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean forward, placing my hands on the seat in front of me. I\u0027ll make small talk with Trish and Erin. Anything is better than wondering about Caleb, and because we\u0027re going to be living in close quarters for the next month, I need to make friends with these girls. But I realize, pretty quick, that they don\u0027t want to chat. Trish puts headphones in her ears and lifts her hoodie to hide her face. Erin is so engrossed in her book I\u0027m not sure she knows that real life is going on around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slump back in my seat and stare out the window. The cornfields and farms outlining the Illinois landscape are a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, Matt,\" Caleb says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Switch seats with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink Maggie still has her mouth open in shock when I climb over the seat and Matt changes places with me. I don\u0027t like seeing another guy sitting next to her. I know it\u0027s stupid that I feel possessive when I have no right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon glances back. \"Caleb, stay in your seat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was getting carsick,\" I say. \"It\u0027s either switch seats or puke all over Maggie and Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at Maggie, who doesn\u0027t look too happy. She scoots further away from me when our knees touch, but she meets my stare with her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was carsick,\" I say dumbly. \"And Lenny smells like shit ... literally. I can\u0027t take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard that,\" Lenny says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" I say back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie flips her light brown hair back with a confidence I only got glimpses of when we were together. She tosses me a sideways glance. \"Why are you trying to start a fight with Lenny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not. He started it.\" I sound like a little kid, but at this point I don\u0027t care. What does Maggie think, that I\u0027m perfect? She should know by now that I\u0027m far from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re being confrontational.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with being confrontational?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie puts her regal nose in the air. \"I\u0027m sure you can figure that one out on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything okay back there?\" Damon pipes in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My finger hurts,\" Lenny blurts out. \"I need an ice pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes as Damon asks Lenny what happened. After a slight pause and a warning glare from me, Lenny says it\u0027s nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie takes out a travel guide of Spain and puts on a pair of wire-rimmed glasses. They must be new, because I haven\u0027t seen her with glasses before. She turns away from me and focuses on her book while chewing on the middle of her pencil. I watch as she makes circles on some of the pages and dog-ears others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Planning a trip to Spain? Again?\" I ask. Right before I left Paradise, she\u0027d said something about changing her mind and not taking her spring semester abroad after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closes the book and shoves it and the gnawed pencil in her backpack. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it. No details, no explanations. Not that she owes me any. She obviously doesn\u0027t want to talk to me, or look at me for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter two hours, Damon parks the van at a rest stop. \"Everyone out. Go to the bathroom and stretch your legs. We\u0027ll be eating a quick dinner here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we\u0027re waiting for everyone else to come back from the bathroom, I walk up to Maggie, who\u0027s standing over by the vending machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" I ask, trying to act normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me a look of both disgust and surprise. \"What\u0027s up? Are you kidding me, Caleb? You disappeared for eight months. You\u0027ve kind of passed the whats up stage by seven months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. I have a feeling nothing I say will be good enough, but I give it a try. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry too.\" Maggie turns and walks away, her limp a stark reminder of that fateful night two years ago. For a semi-crippled girl, she sure limps away fast. I jog to catch up to her, because I\u0027m stupid and can\u0027t leave well enough alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You telling me you haven\u0027t thought about us while I was gone?\" I ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. \"I\u0027ve thought about you. And then I thought about how you left me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t about you, Maggie. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to rehash it,\" she says as she nears the van. \"I\u0027ve moved on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step in front of her, stopping her before she gets too close to the rest of the group. They don\u0027t need to know our private business. \"You can\u0027t ignore me forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head and pushes me away. \"No, I can\u0027t ignore you. I couldn\u0027t even if I wanted to. But don\u0027t try and make me talk about ... us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispers the \"us\" as if it\u0027s a big secret and she doesn\u0027t want anyone to know we had a relationship that went beyond a simple friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the van after dinner, she puts her hands in her lap and stares straight ahead as Damon drives us to the campground. After a while, I notice her eyes starting to close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can lean on me if you want to sleep,\" I offer. \"I promise I won\u0027t, like, touch you or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. I brought a travel pillow.\" She reaches into her backpack and pulls out a plastic blow-up fluorescent green airplane pillow. She puffs air into it and wraps it around her neck, just like the Maggie I used to know. Emotional, self-aware Maggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe falls asleep almost instantly, and an hour later, everyone except Damon and I are asleep. The girl with the headphones is snoring so loud I wonder if Maggie and the tattooed girl will have to get earplugs before this trip is over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a nap, Caleb. We\u0027ve still got a ways to go,\" Damon says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stopped taking naps when I was two years old,\" I tell him, stealing another glance at the sleeping Maggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blow out a frustrated breath, then stare at my knee. I\u0027m bouncing it up and down to the rhythm of the van\u0027s engine. I\u0027m anxious and don\u0027t even know why. I wish I could get up and walk off this nervous energy, or run until my body screams for me to stop. Instead, I\u0027m stuck just sitting here, thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was in juvie, I had too much time to think. Thinking too hard and too long is dangerous for anyone with demons they\u0027re trying to fight off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Maggie sleeps, I envy her. I\u0027m glad she\u0027s moved on, but I\u0027m not sure I have. I left Paradise, but I\u0027m the same guy in the same predicament I was in then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we finally arrive at the campground, Damon hops out of the van to sign us in. He comes back five minutes later, frowning. \"Bad news,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The campers decided they didn\u0027t want to listen to a bunch of sob stories?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They only have one unoccupied cabin. That means ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys and girls are sleeping in the same cabin?\" Tattoo Girl asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon sighs. He\u0027s obviously thrown off by this deviation from his plan. \"Yeah. I\u0027ll be sleeping in the next cabin, with the counselors. I\u0027ll check in on you guys every few hours. Everyone okay with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Umm, no!\" the other girl announces. \"I\u0027m not changing in front of guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a girls\u0027 bathroom just a few feet away from the cabin,\" Damon informs her. \"You can change there, Trish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s the only option, then I\u0027ll live with it,\" Trish says. \"But for the record, I\u0027m not happy about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else is okay with the unexpected sleeping arrangements. Maggie looks a little nervous now that Damon has parked beside the super small cabin. We all pile out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the barely habitable cabin are three bunk beds, with sheets and pillows at the foot of each mattress but not much else. I worked construction a bunch of summers for my uncle and am pretty sure this place is put together with spit and glue ... and a few nails that popped years ago and nobody bothered to fix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get the bottom bunk,\" Matt says as he plops himself down onto one of the thin mattresses and sinks almost to the floor. \"Damn, Damon, this is roughing it to the max.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want a bottom one, too,\" Trish says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" I say, then watch as Maggie limps into the cabin. \"On second thought, I\u0027ll take a top bunk. Maggie needs a bottom bunk because of her, uh ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leg?\" Maggie finishes for me. \"You can say it, Caleb. It\u0027s not like it\u0027s a secret. Everyone can see I walk with a limp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, and while we\u0027re talking about obvious imperfections,\" Matt says, \"I might as well announce that I\u0027m aware I have a stump for an arm. It\u0027s the obvious white elephant in the room, so I just want y\u0027all to know it\u0027s okay to talk about it or ask me questions about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eww,\" Trish cries out. \"Do you have to call it a stump?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you rather I call it my partial appendage?\" Matt asks, pulling up his sleeve and showing off what remains of his left arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes a quick look at it. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon claps his hands together, getting our attention. \"Okay, everyone. Now that that\u0027s settled, get situated and then meet me outside in ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Outside?\" Trish asks. \"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis girl is definitely going to be in the race with Lenny for the most annoying person in our group. She hasn\u0027t smiled or said one remotely positive thing since this trip started. I have a feeling she\u0027s trying to make everyone have as miserable a time as she wants to have. Then again, I\u0027m with her-I\u0027d rather be back in Chicago than here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just come outside in ten,\" Damon says, then pushes open the screen door and disappears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTattoo Girl, whose name is Erin, jumps onto the top bunk above Maggie\u0027s bed. I take the one above Matt, knowing it doesn\u0027t really matter what bed I take because I probably won\u0027t fall asleep until I\u0027m so exhausted my body gives in. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-3.html","bookId":2772,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM"}
