At the back of a counter, tucked away behind a lifeless cash register, I find three small packets of peanuts. I swallow the contents of the first in a single mouthful, then do the same with the second. I shove the third into my trouser pocket for later. There\u0027s precious little time to think about food these days, but when I do get to eat I realize just how much I\u0027ve missed it. Maybe one day I\u0027ll get to eat a proper meal again, if I survive the next couple of days, that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a half-open door behind the bar I hadn\u0027t noticed before. I lean inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the hell\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI back out of the low-lit storeroom quickly, startled by the voice from the darkness. The door lets some light in, and I can see someone in the corner, sitting wedged between two piles of empty boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looks up and shakes his head. I recognize him from last night. His name\u0027s Parsons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter, my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve only been awake for a couple of hours, but already the drawn-out tedium of waiting to fight is getting to me. The idea of a conversation-any distraction-is appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keeping out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? You pissed Julia off or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show me someone who hasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what he means. Being around Julia reminds me of working for Tina Murray, my sour old bitch of a supervisor back at the PFP. Wonder what happened to her...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParsons gestures for me to come closer. I do as he says, then slide down the wall and sit next to him. It\u0027s stiflingly hot in the social club this morning now that the sun\u0027s up, but the dark storeroom is refreshingly cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you ready for this?\" I ask. \"Ready to go out there and start fighting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Course I am,\" he answers, almost too quickly. \"Can\u0027t wait to start killing again. Can\u0027t wait to see them panic when we get given the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s an awkward silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t sound convinced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence continues as he thinks about what I just said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not. I mean, don\u0027t get me wrong, I know what\u0027s got to be done and I know this is probably the only way to make it happen. It\u0027s just that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me neither,\" I admit. \"Who does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one in their right mind. They\u0027re all talking about this battle like it\u0027s a holy war or something, and it\u0027s doing my head in. I don\u0027t want to be stuck in the middle of the city when they level the place like they did London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s got to be done. You can\u0027t deny that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know... I\u0027m just nervous, you know?\" he admits, keeping his voice low. \"I can\u0027t stand all this hanging around. You know what it\u0027s like when you know you\u0027ve got to fight, you just want to get on and do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s right. It\u0027s a relief to find someone else who\u0027s willing to speak candidly about how they\u0027re feeling. Most everyone else is too busy spouting propaganda and bullshit bravado to dare admit that they\u0027re apprehensive about what\u0027s coming. They talk like I imagine Brutes think-focused on the kill at all costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You been here long?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got here about half a day before you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And were you at that convent place with Sahota?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve all been through that. Quite the eye-opener, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParsons stares into space, thinking hard. I sense there\u0027s more he wants to say, but he\u0027s not sure whether he can speak. Perhaps hethinks I\u0027m testing his dedication to the cause? I study his tired face. He looks about ten years older than me, and I wonder what it is we have in common that made us both suitable fodder for Sahota\u0027s organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did you believe any of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All that stuff the Unchanged were spouting at Sahota\u0027s place? Breaking the cycle and all that crap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t answer immediately. Can I trust this man? Now I\u0027m wondering if he\u0027s the one testing my allegiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of it,\" I answer, being deliberately vague. \"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree with most of it up to a point. What Sahota said scared me more, though. I get the feeling they\u0027re just using us as-\" He stops suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly get up and go back out into the bar. Someone\u0027s banging on the outside of the fire exit I entered through yesterday. Apart from me and Parsons there\u0027s no one else down here, and I realize it\u0027s up to me to confront whoever\u0027s out there. I move quickly across the room, grabbing a broken pool cue to use as a weapon, then stand by the door and wait. The hammering continues. The door\u0027s solid-no way of knowing who it is without opening it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it,\" Parsons hisses from across the room. Cowardly fucker, why don\u0027t you come over here and open it? Rather than argue, I take a deep breath, tighten my grip on my pool cue bludgeon, then open the door. There\u0027s a teenaged girl standing in front of me, looking as tense and unsure as I did when I first arrived here. She only looks about fifteen. She\u0027s one of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for Julia Chapman,\" she says, her voice surprisingly confident and strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is?\" I ask, remembering back to my first encounter here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Sophie Wilson,\" she answers, handling the situation far better than I did, \"and I\u0027ve got a message for her from Sahota.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let her in, quickly glancing around the back of the building to make sure she hasn\u0027t been followed before shutting and barring the fire exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lead her through the eerily quiet building, Parsons following us at a cautious distance. I take her upstairs to where I last left Julia talking to Craven, but she\u0027s not there. He points up at the ceiling. I double back and head up to the roof, covering my eyes at the sudden brightness. The sun is huge in the clear sky high above us. Julia\u0027s sitting on one of the deckchairs under the tarpaulin, looking into the city through a pair of binoculars. She lowers them when she hears us approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is-\" I start to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You Julia?\" Sophie asks. Julia nods. \"Got a message for you from Sahota. He said to tell you that I\u0027m the last one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said: Town hall, south side. Six a.m. Five others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia looks at her for a second, absorbing what she\u0027s been told. Then she nods her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Get some rest while you can. There might still be some food left downstairs. Ask one of the others and they\u0027ll show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie heads back down without question, leaving me with Julia. Parsons hovers behind us nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did her message mean?\" I ask, feeling like I\u0027m the only one who\u0027s not in the know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means there\u0027s as many of us here as there\u0027s ever gonna be. It means it\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look straight ahead, determined not to let her see how nervous I\u0027m suddenly feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"South side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"South side of the town hall is where he wants us to base ourselves,\" she answers, looking through the binoculars again. \"It\u0027s where I thought he\u0027d want us to be, close enough to the military to cause them problems, far enough out not to be suspicious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And five others? What was that all about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five other groups like ours. That\u0027s not so good. We were hoping for double that. Should still be enough, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where will they be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know, and I don\u0027t care. All I know and all you need to know is that we\u0027ll go where we\u0027re told to and cause fucking chaos when the time\u0027s right. Between six groups of us, their military won\u0027t know which way to turn. The panic will spread fast, and before you know it the whole city will be fighting. And if we do it right, before long there won\u0027t be a city left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There won\u0027t be anything left,\" Parsons mumbles under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit down on the edge of the roof and stare into the distance. The Unchanged camp looks like a massive, dirty black machine from here. Clouds of gray smoke billow up from between buildings like belching exhaust fumes. Helicopters buzz through the air like flies around a corpse. There\u0027s no point denying it, being this close to the enemy makes me want to march in there and start killing. Or it would if I didn\u0027t feel the odds were stacked against us. It\u0027s probably just me. Perhaps I\u0027m at fault? Maybe I should have more faith? But like I keep telling myself, I don\u0027t want to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just imagine it,\" Julia says wistfully, looking deep into the distance. \"Imagine when we start to fight and they start to run, when they panic and try to get away from us, then run straight into the next battle. Christ, it\u0027ll be beautiful. It won\u0027t take much, you know; just the minimum of coordination from us will be enough to start it off, and they\u0027ll do the rest themselves. It\u0027ll be a chain reaction. We\u0027ll be able to sit back and watch them killing each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I should keep my mouth shut, but I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except we won\u0027t, will we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once we\u0027re in there, there\u0027s no way back out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter. All that\u0027s important is wiping out the enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But at what cost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t coexist, end of story. The cost is irrelevant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m making things worse for myself, but I can\u0027t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What good is winning if you\u0027re dead? What did they used to call that, a Pyrrhic victory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what?\" Parsons asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Pyrrhic victory,\" Julia sighs. \"It\u0027s when you win the battle, but the end result leaves you fucked, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" he grunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" she says to me, putting down the binoculars and standing up, \"and you need to stop talking like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How am I wrong? Once we\u0027re in the city, there\u0027s very little chance of any of us getting out alive, is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a sacrifice we have to make.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where will your pal Sahota be when all of this is going on? Watching from his office? When we\u0027re gone, who\u0027s left? Just kids and Brutes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. \"You come up with an alternative and I\u0027ll listen. Do you want the Unchanged to survive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there\u0027s got to be a better way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there was, don\u0027t you think someone like Sahota would have come up with it by now? If there was any alternative, don\u0027t you think we\u0027d have tried it? None of us wants to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My point exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if your death results in the death of hundreds of the enemy, thousands even, then it has to be worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t bother to respond. She\u0027s bought into this completely, like a brainwashed old-school terrorist about to embark on a jihad. Even if my death were to result in tens of thousands of Unchanged being killed, I still don\u0027t want it to happen. And what about Ellis? I\u0027d rather fight steadily and have this war drag on for years than sacrifice myself today. I can\u0027t stand the thought of not seeing her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia\u0027s not going to let this go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to focus on what\u0027s coming,\" she says, a sneering, threatening tone in her voice. \"Craven said you were looking up information about your family earlier. Forget them, whoever and whatever they were. Your only allegiance now is to us. Nothing else matters apart from what we do when we get back into the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares into my face, then walks away, stopping before she disappears down the stepladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you screw up when we\u0027re in there,\" she warns, \"then so help me, I\u0027ll kill you myself. This is too important for an idiot like you to fuck up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch her go, shaking my head in disbelief. Parsons quietly takes her place in the now empty deckchair. I forgot he was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with you, pal,\" he says, shielding his eyes from the sun, \"but I\u0027ve got enough sense to keep my mouth shut.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-32.html","bookId":2556,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM"}
