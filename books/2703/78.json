I had no idea my brother was such a romantic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Disgusting, isn’t it?” Ten asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline sniffed and sent him a glare, bumping his shoulder with her knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy glaze slid unwillingly to Quinn. His lips had tipped up in a smile as he watched Noel and Aspen. Then, as if he felt my stare, he looked up. Instead of frowning at me for staring, his smile only widened. Then he returned his attention to the main couple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my chest still pounded from that half of a second we’d shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. I was so pathetic. I couldn’t believe I had such a raging crush on my roommate’s boyfriend. Bad enough that Cora even knew about it, now I was longing for stolen little glances that probably meant nothing to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder Cora had been so nasty and unfriendly to me lately. She probably thought I was actually going to try to steal him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced my attention back to Noel and Aspen just as the song drew to a close. Noel let go of Aspen to kneel down in front of her and pull a ring from his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline gasped. “Oh my God. Oh my God!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAspen took a step back, and her mouth fell open as tears filled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t hear the actual proposal from where I sat, but I could tell what her response was when she leapt at him, hugging him and kissing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude,” Ten spoke up. “I can’t believe you’re freaking proposing to a break-up song.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” Caroline hissed, slapping his shoulder. “Before I punch you in the nuts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” He glanced at her in shock before he motioned to Noel and Aspen, who were still kissing. “I’m just saying...that can’t be good luck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s her favorite song. Who cares what the lyrics say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen snorted. “Obviously no one.” He turned away, taking a huge gulp of his beer, and focused his attention on Asher singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the tense set of his shoulders and the tormented expression on Caroline’s face before glancing away to focus back on Noel and Aspen. But, yeah, they were still connected at the mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow.” I turned away from the bar completely to face outward. “They’re really going at it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to me, Cora laughed. “Oh, Zoey. You poor innocent little virgin. Look at your blush.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my mortification, she said it loud enough that all the Forbidden people could no doubt hear her. Just wanting to sink into a hole and die, I continued to blush as she went on. “We totally need to get you some experience. Quinn, baby, let’s set Zoey up with one of your single friends. We could do a double date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn froze and sent her a look that told her going on a double date with me was the last thing he wanted to do. It was the last thing I wanted to do, too. I didn’t want to see him and Cora hanging all over each other any more than necessary, much less purposely trap myself into a front row seat of watching it all night long. But knowing Quinn didn’t want to spend an evening with me either, hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy didn’t he want to hang out with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to tell Cora there was no way I’d go on a double date with her and Quinn—blind dates equaled hell in my book—when Ten suddenly turned to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stopped drinking whatever they were drinking and gaped at him. Caroline even choked on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, taking in all the expressions focused on him. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since when do you double date?” Quinn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since now, I guess.” Glancing at me, he grinned and wiggled his eyebrows. “What do you say, Blondie? It could be fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced toward Caroline. Her expression was surprisingly blank. She was watching the band as if she wasn’t listening in on every word we said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t say yes. I didn’t want to say yes. But what if Cora kept pressuring me until she found someone else, someone I didn’t know. Ten was the antithesis of any guy I would consider dating, but for some reason I trusted him, and I somehow knew he didn’t want to go out with me because he was interested in me. He had some kind of agenda. And whatever it was, I’d rather take a chance on him and his ulterior motive than someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” I mumbled. “I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d said I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy in the world had she said I guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she like Ten? I could tell Caroline was into him, but I’d never caught that vibe from Zoey. So why would she ever agree to go out with him? And what’s more, why had he asked her to? Ten didn’t do the dating thing. He was more of a one-night stand kind of guy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-78.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
