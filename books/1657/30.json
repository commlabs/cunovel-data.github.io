Perry drew a slow breath, working up the courage to say what he’d wanted to for days. Everything could change when they fixed the Smarteye. This could be his last chance to tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria . . . everyone feels lost and low. It’s how a person acts that makes them different. These last days you kept going despite those feet. Despite not knowing your way . . . Despite me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t tell if that was a compliment or an apology.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peered at her. “Both. I could’ve been kinder to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could have at least said a little more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “I don’t know about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, and then her eyes turned serious. “I could have been kinder too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scooted herself back against the headboard. Her dark hair fell straight to her shoulders, framing her small chin. Her pink lips turned up in a soft smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll forgive you on two conditions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry leaned back on his good arm and stole a look at her. Her body belonged in tight clothes, not in camos. He felt guilty looking, but he couldn’t help it. “Yeah? What are they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First, tell me what your temper is like right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe covered his surprised gasp with a cough. “My temper?” No way this was a good idea. He searched for a gentle way to say no. “I could try,” he said after a moment, and then pushed a hand through his hair, shocked at what he’d just agreed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. . . .” He fiddled with the edge of his cast. “Scents, the way I get them, are more than smells. They have weights and temperatures sometimes. Colors, too. I don’t think it’s like that for others. My bloodline on my father’s side is strong. Probably the strongest line of Scires.” He stopped himself, not wanting to sound boastful. He realized his thighs were flexed tight. “So, my temper right now is probably cool. And heavy. That’s what sorrow is like. Dark and thick, like stone. Like the scent coming off a wet rock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at her. She didn’t look like she wanted to laugh so he kept going. “There’d be more. Most of the time, a lot of times . . . there are a few scents in a temper. Nervous tempers are sharp scents. Like laurel leaves? Something bright and tingling like that? Nervous tempers are hard to ignore. So there’d be some of that probably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you nervous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry smiled down at his cast. “That question makes me nervous.” He made himself look at her. Looking at her wasn’t working either, so he pinned his gaze on the lamp. “I can’t do this, Aria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now you have an idea how it feels. How exposed I feel around you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry laughed. “That was tricky of you. You want to know what I’m nervous about now? That you have a second condition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a condition. It’s more of a request.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery part of him was locked tight, waiting for what she’d say next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria pulled the covers over her, hugging them close. “Will you stay? I think I’d sleep better if you stayed here tonight. Then we could miss them together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis impulse was to agree. She was beautiful sitting against the headboard, her skin looking smoother, softer than the sheets pulled up around her. But Perry hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleeping was the most dangerous thing a Scire could do with another person. Tempers mixed in the harmony of sleep. They tangled up, forming their own bonds. Scires became rendered that way, as had happened with him and Talon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t know why he thought of this only now, but he didn’t need to worry. Scires seldom rendered to anyone outside their Sense. And she was a Dweller. The furthest thing from being a Scire. Besides, he’d been sleeping within feet of her for more than a week. What difference would another day make?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s eyes flicked to the soft carpet, then back to Aria. “I’ll be right here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarron had a running countdown to when they could safely power up her Smarteye. He showed it to Aria in the morning, when he took her down to the Navel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven hours, forty-three minutes, and twelve seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an estimate, but Aria knew enough about Marron to take the numbers for their worth. The room was spare and cold compared to the rest of Delphi. A collection of computer equipment. A desk and a couch. It had a sacred air. She had the impression no one came down there except Marron. Aria noticed a vase of roses sitting on a little coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You liked the other one so,” Marron said, beaming, then he quietly set to work on her Smarteye at his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria sat on the couch, her stomach rolling with nerves. She couldn’t tear her eyes from the numbers on the wallscreen. Was the recording of Ag 6 still in the Eye? Was the “Songbird” file? Would she be able to find Lumina and Talon? Only an hour had passed when Marron invited her on a walk outside. She agreed right away. Her feet were still sore, but she’d go crazy down here all alone. Time had never moved more slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe searched for Perry as they moved through Delphi’s halls. She’d stayed awake listening to the steady rhythm of his breathing during the night. But when she’d woken that morning, he hadn’t been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria immediately noticed a change in the courtyard as she stepped outside with Marron. Only a few people were moving about, compared with the bustle she’d seen when she stormed in with Cinder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is everyone?” Aria glanced at the sky. She’d seen much worse than the veinlike flows above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarron’s expression sobered. He looped her arm through his as they continued on the cobblestone path. “We had a few arrows over the wall early this morning from the Croven. They were careless shots fired before daylight. Aimed to strike fear more than anything else. In that, they were successful. I was hoping they’d have relaxed by now, but it appears . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarron trailed off as he looked toward Delphi. Rose and Slate hurried toward them, Rose’s dark braid swinging behind her. She was talking before she’d even stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The boy, Cinder, is gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He left through the east gate,” Slate added quickly. He looked furious with himself. “He was already out when the tower spotted him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarron’s arm tensed around hers. “This is intolerable under the circumstances. It cannot happen. Who was on that post?” He strode off with Slate, still ranting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria couldn’t believe it. After everything, after carrying him there, Cinder had gone? “Does Perry know?” she asked Rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I don’t think so.” Rose pursed her lips in disapproval. Then she rolled her eyes. “You should try the roof first. That’s where he usually is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Aria said, and then dashed for Delphi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRose called out behind her, teasing. “Your feet look like they’re healing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria took the elevator to the top of Delphi and stepped onto the roof, a vast stretch of cement with only a wooden rail framing the perimeter. Perry sat against it, gazing up at the Aether, his wounded arm propped onto his knee. He smiled when he saw her and strode over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached her, his smile fell. “What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cinder’s gone. He left. I’m sorry, Perry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face tightened, and then he looked away and shrugged. “It’s all right. I didn’t even know him.” He was quiet for a moment. “Are you sure he’s gone? They looked for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. The guards saw him leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked to the edge of the roof. Perry propped his arms on the rail, lost in thought as he stared across the trees. Aria took in the long sweep of the wall, curving wide around Delphi. She saw the gate she’d run through just yesterday, and the towers, evenly spaced around the perimeter. Some seventy feet below, animal pens and gardens made neat geometric patterns of the courtyard. She’d just been down there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who told you I was up here?” Perry asked. The disappointment had faded from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rose.” Aria smiled. “She told me lots of things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cringed. “She did? What did she say? No, don’t tell me. I don’t want to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahh . . . that’s cruel. Now you’re just kicking me while I’m down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and they fell quiet again. The silence between them felt good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria,” he said after a while. “I want to wait for the Smarteye with you but I can’t stay in the Navel. Not for long. Makes me skitty being that deep underground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It makes you skitty?” For a lethal creature, sometimes he used words that struck her as utterly childish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shaky? Like you can’t be still?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “Can I wait with you up here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said, grinning. “I was hoping for that.” He threaded his legs beneath the wooden rail, letting them hang over the edge. Aria sat cross-legged beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is my favorite place in Delphi. It’s the best spot to read the wind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes as a breeze swept past, searching for what he meant. She smelled smoke and pine on the cool wind. The skin along her arms tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are your feet?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re still a little sore, but much better,” she said, moved by the simple question. With him, it wasn’t small talk. He was always looking after people. “Talon’s lucky to have an uncle like you,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “No. It’s my fault he was taken. I’m just trying to fix it. I’ve got no choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re rendered. There’s a bond between us through our tempers. I feel what he feels. I don’t just scent it. Same for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t imagine being linked with a person that way. She thought of what both Roar and Rose had said about Scires keeping to their kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry leaned forward, crossing his arms over the rail. “Being away from him, it’s like part of me is gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll find him, Perry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rested his chin on the rail. “Thanks,” he said, his eyes fixed on the courtyard below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s gaze moved to his arm. He’d pushed his sleeves up above his elbows because of the cast. A strong vein laced the swell of his bicep. One of his Markings was a band of angled slashes. The other was made of flowing lines like waves. She had the urge to touch them. Her eyes trailed up to his profile, following the small rise at the top of his nose, finding the thin scar at the edge of his lip. Maybe she wanted to touch more than his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s head snapped over to her and she realized he knew. Heat bloomed across her cheeks. He’d scent her embarrassment, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scooted to the edge and swung her legs over the side of the roof like him and tried to look interested in the goings-on below. The courtyard showed more signs of life. People were moving here and there. A man split firewood with practiced thwacks of an ax. A dog barked at a young girl who held something high, out of its reach. As much as she concentrated on what she saw, she still felt Perry’s attention on her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/under-the-never-sky-under-the-never-sky-1/page-30.html","bookId":1657,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:20 PM"}
