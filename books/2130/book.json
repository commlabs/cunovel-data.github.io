Drizzt and Catti-brie have been away from Mithral Hall for six long years, but the pain of a lost companion still weighs heavily on their strong shoulders. Chasing pirates aboard Captain Deudermont\u0027s Sea Sprite is enough to draw their attention away from their grief. Then a mysterious castaway on an uncharted island sends them back to the very source of their pain, and into the clutches of a demon with vengeance on his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/passage-to-dawn-legacy-of-the-drow-4.jpg","author":"R.A.
