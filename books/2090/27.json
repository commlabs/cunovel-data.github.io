But really, what are the odds that one of those I\u0027ve examined has turned up here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty damn slim,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, the werewolves in the basement could be free, but they\u0027d also been locked up when the disappearances began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did the doctor have a bite mark?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Which leads me to believe the making of a witchie wolf involves the bite of a werewolf in human form,\" Nic said. \"How about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI contemplated the body, which was still quite visible. \"I\u0027m thinking that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We still don\u0027t know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Lydia will find a book, and it will explain everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Including how to get rid of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t that be nice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm,\" I murmured, still staring at the doctor. \"Do you think he was killed because he was on to something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the bad guy meant to keep his identity a secret, why leave the evidence behind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We interrupted him.\" I reached out and plucked the slide from the stage and the notebook from the table. \"Just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I should send that stuff to the crime lab. Free service for all U.S. law enforcement agencies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you imagine what would happen if a government scientist got a gander at the saliva of a werewolf in human form?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt he\u0027d know what it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. So what good would showing him do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None.\" Nic sighed. \"And then we\u0027d have FBI all over the place, asking questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting eaten by werewolves they didn\u0027t know about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chaos. I see your point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should just handle this on our own as we\u0027ve been doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Nic glanced at the doctor. \"We\u0027ll need to get someone to take care of the body. Leaving it here isn\u0027t practical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved a hand at Dr. Watchry. \"I\u0027m not used to this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that I was used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People I\u0027ve just met, and liked, getting killed the minute I turn my back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Understanding spread across his face. \"Happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you stand it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By pushing aside useless emotion and focusing on what\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Important?\" My voice rose several levels in pitch and volume. \"What could be more important than someone\u0027s murder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finding the one who killed them and making them pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the righteous indignation went out of me like the air out of a popped balloon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic smiled. \"We\u0027ll handle this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnspoken was the word together, but I heard it nevertheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s find Basil,\" I said. \"Tell him about the doctor\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And ask him about stray Ojibwe warrior graves. I could also use a list of the missing. Any connection between them could give us a clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThoughts like those were why I kept him around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze wandered over the biceps that stretched the seams of his T-shirt. Among other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe locked the clinic behind us - didn\u0027t need any citizens stumbling over the body - then headed for the sheriff\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was still empty. Nic strode over to the desk and started rooting through the paperwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, can you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a Fed. I can do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thinking like that is usually what gets you guys in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored me. I had to say I found his take-charge attitude attractive. What didn\u0027t I find attractive about him lately?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-ha!\" He held up a sheet of paper. \"List of missing persons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick glance around the room, and he located a Xerox machine, made a copy, and slipped the original back into the file. \"He\u0027ll never know I was here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to ask why all the secrecy, and the door burst open. Both Nic and I turned in that direction with welcoming smiles, which froze on our faces when we didn\u0027t recognize the man who ran inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d seen a few survivalists in Montana. This guy must have been one of their friends. Beard, long hair, jeans, boots, and a flannel shirt. He was young, perhaps twenty-five, no more than thirty. Might even have been handsome without all the hair and the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need the sheriff,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dead one or the new one?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Basil\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"FBI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn expression of relief filled his eyes. \"I found a body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell. Another one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic grabbed a pencil and a sheet of paper. \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out on the old highway. Anderson homestead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic and I exchanged glances. \"Where Sheriff Stephenson\u0027s body was found?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Exactly where his body was found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A second body? Left in the same place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not left. The grave was dug up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grave desecration,\" I muttered, and smacked myself in the forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy only excuse for not seeing the connection earlier was that I\u0027d been focused on finding an Ojibwe warrior\u0027s grave, not that I would have known what one looked like even if I\u0027d seen it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reason the sheriff was at the old Anderson place was that there\u0027d been a report of a grave desecration.\" I turned toward the mountain man. \"But we didn\u0027t see anything disturbed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is now. From the paw prints in the dirt, I\u0027d say dogs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe. But doubtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They probably couldn\u0027t help themselves,\" he continued. \"The body was pretty fresh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean skeleton,\" Nic said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Definitely a body. Newly dead. I\u0027d say no more than a week or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you guess at a cause of death?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking the large, gaping knife wound at the throat had something to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen a few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic and I exchanged glances again. I really didn\u0027t want to know where this guy had seen death by knife wound to the throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get another ME from... anywhere,\" Nic muttered. \"We have to find out who was in the grave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A woman,\" Mountain Man stated in a dry, clinical tone. \"Native American. Pretty old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell!\" Nic muttered at the same time I kicked the desk. Mountain Man stared at us as if we\u0027d lost our minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah. Thanks for coming by.\" Nic ushered him to the door. \"We\u0027ll send someone out as soon as - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We find someone,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic closed the door and turned to me. \"I guess an Ojibwe warrior isn\u0027t necessarily a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m betting it\u0027s Cora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lydia said she passed away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027d been no mention of throat cutting - an item that would have topped my list in any conversation about a dead grandmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lydia said a lot of things,\" I pointed out. \"We\u0027d better talk to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Gramma passing away is a whole lot different than Gramma getting her throat slit and being buried in the woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would Dr. Watchry insist there\u0027d never been a murder in Fairhaven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps Cora didn\u0027t die in Fairhaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get a read on Lydia?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seemed nice enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant, did you bump against her when you passed or at least shake her hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think she\u0027s a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went over the meeting with Lydia in my mind. \"I never touched her.
