Beyond the waist-high railing she\u0027d seen the head and chest of one of the guards, but not Malone. Then she\u0027d watched as Zovastina fired her weapon, the bullet careening off the marble floor inches from Thorvaldsen. The Dane had stood his ground, never moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement to her right drew her attention. A man appeared in the stairway arch, gun in hand. He spotted her and raised his weapon, but never gained the chance to fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot him in the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was thrown back, arms flailing. She finished the kill with one more well-placed shot. Across the nave, forty meters away, she saw the other guardsman advancing deeper into the museum\u0027s exhibits. She unshouldered the bow and found an arrow, but kept a position back from the railing so as not to give Zovastina a chance at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was concerned. Just before the attacker appeared, Viktor had disappeared below into the lower transept. Where had he gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe mated the arrow\u0027s nock to the bowstring and gripped the bow\u0027s handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe retracted the string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard winked in and out through the dim light of the opposite transept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE WAITED. HIS GUN WAS DRAWN, ALL HE NEEDED WAS FOR the guardsman to advance a few feet closer. He\u0027d managed to retreat to the end cap of one of the exhibits, using the shadows for protection, his steps light on the wood flooring, three gunshots from out in the nave masking his movements. Impossible to say where they\u0027d originated since the resounding echoes camouflaged any sense of direction. He really didn\u0027t want to shoot the guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooksellers, generally, did not kill people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he doubted there was going to be much choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew a breath and made his move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZOVASTINA STARED AT HENRIK THORVALDSEN AS MORE GUNSHOTS erupted above. Her thirty minutes alone in the basilica had turned into a crowded melange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen motioned to the wooden box on the floor. \"Not what you expected, was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to be honest. \"Worth a try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ptolemy\u0027s riddle could be a hoax. People have searched for Alexander the Great\u0027s remains for fifteen hundred years with no success.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And does anyone actually believe St. Mark was in that box?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"An awful lot of Venetians certainly do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to leave, so she called out, \"Viktor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a problem, Minister?\" a new voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichener.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest stepped into the lighted presbytery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed her gun at him. \"You lied to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE CREPT LEFT AS THE GUARDSMAN KEPT TO THE RAILING and moved right. He sidestepped a wooden lion attached to a carved ducal throne and crouched behind a waist-high exhibit of tapestries that separated him from his pursuer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scampered ahead, intent on doubling around before the man had a chance to react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the end of the exhibit, turned, and prepared to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arrow pierced the guardsman\u0027s chest, sucking the breath away. He saw a shocked look sweep over the man\u0027s face as he groped for the implanted shaft. Life left him as his body collapsed to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone\u0027s head whirled left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the nave Cassiopeia stood, bow in hand, her face frozen, bearing no emotion. Behind her, high in the outer wall loomed a darkened rose window. Below the window, Viktor emerged from the shadows and moved toward Cassiopeia, a gun coming shoulder high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZOVASTINA WAS ANGRY. \"YOU KNEW THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT tomb,\" she said to Michener.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could I know that? It hasn\u0027t been opened in over a hundred and seventy years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell your pope the Church will not be allowed within the Federation, concordat or no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pass the message along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe faced Thorvaldsen. \"You never said. What\u0027s your interest in all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To stop you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll find that difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. You have to leave this basilica and the airport is a long boat ride away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d come to realize that they\u0027d chosen their trap with care. Or, more accurately, they\u0027d allowed her to choose it. Venice. Surrounded by water. No cars. Buses. Trains. Lots of slow-moving boats. Leaving could well pose a problem. What was it? An hour\u0027s ride to the airport?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the confident glare of the two staring at her from five meters away was no comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVIKTOR APPROACHED THE WOMAN WITH THE BOW. RAFAEL\u0027S killer. The woman who\u0027d just speared another of his guardsmen in the opposite transept. She needed to die, but he realized that was foolish. He\u0027d listened to Zovastina and knew that things were not going well. To leave, they\u0027d need insurance. So he pressed the barrel of his gun into the nape of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should shoot you,\" he spit out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What sport would that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough to even the score.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say we\u0027re even. Ely, for your partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fought a rising anger and forced his mind to think. Then an idea dawned. A way to bring the situation back under control. \"Move to the railing. Slowly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strode three steps forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minister,\" he called out over the balustrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced past his captive and saw Zovastina looking up, her gun still pointed at the two men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one,\" he said to her, \"will be our pass out of here. A hostage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent idea, Viktor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t know what a mess you\u0027ve made, does she?\" the woman whispered to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll die before uttering the first word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to worry. I won\u0027t tell her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE SAW CASSIOPEIA\u0027S PREDICAMENT. HE SPRANG TO THE railing and aimed his gun across the nave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toss it down,\" Viktor called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored the command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d do as he says,\" Zovastina said from below. Her gun was still trained on Michener and Thorvaldsen. \"Or I will shoot these two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Supreme Minister of the Central Asian Federation committing murder in Italy? I doubt it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True,\" Zovastina said. \"But Viktor can easily kill the woman, which should not be a problem for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toss it,\" Cassiopeia said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized that to comply was foolish. Just retreat into the shadows and remain a threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Thorvaldsen said from below, \"do as Cassiopeia says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to trust that both his friends knew what they were doing. Wrong? Probably. But he\u0027d done stupid things before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe allowed the pistol to drop over the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"BRING HER DOWN,\" ZOVASTINA CALLED OUT TO VIKTOR. \"YOU,\" she said to the other man who\u0027d just tossed away his gun. \"Come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not move from his perch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Cotton,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"Do as she says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hesitation and the man disappeared from the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You control him?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor and his female captive entered the presbytery. The other man, the one Thorvaldsen commanded, followed them a moment later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" she asked him. \"Thorvaldsen called you Cotton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name\u0027s Malone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you?\" she said, staring at the woman with the archer\u0027s bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend of Ely Lund.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was happening? She desperately needed to know, so she thought fast and motioned at Viktor\u0027s female captive. \"That one is coming with me. To ensure safe passage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minister,\" Viktor said. \"I think it would be better if she stays here, with me. I can hold her until you\u0027re away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head and pointed at Thorvaldsen. \"Take him with you. Somewhere safe. Once I\u0027m in the air, I\u0027ll call and you can let him go. Any problems, kill him and make sure the body is never found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minister,\" Michener said, \"since I\u0027m the cause of all this chaos, how about me as a hostage and let\u0027s leave this gentleman out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how about taking me with you instead of her?\" Malone asked. \"Never been to the Central Asian Federation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appraised the American. Tall and confident. Probably an agent. But she wanted to know more of the woman\u0027s connection to Ely Lund. Anyone who knew Lund closely enough to risk her life to avenge him bore further investigation. But Michener. She could only hope Viktor was allowed the opportunity to kill the lying scum. \"All right, priest, you go with Viktor. As for you, Mr. Malone, perhaps another time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAMARKAND\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVINCENTI AWOKE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was reclined in the helicopter\u0027s comfortable leather seat. Flying east, away from the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone lying in his lap was vibrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe read the LCD screen. Grant Lyndsey. Chief scientist at the China lab. He stuffed a fob into his ear and pushed \"Phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re done,\" his employee said to him. \"Zovastina has all of the organisms and the lab is converted. Clean and complete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith what Zovastina had planned, he had no intention of the West, or the Chinese government, raiding his facility and linking him to anything. Only eight scientists had worked on the project, Lyndsey their head. All vestiges of their work were now gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pay everyone and send them on their way. O\u0027Conner will visit them and provide for their retirement.\" He heard the silence from the other end of the phone. \"Not to worry, Grant. Gather the computer data and head to my house over the border. We\u0027ll have to wait and see what the Supreme Minister actually does with her arsenal before we act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what he wanted to hear. \"I\u0027ll be seeing you before the day is out. We have work to do. Get moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clicked off the phone and lay back in the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought again about the old dwarf in the Pamir mountains. Back then Tajikistan had been primitive and hostile. Little medical research had ever been done there. Few strangers visited. That was why the Iraqis thought the region a promising place to investigate for unknown zoonoses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo pools high in the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne green, the other brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the plant whose leaves he\u0027d chewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recalled the water. Warm and clear. But when he\u0027d pointed his flashlight into their shallow depths, he recalled an even stranger sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo carved letters. One in each pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZ and H.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChiseled from blocks of stone, lying on the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the medallion Stephanie Nelle had made a point to show him. One of the several Irina Zovastina seemed intent on acquiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the microletters supposedly on its face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZH .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoincidence? He doubted it. He knew what the letters meant since he\u0027d sought out scholars who told him that in Old Greek they represented the concept of life. He\u0027d thought his idea of labeling any future cure for HIV with that ancient designation clever. Now he wasn\u0027t so sure. He felt like his world was collapsing and the anonymity that he\u0027d once enjoyed was quickly evaporating. The Americans were after him. Zovastina was after him. The Venetian League itself might well be after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027d cast his die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo going back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE\u0027S GAZE ALTERNATED BETWEEN THORVALDSEN AND CASSIOPEIA. Neither of his friends showed the slightest concern with their predicament. Between him and Cassiopeia, they could take Zovastina and Viktor. He tried to voice that intent with his eyes, but no one seemed to be listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your pope doesn\u0027t scare me,\" Zovastina said to Michener.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not our intent to scare anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a sanctimonious hypocrite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichener said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much to say?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pray for you, Minister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spit at his feet. \"I don\u0027t need your prayers, priest.\" She motioned toward Cassiopeia. \"Time to go. Leave the bow and arrows. You won\u0027t be needing them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia dropped both to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s her gun,\" Viktor said, and he handed over the weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once we\u0027re away, I\u0027ll call. If you don\u0027t hear from me in three hours, kill the priest. And Viktor,\" she paused, \"make sure he suffers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor and Michener left the presbytery and walked through the darkened nave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we?\" Zovastina said to Cassiopeia. \"I assume you\u0027ll behave yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I have a choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The priest will appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the presbytery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone turned to Thorvaldsen. \"And they\u0027re just going to leave, with no response from us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had to be done,\" Stephanie said, as she and another man stepped from the shadows of the south transept. She introduced the lean man as Edwin Davis, deputy national security adviser, the voice from the phone earlier. Everything about him was neat and restrained, from the pressed slacks and stiff cotton shirt, to his shiny, narrow calf-leather shoes. Malone ignored Davis and asked Stephanie, \"Why did it have to be done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen answered. \"We weren\u0027t sure what was going to happen. We were just trying to make something happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted Cassiopeia to be taken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen shook his head. \"I didn\u0027t. But Cassiopeia apparently did. I could see it in her eyes, so I seized the moment and accommodated her. That\u0027s why I asked you to drop your weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you nuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen stepped closer. \"Cotton, three years ago I introduced Ely and Cassiopeia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that have to do with anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Ely was young, he foolishly experimented with drugs. He wasn\u0027t careful with needles and, sadly, contracted HIV. He managed the disease well, taking various cocktail combinations, but the odds were not in his favor. Most of those infected eventually contract AIDS and die. He was lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassiopeia shares his illness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he heard right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A blood transfusion, ten years ago. She takes the symptomatic drugs and manages her disease, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shocked, but a lot of her comments now made sense. \"How\u0027s that possible? She\u0027s so active. Strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the drugs every day and you can be, provided the virus cooperates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at Stephanie. \"You knew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edwin told me before we came out here. Henrik told him. He and Henrik have been waiting for us to arrive. That\u0027s why Michener took me aside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what were me and Cassiopeia? Expendables? With deniability?\" he asked Davis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that. We had no idea what Zovastina would do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sorry son of a bitch.\" He moved toward Davis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Thorvaldsen said, \"I approved it. Be mad at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and stared at his friend. \"What gave you that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you and Cassiopeia left Copenhagen, President Daniels called. He told me what happened to Stephanie in Amsterdam and asked what we knew. I told him. He suggested I could be useful here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Along with me? That why you lied to me about Stephanie being in trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen cast a glance toward Davis. \"Actually, I\u0027m a bit perturbed about that, too. I only told you what they told me. It seems the president wanted all of us involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Davis. \"I don\u0027t like the way you do business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough. But I have to do what I have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Thorvaldsen said, \"there was little time to think this through. I was improvising as it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I didn\u0027t believe Zovastina would do anything foolish here in the basilica. She couldn\u0027t. And she\u0027d be caught totally off guard. That\u0027s why I agreed to challenge her. Of course, Cassiopeia was another matter. She killed two people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And one more on Torcello.\" He cautioned himself to stay focused. \"What is all this about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One part,\" Stephanie said, \"is to stop Zovastina. She\u0027s planning a dirty war and has the resources to make it a costly one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She contacted the Church and they tipped us off,\" Davis said. \"That\u0027s why we\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have told us all that,\" he said to Davis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mr. Malone, we couldn\u0027t. I\u0027ve read your service record. You were a superb agent. A long list of successful missions and commendations. You don\u0027t strike me as naive. You, of all people, should understand how the game is played.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just it,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t play anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paced about and allowed himself a moment to calm down. Then he approached the wooden box lying open on the floor. \"Zovastina risked everything just to look at these bones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the other part to all of this,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"The more complicated portion. You read some of the manuscript pages Ely found about Alexander the Great and his draught. Ely came to believe, perhaps foolishly, that from the symptoms described, the draught might have some effect on viral pathogens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like HIV?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen nodded. \"We know there are substances found in nature-tree bark, leafy plants, roots-that can combat bacteria and viruses, maybe even some cancers. He was hoping this might be one of those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind recalled the manuscript. Overcome by remorse and sensing that Ptolemy was sincere, Eumenes revealed the resting place, far away, in the mountains, where the Scythians taught Alexander about life. \"The Scythians are the ones who showed Alexander the draught. Eumenes said Alexander was buried where the Scythians taught him about life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething occurred to him. He said to Stephanie, \"You have one of the medallions, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie handed him the coin. \"From Amsterdam. We recovered it after Zovastina\u0027s men tried to take it. We\u0027re told it\u0027s authentic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the decadrachm high in the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Concealed within the warrior are tiny letters. ZH,\" Stephanie said. \"Old Greek for life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore of the History of Hieronymus of Cardia. Ptolemy then handed me a silver medallion that showed Alexander when he fought against elephants. He told me that, in honor of those battles, he\u0027d minted the coins. He also told me to come back when I solved his riddle. But a month later Ptolemy lay dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he knew. \"The coins and the riddle go together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No question,\" Thorvaldsen answered. \"But how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t ready to explain. \"None of you ever answered me. Why did you just let them leave here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassiopeia clearly wanted to go,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"Between her and me, we dangled enough information about Ely to intrigue Zovastina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you called her outside on the phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen nodded. \"She needed information. I had no idea what she would do. You have to understand, Cotton, Cassiopeia wants to know what happened to Ely and the answers are in Asia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat obsession bothered Malone. Why? He wasn\u0027t sure. But it clearly did. As did her pain. And her illness. Too much to keep track of. Too many emotions for a man who worked hard at ignoring them. \"What is she going to do when she gets to the Federation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen shrugged. \"I have no idea. Zovastina knows that I\u0027m wise to her overall plan. I made that clear. She knows Cassiopeia is associated with me. She\u0027ll use the opportunity we gave her to try and learn from Cassiopeia what she can-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before she kills her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Stephanie said, \"that\u0027s a chance Cassiopeia freely accepted. No one told her to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore of his melancholy arose. \"No. We just let her go. Is that priest involved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a job to do,\" Davis said. \"That\u0027s why he volunteered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there\u0027s more,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"What Ely found, Ptolemy\u0027s riddle, it\u0027s real. And we now have all the pieces to discover its solution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to the box. \"There\u0027s nothing there. It\u0027s a dead end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen shook his head. \"Not true. Those bones lay beneath us, in the crypt, for centuries, before they were moved up here.\" Thorvaldsen motioned toward the open sarcophagus. \"When they were first removed, in 1835, something else was found with them. Only a few know.\" Thorvaldsen pointed toward the darkened south transept. \"It\u0027s in the treasury and has been for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you needed Zovastina gone before taking a look?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\" The Dane held up a key. \"Our ticket to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You realize Cassiopeia may have bitten off more than she can ever chew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen nodded heavily. \"Fully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to think, so he gazed toward the south transept and asked, \"Do you know what to do with whatever is in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen shook his head. \"Not me. But we have someone who might.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henrik believes,\" Stephanie said, \"and Edwin seems to agree-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Ely,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"We think he\u0027s still alive.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-venetian-betrayal-cotton-malone-3/page-20.html","bookId":2234,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM"}
