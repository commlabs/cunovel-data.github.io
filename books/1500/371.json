This made him feel slightly better, but it was still a near negligible amount.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe instant he made his way over the rocks, number three didn’t see the beautiful scene filled with violent and hysterical sex, but instead Madeline standing there alone, the unique giant sword still dragged behind her. This time, the brim of her hat was raised, so number three saw her complete face, and the two even looked at each other face to face. Within Madeline’s calm azure eyes was a trace of blankness, just like that of a confused little girl.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhat about number nine?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAll of a sudden, before number three had time to find number nine’s traces, he noticed that after Madeline gave him a look, while dragging the enormous sword, she somewhat awkwardly began to run at him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Damn it, where did number nine go?!” Number three roared from the bottom of his heart, and then he turned around to run. He wasn’t scared of this little girl with two levels of ability, but instead of the two lunatics that were pursuing him. If he wasted any more time here, once he got caught up within those two lunatics, there definitely wouldn’t be a good end for him. Taking on heavy injuries for the sake of two insignificant subordinates? From the noble perspective of a chosen, this was a choice only an idiot would make.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, what made number three feel a bit depressed was that Madeline really did actually chase after him. A little girl with two levels of ability even dared to chase a chosen with seven levels of Magic Domain ability? What was happening to this world? Moreover, Madeline’s speed was abnormally fast, not like someone with two levels of speed strengthening at all. This speed looked like it was at least that of five levels!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, number three’s speed was six levels, so with just a few steps, he pulled apart the distance between Madeline and himself as he headed into the murky night.

He suddenly seemed to have sensed something. When he leaned his head to the side, he found that Madeline was running shoulder to shoulder with him; she was also looking at him!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThen, the heavy sword swept across number three’s waist, as if it lost all its weight and was as light as a feather.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNumber three’s upper body flew outwards for more than ten meters before falling. Meanwhile, Madeline ran by his side the entire time. Even when his upper body fell, she was still silently standing at number three’s side. Apart from the vacant expression, there wasn’t any other expression in her azure pupils. Number three suddenly understood that the reason he could only see blankness in her eyes was because number three, a noble chosen, had never existed in her mind, not even regarded as an enemy! Number three didn’t know why he understood these things, but he would prefer that he never learned of this truth.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“How did you catch up to me?” Number three asked. He was calmly laying on the ground, already no longer struggling. Meanwhile, the lower half of his body, at this moment, also fell more than ten meters away.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA few traces of fluctuations finally appeared in Madeline’s sea-like pupils. With an indifferent, almost dreamlike voice, she said, “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEn\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e, it’s like this, just now, I realized I couldn’t catch up to you, so I increased my speed by two levels.

He, whose consciousness was already starting to fade, did not hear Madeline’s following words of worry. “There were still four more evolutionary points I didn’t know what to do with.

In addition, when shooting, Su didn’t even look backwards, nor did he make any aiming motions. However, this shot that should not have possessed any accuracy was shockingly precise, the bullet surrounded by electrical radiance drawing out a trajectory that directly skewered through two chosen! If it landed, it would definitely blast the first one rotten, and then the one behind him would be seriously injured.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt the critical moment between life and death, these chosen’s beast-like instincts displayed their effects.
