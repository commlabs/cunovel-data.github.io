They staggered toward the others, bleary-eyed and disheveled, and severely underdressed for the pre-dawn chill. \"They were out having a good time,\" Adam said when he saw them coming. \"Looks like they still are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the big emergency?\" Faye called out in a voice much too loud. \"It better be good. Do you have any idea what time it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" Melanie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye cracked up laughing and patted Melanie on the shoulder. \"You and Laurel aren\u0027t the only ones interested in herbology.\" She pulled an eyedropper from her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Care for a taste? It\u0027s all natural.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie\u0027s face hardened. \"This is no time for that,\" she said. \"The hunters have Scarlett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye returned the eyedropper to her pocket. \"I guess that\u0027s a no, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie chose to ignore Faye, Deborah, and Suzan and only address the others, who were capable of paying attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scarlett doesn\u0027t know where she is,\" Cassie said. \"But she\u0027s terrified they\u0027re going to kill her.\" She went on to describe her dream in vivid detail, how the hunters were holding Scarlett captive, torturing her, and studying her powers, and how she begged Cassie to come save her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should we do?\" Adam directed the question to Diana, but it was Cassie who answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to find out where the hunters are keeping her,\" she said. \"We can use the locator spell Constance taught us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" Faye said, staring up at the moon as if it were speaking to her. \"We\u0027re back to using magic!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so fast.\" Diana pursed her lips. \"We have to navigate this very carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buzz-killer,\" Faye said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we did on the docks was an exception,\" Diana said firmly. \"Using magic still puts us at risk. What if this is a trick to help the hunters figure out who we are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care about that,\" Cassie blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone swung their head in her direction, awestruck by her outburst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sister is in danger,\" Cassie continued, refusing to be dismayed. \"It\u0027s worth the risk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah was the first to break the silence with cackling laughter. \"That\u0027s not your call to make, princess.\" Cassie had the urge to scream out again, but she restrained herself and simply said, \"As one of the leaders of this Circle, it is partially my call to make.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you going to get it?\" Faye shouted. \"You don\u0027t get to put your own petty needs before the Circle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is hardly a petty need, Faye,\" Cassie said. \"Scarlett is being tortured. They\u0027re probably going to kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s fine with you if we all get killed trying to save her.\" Faye turned her back on Cassie dismissively, swatting her pitch-black hair in her direction. \"You\u0027re just being selfish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re one to talk about being selfish,\" Cassie shot back. \"Who\u0027s more selfish than you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. That\u0027s enough.\" Diana raised her clear, overpowering voice and called for order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam placed his hand on Cassie\u0027s back to calm her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be a way to perform the locator spell without the hunters tracing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone got quiet for a moment to think, but Cassie couldn\u0027t understand all this deliberation. A feeling of heat overcame Cassie, not from outside - the bluff remained cool and breezy - but from deep inside her gut, where a boiling anger seethed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s just no way, she thought to herself. She\u0027d have to find Scarlett on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Adam shot up from the log he was sitting on. \"We can do it in a crowded place,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody responded, but Adam had a look of delight across his face, and his breathing was heavy. \"Don\u0027t you get it?\" he said. \"If we do it in a crowd, the hunters will have a harder time deciphering the source of the magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, my friend, is brilliant,\" Chris said, giving Adam a high five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie\u0027s gray eyes widened. \"That totally could work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could do it during some school event.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Under the bleachers,\" Laurel called out. \"During the big track meet after school today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie threw herself at Adam and wrapped her arms Cassie threw herself at Adam and wrapped her arms tightly around him. \"This is why I love you,\" she said. \"You always have the best ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam\u0027s eyes radiated an enchanting blue light. \"Is that why?\" He started laughing and then said, \"Okay, so it\u0027s a plan. We do the locator spell this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should still put it to a vote,\" Diana said brusquely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye smirked. \"Way to kill a moment, D.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only fair to let everyone have their say on this,\" Diana insisted. \"And we should all keep in mind that locating Scarlett is only half of it.\" She paused to look at Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deciding what we do from there should be another vote entirely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie lashed out, unable to stop herself. \"Do you not understand that they\u0027re going to kill her? She\u0027s my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes that mean nothing to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s lips parted, but no sound escaped. She searched Cassie\u0027s eyes as if she were looking for something in them she\u0027d lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s anger wasn\u0027t intended solely for Diana, but it may as well have been. She had screamed almost directly into her face. It was no way to behave, but the way Cassie saw it, this wasn\u0027t a time for cool analytics and meticulous strategy. Not when Scarlett\u0027s life was at stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana looked at Cassie for another bewildered and speechless moment before turning away. \"We\u0027re getting ahead of ourselves,\" she said. \"There\u0027s no guarantee the locator spell will even work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam went to Cassie\u0027s side and put his arm around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re going to try it. Do we all agree?\" There were nods all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was so good to her, and it was something that the group was willing to try the spell, but it still wasn\u0027t enough to console Cassie. All this voting and planning was wasting too much time. At this rate, they\u0027d never get to Scarlett in time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-divide-the-secret-circle-4/page-20.html","bookId":2098,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM"}
