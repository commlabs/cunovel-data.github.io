There seems to be some question about whether or not you and your kind are even human! That severely diminishes your potential usefulness to me as a husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why you mouthy, bad-tempered, perverse little easterner. You really don\u0027t know when to shut up, do you? I\u0027m as human as you are, lady, and tonight I\u0027ll prove it. What\u0027s more, you can damn well forget about using whatever contraceptive device that medic gave you. Is that clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana decided that he was right. She didn\u0027t seem to know when to shut up. She also didn\u0027t know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen to quit. Her frustrated fury boiled over. Without any warning, not even a shout of anger, she launched herself at Gryph. Her spread hands caught him full on the chest and she shoved him backward with all her might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomatically Gryph tried to steady himself against the unexpected assault, but the low rail caught the back of his leg and he lost his balance. He didn\u0027t waste time trying to save himself after that. He simply wrapped one hand around Sariana\u0027s wrist and pulled her over with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scarlet-toe wisely leaped from Sariana\u0027s shoulder to the safety of the sled rail. Sariana gasped as she hit the water with a splash. The river was chilly but it wasn\u0027t freezing. She found\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eherself floundering in water that only came up to her shoulders. Her skirts billowed out around her as she righted herself and surfaced. She pushed her hair back off her face and blinked away the water that was streaming into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlyph was surfacing a short distance away, his eyes glittering with a mixture of emotions that ran the gamut from fury to desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ve come to the conclusion I\u0027m not a real man, Sariana?\" Gryph started to glide slowly toward her through the water. \"That\u0027s an interesting deduction. How do you define a real man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plunge into the river was having a very sobering effect on Sariana\u0027s temper. \"Calm down, Gryph. I was just feeling very provoked a few minutes ago. I\u0027m sorry if I said anything to offend you.\" She retreated cautiously as he approached. She would have turned and tried to dash to shore, but she knew the weight of her clothes would hamper her too much. His sleek trousers and shirt were far less of a hindrance in the water. Gryph would catch her easily if she tried to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sorry for offending me? That\u0027s hard to believe. You seem to be making a career of offending me. You go out of your way to do it, in fact. It\u0027s going to take a lot more than an apology to calm me down this time.\" He began to close the distance between them. He did it with excruciating slowness, a hunter closing in on his prey. \"Now tell me what your definition of a man is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver went through her that was not caused by the chill of the river water. \"Gryph, this is hardly the time or place to discuss philosophy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong. This is exactly the time and the place, What\u0027s more, I\u0027m in the mood to discuss such matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well I\u0027m not,\" she sputtered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad. You started this, remember. As usual, your tendency to run off at the mouth has gotten you into trouble. Let\u0027s see how you get out of it. Tell me exactly where I fail to measure up to your standards for a man. I\u0027ll do my best to correct any problem areas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana eyed him warily. She was cold from the water. She was nervous about Gryph\u0027s intentions. She was still angry with him and she was determined not to let him win this battle. But into that chaotic mixture of emotions came another, familiar sensation of hungry excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could have fought that last feeling, Sariana realized. She was more aware of it now. She could control an unwanted passion if that\u0027s all that was involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as she watched Gryph coming toward her through the water she realized what the real problem was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was falling in love with the man. She had been falling in love with him since the night she had set out to coerce him into helping the Avylyns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was falling in love with him and she wasn\u0027t even sure now that he was wholly human. \"Gryph, stop this. I don\u0027t have to answer your foolish questions. You\u0027re just trying to make me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enervous. Admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not trying to make you\u0027 nervous. You\u0027re already nervous. With good reason. Answer my question, Sariana. What does it take to make me a man in your eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the Lightstonn, you are a man! I\u0027ve already apologized for implying otherwise. I told you, I was angry at the time. Stop tormenting me. Now let\u0027s get out of the water like sensible people. It\u0027s getting very cold,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, Shieldmate,\" he growled softly. \"I\u0027ll warm you. I\u0027ll warm your backside so thoroughly you won\u0027t be able to sit down for the next few days. I think it\u0027s time you learned there are limits to my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egood nature. I\u0027ll teach you to imply I\u0027m not a man. Your fast tongue has run away with you this time, Sariana. I\u0027m going to help you learn to control it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swooped down on her, catching her up in his arms and lifting her high against his chest. Then he started wading toward shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gryph, put me down. Damn you, you\u0027re not going to have everything your own way.\" \"Neither are you.\" He set her on her feet in the sand and began stripping the wet clothing from her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ve got a problem, don\u0027t we?\" She shivered in the evening air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing we can\u0027t resolve.\" Gryph let the last of her soaked garments fall to the sand. Then he reached for a blanket from his travel pouch and wrapped it around her. \"Dry yourself,\" he ordered. \"The last thing I need on this trip is for you to get sick.\" He went to work on his own clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana\u0027s temper rose once more. \"Damn it, we certainly wouldn\u0027t want that to happen, would we? Mustn\u0027t interfere with the mysterious Shield\u0027s inscrutable plans by catching a little cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his shirt onto the sand and peeled off his wet trousers. \"Sariana, if you have any sense you will close your mouth. You\u0027ve said enough for one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t got any sense,\" she declared as she realized he was fully erect, his body hard with desire. So much for the lauded effects of a cold bath. Apparently it wasn\u0027t universally effective. \"If I did, I wouldn\u0027t be here.\" Sariana clutched her blanket and watched as Gryph briskly nibbed himself dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027d had any sense I would have left Serendipity the night you first sank your sharp little nails into me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana was unaccountably hurt. \"What a terrible thing to say. I never sank my nails into you.\" \"The hell you didn\u0027t. You poisoned me and had me kidnapped. Then you tried to blackmail me into \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-60.html","bookId":1801,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM"}
