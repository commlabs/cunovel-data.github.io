{"id":9362,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. THE RESULT AT THE HOP.","content":"Every one goes to hops promptly on time at West Point. In select society it is the thing nowadays to go late everywhere, so Chauncey assured his friends. But at the academy relentless tattoo sounds on hop-nights at half-past nine as usual. The cadets have to be in line at camp five minutes later. And so, anxious to dance all they can, everybody who intends to dance is on hand by the hour of eight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The dances were held, in Mark\u0027s day, in the academy building, in two big rooms on the second floor. Those rooms are used as examination rooms; luckless and frightened candidates were sent there to show what they do not know. This evening, however, it was gay and festive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The West Point Military Band, in full plumage, occupied a small platform and dispensed an overture previous to the first waltz. The walls were gay with flags and an abundance of decorations in general. And the floor and seats about the room were still more beautifully adorned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A person who \"knew the ropes,\" who was familiar with hops and hop ways, would not have failed to notice[Pg 142] that there was something unusual going on that night, that everybody seemed to be waiting for something. Cadets talking to damsels could not keep their eyes from straying to the doorway, while at the doorway sauntered about, waiting, a considerable group of anxious cadets. There was one thought in the minds of all of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will they come? Oh, say, will they come?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then, suddenly, a ripple of excitement ran around the room; cadets crowded to the doorway, girls strained their necks to get a view, the leader of the band in all his finery nearly let his orchestra run wild in his interest. And across the floor rushed Corporal Spencer, hop manager, and grasped his friend Jasper by the arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027re here! They\u0027re here, man!\" he gasped. \"Oh, say!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the next instant the bandmaster waved his baton, the music crashed all at once, and the first dance was begun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A dance with plebes present!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To say that the three, Mark, Chauncey and \"B\u0027gee,\" were the cynosure of all eyes would not begin to express the situation. Every one\u0027s glance was fairly glued upon them. Girls forgot their dance partners, cadets stopped still in their tracks. Not a soul offered to dance. Not a soul did anything but stare at those three idiots.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They did not seem the least bit ill at ease. All of[Pg 143] them seemed quite in their element. Their attire was surely immaculate; Chauncey was fairly radiant in an elegantly handled monocle. And they did not seem to notice the stares, intentionally rude, that came from the cadets. They knew just what to do, and they did it, while the whole room watched and gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Grace Fuller, belle of West Point, sat in one corner of the room, a perfect vision of loveliness indescribable. About her were half a dozen cadets. Her stern old father sat nearby, with Mrs. Fuller beside him. And toward that group those idiotic plebes were going!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The yearlings gasped in horror, bit their lips in vexation. For Judge Fuller arose from his seat and welcomed Mark Mallory heartily; his wife did likewise. The three sat down and began to talk to them and to Grace, at which the cadets with that party went off in horror and amazement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, there was no use staring any more, for the three plebes were safe behind that bulwark; and vexed and aggravated, the cadets went their ways and began to dance. They kept their eyes on the three, however. They saw Mrs. Fuller rise suddenly and cross the room, with Chauncey and Dewey at her side. And then what must she do but introduce them to two girls? Oh!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was terrible! Bull Harris, Mark\u0027s old enemy, was in the very act of asking one of the girls, a tall,[Pg 144] stately creature clad in pink, if he might have the pleasure, etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Harris,\" said she. \"But I\u0027m already engaged for this dance.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then up stepped Mrs. Fuller.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Miss Evens,\" she said, \"allow me to present Mr. Dewey, with whom I believe you have promised to dance.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A moment later, to the indescribable horror of the cadets in the place, three plebes set out upon that floor to dance, each of them leading girls with whom to dance was a privilege that came only to the best. And how those plebes did dance! The yearlings had never seen better; they could not but acknowledge that. For the plebes were on their mettle then, and if ever they danced in their lives, they did then, radiant with triumph, swept away by the excitement distributing benignant smiles upon every one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There is only one heaven that lasts an eternity. All others, that dance included, have their finish. The three plebes returned the delighted girls to their seats, and the cadets, excusing themselves from every one, rushed out into the hall, there to hold an angry and excited consultation. For this was indeed a desperate, a terrible thing! Evidently three girls, relying upon their charms, were going to insult the corps wantonly, dance with some beastly plebes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 145]\"They shall pay for it!\" was the cry. \"Not a man shall dance with them. Cut them dead!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But if the yearlings supposed that Mark and his friends proposed to dance with just three girls all that night, they were woefully and badly mistaken. The fever had spread in the interim; introductions had been going on. When the yearlings returned, behold, Mark was making himself charming to another girl, and Chauncey, perfectly in his element at last, was busily engaged in describing the streets of Paris to a group of half a dozen!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Cut them all!\" whispered the yearlings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, they tried it. To be brief, Grace and the other two danced with no one that next dance. But three more girls went down on the blacklist, and the plebes\u0027 triumph was yet greater.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll leave \u0027em no one to dance with,\" chuckled Mark. \"We\u0027ll send them all home!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next dance was a lanciers. Three couples joined the groups upon the floor and lo and behold, from the spot where the plebes stood every cadet fell away with obvious meaning. The rudeness was seen by every one in the room; it was the worst insult of all. The three couples stood lost for a moment; and then, suddenly, red with indignation, the dignified judge sprang to his feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He and his daughter made up that set. And once more the yearlings fairly ground their teeth with rage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 146]They did not know what to do then. They were fairly baffled. The plebes had entered the trap—and here was the result!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, if we only hadn\u0027t been fools enough to send those invitations!\" was their thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile dance after dance passed, girl after girl was \"out of it.\" There is always a scarcity of girls at a place like West Point. There are always sure to be more cadets at every hop than there are partners, and with those three vile plebes sending three to the wall every dance—and the prettiest and most liked ones, too—things soon began to arrive at a crisis. It looks funny to see the pretty girls sitting and the ugly ones dancing; and every one began to see that the plebes were having decidedly the best of the bargain. They were dancing with whom they pleased; most of the cadets were soon unable to dance at all, finding it necessary to hang about the doorway and discuss the situation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a distinct triumph for the plebes; even the yearlings could not deny that, and that made them all the angrier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ten dances had passed; by actual count there were thirty girls \"out of it,\" and something less than twenty still left to the cadets. And then the matter came to a head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadet Lieutenant Wright, a first class man, captain of[Pg 147] the football team, and a hop manager for his class, caused the trouble. Urged by all his desperate classmates and urged still more by the spectacle of Mark\u0027s dancing with a certain sweet creature who had hitherto devoted all her energies to making herself charming to him, he stepped forward in the middle of the dance and with his badge of manager upon his coat, touched Mark upon the arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark halted abruptly. The whole room stared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Mallory,\" said the lieutenant, \"the cadets who are giving this hop request you to leave the floor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark\u0027s face turned white; he bit his lip savagely to choke down his anger, and when he spoke at last his voice was hard and calm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The cadets who are giving this hop,\" he said, drawing the invitation from under his coat, \"invited me by this to come. I shall consider your remark, sir, as a personal insult, for which you will be called upon to answer at Fort Clinton.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And do you refuse to leave?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As an invited guest and a cadet of this academy I most decidedly do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the whole room heard him, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wright returned to his classmates; a brief consultation was held, ending in his stepping across the room and speaking to the leader of the band. The music stopped abruptly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 148]The hop was over for the night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three heartily delighted plebes escorted three heartily delighted damsels home that night. And wild indeed was the hilarity of them and of the Banded Seven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Victory! Victory!\" was the cry. \"We danced and we have conquered!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3246/88971.html","bookId":641,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:12:11 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:12:11 AM"}
