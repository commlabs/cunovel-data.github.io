When I called the dial-a-reaper number, I hadn\u0027t expected you two would be the ones to make the pickup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The director thought it would be best if we limited exposure of Brotherhood members to one who so clearly does not embrace the true glory of the light,\" Janice Mycowski said primly as she pushed past me into the hotel room. \"You have Kristjana and Mattias here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I closed the door behind Rick, trying to summon up a welcoming smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look well,\" Rick said politely. \"Iceland must agree with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRick looked startled for a moment until he realized I wasn\u0027t shouting at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMattias, who had been forbidden to leave his chair, grabbed the seat and chair-hopped his way toward me. \"Pia!\" he called as I reentered the living room of our hotel suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you to stay!\" I said, pointing back at the corner where he\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face shifted into a pout. \"But Kristoff is not here. You said I had to stay out of his way, but he is gone. Smooches!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRick and Janice looked at Mattias with obvious surprise, the former turning a bemused glance upon me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er... he\u0027s a bit... affectionate,\" I said, blushing a little as I hissed to Mattias, \"I told you there will be no kissing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piiiia,\" he said, drawing out my name in a depressed sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve light-bound him!\" Janice declared after giving him a good long look. She turned her fierce gaze upon me. \"You dare!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet your butt I dare,\" I said, squaring my shoulders and looking like I would be prone to light-binding anyone who annoyed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s keeping him happy and me sane, so I don\u0027t want to hear one word about that. Kristjana is through the bedroom to your left.\" I gestured toward the appropriate door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe marched to it with a glare that probably could have cracked cement. \"I shall be sure to tell the director just how you treated our members!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m sure Frederic has a much worse image of me than as someone who dazzles a couple of troublesome reapers,\" I said, following her into the room. I was braced for a scream of outrage, which was forthcoming immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you done to her?\" Janice yelled. I stood in the doorway and smiled somewhat weakly as Janice fussed around the prone woman lying on the bed. \"Goddess above! You\u0027ve killed her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, she\u0027s not dead. She\u0027s just sedated. She was a wee bit upset when we got her out of the room she was being kept in, and the doctor thought it would be best if she had a little downtime to recover. I\u0027m not quite sure why, but she was resistant to the light-binding, so we gave up trying to make her happy and just let her go to sleep instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Downtime!\" Janice shot me a look of purest venom before she began patting Kristjana\u0027s cheeks in an attempt, I assumed, to bring her around. \"You have become one of the monsters you should be destroying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She appears to be injured,\" Rick said, peering over his wife\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" I said quickly. \"Not seriously, anyway. There was a little incident on the fire escape when she tried to break free, and Kristoff was slow in grabbing her, so she went over the edge, but we were at the bottom of the fire escape, so she didn\u0027t fall very far. The doctor said it looks far worse than it really is. The black eye should fade in no time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them gave me identical looks of horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had her X-rayed and everything,\" I reassured them. \"I managed to get her light-bound for the duration of the hospital visit, and she checked out fine, so really, there\u0027s nothing to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need me? I\u0027m here if you need licking anywhere,\" Mattias called from the doorway, blowing me a kiss as he beamed at Rick and Janice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His things are all packed and ready,\" I told Rick with an urgency that I feared was unmistakable. \"I\u0027m afraid we didn\u0027t have time to get Kristjana\u0027s things, but with the town crawling with vampires, we thought it best to sit tight and not worry about her clothes and such.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kristoff!\" Mattias called happily from where he still sat in the doorway, his head turned to the door of the suite. \"Pia said I must sit in the chair until you returned. Now I can go to her. She needs me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff! I told you the Brotherhood people would be here to pick up Mattias and Kristjana! Go away before they see you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDio , he swore. I thought they would be gone by now. Did you find out where Alec is?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I haven\u0027t even brought that up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kristoff?\" Janice said, suspicion tainting the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he\u0027s my... er...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Husband,\" Kristoff said, appearing in the doorway. He eyed the two Brotherhood folk for a moment. I do not know them. Where are they from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they will not know me, either. I have not worked in the United States. \"Kristoff von Hannelore,\" he added, making a little bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVon Hannelore? I asked, somewhat surprised by his surname. I had been too flustered at our rushed wedding to notice what name was listed for him on the papers, and hadn\u0027t thought to ask him about it since. Isn\u0027t that German? I thought you were Italian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents were from a small principality in what is now Germany. I lived there in my youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... you\u0027re married to the sacristan,\" Janice said, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMattias took my hand and kissed my fingers. \"Yes, she is. My Pia. My wife. She needs me. Licks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff pried Mattias\u0027s fingers off my hand, taking it himself. \"She was married to me first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a bit complicated,\" I said, wondering how on earth I could explain Kristoff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kristoff is my friend, too,\" Mattias added, beaming at him and trying to take his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff growled, I am not used to having to be explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, well, people who charge in on meetings with their mortal enemies just have to tough out what they find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have two husbands?\" Rick asked a bit hesitantly. \"Is that legal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... technically-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Kristoff said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey don\u0027t seem to realize you\u0027re a vampire. I\u0027m glad, but I have to say that it surprises me a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not like we walk around with a big sign pointing to us proclaiming, \"Dark One,\" you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, but you\u0027re their area of specialty. Shouldn\u0027t they at least sense something different about you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExperienced reapers might. These two appear innocuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like licking,\" Mattias said, apropos of nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You try and you\u0027ll find yourself without a tongue,\" Kristoff threatened as Mattias grinned at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mattias! Sit!\" I ordered, pointing to the chair. \"No licking! No kissing! And stop trying to hold Kristoff\u0027s hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pia, Pia, Pia,\" was his sad little refrain as he obeyed my command and sat in a chair next to me, pouting slightly as he clutched the hem of my gauze skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you have done to that poor man-to both of them...\" Janice said, her face dark with malevolence. \"You will answer to the governors for these crimes; oh, yes, you will!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRick had been giving Kristoff a thorough visual examination, and said finally, a puzzled frown between his brows, \"You are not a member of the Brotherhood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said, tensing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kristoff is helping me with... er... finding Ulfur,\" I improvised, hoping the mostly true statement would pass muster. \"Which isn\u0027t going to be easy at all. An Ilargi has taken his soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ilargi!\" Janice gasped. \"Here? You must stop him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easier said than done. Kristoff is here to help me find Ulfur\u0027s remains, his essence, so we can raise him as a lich and get him away from the Ilargi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a vespillo,\" Rick said to Kristoff, nodding at my deception. \"You have a necromancer already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not a vespillo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, but it won\u0027t hurt if they think you are. I\u0027d rather not have them poking around and figuring out you\u0027re a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBah!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, her name is Eve.\" I glanced at my watch. \"In fact, we have an appointment to meet with her and her... er... assistant in half an hour, so we really should get down to business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What business would that be?\" Rick asked politely as Janice gently shook Kristjana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s asleep,\" Mattias said helpfully. \"She was not nice to Pia, so we put her to sleep. She threatened to rip my lips off, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have fulfilled only part of your bargain,\" Janice said, giving up on Kristjana. \"You must also retrieve the spirit left behind and escort him to Ostri. Which\"-a slow, evil smile crept over her face-\"considering he is now a phantasm, is going to be very difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not impossible once he\u0027s a lich,\" I said, hoping that was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvidently it was, because her face darkened again, and she turned away with a muttered word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid we cannot help with your spirit, if that\u0027s what you are asking,\" Rick said. \"It would violate the terms of the agreement, you see. I wish we could help, but our hands are tied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hands were tied earlier,\" Mattias piped up. He sent me a loving look. \"Pia tied my hands to my feet and made me lie on the floor while she took a bath. I pretended I was her bath mat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We weren\u0027t going to tell people about that,\" I reminded Mattias with a weak smile at the others. \"It wasn\u0027t like it sounds....\" Kristoff\u0027s look had me stammering to a halt. \"But enough about that. The business I referred to actually concerns the board of governors. You see, there\u0027s a vampire I want to find, and I think they can help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanice bristled. \"You dare to use us in that way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, you keep asking me if I dare to do things, and I think by now we can take it as read that yes, I dare. I dare a lot, actually. Why? Because I have to. So if we could move past the dramatic gasps of horror and bugging-out eyes and pointing fingers and whatnot, and stick to the facts, I\u0027d be really grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" Mattias told me, and proceeded to suck on the bit of my skirt hem that he held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanice\u0027s face turned beet red. \"You dare-\" She caught herself in time. \"You can\u0027t seriously believe that the governors would in any way aid someone who so clearly does not follow the precepts of the Brotherhood. You think we would turn over to you our database of vampire locations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but that\u0027s interesting that you have one.\" Did you know that they have a database?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. It is sorely out-of-date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good, because I can assure you that the governors will do nothing-nothing-to aid one of the evil undead. Unless, of course, you\u0027re referring to cleansing them of their darkness and bringing them into the light, as they all should be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff stiffened beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelax. That\u0027s how they all talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is not a thought prone to inducing relaxation, he answered with a mental grimace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought the urge to touch him, knowing full well that I couldn\u0027t do so without wanting to jump him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff\u0027s lips curled slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could at least pretend you don\u0027t hear my smutty thoughts about you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not? I enjoy them. I particularly liked the one you had about massage oil, although I prefer cherry flavor to orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What exactly did you want to know?\" Rick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have reason to believe that one of the vampires has been held by the Brotherhood,\" I said, picking my words carefully. I didn\u0027t want to outright accuse them of nabbing Alec if he had gone along willingly. Then again, I didn\u0027t know if he had done that. \"I\u0027d like to know where he is, and if he\u0027s OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Janice said abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem to understand,\" Kristoff said, wrapping his arm around my waist. \"Pia is not asking. She is telling you what it will take in order for her to turn over these two reapers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMattias rubbed his head on my hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will turn them over because that is part of the agreement,\" Janice said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m changing that,\" I said simply. \"Now in order to get them, I want to know where Alec is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec?\" She frowned and glanced at her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, shrugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec Darwin. He\u0027s a vampire who was in Iceland two months ago. He disappeared not long after I went home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you care?\" Janice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought for a few seconds of lying, but I\u0027d done enough indulging in half-truths for the day. \"I had a relationship with him at one time, and although it\u0027s over, I am concerned for his well-being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relationship?\" Janice asked, horrified. \"You gave yourself to a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pia was not a Zorya at the time,\" Kristoff said, taking us all a bit by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" I agreed. \"And we weren\u0027t together for very long, but I still would like to know what\u0027s happened to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s dead by now,\" Janice said with malicious enjoyment. She bared her teeth. \"If he is in the power of the governors, then he has been cleansed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they\u0027d take him to the Brotherhood headquarters?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanice looked sullenly at her husband when he answered, \"Most likely. That\u0027s where the big storage facility is, you see. Where they keep the vampires before they are cleansed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a bit sick to my stomach at the thought of such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside me, pain spiked through Kristoff. I leaned into him, offering him wordless comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not tell her any more,\" Janice ground out through her teeth. \"You have said enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec may well be dead,\" I said calmly as he tensed up again. \"But I\u0027d like to hear that from Frederic himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monsieur Robert does not wish to speak to you,\" Janice said, whipping out her cell phone before she remembered that it wouldn\u0027t work in Europe. She jammed it back into her bag. \"But if you demand proof of that yourself, I will call the Brotherhood headquarters. I will use this phone.\" She gestured to the phone next to Kristjana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be my guest. Mattias, come along. Rick, can I offer you some coffee while we wait for Janice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeloved, these are reapers, Kristoff protested as he followed Mattias and me out of the room and into the living area. You do not offer them beverages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may not, but I do. I like Rick. He\u0027s not at all snarky like his wife. Besides, he said he was a historian, and I\u0027d like to know more about the Brotherhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? he asked quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust curious about how they got started going after you guys. \"So, Rick, you\u0027re a historian, right? You must know a lot about the origins of the Brotherhood. How do you like your coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Black is fine,\" he said, sitting down on the couch next to where I parked Mattias, giving me a bit of a bemused look. Kristoff sat gingerly on the chair next to him, eyeing long fingers of sunlight as they spilled onto the highly polished oak floor. \"And I know something about it, but unfortunately not a lot. The archives dealing with the history of the Brotherhood really only included resources that cover the time after the Lodi Congress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the name given to the body that organized the first hunt of Dark Ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh. I know they used to just deal with helping dead folk, but then something happened to switch their attention to vampires. What exactly was that?\" I asked, giving Mattias a cup before taking one for myself and plopping down on the arm of Kristoff\u0027s chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff shifted uncomfortably. The finger of sunlight was creeping ever closer to our feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a little hard to piece together precisely, but I gather that there was a Bavarian Zorya who killed a vampire\u0027s mate in a jealous fit. The vampire, in revenge, slaughtered both the Zorya and her husband, the sacristan for that area. The Brotherhood was so outraged at their deaths, it started a movement to cleanse the darkness that threatened to consume not just Brotherhood members, but all who stood in the way of the vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A vampire started it?\" I asked, finding it hard to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff swore in Italian, fortunately only in my head. I had to admit I agreed with his sentiment. What do you bet there\u0027s more to the story than that? I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peeked at him out of the corner of my eye. That sounded like more than just a general condemnation of the reapers. Do you know how the Brotherhood got started on their vendetta against you guys?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll who hunt the reapers are familiar with their history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood, then you can tell me what happened. \"Are you absolutely sure that a vampire started it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Without a doubt, yes. I\u0027ve seen the primary sources.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised primary sources survived so long.\" Kristoff?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do you care how the war started? It\u0027s ending it that I care about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRick said as he set down his coffee, \"There is only one that I\u0027ve seen. Or, rather, seen photocopies of. It is a diary that mentions the origin of the Lodi Congress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a bit surprised at Kristoff\u0027s snappish tone but kept my smile serene. \"Fascinating stuff. I wonder-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have spoken to the director,\" Janice announced with a dramatic wave of her hand as she entered the room. Judging by the gloating smile on her face, she was enjoying every moment of this. \"The director, as I told you, has no desire to speak with you personally, and asked me to inform you that your agreement to the original terms is binding, and is not open to amendment. Further, he was appalled and shocked to hear how you\u0027ve been abusing the priestess and sacristan, and asked me to tell you that separate charges may be made on those accounts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo surprise there, I said. But we got what we wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t confirm that they have Alec, Beloved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t deny it, either, and thanks to Rick, we now know where he would be likely to be held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will take them now,\" Janice said, gesturing to her husband. \"I just pray to the goddess that they will survive your abuses without permanent damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mattias, how would you like to go to Los Angeles?\" I asked as she and Rick went into Kristjana\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought for a moment. \"Would I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you would. You\u0027d have fun there, and meet new people, and see new things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New things are good. Are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned forward to whisper in his ear, \"Not right now. Don\u0027t tell anyone, but I will be there soon, and I\u0027ll see you then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piaaaa,\" he said, his eyes filled with adoration. He turned his head to kiss me, but I jumped back. He smacked his lips a couple of times at me. \"Good-bye kiss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Kristoff said, slamming Mattias\u0027s bag into his arms, sending him staggering back a couple of steps. \"Don\u0027t let the door hit you on the-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kristoff!\" I glared at him. You don\u0027t have to be rude to him! He can\u0027t help being like a gigantic human puppy when he\u0027s under the influence of my womanly wiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might not be able to help it, but I\u0027m tired of him always trying to fondle you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJealousy ill becomes you when it concerns someone light-bound. \"The doctor says she should be out for another hour or so,\" I told Rick as he emerged from the room with a limp Kristjana in his arms. \"But she should be fine. Go with Janice and Rick, Mattias. They will take you to LA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am going with Janice and Rick,\" he repeated, following them to the door. \"I will be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you will,\" I said, standing at the door to the suite and waving at Mattias until the door of the elevator closed on them. I slumped against the wall, relieved to be rid of the stress of keeping Mattias under control. \"Whew. That\u0027s done. I can feed you now. I know you\u0027re hungry, and we should have a few minutes before we have to go spirit hunting-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pia!\" I de-slumped when a familiar dark-haired woman emerged from the other elevator, tugging a tall, thin woman after her. \"Hi! We\u0027re a bit early. You don\u0027t mind, do you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crouching-vampire-hidden-fang-dark-ones-7/page-10.html","bookId":2208,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:38 PM"}
