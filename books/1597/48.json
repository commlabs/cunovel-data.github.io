I squealed and pulled him closer, and he lifted my other leg around him. I thought I would split in two in the most wonderful way as I rode him, my back pinned to the tree and my arms wrapped around his neck and my legs wrapped around his waist, ruffled skirt trailing to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struck that secret place inside me again and again, splitting me like a ripe plum, juicy and ready to burst. It was too soon, but I couldn’t stop, couldn’t slow down to enjoy it. As I cried out, he caught my breath in another sloppy, deep kiss, and I pulsed in release as I tasted blood and berries. He shuddered inside me, fighting to the last, and I pulled back before he could bite my tongue as he climaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were both shaking as the savagery of the interlude drained away. He lowered me to the ground and caught me up when I stumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed and turned away to settle my skirts, which were all tangled up over my petticoats. When I felt his hand on my shoulder, I turned in surprise, and he gave me a shy smile and held a red handkerchief out on his glove-clad hand. I returned the smile and mopped myself off under the dress with my back to him, grateful that my clothes hid the aftermath of our lust from the relatively bright light of day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turned back around, holding the stained hanky, he had put his own clothing to rights. How the man always managed to look both dapper and careless was beyond me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just leave it on the ground, love,” he said with a teasing grin. “That’s going to make some lucky bludbunny very happy. Now, let’s see what our fine Magistrate has in store for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt on the moss by the spring, fussing with my skirts. After what had just happened, I should have been past modesty with Criminy, but he could make me blush with nothing but a grin. And it definitely wasn’t shame or embarrassment that I was feeling. Now that I had made my choice, it occurred to me that I wanted him not only to want me but also to esteem and respect me. I had gone from actively avoiding his adoration to trying to win his favor, and I felt more than a little awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t get it,” I said, self-conscious as I tucked the orange ruffles around my ankles. “I thought you didn’t drink from blud animals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy my side, Criminy dug through his coat with deft hands, assembling the tools he needed to work his magic. Fidgety and inelegant by comparison, I waited to play my part. Asking him questions helped me forget my physical and emotional discomfort and took my mind off contemplating what had just passed between us, which was really a very muddled experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can feed from them,” he said. “But they don’t taste very good. It’s the same reason most Pinkies don’t eat predators. Grass-fed creatures are much more succulent. But when it’s an even fight and a valid kill … well, it gets the blood pumping, and winning the war matters more than the gourmet taste.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a flat rock by the pool, he laid out a dagger and a murky glass bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t mind, then?” he asked softly, playing with the dagger, the same one he’d used to kill the bludrat. He scoured it with sand repeatedly and rubbed it clean on the moss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What, watching you kill and eat a deer?” I asked. “Obviously not. It was … different. But not bad.” I looked down, too, fiddling with my boot lace. “It was fascinating. You were very beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes, nothing more beautiful than watching a stag have its throat ripped out,” he said. “Scares the living daylights out of most of your kind. Further evidence that Bludmen need to be locked up. Enslaved. Drained. For we have violent tendencies, you know, and aren’t fit for polite society.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s just because they don’t have to kill their own meat,” I said. “People forget what it’s like when it’s life or death. I have patients who are dying and need help but are scared to have a needle put in their arm. They live such a soft life that they would risk death because they’re afraid of a tiny piece of metal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Utter balderdash,” Criminy said, polishing the knife on his breeches. “I suppose people really are ridiculous, no matter where you go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set down the dagger, clearing his throat and straightening the collar of his coat. I wasn’t the only one acting fidgety. He wouldn’t meet my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something else is bothering you,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure how to ask, but aren’t you worried about the … consequences of our actions?” he said. He looked up with a wry grin. “Half-bluds don’t lead a merry life here. I’m surprised you’re not taking precautions. I can get you the herbs, if you wish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, that,” I said with a small, sad smile. “No, I’m not worried. I had … I had a loss, in my world. It was one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced, and I decided that I wasn’t ready to try again. I get a special shot, special medicine, once a year, to keep that from happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s handy magic,” he said, considering. “Not that I’d be sorry otherwise. Just so you know. And I’m sorry for the things that have pained you in your past.” He held my face, rubbing my cheek with his gloved thumb. “Got a bit of stag blood there,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached toward the sparkling pool to get some water, but he stopped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The water needs to stay pure,” he said. “But if you’re ready, I’ll take that drop of blood now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. He was already holding my hand, so he just removed the glove. It was businesslike this time, nothing sexy about it. With the dagger, he pricked my finger and squeezed a drop of blood into the pool, where it landed with a plop and swirled around, melting into the currents of the small spring below the surface. He placed my hand back in my lap and reached for the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePouring a thin stream of blue liquid into the pool, he said, “Where is Jonah Goodwill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water rippled, and a picture formed, just on the surface, like a reflection in window glass. It was Jonah Goodwill. In an airy room with white walls and dark wood beams, the kindly-looking old man with the walrus mustache sat at a table, eating his dinner. He seemed so harmless, just an elderly gentleman running to fat, slurping his soup. A servant stood nearby with a towel over his arm, framed by a picture window showing the church steeple of Manchester.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the white wall behind Goodwill, dozens of black eyes glistened on hunting trophies. I could tell that they were all creatures of blud—they looked bigger, meaner, more vicious than their softer counterparts. The moose in the center looked as if it could take the leg off a rhinoceros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s handy,” murmured Criminy. “Now we know he’s home.” Then he waved a hand over the pool, saying, “Where is my ruby locket?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water swirled by itself, the vision of Goodwill wavering and shifting to an empty bedroom with the same white walls and ceiling timbers. The locket lay on an elegant dresser. Beside it sat an old black-and-white photograph of a girl with bobbed black hair holding a bouquet of flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” Criminy muttered. “All of our bludbunnies in one burrow. Now, why does Jonah Goodwill want Letitia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pond rippled, and the vision dissipated. A new scene shimmered into being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Darkside in Manchester. All around the streets, dead Bludmen and women and children were scattered, their bodies spindly and pale and riddled with sores. Then the vision spun to another city, another Darkside, more bodies. Then another, and another. It showed us a world where all Bludmen were dead. The world Jonah Goodwill hoped to bring into being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at the center of the vision, surrounded by death, was me, the ruby locket hanging around my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walk to Manchester was both easier and more difficult after that. Easier because Criminy was bloated with stag blood and full of energy and because I was gnawing on a leg bone of quickly roasted, mostly rare venison. More difficult because Criminy was carrying the stag’s lopped-off head by its enormous rack of antlers, a humble gift to Magistrate Goodwill, collector of blud trophies. We hoped it would be our ticket into his presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you really think it’ll work?” I asked, sidestepping random blood droplets that leaked from the severed neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way to tell,” Criminy said. “Maybe he’ll take it, maybe not. If not, I’ll throw it at him and knock him down, maybe puncture a lung with a lucky antler. He won’t be expecting that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But wouldn’t it just be easier to let ourselves be captured?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not unless you’d like to see exactly how much blud’s in my body, love,” he said grimly. “They’ll drain me without a thought. Always better to sneak in unawares, keep that ace hidden up your sleeve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your sleeve’s covered in stag blood, Master Stain. And you deserve some sort of prize for carrying something that heavy on foot,” I said, and then it hit me. “Wait. Why aren’t we riding in the wind-up carriage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s two good reasons, pet,” he said. “One, if we arrive at their front gate in something that old and unusual, we might as well show up riding a unicorn. And two, it must go back to Master Haggard undamaged. I don’t want a Bludman that old and powerful angry at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on the road, we soon saw Manchester shimmering against the dark, oily clouds. I could smell the storm coming, and just being near the city made me queasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink of Nana, I said to myself. Think of her chicken ’n’ dumplings and how she smiles every morning when you walk through her door. Think of all the Bludmen you can save, all of the children who will have a better life if you can stop Jonah Goodwill. You’re going into Manchester, no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Criminy grunted and shifted the stag’s head onto his other shoulder, and my thoughts came back to him. I smiled at the broad shoulders, the unstudied and catlike grace, the powerful body writhing with wiry muscles and striding so easily and boldly with a grim smile through a dangerous world. There was a soft place in my heart for him. More than that. He wanted me to be exactly who I was, and he completed a part of me that I hadn’t known existed. I didn’t want to lose that, either. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wicked-as-they-come-blud-1/page-48.html","bookId":1597,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:29 PM"}
