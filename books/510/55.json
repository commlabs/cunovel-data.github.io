{"id":12027,"no":55,"title":"CHAPTER LIII. THE MURDER OF THE USURER.","content":"\u0026nbsp;\"Come in! Come in! More expense. More losses. As if an honest man, who only does what he can with his own, could not come to the court with a hope of meeting with a civil reception, unless he were decked out like a buffoon. Come in. Well, who are you?\" \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Augustus Snipes, sir, at your service. Brought home the clothes, sir. The full dress suit you were so good as to order to be ready to-day, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, you are a tailor?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, dear no, sir. We are not tailors now a days. We are artists.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Curse you, whatever you are. I don\u0027t care. Some artist I\u0027m afraid has done me out of ￡8000. Oh, dear. Put down the things. What do they come to?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Eighteen pounds ten shillings and threepence, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n John Mundell gave a deep groan, and the tailor brushed past Todd to place the clothes upon a side table. As he returned he caught sight of Todd\u0027s face, and in an instant his face lighting up, he cried—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah! how do? How do?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Eh!\" said Todd.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How did the Pompadour coloured coat and the velvet smalls do, eh?—Fit well? Lord, what a rum start for a barber to have a suit of clothes fit for a duke.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Duke!\" cried Mundell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd lifted one of his huge feet and gave the \"artist\" a kick that sent him sprawling to the door of the room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That,\" he said, \"will teach you to make game of a poor man with a large family, you scoundrel. What, you won\u0027t go, won\u0027t you? The—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The artist shot out at the door like lightning, and flew down the stairs as though the devil himself was at his heels. Todd carefully closed the door again, and fastened it by a little bolt that was upon it. A strange expression was upon the countenance of John Mundell. His face looked perfectly convulsed, and he slowly rose from his chair. Todd placed one of his huge hands upon his breast and pushed him back again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" said Todd.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He—he—knows you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The Pompadour coloured coat! Ah, I recollect the Pompadour coloured coat, too. I thought I knew your face. There was a something, too, about your voice that haunted me like the remembrance of a dream. You—you—are—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Help—help! Tell me if I be mad, or if you are a duke in the disguise of a barber, or a barber in the likeness of a duke. Ah, that Pompadour coloured coat, it sticks—sticks in my throat.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish it did,\" growled Todd. \"What do you mean, Mr. Mundell?—Pray express yourself. What do you mean by those incoherent expressions?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you human?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dear me, I hope so. Really, sir, you look quite wild.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stop—stop—let me think—the face—the voice—the Pompadour coat—the costume fit for a duke. It must be so.—Man or devil, I will grapple with you, for you have got my pearls and my money. My ￡8000—my gold that I have lived, that I have toiled for—that I have schemed, and cheated to keep up—that I have shut my eyes to all sights for—and my heart to all tender emotions. You have my money, and I will denounce you!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stop,\" said Todd.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The usurer paused in what he was saying, but he still glared at Todd fiercely, and his eyes protruded from their orbits, while the muscles of his mouth worked as though he were still trying to utter audible sounds, but by some power was denied the capacity to utter them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You say you have lost pearls?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes—yes.—Orient pearls.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd dived his hand into the breast of his apparel and produced the string of pearls. He held them before the ravished and dazzled eyes of John Mundell, as he said—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Were they like these?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With a cry of joy Mundell grasped at the pearls. Tears of gratified avarice gushed from his eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My own—my own pearls—my beautiful pearls!—Oh, blessed chance—my pearls back again. Ha! ha! ha!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ha!\" echoed Todd, as he stepped behind the chair on which John Mundell was sitting.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With his left hand he took one vigorous grasp of the remaining hair upon the head of the usurer, and forced his back against the chair. In another instant there was a sickening gushing sound. Todd, with the razor he held in his right hand, had nearly cut John Mundell\u0027s head off. Then he held him still by the hair. Gasp—gasp—gasp—bubble—gasp—bubble.—Ah! ah! ah!—Goggle—goggle. A slight convulsive movement of the lashes, and the eyes set, and became opaquely dim. The warm blood still bubbled, but John Mundell was dead. Todd picked up the pearls and carefully replaced them in his bosom again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How many strange events,\" he said, \"hang upon these baubles. Ah, it\u0027s only one more—a dirty job rather—but business is business!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He stood in the room as silent as a statue, and listened intently. Not the slightest sound indicative of the proximity of any one came upon his ears. He felt quite convinced that the deed of blood had been done in perfect secrecy. But then there he was.—Who but he could be accused? There he stood, the self-convicted murderer. Had he not done the deed with the weapon of his handicraft that he had brought to the house? How was Todd to escape the seeming inevitable cold-blooded murder? We shall see. Huddled up in the chair, was the dead body. Mundell had not fallen out of the capacious easy seat in which he sat when he breathed his last. The blood rolled to the floor, where it lay in a steaming mass. Todd was careful—very careful not to tread in it, and he looked down his garments to see if there were any tell-tale spots of gore; but standing behind the chair to do the deed, as he had done, he had been saved from anything of the sort. There he stood, externally spotless, like many a seeming and smirking sinner in this world—but oh, how black and stained within!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Humph!\" said Todd; \"John Mundell was half distracted by a heavy loss. He was ill, and his mind was evidently affected. He could not even shave himself. Oh, it is quite evident that John Mundell, unable to bear his miseries, real or ideal, any longer, in a fit of partial insanity, cut his throat. Yes, that will do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd still kept the razor in his grasp. What is he going to do?—Murder again the murdered?—Is he afraid that a man,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"With twenty murders on his head!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n will jostle him from his perilous pinnacle of guilty safety?—No. He takes one of the clammy dead hands in his own—he clasps the half rigid fingers over the handle of the razor, and then he holds them until, in the course of a minute or so, they have assumed the grasp he wishes, and the razor, with which he, Todd, did the deed of blood, is held listlessly, but most significantly, in the hand of the dead.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Murder Of The Usurer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Murder Of The Usurer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That will do,\" said Todd.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The door is reached and unfastened, and the barber slips out of the room. He closes the door again upon the fetid hot aroma of the blood that is there, fresh from the veins of a human being like himself—no—no—not like himself.—No one can be like Sweeney Todd. He is a being of his own species—distinct, alone, an incarnation of evil! Todd was in no particular hurry to descend the stairs. He gained the passage with tolerable deliberation, and then he heard voices in the parlour.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What a man you are!\" said Mrs. Blisset.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah, my dear, I am indeed. Who would not be a man for your sake? As for Mr. Blisset, I don\u0027t think him worth attention.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nor I,\" said the lady, snapping her fingers, \"I don\u0027t value him that. The poor mean-spirited wretch—he\u0027s not to be compared to you, captain.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think not, my love. Have you got any change in your pocket?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. I—I-think I have about seven shillings or so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That will do. Much obliged to you, madam—I mean, my dear Mrs. B. Ah, if you would but smother Blisset, so that I might have the joy of making you Mrs. Captain Coggan, what a happy man I should be.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd tapped at the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What was that?\" cried the captain in evident alarm; \"Is it Blisset?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, captain—oh, no; I should like to see him interrupt me, indeed. A pretty thing that I cannot do what I like in the house I keep. Come in.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd just opened the door far enough to introduce his hideous head; and having done so, stared at the pair with such a selection of frightful physiognomical changes, that they both sat transfixed with horror. At length Todd broke the silence by saying—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027s frightfully nervous.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What?—what?—who?\" gasped the captain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What?\" repeated Mrs. Blisset.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s his name, upstairs, that I was sent for to shave just now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What, Mr. Mundell. Ah, poor man, he has been in a very nervous state ever since he has been here. He continually talks of a heavy loss he has had.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" said Todd, \"I suppose he means you to pay me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am. He says he is too nervous and excited for me to shave him just now, but he has borrowed a razor from me and says he will shave himself in the course of an hour or so, and send it back to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, very well. Your money will be sent with the razor, no doubt; for although Mr. Mundell is so continually talking of his losses, they tell me he is as rich as a Jew.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, ma\u0027am. Good morning; good morning, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The captain cast a supercilious glance upon Todd, but did not deign to make the remotest reply to the mock civility with which he was bidden good morning. No one stands so much upon his dignity, as he whose title to any at all is exceedingly doubtful. The female heart, however, is mollified by devotion, and Mrs. Blisset returned the adieu of Todd. When he got into the passage, he uttered one of his extraordinary laughs, and then opening the street door, he let himself out. Todd by no means hurried back to Fleet Street, but as he walked along he now and then shrugged his shoulders and shook his huge hands, which, to those acquainted with his peculiarities, would have been sufficient indications of the fact that he was enjoying himself greatly. At length he spoke—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So—so—what a Providence we have, after all, watching over us. The moment I am in any real danger as regards the string of pearls, up starts some circumstance that enables me to ward it off. Well, well, some day I almost think I shall turn religious and build a church, and endow it. Ha!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd was so tickled at the idea of his building a church and endowing it, that he stopped at the corner of Milford Lane, to enjoy an unusual amount of laughter; as he did so he saw no other than Mrs. Ragg, slowly coming towards him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah,\" he said, \"Tobias\u0027s mother. The mother of the Tobias that was!—I will avoid her.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He darted on, and was through Temple Bar before Mrs. Ragg could make up her mind which way to run, for run she fully intended to do, when she saw Todd standing at the corner of Milford Lane. But she had no occasion for hurrying from him, as he walked in the direction of his shop as speedily as possible. Although he was perfectly satisfied with the clever manner he had ridded himself of the usurer, who probably might have been a source of annoyance to him, and who might eventually have been the means of bringing him to justice, he thought that he might be losing opportunities of making more victims for the accumulation of his ill-gotten wealth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89612.html","bookId":510,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:23:37 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:23:37 AM"}
