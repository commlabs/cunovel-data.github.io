Allison had volunteered for the job. Fresh blood. Her blood. Smelling the meat now triggered a hunger in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hunger for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself pacing inside the small bungalow. The floorboard creaked beneath me. I always paced at this time of the day, medallion or no medallion. When the sun was about to set, that thing which was inside me awakened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwakened to the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused at the open window. The sky beyond was purplish - and filling up with low-hanging clouds. So much for the sunny skies. This was, after all, the Pacific Northwest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, the first drops appeared against the big window, splattering, collecting, sliding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued pacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I paced, both a sadness and an excitement filled me. Excitement for the coming night. Sadness for what I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, just when I would think I was feeling normal, or feeling human, this would happen: the day would merge into night. And, when that happened, I would feel anything but normal. Anyone but myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt on edge, anxious, angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be when I would snap at Tammy and Anthony - and even more often at Danny - more than enough times for them to know to stay away from Mommy at this time of day. Of course, back in the day, my kids didn\u0027t know the reason why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they did. Now they knew everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey knew Mommy was a freak. They also knew that they were pretty freaky themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot my fault, I thought, as I shook my hands and continued pacing. I didn\u0027t ask for this. I was only out jogging. Jogging as I had done many times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds of times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the bastard been watching me seven years ago? Or had I simply crossed paths with him unexpectedly? An unfortunate crossing of paths?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know...and perhaps would never know, unless...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless I talked to the vampire hunter who\u0027d killed my own attacker. The vampire hunter named Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, wasn\u0027t there another who knew the answers? My guardian angel had been neither a guardian nor an angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIshmael had, apparently, orchestrated my attack. How, I didn\u0027t know, but I was going to find out. What strings had he pulled? In the least, what did the son-of-a- bitch know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my hands again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood God, when was the fucking sun going to set?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, I knew. Soon. I could feel it out there, beyond the forest of evergreens. Its rounded upper half was still above the distant horizon. I couldn\u0027t see it but I could feel it. Every ray. Every particle of light. Every fucking photon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew Fang. He didn\u0027t have to push me so hard. I might have come around. I might have fallen in love with him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew Detective Hanner, too. Whatever her game was, I didn\u0027t know, but I did know one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t going to win. Not if she came up against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by stealing Fang from me - my very best friend - well, she made it personal. Very, very personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI accidentally elbowed the corner of the kitchen. Plaster exploded and the whole house shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy, I thought. Calm down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Danny and Kingsley. Two cheaters. Two bastards, and I nearly drove my hand through the front door as I passed by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s not calming down, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of my kids and took a deep breath. I thought of Detective Sherbet and smiled. I thought of Allison snoring in the room next to me, and almost laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was calming down. Good. Willing myself to calm down. Yes, good. But there was another reason for why I was finally relaxing. Oh, yes, another reason, indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was slip, slip, slippin\u0027 away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused by the big window and breathed in deeply, filling my worthless lungs to capacity with useless air. And by the time I had filled them completely, the anger and hostility had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like a new woman. Or a new vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun, after all, had set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was alive again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruly alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and saw Allison watching me from the shadows of her doorway, her hair mussed. \"Feeling better?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very, very hungry,\" I said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-13.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
