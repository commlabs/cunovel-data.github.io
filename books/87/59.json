It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early return (to man\u0027s normal state). That early return is what I call the repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation (of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall be, he may be the ruler of a state.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e3.
