KENYON\u0027S PLANS FOR OLIVER.","content":"S OON after they were seated in the cars, bound for New York, Mr. Kenyon remarked:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps you are surprised, Oliver, that I take you with me instead of Roland.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver admitted that he was surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The fact is,\" said Mr. Kenyon candidly, \"I don\u0027t think Roland treats you as well as he should.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver was more and more surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t complain of Roland,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t think he likes me, but perhaps that is not his fault. We are quite different.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Still he might treat you well.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t think of that, Mr. Kenyon; Roland has never done me any serious harm, and if he proposed to do it, I am able to take care of myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver did not say this in an offensive tone, but with manly independence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are quite magnanimous,\" said Mr. Kenyon. \"I am just beginning to appreciate you. I own that I used to have a prejudice against you, and it is possible I may have treated you harshly; but I have learned to know you better. I find you a straightforward, manly young fellow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, sir,\" said Oliver, very much astonished. \"I am afraid you do me more than justice. I hope to retain your good opinion.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have no doubt you will,\" said Mr. Kenyon, in a quiet and paternal tone. \"You have probably noticed that my manner toward you has changed of late?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir, I have noticed the change, and been glad to see it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course, of course. Now, I have got something to tell you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver naturally felt curious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I want to tell you why I have brought you to New York to-day. You probably thought it was merely for a pleasant excursion.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have another object in view. Noticing as I have the dislike—well, the incompatibility between you and Roland, I have thought it best to make separate arrangements for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now Oliver was strangely interested. What plan had Mr. Kenyon formed for him?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I intend you to remain in the city. How does that suit you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There are not many boys of Oliver\u0027s age to whom such a prospect would not be pleasing. He answered promptly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should like it very much.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No doubt Roland will envy you,\" said Mr. Kenyon. \"I am sure he would prefer the city to our quiet little country village. But I cannot make up my mind to part with him. He is my own son, and though I endeavor to treat you both alike, of course that makes some difference,\" said Mr. Kenyon, in rather an apologetic tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course it does,\" said Oliver, who did not feel in the least sensitive about his step-father\u0027s superior affection for Roland.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where am I to live in the city?\" he asked next.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There are two courses open to you,\" said Mr. Kenyon. \"You might either go to some school in the city or enter some place of business. Which would you prefer?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Had Oliver been an enthusiastic student, he would have decided in favor of school. He was a good scholar for his age, but, like all boys, he fancied a change. It seemed to him that he would like to obtain a business position, and he said so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His step-father anticipated this, and wished it. Had Oliver decided otherwise, he would have exerted his influence to have him change his plan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps you are right,\" said Mr. Kenyon meditatively. \"A bright, smart boy like you, is, of course, anxious to get to work and do something for himself. Besides, business men tell me that it is always best to begin young. How old are you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Almost sixteen,\" answered Oliver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was only fourteen when I commenced business. Yes, I think you are right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is it easy to get a position in the city?\" asked Oliver, getting interested.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not unless you have influence; but I think I have influence enough to secure you one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In fact, I know of a party who is in want of a boy—an old acquaintance of mine. He will take you to oblige me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What business is he in?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He has a gentlemen\u0027s furnishing store,\" answered Mr. Kenyon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think that business is as good as some other kinds?\" said Oliver dubiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is a capital business,\" said his step-father emphatically. \"Pays splendid profits.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who is the gentleman you refer to?\" enquired Oliver, with natural interest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, to be frank with you, it is a nephew of my own. I set him up in business three years ago, and he has paid back every cent of my loan with interest out of the profits of his business. I can assure you it is a paying business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would judge so, from what you say,\" returned Oliver thoughtfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Somehow he felt disappointed to learn that the employer proposed to him should be a relation of his step-father. This, however, was not an objection he could very well express.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Suppose I should not like business,\" he suggested, \"could I give it up and go to school?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly,\" answered Mr. Kenyon. \"Bear in mind, Oliver, that I exercise no compulsion over you. I think you are old enough now to be judge of your own affairs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The conversation which we have reported took some time. After it was over Mr. Kenyon devoted his attention to the morning papers, and Oliver was sufficiently amused looking out of the window and examining his fellow-passengers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently they reached the city. Leaving the cars, they got into a horse-car, for distances are great in New York.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver looked out of the car windows with a lively sense of satisfaction. How much gayer and more agreeable it would be, he thought, to be in business in a great city like New York than to live in a quiet little country village where nothing was going on. This was a natural feeling, but there was another side to the question which Oliver did not consider. How many families in the great, gay city are compelled to live in miserable tenements, amid noise and vicious surroundings, who, on the same income, could live comfortably and independently in the country, breathing God\u0027s pure air, and with nothing to repel or disgust them?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"New York is rather a lively place, Oliver,\" said Mr. Kenyon, who read his young companion\u0027s thoughts. \"I think you will like to live here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sure I shall,\" said Oliver eagerly. \"I should think you would prefer it yourself, Mr. Kenyon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps I may remove here some day, Oliver. I own that I have thought of it. Roland would like it better, I am sure.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir, I think he would.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is the store you spoke of, Mr. Kenyon?\" he queried, after a pause. \"Are we going there now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; we will go there in the first place. We may as well get matters settled as soon as possible. Of course, you won\u0027t have to go to work immediately. You can take a little time to see the city—say till next Monday.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank, you, sir. I should prefer that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We get out here,\" said Mr. Kenyon after a while.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were on the Third Avenue line of cars, and it was to a shop on the Bowery that Mr. Kenyon directed his steps. It was by no means a large shop, but the windows were full of articles, labelled with cheap prices, and some even were displayed on the sidewalk. This is a very common practice with shops on the Bowery and Third Avenue, as visitors to New York need not be reminded. On a sign-board over the door the name of the proprietor was conspicuously displayed thus:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e EZEKIEL BOND,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cheap Furnishing Store.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is the place, Oliver,\" said Mr. Kenyon. \"Ezekiel Bond is my nephew.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It seems rather small,\" commented Oliver, feeling a little disappointed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mustn\u0027t judge of the amount of business done by the size of the shop. My nephew\u0027s plan is to avoid a large rent, and to replenish his stock frequently. He is a very shrewd and successful man of business. He understands how to manage. The great thing is to make money, Oliver, and Ezekiel knows how to do it. There are many men with large stores, heavy stocks, and great expenses who scarcely make both ends meet. Now, my nephew cleared ten thousand dollars last year. What do you say to that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I shouldn\u0027t think it possible to have such a large trade in such a small place,\" answered Oliver, surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is a fact, though. That\u0027s a nice income to look forward to, eh, Oliver?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While this was going on they were standing in front of the window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now,\" said Mr. Kenyon, \"come in and I will introduce you to my nephew.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59220.html","bookId":527,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM"}
