Elizabeth fairly flew out the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a good woman,\" Angus said with a long sigh. He tossed the water from his cup on the earthen floor, then got out of his bed to search for the jug of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She took it with her,\" Alec announced with a laugh. \"The woman knows you better than you think she does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus looked pleased with that statement. He motioned for Alec to share a portion of his drink with him, and when his laird had complied, he took a long swal ow. \"Lord, that tastes good. Your wife has told Elizabeth I can\u0027t have any wine until the threads come out. Only God knows why she would say such a monstrous thing. Elizabeth obeys every order though. I\u0027m damned to misery with the two of them pecking at me like hens, Alec. You should have let me die, man, and saved me from such—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angels?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus nodded. \"Did you have something in particular you wanted to discuss with me, or did you just want to see my sorry state?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close the door, Angus,\" Alec directed. \"I don\u0027t want anyone to overhear our talk. I need some information, friend, and advice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus kicked the door shut. \"I can tel it\u0027s serious, Alec. Your expression is grim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec explained what had happened to Jamie. He ended the narrative by tel ing Angus that Jamie didn\u0027t know someone had tried to kil her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men discussed the added protection that would be needed until the culprit was found. Though Angus wasn\u0027t an old man by any measure, he was stil three summers senior to his laird, and in Alec\u0027s mind, three summers the wiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus sat down in a chair and propped his feet up on the bed. His scowl was as deep as Alec\u0027s by the time they\u0027d finished making their plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alec started pacing the length of the room, Angus knew there was more to be discussed. He patiently waited for his laird to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong, silent minutes passed before Alec turned back to Angus. \"Angus, I want you to tel me everything you remember about Helena. You were here, with Marcus and Gavin, during the short time I was married to her. Since I was away—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, you were doing the king\u0027s business most of that time,\" Angus agreed. \"Do you realize, Alec, this is the first time you\u0027ve said her name since the burying day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to put it behind me,\" Alec announced. \"Yet I\u0027ve always…\" He stopped mid-sentence, shook his head, and then commanded once again that Angus tel him what he knew about Helena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kincaid spent a good half-hour questioning his trusted friend. His mood wasn\u0027t much improved when he left Angus. Elizabeth had been hovering outside the door. Alec winked at her before leaving, causing yet another blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had just reached the top of the hil when he saw Jamie in the window above the first story. If she\u0027d just turned a little to the left, she would have seen him. Jamie\u0027s attention, however, was centered on the two soldiers lounging against the stone wall below her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was smiling. His mood immediately lightened. Lord, she was enchanting. He thought she was a bonny lass indeed with her hair tied up on top of her head. Long curly strands had already worked their way down the sides of her face. There were smudges of dirt on her nose and forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would need yet another bath before nightfal , he decided with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething one of the soldiers was saying to the other drew her full attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Alec watched, Jamie braced her elbows on the ledge and leaned farther out. He could tel she was vastly amused by the story one soldier was relating to his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec moved closer, then came to a sudden stop when he realized his men were speaking in Gaelic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she understood every damn word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was too surprised to be angry with her. Then he heard the last of an old jest the soldier was tel ing his friend, about a Scottish warrior finding an unclothed woman stretched out on the roadside. As was the man\u0027s natural inclination, the warrior immediately fel upon her and had his way with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger soldier let out a good snort of appreciation before his friend continued the tel ing. He explained then that another Scottish warrior came upon the scene and immediately shamed his friend by tel ing him the woman was obviously dead, for God Almighty\u0027s sake, and only a vile infidel would want to mate with a dead woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie\u0027s hands had covered her mouth, probably to keep her laughter contained. Her eyes were sparkling with pleasure, too. She waited in anticipation for the punch line of the jest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec waited to see her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead?\" the soldier shouted. \"I thought she was English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie lost her smile then. She disappeared from the window while the two unsuspecting soldiers continued to laugh with merriment. She was back in his vision quickly, though, balancing a large bucket of water in her hands. Alec held his laughter as he watched her struggle with the awkward weight. He didn\u0027t bother to warn his men. Jamie took careful aim, then smiled with the joy of victory when the soapy water poured over her victims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pray, do forgive me,\" she called down when they\u0027d finished their litany of curses and turned to look up at her. \"I had no idea you were standing there,\" she lied, ever so sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Lady Kincaid,\" the one soldier gasped out to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men were immediately contrite for having yel ed. They apologized profusely. As they rushed past Alec, he heard one remark that it was a blessing their mistress didn\u0027t understand Gaelic, else she surely would have been offended by their crude remarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had understood. Alec did laugh then, a full booming sound that drew his wife\u0027s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled down at him. \"You\u0027re in a fine mood, husband,\" she called out. \"Are you feeling rested, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have to bring up his nap. Alec quit his laughing. He decided two could play this foolish game of deception, and his mind was already thinking of the remarks he was going to make—al in Gaelic, of course—just to goad her temper. She wouldn\u0027t be able to retaliate, for to do so would prove she understood what he\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would beat her at her own game. Alec looked forward to the insults he planned to hurl at her. She was such a little temptress when she was riled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was just the man to rile her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was fil ed with surprises, pretending ignorance whenever Gaelic was spoken in her presence. Hel , he\u0027d ordered his men to strengthen their skil s in her language just to make her adjustment easier. Why, she\u0027d have them all strutting around in English garb by winter if he wasn\u0027t more careful, Alec decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat thought gave him a chil .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Alec? Why were you laughing?\" Jamie asked again, leaning farther out on the ledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you watch what you\u0027re doing?\" he shouted up at her. \"You\u0027re going to fal on your head, you daft woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved back a pace. \"Thank you for being so concerned, husband. Now will you tel me why you were laughing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec recounted the tale he\u0027d overheard, just to goad her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie didn\u0027t let him finish the jest, though. \"I\u0027ve heard that old jest, Alec,\" she called out. \"The woman wasn\u0027t dead,\" she added. \"She was Scottish, and that\u0027s that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left the window before Alec could argue with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met him at the bottom of the steps. \"What\u0027s all this clutter?\" he asked in a growl. The distance between them was fil ed with bundles. A rather odd-looking chair, the seat as wide as two good-sized men, topped the pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My possessions,\" Jamie announced. \"Some will go into our bedroom, Alec, and the rest belong in the hall .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like clutter,\" Alec stated. He reached down, grabbed a tapestry, and held it up so that he could see the design. Jamie skirted her way around her things and snatched the tapestry out of Alec\u0027s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t frown so, husband,\" she whispered, for both Gavin and Marcus were observing the scene. \"I thought we\u0027d place this tapestry above your mantel,\" she continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hel is it?\" he growled. \"I can\u0027t make…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were looking at the wrong side,\" Jamie returned. She hurried over to Gavin, handed the tapestry to him. \"Please hang this—as straight as a lance, if you please. And try not to look at it while you\u0027re hanging it, Gavin. I want you to be surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you do this with your own hands, milady?\" Gavin asked, smiling over her enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, heavens, no,\" Jamie told him. \"Agnes and Alice did all the work. It was their birthday surprise for me.\" She gave both Gavin and Marcus a long look then, and turned back to Alec. \"Do you know, we must conspire to have my twin sisters meet Gavin and Marcus. I do believe they\u0027d—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t going to arrange any marriages, Jamie,\" Alec interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are the twins like you, Jamie?\" Gavin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, both are much prettier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin\u0027s eyes widened. \"Then I must meet these ladies,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their personalities are just like Mary\u0027s,\" Alec murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" Gavin rushed out. He turned and hurried to the fireplace to hang the tapestry. Alec\u0027s laughter trailed behind him. \"Gavin, if you ever tel anyone your laird slept during the day, I\u0027l make certain you meet both sisters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What nap?\" Gavin called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Marcus joined in their laughter. Jamie had never seen the dark-haired soldier smile before. She instinctively smiled back. \"Why are you all so amused?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind, Jamie,\" Alec said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave her husband a suspicious look. \"Were you just suggesting to your men that my sisters might not be worthy of them?\" Her hands settled on her h*ps and she took a step toward him in obvious chal enge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t saddle a goat with the pair of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a loud gasp. He couldn\u0027t resist. He took a step forward, then added in a lazy voice, \"I don\u0027t believe in being cruel to animals, wife. Surely you\u0027ve noticed that fact by now. I don\u0027t use a crop on my steed and I—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you insulting my family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer her, just gave her that irresistible lopsided grin she liked so much. She couldn\u0027t help but laugh. The man was completely hopeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re as shameful as they come, Kincaid. I now realize you simply don\u0027t know my family well enough to make a correct evaluation. I shal , of course, take care of that matter as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin faltered. She sweetened her smile. \"I shal ask them to pay us a visit, husband. A nice, long visit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this supposed to be?\" Gavin called out, drawing her attention. The soldier was climbing down from the stool on which he had stood to hang the tapestry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand back and you can surely see who it is,\" Jamie called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it… good Lord, Alec, I just hung—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s will iam, our beloved Conquerer, Gavin. A fair depiction I\u0027m told. He was quite a handsome man, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one said a word for a long minute. Gavin and Marcus were both staring at Alec to judge his reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir laird was staring at his wife, a most incredulous look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus was the first to recover. \"He was fat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was solid, Marcus, not fat,\" Jamie corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in God\u0027s name is that thing above his head?\" Gavin asked, backing up yet another step. \"That yel ow thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a halo,\" Jamie explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sainted the man?\" Marcus asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t official just yet,\" Jamie said. \"But it\u0027s only a matter of time before the church does acknowledge his sainthood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" It was Marcus who asked what all three men were thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie was pleased that her husband and his soldiers were showing such interest in her history. She took her time explaining to them how willliam had single-handedly changed the way of life in England. In great detail she instructed them in the ways of the liege lord, the duties of a vassal, the bond each formed with the other. When she was finished, she was sure they had many questions to ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one, however, seemed inclined to ask her anything. \"Do you think such a system would work here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It already has, Jamie, for several hundred years,\" Alec snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve just described the Scottish clan, lass,\" Gavin said, trying to soften her disappointment in her husband\u0027s reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tear it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec, you cannot mean it,\" Jamie cried. \"My sisters spent long hours working on that tapestry. It was a present for my birthday. I want to look at it whenever the mood strikes me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Murdock strol ed into the hall in time to overhear Jamie\u0027s remark. One good look above the hearth told him the reason for his laird\u0027s scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see an argument was brewing. He didn\u0027t want the little lass\u0027s feelings injured and hurried to intervene in her behalf. \"Now, now, Alec, she isn\u0027t meaning to insult you by putting your enemy\u0027s likeness in your home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, of course I didn\u0027t mean to insult him,\" Jamie said. \"He, on the other hand, is certainly testing my patience, I can tel you that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m testing your patience?\" Alec all but strangled on his urge to shout. Her delicate nature was the only reason he held back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You certainly are, Alec Kincaid,\" Jamie continued. \"This is my home, too, isn\u0027t it? I should be all owed to hang any tapestry I want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie and Father Murdock frowned at Alec. Gavin and Marcus were smiling. Jamie gave Alec her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father, will you help me carry this chair into the hall ? Or is this against your rules too, Alec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Murdock gave the piece of furniture a thorough inspection. \"There are warped blades of wood stuck to the bottom,\" he noted aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something\u0027s wrong here, lass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The chair\u0027s supposed to rock back and forth,\" Jamie patiently explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest wobbled his eyebrows in reaction to her statement. \"I know,\" she said then. \"It will never catch on. Stil , it\u0027s a most comfortable chair. You must try it, Father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps another time,\" the priest said, taking a step away from the strange-looking contraption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec let his exasperation show. He lifted the chair and carried it down the three steps, then crossed the room with long strides and placed the chair adjacent to the hearth. He tried not to look up at will iam\u0027s ugly face smiling down at him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-34.html","bookId":1852,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM"}
