{"id":82452,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"\u003cp\u003eXXIV\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;From the Lost World\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE BLaYLOCKS, IT MaY BE SaFE TO SaY, WENT DIRECTLY TO jail. They did not have a Get Out of Jail Free card, they did not collect two hundred dollars, and their mean monopoly was smashed. I understood that they were as tight-lipped as clams at first, but then the family ties began unraveling as the state investigators drilled them. Wade learned that Donny had stolen a large chunk of his moonshine profits, Bodean found that Wade was skimming the gambling den\u0027s money, and Donny suspected that Wade had put some arsenic in his bottle of moonshine and that\u0027s why he thought he\u0027d seen a ghost. as the Blaylock brothers began spilling their guts, Biggun decided to take the high road. He fell on his knees at the arraignment and professed, sobbing to shame Shakespeare, that he was Born again and had been duped into following the paths of Satan by his own misguided sons. They must take after their mothers, he said. He vowed to devote his life to being a minister, if, by the grace of the Lord above, the judge would offer him the cup of mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was told he would have a very long time in which to practice his preaching, and a nice secure place to catch up on his Bible reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they dragged him out of court, kicking and screaming, he damned everybody in sight, even the stenographer. They said he threw so many curses that if those bad words had been bricks, they\u0027d have made a three-bedroom house with a two-car garage. The brothers went before judges as well, to similar results. I didn\u0027t have any sympathy for them. If I knew the Blaylocks, they\u0027d soon be running the prison store and making a killing off every cigarette and square of toilet paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing, though, the Blaylocks refused to divulge: what was in the wooden box they\u0027d sold to Gerald Hargison and Dick Moultry. It couldn\u0027t be proven that any box even existed. But I knew better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amorys left town. Mr. Marchette gave up being fire chief and stepped into the role of sheriff. I understand Sheriff Marchette told Mr. Owen Cathcoate anytime he wanted to wear a deputy\u0027s badge it would be fine with him. But Mr. Cathcoate informed the sheriff that the Candystick Kid had gone to roam the frontiers of the Wild West, where he belonged, and from here on out he was just plain old Owen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom was in a zombie state for a while, as visions of what might have been careened through her mind, but she came out of it. I believe that deep in her heart she might have wanted Dad to stay safe at home but she respected him more for making up his own mind about what was right. When my lie became obvious, Dad debated not letting me go to the Brandywine Carnival when it came to town but he wound up making me wash and dry the dinner dishes for a week straight. I didn\u0027t argue. I had to pay the piper somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the posters began appearing around town. BRaNDYWINE CaRNIVaL IS ON ITS WaY! Johnny was looking forward to seeing the Indian ponies and trick riders. Ben was excited about the midway, and the rides lit up with pulsing multicolored bulbs. I looked forward to the haunted house, which you rode through on rickety railcars while unseen things brushed your face and howled at you in the dark. Davy Ray\u0027s excitement concerned the freak show. I never saw anybody who got so worked up about freaks as he did. They gave me the creeps and I could hardly look at them, but Davy Ray was a true connoisseur of freakdom. If it had three arms, a pinhead, crocodile-scaled skin, or sweated blood, he went into giddy fits of delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it happened that on Thursday night the park area near the baseball field where we\u0027d had our Fourth of July barbecue was empty when the last Zephyr light went off. On Friday morning, kids on their way to school witnessed the transformation a few hours could bring. The Brandywine Carnival appeared like an island in a sea of sawdust. Trucks were chugging around, men were hoisting up tents, the frameworks of rides were being pieced together like dinosaur bones, and the booths were going up where food would be sold and Kewpie dolls not worth a quarter would be won for two dollars\u0027 worth of horseshoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore school, my buddies and I took a spin around the park on our bikes. Other kids were doing the same thing, circling like moths in expectation of a light bulb. \"There\u0027s the haunted house!\" I said, pointing toward the bat wings of a gothic mansion being hinged together. Ben said, \"Gonna be a Ferris wheel this year, looks like!\" Johnny\u0027s gaze was on a trailer with horses and Indians painted on its side. Davy Ray hollered, \"Looka there! Hoo boy!\" We saw what he was so excited about: a big, garishly painted canvas with a wrinkled face at its center and in the center of the wrinkled face a single horrible eyeball. FREaKS OF NaTURE! the words on the canvas said. IT COULD\u0027VE BEEN YOU!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, it was not a large carnival. It was short of medium-sized, too. Its tents were patched, its trailers rust-streaked, its trucks and workers equally tired. It was the end of the carnival season for them, and our area was almost its last stop. But we never thought that we were getting the leftover crop of caramel apples, that the Indian ponies and trick riders went through their routines with an eye on the clock, that the rides clattered in need of oiling and the barkers were surly not to add flavor but because they were damned bushed. We just saw a carnival out there, aglow and beckoning. That\u0027s what we saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like a good one this year!\" Ben said as we started to turn back for school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it sure-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then a horn blasted behind me and Rocket zoomed out of the way as a Mack truck passed us. It turned onto the sawdust, its heavy tires crunching down. The truck was a hodgepodge of different-colored parts, and it was hauling a wide trailer with no windows. We could hear the suspension groan. On the trailer\u0027s sides, an amateurish hand had painted crude green jungle fronds and foliage. across the jungle scene was scrawled, in thick red letters that had been allowed to drip like rivulets of blood: FROM THE LOST WORLD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt rumbled away, toward the maze of other trucks and trailers. But in its wake I caught a smell. Not just exhaust, though of that there was plenty. Something else. Something... lizardy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whew!\" Davy Ray wrinkled his nose. \"Ben let one!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silent but deadly!\" Davy Ray whooped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did it yourself, then! Not me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I smell it,\" Johnny said calmly. Davy Ray and Ben shut up. We had learned to listen when Johnny spoke. \"Came from that trailer,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watched the Mack truck and trailer turn between two tents and go out of sight. I looked at the ground, and saw the tires had smushed right through the sawdust and left brown grooves in the earth. \"Wonder what\u0027s in iti\" Davy Ray asked on the scent of a freak. I told him I didn\u0027t know, but whatever it was, it was mighty heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ride to school, we formulated our plans. Parents permitting, we would meet at my house at six-thirty and go to the carnival together like the Four Musketeers. Does that suit everybodyi I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t,\" Ben answered, pedaling beside me. He spoke the word like a grim bell tolling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why noti We always go at six-thirty! That\u0027s when all the rides are goin\u0027!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t,\" Ben repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you got a parrot stuck in your throati\" Davy Ray asked. \"What\u0027s wrong with youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen sighed, blowing a wisp of steam in the morning\u0027s sunny chill. He had on a woolen cap, his round cheeks flushed with crimson. \"Just... can\u0027t. Not until seven o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We always go at six-thirty!\" Davy Ray insisted. \"It\u0027s... it\u0027s...\" He looked at me for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tradition,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah! That\u0027s what it is!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think there\u0027s somethin\u0027 Ben doesn\u0027t want to tell us,\" Johnny said, swerving his bike up on the other side of Davy Ray. \"Spit it out, Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just... I can\u0027t...\" He frowned, and with another plume of steam decided to give up the game. \"at six o\u0027clock I\u0027ve got a piana lesson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whati\" Davy Ray had fairly yelled it. Rocket wobbled. Johnny looked as if he\u0027d taken a Cassius Clay roundhouse punch to the noggin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a piana lesson,\" Ben repeated. The way he said that word, I could see legions of simpering pansies behind legions of upright pianos while their adoring mothers smiled and patted their beanies. \"Miss Blue Glass has started teachin\u0027 piana. Mom\u0027s signed me up, and my first lesson\u0027s at six o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were horrified. \"Why, Beni\" I asked. \"Why\u0027d she do iti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants me to learn Christmas songs. Can you believe iti Christmas songs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man!\" Davy Ray shook his head in commiseration. \"Too bad Miss Blue Glass can\u0027t teach you guitar!\" Git-tar, he pronounced it. \"Now, that\u0027d be cool! But piana... yech!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t I know it,\" Ben muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s a way around this,\" Johnny said as we neared the school. \"Why don\u0027t we just meet Ben at the Glasses\u0027 housei We can ride on to the carnival at seven instead of six-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah!\" Ben perked up. \"That way it won\u0027t be so awful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was settled, then, pending parental okay. But every year we all got together and went to the carnival on Friday night from six-thirty until ten, and our parents had always said yes. It was really the only night kids our age could go. Saturday morning and afternoon was when the black people went, and Saturday night belonged to the older kids. Then by ten o\u0027clock on Sunday morning the park area was clear again except for a few scatters of sawdust, crushed Dixie cups, and ticket stubs the cleanup crew had left like a dog marking its territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day passed in a slow crawl of anticipation. Leatherlungs called me a blockhead twice and made Georgie Sanders stand with his nose pressed against a circle on the blackboard for smarting off. Ladd Devine went to the office for drawing a lewd picture on the inside cover of his notebook, and the Demon swore she\u0027d fix Leatherlungs\u0027 wagon. I sure would\u0027ve hated to be in Leatherlungs\u0027 clunky brown shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom my house, as the blue twilight gathered and the sickle moon appeared, I could see the lights of the Brandywine Carnival. The Ferris wheel was turning, outlined in red. The midway sparkled with white bulbs. The sound of calliope music, laughter, and joyous screams drifted to me over the roofs of Zephyr. I had five dollars in my pocket, a gift from my father. I was wrapped up in my fleece-lined denim jacket against the cold. I was ready to roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Glass sisters lived about a half mile away, on Shantuck Street. By the time I got there on Rocket, near quarter before seven, Davy Ray\u0027s bike was parked next to Ben\u0027s in front of the house, which looked like a gingerbread cottage Hansel and Gretel might\u0027ve envied. I left Rocket and went up on the porch. I could hear piano notes being banged behind the door. Then the high, fluty voice of Miss Blue Glass: \"Softly, Ben. Softly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed the doorbell. Chimes rang, and Miss Blue Glass said, \"Will you please answer that, Davy Rayi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door as the banging continued. I could tell by his sick expression that listening to Ben try to hammer out the same five notes over and over again wasn\u0027t good for your health. \"Is that Winifred Osbornei\" Miss Blue Glass called over the racket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ma\u0027am, it\u0027s Cory Mackenson,\" Davy Ray told her. \"He\u0027s waitin\u0027 for Ben, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring him in, then. Too cold to wait outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed the threshold into a living room that was a boy\u0027s nightmare. all the furniture looked like spindly antiques that wouldn\u0027t bear the weight of a starved mosquito. Little tables held porcelain figures of dancing clowns, children holding puppies, and the like. a gray carpet on the floor appeared to indelibly remember footprints. a glass curio cabinet as tall as my dad held a forest of colored crystal goblets, coffee mugs with the faces of all the presidents on them, twenty-odd ceramic dolls clothed in lace costumes, and maybe another twenty rhinestone-decorated eggs each with its own brass four-footed stand. What a crash that thing would make if it went over, I thought. a green-and-blue-streaked marble pedestal held an open Bible as big as my gargantuan dictionary, the type in it large enough to be read from across the room. Everything looked too frail to touch and too precious to enjoy, and I wondered how anybody could live in such a state of frozen pretty. Of course, there was the gleaming brown upright piano, with Ben trapped at its keys and Miss Blue Glass standing beside the bench holding a conductor\u0027s baton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Cory. Please have a seat,\" she said. She was wearing all blue, as usual, except for a wide white belt around her bony waist. Her whitish-blond hair was piled up like a foamy fountain, her black glasses so thick they made her eyes bug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wherei\" I asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right there. On the sofa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sofa, covered in velvety cloth that showed shepherds playing their harps to prancing sheep, had legs that looked about as sturdy as rain-soaked twigs. Davy Ray and I eased down into the sofa\u0027s cushiony grip. The sofa creaked ever so slightly, but my heart jumped in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now! Thinkin\u0027 cap on! Fingers flow like the waves! One, two, three, one, two, three.\" Miss Blue Glass started motioning up and down with her baton as the pudgy fingers of Ben\u0027s right hand tried to play the same five notes with some resemblance to rhythm. Soon enough, though, he was pounding those notes as if trying to crush fire ants. \"Flow like the waves!\" Miss Blue Glass said. \"Softly, softly! One, two, three, one, two, three!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen\u0027s playing was less wavy and more sludgy. \"I can\u0027t do it!\" he wailed, and he pulled his hand away from those frightful keys. \"My fingers are gettin\u0027 all crossed up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sonia, give that boy a rest!\" Miss Green Glass called from the rear of the house. \"You\u0027re gonna wear his fingers to the bone!\" Her voice was more trombone than flute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just mind your own beeswax now, Katharina!\" Miss Blue Glass retorted. \"Ben\u0027s got to learn the proper technique!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s his first lesson, for pity\u0027s sake!\" Miss Green Glass walked out of a hallway into the living room. She put her hands on her skinny hips and glowered at her sister from behind her own black-framed glasses. She was wearing all green, the shades varying from pale to forest. She made you feel a little seasick just looking at her. Her blondish-white hair was piled higher than Sonia\u0027s, and had a vague pyramidal shape about it. \"Not everybody\u0027s a musical genius like you, you know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes I do know, thank you very much!\" Swirls of red had crept into Miss Blue Glass\u0027s ivory cheeks. \"I\u0027ll thank you not to interrupt Ben\u0027s lesson!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His time\u0027s about over, anyway. Who\u0027s your next victimi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winifred Osborne is my next student,\" Miss Blue Glass said pointedly. \"and if it wasn\u0027t for your magazine subscriptions, I wouldn\u0027t have to go back to teachin\u0027 piano to begin with!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you blame my magazine subscriptions! It\u0027s your own self at fault! I swear, if you buy another set of dinner plates, I\u0027m gonna go straight out of my head! What\u0027re you buyin\u0027 all those dinner plates for when we don\u0027t ever have anybody to dinneri\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re pretty, that\u0027s why! I like pretty things! and I could ask you why you went out and bought a collection of First Lady thimbles when you can\u0027t even sew a stitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re gonna grow in value, that\u0027s why! You wouldn\u0027t know an investment if it crawled up on one of those dumb dinner plates and begged you to eat it with a biscuit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feared the Glass sisters were going to come to blows. The timbres of their voices sounded like a duel of slightly off-key musical instruments. Caught between them, Ben appeared about to leap from his skin. Then something went crooaaakk from the rear of the house. It was the kind of noise I would\u0027ve imagined the tentacled Martian in the bowl could make. Miss Blue Glass jabbed the baton at her sister and snapped, \"See therei You\u0027ve upset him! are you satisfied nowi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door chimes rang. \"It\u0027s probably the neighbors fussin\u0027 about your hollerin\u0027!\" Miss Green Glass predicted. \"They can hear you all the way to Union Town!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnny stood there when Miss Blue Glass opened the door. He was bundled up in a dark brown jacket over a black turtleneck. \"I\u0027m here to wait for Ben,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord have mercy! Is the whole world waitin\u0027 for Beni\" She made a face as if she\u0027d bitten into a lemon, but she said, \"He\u0027s still got five minutes! Come on in, then!\" Johnny entered the house, and he saw our edgy faces and realized he had stepped into something that was not a pile of roses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrooaaakk! Crooaaakk! the thing in the back room squawked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you see to him if you aren\u0027t too busyi\" Miss Blue Glass told her sister. \"Since you\u0027ve stirred him up, at least see to him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear I\u0027d move out of here if I could find a cardboard box worth livin\u0027 in!\" Miss Green Glass groused, but she stalked into the hallway again and the ruckus was over at least for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, I\u0027m worn out!\" Miss Blue Glass picked up an old church bulletin and fanned herself with it. \"Ben, get up and I\u0027ll show you what you can be playin\u0027 if you\u0027ll do your exercises like I\u0027ve told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes ma\u0027am!\" He jumped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Blue Glass settled herself on the piano bench. Her hands with their long elegant fingers poised over the keyboard. She closed her eyes, getting in the mood I guess. \"I used to teach this song to all my students when I was teachin\u0027 piano full-time,\" she said. \"Ever heard of \u0027Beautiful Dreamer\u0027i\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ma\u0027am,\" Ben said. Davy Ray elbowed me in the ribs and rolled his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is it,\" Miss Blue Glass explained, and she began to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the Beach Boys, but it was nice. The music swarmed out of that piano and filled up the room, and Miss Blue Glass swayed slightly from side to side on the bench as her fingers rippled across the keyboard. I have to say, it did sound pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a terrible screech intruded. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and strained at their roots. The noise felt like jagged glass hammered into your earhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skulls and bones! Hannah Furd! Skulls and bones! Cricket in Rinsin!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Blue Glass stopped playing. \"Katharina! Feed him a cracker!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s goin\u0027 crazy in here! He\u0027s beatin\u0027 at his cage!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skulls and bones! Draggin me packin! Skulls and bones!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know if those words were what the thing was screaming, but that\u0027s what it sounded like to me. Ben, Davy Ray, Johnny, and I looked at each other as if we\u0027d walked into a nuthouse. \"Hannah Furd! Crooaaakk! Cricket in Rinsin!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a cracker!\" Miss Blue Glass yelled. \"Do you know what a cracker isi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll crack your head in a minute!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screaming and screeching went on. Over this tumult, the door chimes rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s that song, I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you!\" Miss Green Glass hollered. \"He goes insane every time you play it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crooaaakk! Draggin me packin! Hannah Furd! Hannah Furd!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and opened the front door in prelude to running out. a middle-aged man and a little girl eight or nine years old stood on the porch. I recognized the man. Mr. Eugene Osborne was the cook at the Bright Star Cafe. \"We\u0027re here for Winifred\u0027s piano less-\" he began, before the caterwauling started up again. \"Skulls and bones! Crooaaakk! Cricket in Rinsin!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in the world is that racketi\" Mr. Osborne asked, his hand on the little girl\u0027s shoulder. Her blue eyes were wide and puzzled. On Mr. Osborne\u0027s knuckles, I saw, were faded tattooed letters. a U.S. on the thumb, and on the following fingers a, R, M, and Y.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my parrot, Mr. Osborne.\" Miss Blue Glass came up and shoved me aside. She was mighty strong to be so thin. \"He\u0027s havin\u0027 a little trouble lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Green Glass emerged from the hallway, carrying a bird cage that contained the source of all that noise. It was a fairly large parrot, and it was fluttering at the bars and shaking like a tornado-spun leaf. \"Skulls and bones!\" it shrieked, showing a black tongue. \" Draggin me packin!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You give him a cracker!\" Miss Green Glass put the bird cage down on the piano bench, none too gently. \"I\u0027m not gettin\u0027 my fingers snapped off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fed yours all the time, and I sure risked my fingers!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not feedin\u0027 that thing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah Furd! Draggin me packin! Skulls and bones!\" The parrot was a bright turquoise blue, not a speck of any other color on him except for the yellow of his beak. He attacked the bars, blue feathers flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then get him to the bedroom!\" Miss Blue Glass said. \"Put the night cloth over him and settle him down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a slave! I\u0027m just a slave in my own home!\" Miss Green Glass wailed, but she picked up the bird cage by its handle again and left the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skulls and bones!\" the parrot shrieked in parting. \" Cricket in Rinsin!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea door closed, and the noise was thankfully muffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a little bitty problem,\" Miss Blue Glass said to Mr. Osborne with a nervous smile. \"He doesn\u0027t seem to like one of my favorite songs. Please come in, come in! Ben, that finishes your lesson for this evenin\u0027! Remember, now! Thinkin\u0027 cap on! Fingers flow like the waves!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" Then he said under his breath to me, \"Let\u0027s get outta here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started out, following Davy Ray. The parrot had quieted, perhaps calmed by its night cloth. and then I heard Mr. Osborne say, \"First time I ever heard a parrot curse in German.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Osbornei\" Miss Blue Glass lifted her penciled-on eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped at the door, and turned to listen. Johnny bumped into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Curse in German,\" Mr. Osborne repeated. \"Who taught him those wordsi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I... have no idea what you\u0027re talkin\u0027 about, I\u0027m sure!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a cook for the Big Red One in Europe. Got the chance to talk to a lot of prisoners, and believe me I know some foul words in German when I hear \u0027em. I just heard an earful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My... parrot said those thingsi\" Her smile flickered off and on. \"You\u0027re mistaken, of course!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go!\" Johnny told me. \"The carnival\u0027s waitin\u0027!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t just cursin\u0027, either,\" Mr. Osborne went on. \"There were other German words in there, but they were all garbled up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parrot is american,\" Miss Blue Glass informed him with an upward tilt of her chin. \"I have no earthly idea what you\u0027re talkin\u0027 about!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, okay, then.\" He shrugged. \"Don\u0027t matter none to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys! Will you close that door and stop lettin\u0027 all the heat outi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Cory!\" Davy Ray called, already astride his bike. \"We\u0027re late enough as it is!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea door opened in the back. Miss Green Glass said from the hallway, \"He\u0027s quiet now, thank the Lord! Just don\u0027t play that song again, whatever you do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve told you it\u0027s not that song, Katharina! I used to play it for him all the time and he loved it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he hates it now! Just don\u0027t play it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir squawking was beginning to remind me of two squabbling old parrots, one blue and one green. \"Close that door, if you please!\" Miss Blue Glass yelled at me, and Johnny gave me a shove onto the porch to uproot my feet. He closed the door behind us, but we could still hear the Glass sisters clamoring like buzz saws. I pitied that poor little Osborne girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those two are loony!\" Ben said as he got on his bike. \"Man, that was even worse than school!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must\u0027ve done somethin\u0027 to make your mom awful mad at you,\" was Davy Ray\u0027s opinion. \"Time\u0027s wastin\u0027!\" He gave a whoop and took off in the direction of the carnival, his bike\u0027s pedals flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lagged behind the others, though they kept yelling for me to catch up. German curse words, I was thinking. How come Miss Sonia Glass\u0027s parrot knew German curse wordsi as far as I knew, neither of the sisters spoke anything but Southern English. I hadn\u0027t realized Mr. Osborne was in the Big Red One. That, I knew from my reading, was a very famous infantry division. Mr. Osborne had really been there, on the same war-torn earth as Sgt. Rock! Wow, I thought. Neato!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how come the parrot knew German curse wordsi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the happy sounds of the carnival drifted to me along with the aromas of buttered popcorn and carameled apples. I left the German-cursing parrot behind, and sped up to catch my buddies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe paid our dollars at the admission gate and threw ourselves into the carnival like famished beggars at a feast. The strings of light bulbs gleamed over our heads like trapped stars. a lot of kids our age were there, along with their parents, and some older people and high school kids, too. around us the rides grunted, clattered, and rattled. We bought our tickets and got on the Ferris wheel, and I made the mistake of sitting with Davy Ray. When we got to the very top and the wheel paused to allow riders on the bottommost gondola, he grinned and started rocking us back and forth and yelling that the bolts were about to come loose. \"Stop it! Stop it!\" I pleaded, my body freezing solid to offset his elasticity. at that height, I could see all across the carnival. My gaze fell on a garish sign with crude green jungle fronds and the red, dripping words FROM THE LOST WORLD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paid Davy Ray back in the haunted house. When the warty-nosed witch jumped out of the darkness at our clanking railcar, I grabbed the back of his neck and wailed to shame the scratchy recorded gibberings of ghost and goblin. \"Quit it!\" he said after he\u0027d come down onto his seat again. Outside, he told me the haunted house was the dumbest thing he\u0027d ever seen in his life and it wasn\u0027t even a bit scary. But he sure was walking funny, and he hustled himself off to the row of portable toilets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stuffed our faces with cotton candy, buttered popcorn, and glazed miniature doughnuts. We ate candied apples covered with peanuts. We packed away corn dogs and drank enough root beer to make our bellies slosh. Then Ben wanted to ride the Scrambler, with results that were not pretty. We got him into one of the portable toilets, and luckily his aim was good and his clothes were spared a Technicolor splatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen passed on entering the tent that displayed the big, wrinkled one-eyed face. Davy Ray almost chewed his way through the canvas in his hurry to get in there, but Johnny and I went with him against our better judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the gloomy confines, a dour-looking man with a nose as large as a dill pickle held court before a half dozen other freak aficionados. He went on for a while about the sins of the flesh and the eye of the Lord. Then he drew back a small curtain and switched on a spotlight and there in a big glass bottle was a shriveled, pink and naked baby with two arms, two legs, and a Cyclops eye in the center of its domed forehead. I winced and Johnny shifted uncomfortably when the man picked up the formaldehyde-filled bottle, the Cyclops baby drifting in its dream. He started showing it to everybody up close. \"This is the sin of the flesh, and here\u0027s the eye of God as punishment for that sin,\" he said. I had the feeling he might get along famously with Reverend Blessett. When the man paused in front of me, I saw that the eye was golden, like Rocket\u0027s. The baby\u0027s face was so wrinkled it might have been that of a tiny old man, about to open his toothless mouth and call for a sip of white lightning to ease his aches. \"Notice, son, how the finger of God has wiped clean the means of sin,\" the man said, his baggy-drawered eyes glinting with a spark of evangelical fever. I saw what he meant: the baby had neither male nor female equipment. There was nothing but wrinkled pink skin down there. The man turned the bottle to show me the baby\u0027s back. The baby drifted against the glass, and I heard its shoulder make a soft wet noise of collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the Cyclops baby\u0027s shoulder blades. They were thick, bony protrusions. Like the stumps of wings, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand I knew. I really did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cyclops baby was somebody\u0027s angel, fallen to earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woe to the sinner,\" the man said as he moved on to Johnny and Davy Ray. \"Woe to the sinner, under the eye of God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ah, that was a gyp!\" Davy Ray ranted when we were outside on the midway again. \"I thought it was gonna be alive! I thought it could talk to you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t iti\" I asked him, and he looked at me like I was halfway around the bend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went to a show where motorcycle drivers raced around and around a caged-in cylinder, the engines screaming right in front of our faces and the tires gripping disaster\u0027s edge. Then we went to the Indian pony show, under a large tent where palefaces who wouldn\u0027t know Geronimo from Sitting Bull jumped around in loincloths and feathers and tried to spur some spirit into horses one hay bale away from the glue factory. The finale came when a wagon with cowboys on it circled the tent with the pseudo-Indians in pursuit, and the cowboys shot off their blanks and the white redmen hollered and ran for their lives. alabama history was never so boring, but at the end of the show Johnny gave a wan smile and said that one of the ponies, a little tawny thing with a swayed back, looked as if it really could gallop if it had half a field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time Davy Ray was freak-hungry again, so we accompanied him to see a rail-skinny red-haired woman who could make electric bulbs light up by holding them in her mouth. Next was the al Capone Death Car, the display of which showed bleeding bodies sprawled on a city sidewalk while leering gangsters raked the air with tommy-gun bullets. The actual car, which had a dummy behind the wheel and four dummies standing there gawking at it, was a piece of junk Mr. Sculley would\u0027ve scorned. We hung in with Davy Ray, as he worked up to speed. The Gator Boy, the Human Caterpillar, and the Giraffe-Necked Woman lured him from behind their canvas folds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then we rounded a corner, and we caught that smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a hint of it, drifting down at the bottom below the reeks of hamburger grease and doughnut fat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizardy, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben\u0027s messed his pants!\" Davy Ray said. He should talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did not!\" Ben ought to know by now not to invoke this vicious cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There it is,\" Johnny said, and right in front of me was the huge red LOST with THE and WORLD on either side of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trailer had steps that went up into a large, square boxcarlike opening. a dingy brown curtain was pulled across it. at the ticket booth, a man with greasy strands of dark hair combed flat across his bald skull was sitting on a stool, chewing on a toothpick and reading a Jughead comic book. His small, pale blue marbles of eyes flickered up and saw us, and he reached drowsily for a microphone. His voice rasped through a nearby speaker: \"Come one, come all! See the beast from the lost world! Come one, come...\" He lost interest in his spiel and returned to the cartoon balloons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stinks around here,\" Davy Ray said. \"Let\u0027s go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" I told him. \"Just a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOST filled up my vision. \"I might want to see what this is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t waste your money on this!\" Ben warned. \"It\u0027ll be a big snake or somethin\u0027!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it can\u0027t be any dumber than the Death Car!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to agree with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, there\u0027s a two-headed bull over yonder!\" Davy Ray pointed to the painted canvas. \"That\u0027s for me!\" He started walking off, and Ben took two steps with him but stopped when he realized Johnny and I weren\u0027t following. Davy Ray glanced back, scowled, and stopped, too. \"It\u0027ll be a gyp!\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I answered. \"But maybe it\u0027ll be-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething neat, I was about to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there came the sound of a massive body shifting its weight. The trailer groaned. Boom! went the noise of bulk hitting wood. The entire trailer shivered, and the man behind the ticket booth reached down at his side and picked up something. Then he started banging on the trailer with a baseball bat studded with nails. I could see where countless nail points had scarred the huge red T of LOST.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever was inside settled down. The trailer ceased its motions. The man put the baseball bat away, his face an expressionless blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa,\" Ben said quietly. \"Mighty big critter in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy curiosity was raging. The swampy smell seemed to be keeping customers away, but I had to know. I approached the ticket seller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Onei\" He didn\u0027t even look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is iti\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s from the lost world,\" he answered. Still he stared at the comic book. His face was gaunt, his cheeks and forehead pitted with acne scars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir, but what is iti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time he did look up. I almost had to step back, because simmering in his eyes was a fierce anger that reminded me of Branlin fury. \"If I told you that,\" he said, sucking noisily on his toothpick, \"then it wouldn\u0027t be no surprise, would iti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it... like... a freak or somethin\u0027i\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go in.\" He smiled coldly, showing little nubs of chewed-down teeth. \"Then you tell me what you saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cory! Come on!\" Davy Ray was standing behind me. \"This is a gyp, I said!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh it is, is iti\" The man slapped his comic book down. \"What do you know, kidi You don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 but this little blister of a town, do youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a gyp when I see it!\" He caught himself. \"Sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do youi Boy, you don\u0027t know your head from your ass! Get on out of here and quit botherin\u0027 me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sure will!\" Davy Ray nodded. \"You bet I will! Come on, Cory!\" He stalked off, but I stayed. Davy Ray saw I wasn\u0027t coming, and he made a noise like a fart and went over to a concession stand near the two-headed bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One,\" I told the man as I dug a quarter out of my jeans pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifty cents,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everythin\u0027 else is a quarter!\" Ben had come up beside me, with Johnny on my other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is fifty cents,\" the man repeated. \"Thing\u0027s gotta eat. Thing\u0027s always gotta eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid the money in front of him. He put the two quarters into a tin can that sounded all but empty, then he tore a ticket and gave me half. \"Go up through that curtain and wait for me. There\u0027s another curtain on the other side. Don\u0027t go through that one till I come up. Heari\" I said I did, and I climbed the steps. The lizardy, swampy odor was terrible, and under that was the sickly-sweet smell of rotting fruit. Before I reached that curtain, I was debating the wisdom of my curiosity. But I pushed through it, and I stood in near darkness. \"I\u0027ll go, too,\" I heard Johnny say behind me. Then I waited. I reached out and felt a rough burlap curtain between me and whatever else was in the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething rumbled, like a distant freight train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move on in some,\" the ticket man said, speaking to me as he came up the steps, herding Johnny and Ben. When he pushed the first curtain open, I saw he was holding the nail-studded baseball bat. I gave the other guys room to stand between the curtains. Ben pinched his nostrils shut and said, \"That smells sick!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likes ripe fruit,\" the man explained. \"Sometimes it goes over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this thingi\" Johnny asked. \"and what\u0027s the lost worldi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lost world is lost! Just like it says. What\u0027s lost is no more and can never be again. That get through your skulli\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of us liked his attitude. Johnny probably could\u0027ve punched his lights out. But Johnny said, \"Yes sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m comin\u0027 up!\" It was Davy Ray. \"Where\u0027s everybodyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man moved onto the stairs to block his way. \"Fifty cents or forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course this caused an outburst. I peered through the curtain to watch Davy Ray wrangle with the man. Davy Ray was chewing on a Zero candy bar, the white kind with chocolate nougat in the center. \"If you don\u0027t shut up,\" the man warned, \"I\u0027m gonna charge you seventy-five cents! Pay up or take a walk!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo quarters changed possession. Davy Ray squeezed in with us, and then the man entered muttering sourly. He said to me, \"You, boy! Go on through!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed aside the rough burlap. as I entered, the smell almost knocked me out. The guys filed in behind me, then Mr. attitude. Four oil lamps, hanging from ceiling hooks, afforded the only light and it was murky at best. In front of me was what appeared to be a big hogpen, enclosed by iron bars the thickness of pythons. Something lay in that pen that was so huge it made my legs go wobbly. I heard Ben gasp behind me. Johnny gave a low whistle. In the pen were piles of rotting, moldy fruit rinds. The fetid decay lay in a soup of greenish-brown mud and, to be delicate here, the mud was adorned with dozens of brown chunks as long as my father\u0027s arm and twice as thick. a dark cloud of flies whirled above the pen like a miniature tornado. The smell of all this at close range was bad enough to knock the stripes off a skunk. Little wonder Mr. attitude\u0027s tin can was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Step up there and take a look!\" he said. \"Go on, you paid for it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna puke!\" Ben wailed, and he had to turn and run out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ain\u0027t givin\u0027 no refunds!\" Mr. attitude hollered after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was the man\u0027s brawling voice. Maybe it was the way we all smelled to that thing in the pen. But suddenly it started heaving itself up from its mud bed, and the huge bulk just kept getting bigger as more of it shucked free from the liquidy mess. The thing gave a single snort that rumbled like a hundred bassoons. Then it lumbered over toward the far side of the trailer, its wet gray flesh glistening with mud and filth, a universe of flies crawling on its hide. With a shriek of shocks and stressed timbers, the entire trailer suddenly began tilting to that side, and all three of us yowled and hollered with the conviction of fear we\u0027d never felt in the haunted house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold still, you shithead!\" Mr. attitude stood up on a wooden platform. \"I said hold still \u0027fore you throw us over!\" He lifted that baseball bat and brought it savagely down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of that bat smacking flesh made my stomach lurch. I almost lost my carnival feast, but I clenched my teeth together. Mr. attitude kept hitting the beast: a second time, a third, and a fourth. The creature made no noise, but with the fourth blow it staggered away from the trailer\u0027s wall toward the center of the pen again and the trailer righted itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"and stay there, ya dumb shit!\" Mr. attitude yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"are you tryin\u0027 to kill it, misteri\" Davy Ray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sonofabitch don\u0027t feel no pain! He\u0027s got skin like fuckin\u0027 armor plate! Hey, don\u0027t you be tellin\u0027 me my business or I\u0027ll throw you outta here on your ass!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know if the creature could feel pain or not. all I knew was that I was looking at a big slab of wrinkled gray flesh with dots of blood welling up out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing was half the height of an elephant and about as big as our pickup truck. as the thick muscles of its haunches quivered, flies rose lazily into the air. In the murky lamp-light, as the creature stood motionless in its mudhole with its stumpy legs mired in rotten fruit rinds and its own excrement, I could see the stubs of three horns rising up from a neckplate of bone covered with leathery gray flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost fell down, but I feared what might be on that floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This here\u0027s an old thing,\" Mr. attitude said. \"You know how some turtles can live for two hundred, three hundred yearsi Well, this thing\u0027s so old he makes them turtles look like teenagers. Older\u0027n Methuselah\u0027s pecker,\" he said, and laughed as if this was funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you find himi\" I heard my voice ask, my mind too stunned to connect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bought him for seven hundred dollars, cash on the barrel. Fella had him on the circuit in Louisiana, down in Cajun land. Before that, guy out in Texas was showin\u0027 him. Before the Texan, fella in Montana trucked him around. I guess that was in the twenties. Yeah, he\u0027s been around some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavy Ray said, in a quiet and uneasy voice, \"He\u0027s bleedin\u0027.\" He held half of the Zero candy bar down at his side, his appetite vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, so whati Gotta smack him some to make him pay attention. Hell, he\u0027s got a brain \u0027bout the size of a walnut, anyhow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d he come fromi\" I asked. \"I mean... who found him firsti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a long time ago. I don\u0027t remember what that Cajun fucker told me. Somethin\u0027 about... some professor found him. Either in the amazon jungle or the Belgian Congo, I forget which. Up on some plateau nobody can get to or find again. His name was... Professor Chandler... no...\" He frowned. \"Callander... no, that ain\u0027t it.\" He snapped his fingers. \"Professor Challenger! He\u0027s the one found it and brung it back! Know what it isi It\u0027s a tri... a tri-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-ceratops,\" I finished for him. I knew my dinosaurs, and that\u0027s no lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, a tricereytopalis,\" Mr. attitude said. \"That\u0027s just what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody cut his horns off,\" Johnny said. He, too, had recognized it, and he walked past me and clamped his hands to the iron bars. \"Who cut his horns off, misteri\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, myself, and I. Had to. You shoulda seen them fuckers. Like spears they were. He kept bustin\u0027 through the trailer\u0027s walls with \u0027em. Tore right through sheet metal. My chain saw broke all to pieces \u0027fore I was even half through, had to use a fuckin\u0027 ax. He just laid there. That\u0027s what he does, just lays there and eats and shits.\" Mr. attitude kicked at a white-molded watermelon rind that had somehow been shoved out of the mudhole. \"Know how much it costs to keep that old fucker in fruit this time of yeari Man, that was the dumbest seven hundred dollars I ever spent!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavy Ray stepped up to the bars beside Johnny. \"How come he only eats fruiti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he can eat most anythin\u0027. Once carnival season\u0027s over, I feed him garbage and tree bark.\" Mr. attitude grinned. \"Fruit makes him smell better, y\u0027see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe triceratops\u0027s small black eyes slowly blinked. His massive head moved from one side to the other, searching for a thought. The pen was hardly large enough for him to turn around in. Then he exhaled a long breath and eased down into the mud again, and he stared at nothing with tendrils of blood creeping down his flank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"awful tight in there, ain\u0027t iti\" Davy Ray asked. \"I mean... don\u0027t you ever let him outi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no! How would I get him back in again, geniusi\" He leaned over the iron bars, which came to his waist when he was standing on the wooden platform. \"Hey, shithead!\" he yelled. \"Why don\u0027t you do somethin\u0027 to earn your fuckin\u0027 keepi Why don\u0027t you learn to balance a ball on your snout, or jump through a hoopi Thought I could fuckin\u0027 train you to do some tricks! How come you don\u0027t do nothin\u0027 but sit there lookin\u0027 stupidi\" Mr. attitude\u0027s face contorted, and its anger was ugly. \"Hey, I\u0027m talkin\u0027 to you!\" He smacked the beast\u0027s back with the baseball bat once and then again, the nails drawing blood. The triceratops\u0027s watery eyes closed in what might have been mute suffering. Mr. attitude lifted the bat for a third blow, his nubby teeth clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do that, mister,\" Davy Ray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand something in his voice meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bat paused in its descent. \"What\u0027d you say, boyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said... don\u0027t do that. Please,\" he added. \"It\u0027s not right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might not be right,\" Mr. attitude agreed, \"but it is fun.\" and he whacked the triceratops across the back a third time with all his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Davy Ray\u0027s hand clench as he mashed the remaining half of the Zero candy bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had enough,\" Johnny said. He turned away from the pen and walked past me and out of the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go, Davy Ray,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not right,\" Davy Ray repeated. Mr. attitude had stopped beating the beast, and the nails were slicked with red. \"Somethin\u0027 like this shouldn\u0027t be caged up in a mudhole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had your fifty cents\u0027 worth,\" the man said. He sounded drained, sweat glistening on his forehead. I guess it was hard work, whacking those nails in and pulling them out. The act of violence seemed to have sapped some of his anger. \"Go on home, country boys,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavy Ray didn\u0027t budge. His eyes reminded me of smoldering coals. \"Mister, don\u0027t you know what you\u0027ve goti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. One big fuckin\u0027 headache. You wanna buy himi Hell, I\u0027ll cut you a deal! Get your daddy to bring me five hundred dollars, I\u0027ll sure as shit unload him in your front yard and he can sleep in your fuckin\u0027 bed with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavy Ray was not suckered by this spiel. \"It\u0027s not right,\" he said, \"to hate somethin\u0027 just for bein\u0027 alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you knowi\" Mr. attitude sneered. \"You don\u0027t know shit about nothin\u0027, kid! You live twenty more years and see what I seen of this stinkin\u0027 world and then you come tell me what to do and what not to do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Davy Ray did a strange thing. He threw the mashed-up Zero candy bar into the mud right under the triceratops\u0027s beaky snout. It made a little plop as it went into the liquid. The triceratops just sat there, its eyes heavy-lidded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Don\u0027t you be throwin\u0027 nothin\u0027 in that pen, boy! Both of you just git!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on my way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a great gobbling sound and looked around to see the triceratops opening its mouth and scooping up the Zero and the surrounding mud like a living bulldozer. The beast chewed a few times and then he tilted his head back to let all the muck slide down his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on!\" Mr. attitude told us. \"I\u0027m shuttin\u0027 down for the-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trailer trembled. The triceratops was standing up, dripping like an ancient swamp oak. I swear his rust-colored tongue, which was as big as a dinner plate, emerged to lick his gray, mud-caked mouth. His head with its three hacked-off horn stumps tilted toward Davy Ray, and he began lumbering forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like watching a tank build up to speed. and then he lowered his head to collide with the iron bars, and the thick plate of bone made a noise like the popping together of two giants\u0027 football helmets. The triceratops stepped back three paces and with a snorting grunt he crashed his head against the iron bars again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Hey!\" Mr. attitude was yelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe triceratops shoved forward, his feet or paws or whatever they were sliding in the mud. His strength was awesome; muscles rippled beneath the elephantine flesh, and flies fled the quake. The iron bars groaned and began to bend outward, bolts making a squealing noise as they came loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, quit it! Quit!\" Mr. attitude started beating the triceratops again, and droplets of blood flew from the nails. The beast paid no attention, but kept bending the bars in his effort, I realized, to get to Davy Ray. \"You sonofabitch! You stupid old fucker!\" the man hollered as the baseball bat rose and fell. He looked at us, his eyes wild. \"Get out! You\u0027ve drivin\u0027 him crazy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed Davy Ray\u0027s arm and pulled at him. He came with me, and we heard more bolts breaking loose behind us. The trailer started rocking like a demonic cradle; the triceratops, it seemed to me, was throwing a fit. We got down the steps, and saw Johnny standing upwind while Ben-a perfect picture of misery-was sitting on an upturned soft-drink case with his face buried in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was tryin\u0027 to get out,\" Davy Ray said as we watched the trailer shake, rattle, and roll. \"Did you see thati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I did. He went crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bet he never had a candy bar before,\" he said. \"Not in his whole life. He likes Zeros as much as I do, huhi Boy, I\u0027ve got a whole boxful at home he\u0027d like to get into, I\u0027ll bet!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure the taste of a candy bar had done it, but I said, \"I think you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trailer\u0027s rocking subsided. In a few minutes Mr. attitude came out. His clothes and face were splattered with gobbets of mud and dookey. Both Davy Ray and I started shaking trying to hold in our belly laughs. Mr. attitude drew the curtain, pulled a door shut, and locked it with a chain and padlock. Then he looked at us and exploded. \"Get outta here, I said! Go on, before I-\" He came at us, waving the nail-studded baseball bat, and we let our laughter go and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carnival was closing for the night, the midway\u0027s crowd dwindling, the rides shutting down and the freak-show barkers hanging up their superlatives. The lights began to go off, one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked to where we\u0027d left our bikes. The air had gotten frosty. Winter was on the march.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen, his load somewhat lightened, had returned to the land of the living and was chattering happily. Johnny didn\u0027t say much, but he did mention how neat the motorcycle riders were. I said I could build a haunted house that would scare the pickles out of people, if I had a mind to. Davy Ray, however, said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil we got to our bikes. Then Davy Ray said, \"I wouldn\u0027t like to live that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What wayi\" Ben asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that pen. You know. Like the thing from the lost world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen shrugged. \"ahhhhh, he\u0027s probably used to it by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bein\u0027 used to somethin\u0027,\" Davy Ray answered, \"is not the same as likin\u0027 it. Numb nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, don\u0027t get mad at me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ain\u0027t mad at anybody.\" Davy Ray sat on his bike, his hands clenching the grips. \"It\u0027s just... I sure would hate to live that way. Could hardly move. Sure couldn\u0027t see the sun. and every day would be just like the day before, even if you lived a million days. I can\u0027t stand the thought of that. Can you, Coryi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be pretty awful,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That man\u0027ll kill it real soon, the way he\u0027s beatin\u0027 it. Then he can go dump it on a garbage pile and be done with it.\" Davy Ray looked up at the sickle moon, his breath white. \"Thing wasn\u0027t real, anyhow. That man was a low-down liar. It was a deformed rhinoceros, that\u0027s all it was. So, seei It was a gyp, like I told you.\" and he started pedaling away before I could argue with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was our visit to the Brandywine Carnival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly Saturday morning, sometime around three, the civil defense siren atop the courthouse began yowling. Dad got dressed so fast he put his underwear on backward, and he took the pickup to go find out what was happening. I thought the Russians were bombing us, myself. When Dad returned near four o\u0027clock, he told us what he\u0027d learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the carnival\u0027s attractions had escaped. Broken right out of its trailer and left it in kindling. The man who owned it had been sleeping in another trailer. I later heard Dad tell Mom it was a trailer occupied by a red-haired woman who did strange things with light bulbs. anyway, this thing had gotten loose and rampaged down the midway like a Patton tank, tearing through tents like they were heaps of autumn leaves. This thing had evidently run right down Merchants Street and smashed into several stores, then had turned a number of parked cars into Mr. Sculley\u0027s fodder. Had to have done ten thousand dollars\u0027 worth of damage, Dad said Mayor Swope had told him. and they hadn\u0027t caught the thing yet. It had gotten into the woods and headed for the hills while everybody was still jumping into their boots. Except Mr. Wynn Gillie had seen it when it had crashed its head through the bedroom wall of his house, and Mr. Gillie and his wife were now being treated for shock at the hospital in Union Town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast from the lost world was free, and the carnival left without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let it wait until Sunday evening. Then I called the Callan house from Johnny\u0027s, and we used the telephone in the back room while his folks were watching TV. Davy Ray\u0027s little brother andy answered. I asked to speak to Mr. Callan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you, Coryi\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was callin\u0027 for my dad,\" I told him. \"We\u0027re gonna be takin\u0027 Rebel\u0027s pen down this week, and we were wonderin\u0027 if you might have... oh, a chain cutter we could usei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027ll probably need wire cutters for that job. There\u0027s a difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s some chain needs to be cut, too,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then. No problem. I\u0027ll have Davy Ray bring it over tomorrow afternoon, if that\u0027ll suit you. You know, I bought that chain cutter a few years ago but I never use it. Down in the basement in a box somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Davy Ray\u0027ll probably know where it is,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. attitude had slinked away, most likely because a seven-hundred-dollar loss was cheaper than a ten-thousand-dollar vacation in jail. Many mighty hunters went out on the trail of the beast from the lost world, but they returned with dookey on their boots and their egos busted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a picture in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the park after the carnival has packed up and gone. It is clear again, except for a few scatters of sawdust, crushed Dixie cups, and ticket stubs the cleanup crew has left like a dog marking its territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this year the wind blows Zero wrappers before it, and they make a sound like giggling as they pass. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/boy-s-life/page-25.html","bookId":2471,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:00 PM"}
