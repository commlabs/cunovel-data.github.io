{"id":37741,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II. JOHN RECEIVES SOME PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;John Oakley had triumphed in his encounter with Ben Brayton, and rode off like a victor. Nevertheless he could not help feeling a little doubtful and anxious about the future. There was no doubt that Ben would complain to his mother, and as it was by her express permission that he had taken the horse, John felt apprehensive that there would be trouble between himself and his stepmother. I have already said, that, though a manly boy, he was not quarrelsome. He preferred to live on good terms with all, not excepting Ben and his mother, although he had no reason to like either of them. But he did not mean to be imposed upon, or to have his just rights encroached upon, if he could help it. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What should he do if Ben persevered in his claim and his mother supported him in it? He could not decide. He felt that he must be guided by circumstances. He could not help remembering how four years before Mrs. Brayton (for that was her name[23] then) answered his father\u0027s advertisement for a house-keeper; how, when he hesitated in his choice, she plead her poverty, and her urgent need of immediate employment; and how, influenced principally by this consideration, he took her in place of another to whom he had been more favorably inclined. How she should have obtained sufficient influence over his father\u0027s mind to induce him to make her his wife after the lapse of a year, John could not understand. He felt instinctively that she was artful and designing, but his own frank, open nature could hardly be expected to fathom hers. He remembered again, how, immediately after the marriage, Ben was sent for, and was at once advanced to a position in the household equal to his own. Ben was at first disposed to be polite, and even subservient to himself, but gradually, emboldened by his mother\u0027s encouragement, became more independent, and even at times defiant. It was not, however, until now that he had actually begun to encroach upon John\u0027s rights, and assume airs of superiority. He had been feeling his way, and waited until it would be safe to show out his real nature.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n John had never liked Ben,—nor had anybody else except his mother felt any attachment for him,—but he had not failed to treat him with perfect politeness and courtesy. Though he had plenty of intimations[24] from the servants and others that it was unjust to him that so much expense should be lavished upon Ben, he was of too generous a nature to feel disturbed by it, or to grudge him his share of his father\u0027s bounty.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s enough for both of us,\" he always said, to those who tried to stir up his jealousy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But suppose your father should divide his property between you? How would you like to see Ben Brayton sharing the estate?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If my father chooses to leave his property in that way, I shan\u0027t complain,\" said John. \"Fortunately there is enough for us both, and half will be enough to provide for me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But John had never anticipated such a contingency as Ben and his mother claiming the whole property, and, frank and unsuspicious as he was, he felt that his father would never have left him so entirely dependent upon his stepmother unless improper means had been used to influence his decision. There was a particular reason which he had for thinking thus. It was this: Three days before his father died, he was told by the servant, on entering the house, that the sick man wished to see him. Of course he went up instantly to the chamber where,[25] pale and wasted, Squire Oakley lay stretched out on the bed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was stricken by a disease which affected his speech, and prevented him from articulating anything except in a whisper. He beckoned John to the bedside, and signed for him to place his ear close to his mouth. John did so. His father made a great effort to speak, but all that John could make out was, \"My will.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your will, father?\" he repeated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sick man nodded, and tried to speak further. John thought he could distinguish the word \"drawer,\" but was not certain. He was about to inquire further, when his stepmother entered the room, and looked at him suspiciously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why have you come here to disturb your sick father?\" she asked, coldly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I did not come here to disturb him,\" said John. \"I came because he wished to speak to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Has he spoken to you?\" she asked, hastily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He tried to, but did not succeed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You should not allow him to make the effort. It can only do him harm. The doctor says he must be kept very quiet. You had better leave the room. He is safest in my care.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n John did leave the room, and though he saw his[26] father afterwards, it was always in his stepmother\u0027s presence, and he had no farther opportunity of communicating with him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He could not help thinking of this as he rode along, and wondering what it was that his father wished to say. He knew that it must be something of importance, from the evident anxiety which the dying man manifested to speak to him. But whatever it was must remain unknown. His father\u0027s lips were hushed in death, and with such a stepmother John felt himself worse than alone in the world. But he had a religious nature, and had been well trained in the Sunday school, and the thought came to him that whatever trials might be in store for him he had at least one Friend, higher than any earthly friend, to whom he might look for help and protection. Plunged in thought, he had suffered Prince to subside into a walk, when, all at once, he heard his name called.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hallo, John!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Looking up, he saw Sam Selwyn, son of Lawyer Selwyn, and a classmate of his at the academy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is that you, Sam?\" he said, halting his horse.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is my impression,\" said Sam, \"but I began to think it wasn\u0027t just now, when my best friend seemed to have forgotten me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [27]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I was thinking,\" said John, \"and didn\u0027t notice.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where are you bound?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nowhere in particular. I only came out for a ride.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re a lucky fellow, John.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You forget, Sam, the loss I have just met with;\" and John pointed to his black clothes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Excuse me, John, you know I sympathize with you in that. But I\u0027m very fond of riding, and never get any chance. You have a horse of your own.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just at present.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just at present! You\u0027re not going to lose him, are you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sam, I am expecting a little difficulty, and I shall feel better if I advise with some friend about it. You are my best friend in school, and I don\u0027t know but in the world, and I\u0027ve a great mind to tell you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll give you the best advice in my power, John, and won\u0027t charge anything for it either, which is more than my father would. You know he\u0027s a lawyer, and has to be mercenary. Not that I ought to blame him, for that\u0027s the way he finds us all in bread and butter.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll turn Prince up that lane and tie him, and then we\u0027ll lie down under a tree, and have a good talk.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [28]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n John did as proposed. Prince began to browse, apparently well contented with the arrangement, and the two boys stretched themselves out lazily beneath a wide-spreading chestnut-tree, which screened them from the sun.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now fire away,\" said Sam, \"and I\u0027ll concentrate all my intellect upon your case gratis.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I told you that Prince was mine for the present,\" commenced John. \"I don\u0027t know as I can say even that. This afternoon when I got home I found Ben Brayton just about to mount him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you gave him a piece of your mind.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I ordered him off,\" said John, quietly, \"when he informed me that the horse was his now,—that his mother had given it to him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did you say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That it was not hers to give. I seized the horse by the bridle, till he became alarmed and slid off. He then came at me with his riding-whip, and struck me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I didn\u0027t think he had pluck enough for that. I hope you gave him as good as he sent.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I pulled the whip away from him, and gave him two blows in return. Then watching my opportunity I sprang upon the horse, and here I am.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And that is the whole story?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [29]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And you want my advice?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I\u0027ll give it. Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, stick to that horse, and defy Ben Brayton to do his worst.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It seems to me I\u0027ve heard part of that speech before,\" said John, smiling. \"As to the advice, I\u0027ll follow it if I can. I\u0027m not afraid of anything Ben Brayton can do; but suppose his mother takes his part?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you think she will?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am afraid she will.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then defy her too,\" said Sam, hastily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" said John. \"I am only a boy of fifteen, and she is my father\u0027s widow. If she chooses to take the horse away, I don\u0027t know that I can do anything.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ben Brayton is a mean rascal. Didn\u0027t he get a gold watch at the same time that you got the horse?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; he might have had a horse too, but he preferred the watch and chain. They cost as much as Prince.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And now he wants the horse too?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So it seems.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s what I call hoggish. I only wish Ben[30] Brayton would come to school, and sit next to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What for?\" asked John, a little surprised at this remark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wouldn\u0027t I stick pins into him, that\u0027s all. I\u0027d make him yell like—a locomotive,\" said Sam, the simile being suggested by the sound of the in-coming train.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n John laughed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s an old trick of yours,\" he said, \"I remember you served me so once. And yet you profess to be my friend.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I didn\u0027t stick it in very far,\" said Sam, apologetically; \"it didn\u0027t hurt much, did it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Didn\u0027t it though?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I didn\u0027t mean to have it. Maybe I miscalculated the distance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s all right, if you don\u0027t try it again. And now about the advice.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wouldn\u0027t be imposed upon,\" said Sam. \"Between you and me I don\u0027t think much of your stepmother.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nor she of you,\" said John, slyly. \"I heard her say the other day that you were a disgrace to the neighborhood with your mischievous tricks.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is the \u0027most unkindest\u0027 cut of all,\" said Sam.[31] \"I\u0027d shed a few tears if I hadn\u0027t left my handkerchief at home. I have a great mind to tell you something,\" he added, more gravely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well?\" said John, inquiringly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s something that concerns you, only I happened to overhear it, which isn\u0027t quite fair and aboveboard, I know. Still I think I had better tell you. You know my father was your father\u0027s lawyer?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, he as well as everybody else was surprised at the will that left everything to your stepmother, only he had the best reason to be surprised. I was sitting out on our piazza when I heard him tell my mother that only three months ago your father came to his office, and had a will drawn up, leaving all the property to you, except the thirds which your stepmother was entitled to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Only three months ago?\" said John, thoughtfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And did he take away the will with him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; he thought at first of leaving it in my father\u0027s charge, but finally decided to keep it himself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What can have become of it? He must have destroyed it since.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [32]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My father doesn\u0027t think so,\" said Sam.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What does he think?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mind you don\u0027t say a word of what I tell you,\" said Sam, lowering his voice. \"He thinks that Mrs. Oakley has put it out of the way, in order to get hold of the whole property herself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can hardly think she would be so wicked,\" said John, shocked at the supposition.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Isn\u0027t it easier to believe that of her, than to believe that your father would deal so unjustly by you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I won\u0027t call it unjustly, even if he has really left her the whole property,\" said John. \"Still, I was surprised at being left out of the will. Besides,\" he added, with a sudden reflection, \"there\u0027s something that makes me think that the will you speak of is still in existence.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Sam.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In reply John gave the particulars of his father\u0027s attempt to communicate with him, and the few words he was able to make out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I understand it all now,\" said Sam, quickly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you\u0027re ahead of me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s plain as a pike-staff. Your father hid the will, fearing that your stepmother would get hold of it and destroy it. He wanted to tell you where it[33] was. Do you know of any secret drawer in your house?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n John shook his head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There must be one somewhere. Now, if you want my advice, I\u0027ll give it. Just hunt secretly for the drawer, wherever you think it may possibly be, and if you find it, and the will in it, just bring it round to my father, and he\u0027ll see that justice is done you. Come, I\u0027m not a lawyer\u0027s son for nothing. What do you say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder if you were right, Sam.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You may depend upon it I am. I\u0027m your lawyer, remember, and you are my client. I give advice on the \u0027no cure no pay\u0027 system. If it don\u0027t amount to anything I won\u0027t charge you a cent.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And if it does?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you get your property by my professional exertions, I trust to your generosity to reward me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right, Sam.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course you won\u0027t let your stepmother suspect what you\u0027re after. Otherwise she might get the start of you, and find it herself, and then much good it would do you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m glad to think it is still in existence, and that she hasn\u0027t destroyed it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She would if she could, you may depend on that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [34]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Sam, I\u0027m much obliged to you for your advice. I think I must be going now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, good-by, old fellow. Keep a stiff upper lip, and don\u0027t give up the ship—horsemanship, I mean. I must go round to the office, and see if father doesn\u0027t need a little professional assistance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n John leaped on Prince\u0027s back, and turned him in the direction of home. The revelation which Sam had made gave a new direction to his thoughts. If his father had really intended to give him a share of the estate, he felt that he ought to have it, and determined to institute a search as cautiously as possible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Driving into the yard he saw Ben sitting sullenly on the door-step. He eyed John with no very friendly glance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where\u0027ve you been?\" he demanded.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Up the road,\" said John, briefly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s the last time you\u0027ll ride my horse.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s not your horse.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ll find out whose horse it is,\" muttered Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t care about disputing with you,\" said John, quietly, turning towards the stable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My mother wishes to see you at once; do you hear?\" said Ben, unpleasantly. \"She\u0027s going to make you apologize to me for your impudence.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [35]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll go in and see her as soon as I have put the horse in the stable,\" John answered, quietly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hate that fellow,\" muttered Ben, following our hero with lowering eyes; \"he puts on too many airs altogether.
