But when I saw the worried looks on Mr. Tall\u0027s and Mr. Crepsley\u0027s faces and realized how uneasy they were, it put me on edge a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in, boys,\"Mr. Tiny welcomed us, as though it was his van and not Mr. Tall\u0027s. \"Sit down, make yourselves at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stand if that\u0027s okay,\"Evra said, trying not to let us hear the chatter of his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stand, too,\"I said, following Evra\u0027s lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish,\"Mr. Tiny said. He was the only one sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been hearing a lot about you, young Darren Shan,\"Mr. Tiny said. He was rolling something between his hands: a heart-shaped watch. I could hear it ticking whenever there was a pause in his speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re quite the boy, by all accounts,\"Mr. Tiny went on. \"A most remarkable young man. Sacrificed everything to save a friend. There aren\u0027t many who would do as much. People are so self-centered these days. It\u0027s good to see the world can still produce heroes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m no hero,\"I said, blushing at the compliment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you are,\"he insisted. \"What is a hero but a person who lays everything on the line for the good of somebody else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled proudly. I couldn\u0027t understand why Evra was so afraid of this nice, strange man. There was nothing terrible about Mr. Tiny. I kind of liked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Larten tells me you\u0027re reluctant to drink human blood,\"Mr. Tiny continued. \"I don\u0027t blame you. Nasty, repulsive stuff. Can\u0027t stand it. Apart from young children, of course. Their blood is scrump-dilly-icious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"You can\u0027t drink blood from them,\"I said. \"They\u0027re too small. If you took blood from a young child, you\u0027d kill it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened and so did his smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So ?\"he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill ran down my spine. If he had been joking, it would have been in really poor taste, but I could have overlooked it (hadn\u0027t I just been laughing about poor Bradley Stretch?). But I could tell from his expression that he was totally serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden I knew why this man was so feared. He was evil. Not just bad or nasty, but pure demonic evil. This was a man I could imagine killing thousands of people just to hear them scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\"Mr. Tiny said, \"your face seems familiar. Have we met before, Darren Shan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you certain?\"he asked. \"You look very familiar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... would have... remembered,\"I stuttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t always trust memory.\"Mr. Tiny smiled. \"It can be a deceptive monster. Still, no matter. Maybe I\u0027m confusing you with someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the way his lips twisted into a grin (how did I ever think that was a nice smile?), I could see he didn\u0027t think that. But I was sure he was wrong. There\u0027s no way I would have forgotten meeting a creature like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down to business,\"Mr. Tiny said. His hands tightened on the heart-shaped watch and for a second they seemed to glow and melt into its ticking face. I blinked and rubbed my eyes. When I looked again, the illusion - which it must have been - was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You boys saw me arrive with my Little People,\"Mr. Tiny said. \"They\u0027re new converts to my cause and are a little unsure of the ropes. Normally I\u0027d stick around and teach them how to work, but I have business elsewhere. Still, they\u0027re smart and I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"However, while they\u0027re learning, I\u0027d like it if you two fine, young men would help ease them into the swing of things. You won\u0027t have to do much. Mainly I want you to find food for them. They have such big appetites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about it, boys? I\u0027ve got the permission of your guardians.\"He nodded at Mr. Tall and Mr. Crepsley, who didn\u0027t seem happy about the arrangement, but looked resigned. \"Will you help poor old Mr. Tiny and his Little People?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Evra. I could see he didn\u0027t want to do it, but he nodded his head anyway. I did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent!\"Mr. Tiny boomed. \"Young Evra Von knows what my darlings like, I\u0027m sure. If you have any problems, report to Hibernius and he\u0027ll help you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Tiny waved a hand to let us know we could leave. Evra began edging backward immediately, but I held my ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\"I said, summoning all my courage, \"but why do you call them Little People?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Tiny turned around slowly. If he was surprised by my question, he didn\u0027t show it, though I could see the mouths of Mr. Tall and Mr. Crepsley dropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re little,\"he explained calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that,\"I said. \"But don\u0027t they have another name? An official name? If somebody mentioned \u0027Little People\u0027 to me, I\u0027d think they were talking about elves or leprechauns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Tiny smiled. \"They are elves and leprechauns,\"he said. \"All around the world, you will find legends and stories of small, magical people. Legends have to start somewhere. These legends started with my short, loyal friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you telling me those dwarfs in blue capes are elves ?\"I asked disbelievingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"he said. \"Elves don\u0027t exist. Those dwarfs - as you so rudely put it - were seen, long ago, by ignorant people, who invented names for them: elves or fairies or sprites. They made up stories about what they were and what they could do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can they do?\"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Tiny\u0027s smile slipped. \"I heard you were quite the one for asking questions,\"he growled, \"but nobody told me you were this nosy. Remember, Darren Shan: Curiosity killed the cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a cat,\"I said boldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Tiny leaned forward, and his face darkened. \"If you ask more questions,\"he hissed, \"you might find yourself turned into one. Nothing in life is forever, not even the human form.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe watch in his hands glowed again, red like a real heart, and I decided it was time to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to bed now and get a good night\u0027s sleep,\"Mr. Crepsley told me before I left. \"There will be no lessons tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And rise early, boys,\"Mr. Tiny added, waving goodbye. \"My Little People are always hungry in the mornings. It\u0027s not wise to let their hunger go unattended. You never know what they might set their minds - and teeth - on if they go unfed for too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hurried out the door and raced back to our tent, where we fell to the floor and listened to our hearts beating loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy?\"Evra asked when he could speak. \"Talking to Mr. Tiny like that, asking him questions, you must be out of your mind!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\"I said, thinking back on the encounter, wondering where I\u0027d gotten the nerve from. \"I must be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra shook his head in disgust. It was early, but we crawled into bed anyway. We lay awake for hours, Staring at the ceiling of the tent. When I finally fell asleep I dreamed of Mr. Tiny and his heart-shaped watch. Only, in my dreams, it wasn\u0027t a watch. It was a real human heart. Mine. And when he squeezed it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgony. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-14.html","bookId":2438,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:57 PM"}
