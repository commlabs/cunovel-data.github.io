It deserves pie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, “Do you have an inner filter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA devious smile crossed his lips, “Nope.” He took the first bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug in where he’d taken his bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coconut-cream pie melted in my mouth. Even with my lips covered in whipped cream and my mouth full, I spoke, “Is that real whipped cream?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly, “From this seedy, little place in the industrial section. I was going to bring you there, ‘cause I heard about the pie, but when I got there, I knew you wouldn’t eat there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, “I’m not a snob.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his eyes, “I know. You’re a princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a second bite, “You’re a princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and ate a huge bite, “Ohhhhh my God.” He licked his lips and I looked back at the pie. Some things were safer not to watch. I hadn’t been to a show, since the first one. That was also better not to watch. Seeing him so alive made me hot. I clearly had issues with sexy boys and self-control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched an eyebrow, “So I Googled you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted, “‘Bout time.” I loved the sarcasm in his voice; he could really care less about the fame, when it was just the two of us. It was part of the show for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip and then went for it, “I saw the articles about you getting kicked off the show.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis bright-blue eyes lifted to mine but his look turned stern like his tone, “Drop it.” The tone wasn’t playful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made me smile nervously, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a stern look, “You wanna talk about your ex-boyfriends some more?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, the humor left me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed his fork, “This topic is like that for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another bite, “Fair enough.” I ate the bite but I couldn’t do it. I didn’t feel like eating anymore. I dropped my fork, “Thanks for the pie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my hand, “Don’t be mad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up into his eyes, “Your expressions are so weird sometimes. You can darken your face, I swear it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, “Your brother coming still?” He was always ignoring the things he didn’t want to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped back and stopped staring at his face, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and forgot about the forbidden conversations, “Yeah. Tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, “Maybe. He’s a hot mess. He’s really artistic and messy, and one minute he has a job, and then he doesn’t. My parents go insane with him. You guys will for sure hit it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized what I’d said when he gave me his blank stare. I laughed, “I’m on a roll today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “I gotta go rehearse, try not to get into trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuck my tongue out at him and pulled my headphones back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night I was studying when he came in late. I looked up smiling and focused on our friend zone, “How was the show?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down next to me on the couch, “It was great. I heard afterward, some big wig was coming to see us play. We might have competing offers. I frowned, “What? Congrat…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a finger up to my lips, “Shhh. Not yet. Nothing to get excited about yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis finger stayed there for a minute and then ran down my jaw. He leaned forward and lightly brushed his lips against mine. He pulled back. There was something in his eyes, “Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “Don’t be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arched an eyebrow, like he was questioning the fact I’d given him permission. He leaned in again, lightly brushing his lips on mine. “God damned you are sweet,” he whispered into my mouth and got up from the couch. I sat there frozen for a few minutes, still tasting the kiss that wasn’t nearly awkward enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day he drove me to the airport to pick up Danny. We didn’t talk about the kiss. He was fun and playful. He cranked the car stereo and sang as loud as he could. We pulled up at a light and some girls looked over at him and started screaming. He waved at them and sang louder. I tried to only hear the radio but it was impossible. It was an amazing performance for a car ride. He beamed at me from behind his sunglasses and messy hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost ran when we got to the airport. I needed to be away from him. When I looked back at him, I smiled at the fact he was still wearing his sunglasses. His fame situation wasn’t getting better. He stood, looking like Lochlan Barlow, but in sunglasses. He needed the Mitch Pitt beard and homeless apparel. Girls pointed and swooned. I nudged him, “You’re not fun to take out of the house anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me his one-sided grin, “You’ve never been fun to take out of the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “Ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny came walking down the ramp. He looked the same, thick and handsome but disheveled. His dark-blonde hair was cut into the same fohawk as Lochlan’s. It even hung in the back, almost like a mullet. His jeans were tight and his tee shirt was wrinkled. He stopped, grinning and shaking his head. His bright-green eyes twinkled, the way they always did. He was the most joyous person I knew, “Lochlan Barlow is your roommate?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked between them, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny put his hand out for Lochlan. They shook hands. I sighed, “Danny—Lochlan. Let’s go before we get mobbed, like we have one of the Beatles with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny wrapped a thick arm around me, “You have better than the Beatles, dude. Only you would fail to mention, you were shacked up with a celebrity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a look, “There’s no shacking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan chuckled, “She didn’t know who I was for like weeks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny sighed, “I’m ashamed of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth hung open, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “You are shamed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, “Whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan laughed and nodded at Danny, “You should come to the bar tonight. We’re playing at the nice one. Our Fridays are the best bar we play.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny gave me a look. I agreed, dreading the words about to leave my lips, “Yeah.” Shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nattered at each other about music and dudes. I didn’t know anything they were talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked behind them, stunned by the instant bromance going on. Lochlan seemed more into my brother, than Danny was to him. That lasted until Lochlan went to the bedroom to get something when we got home, and Danny started silent screaming and mouthing things. I didn’t know what he was going on about, but I had to assume it was like a little girl seeing Justin Bieber for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and drank from the orange juice carton. When Lochlan came back around the corner with a tee shirt for him, Danny played it cool again. I snorted at the two of them. Lochlan gave me a look and walked into the kitchen. He took the carton from my hands and drank the rest. I tried not to watch him drink, or eat, or sing, so I went to the couch and read a book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey flirted and chatted for hours. It was sort of good. I read and did my homework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe romance novels were making my attraction for him worse, so I grabbed the newest James Rollins, instead of romance. I finished it off in the tub and got out to get ready. I didn’t bother straightening my hair. A bar in the humidity of early fall in Boston was a death trap for straight hair. I hadn’t worn it curly since the night we’d made fools of ourselves. I looked at myself and smiled. Barely there makeup, a plain blue tee shirt and a pair of linen pants. I looked like I was trying to be casual. He wouldn’t even notice me compared to the girls in the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked into the kitchen to find them eating Chinese food and listening to some old song. Danny pointed, “You hear the break? So classic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting annoyed, Danny had barely spoken to me. I walked behind the island to see Lochlan filling a plate and listening to the song. He passed me the plate and a fork. I scowled, “I don’t like it when you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a hand up, silencing me. Danny shushed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, chuckling and leaned against the counter, “Screw you both.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ignored me. The song ended. Lochlan smiled, “You know what, you’re totally right. The way he gave the pause after the break was dramatic. I felt my heartbeat pause, waiting for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny pointed, “I know, right.” He gave me a look, “How was the tub?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped him off, taking a huge bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward, kissing the top of my head, “I missed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan looked at his fat leather watch that looked like more of a cuff than a watch, “I gotta go. Come at ten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, looking as disinterested as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed me a grin and walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny waited for the door to close and then the girlfriend gushing started, “Oh man. He’s so cool. You’re rooming with him? He’s like rich. He doesn’t even need a roommate… you fucking him and not telling me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked on my noodles, coughing. He grabbed me a drink of water and passed it to me. I coughed again, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked confused, “Why’s he rooming with you? Didn’t they ever find you guys another place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “I don’t know. We just agreed this was better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “Oh man, please don’t blow this. I always wanted a rock star brother and a brother-in-law is just as good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sickened expression covered my face, “Dude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me the puppy dog look, “Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneered, “You’re a psycho. This isn’t a third world country. You can’t just give me away to the guy you like the best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe folded his arms, “I’ll call Dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked, “He’s a huge Lochlan fan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, “Great. Please don’t tell him. I don’t want him to come here and embarrass me too.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/my-side/page-12.html","bookId":2792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM"}
