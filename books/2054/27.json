{"id":110166,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Casey\u0027s out sick,\" Paige told me briskly, putting on her coat. \"So you\u0027ll probably have to cover for her on the registers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no problem.\" I leaned against her office wall. \"Keeps things interesting, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePausing, she gave me a brief smile. \"I really appreciate you coming in like this - on such short notice.\" She patted her stomach absentmindedly. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s nothing, but I\u0027ve had this pain all day - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s fine. Go. You have to take care of yourself. You have to take care of both of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at me again, picking up her purse and walking to the door. \"Doug\u0027s skulking around here somewhere if you need help, so make him do it. Hmm... there was one other thing I needed to tell you... Oh yeah - there\u0027s something for you in your office. I left it on your chair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButterflies shot through my stomach at her words. \"W-what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to see. I\u0027ve got to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Paige out of her office and turned uncertainly into my own. The last thing left on my chair had been an envelope from Roman, one more piece in his twisted game of love and hate. Oh God, I thought. I knew it wouldn\u0027t be as easy as Carter had said. Roman\u0027s back, starting it all up again, waiting for me to\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared, swallowing a gasp. The Glasgow Pact sat on my chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGingerly, I picked up the book, handling it like fine china. It was my copy, the one I had given Seth to sign over a month ago. I\u0027d forgotten all about it. Opening up the inside cover, I saw lavender rose petals fall out. There were only a handful of them, but they were more precious to me than any of the bouquets I\u0027d received this month. Trying to catch them, I read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Thetis,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong overdue, I know, but very often the things we most desire come only after much patience and struggle. That is a human truth, I think. Even Peleus knew that.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- Seth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s back, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" I looked up from the baffling inscription to see Doug leaning against the doorframe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded toward my book. \"Mortensen. He\u0027s up in the cafe again, typing away as usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed the book, holding it tightly with both hands. \"Doug... are you up on your Greek mythology?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"Don\u0027t insult me, Kincaid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Thetisand Peleus... they were Achilles\u0027 parents, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed they were,\" he told me, smug with the confidence of his area of expertise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor my part, I was simply puzzled. I didn\u0027t really get the inscription or understand why Seth would reference the Trojan War\u0027s greatest warrior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know the rest?\" Doug asked me expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? That Achilles was a dysfunctional psychopath? Yeah, I know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah, everyone knows that. I mean the really cool part. About Thetis and Peleus.\" I shook my head, and he continued, professor-like, \" Thetiswas a sea nymph, and Peleus was a mortal who loved her. Only, when he went to woo her, she was a real bitch about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was a shape-shifter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly dropped the book. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug nodded. \"He approached her, and she turned into all sorts of shit to scare him off - wild animals, forces of nature, monsters, whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What...what\u0027d he do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He held on. Grabbed her and wouldn\u0027t let go through all of those terrible transformations. No matter what she turned into, he just held on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what?\" I could barely hear my own voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She finally turned back into a woman and stayed a woman. Then they got married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had stopped breathing somewhere around the word \"shape-shifter.\" Still clutching the book, I stared off into space, a great winged feeling swelling in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all right, Kincaid? Christ, you\u0027ve been weird lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, tuning back in to reality. The feeling in my chest burst out, launching into glorious flight. I started breathing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Sorry. I\u0027ve just had a lot on my mind.\" Forcing levity, I added, \"I\u0027ll do my best not to be too weird from now on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug looked relieved. \"Coming from you, that might be a long shot, but here\u0027s to hoping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I agreed, smiling. \"Here\u0027s to hoping.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-blues-georgina-kincaid-1/page-27.html","bookId":2054,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:16 PM"}
