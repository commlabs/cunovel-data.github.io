She doesn\u0027t see any pink faces lurking up here in the infrared, it ought to be safe. But there are a couple behind her, just ambling along pleasantly, not looking directly at her, like they just decided it was time to go for a stroll in the woods in the middle of the night. One of them is the High Priest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe woman\u0027s probably in her mid-twenties, she\u0027s a tall gangly type, nice- but not good-looking, probably was a spunky but low-scoring forward on her high school basketball team. Y.T. sits her down on a rock out in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea where you are?\" Y.T. says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"In the park,\" the woman says, \"with my friends. We\u0027re helping to spread the Word.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you get here?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"From the Enterprise. That\u0027s where we go to learn things.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, like, the Raft? The Enterprise Raft? Is that where you guys all came from?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know where we came from,\" the woman says. \"Sometimes it\u0027s hard to remember stuff. But that\u0027s not important.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you before? You didn\u0027t grow up on the Raft, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a systems programmer for 3verse Systems in Mountain View, California,\" the woman says, suddenly whipping off a string of perfect, normal-sounding English.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how did you get to be on the Raft?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. My old life stopped. My new life started. Now I\u0027m here.\" Back to baby talk.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the last thing you remember before your old life stopped?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I was working late. My computer was having problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it? That\u0027s the last normal thing that happened to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"My system crashed,\" she said. \"I saw static. And then I became very sick. I went to the hospital. And there in the hospital, I met a man who explained everything to me. He explained that I had been washed in the blood. That I belonged to the Word now. And suddenly it all made sense. And then I decided to go to the Raft.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You decided, or someone decided for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to. That\u0027s where we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else was on the Raft with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"More people like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you how?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All programmers. Like me. Who had seen the Word.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Seen it on their computers?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Or sometimes on TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do on the Raft?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe woman pushes up one sleeve of her raggedy sweatshirt to expose a needle-pocked arm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You took drugs?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We gave blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"They sucked your blood out?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Sometimes we would do a little coding. But only some of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been here?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. They move us here when our veins don\u0027t work anymore. We just do things to help spread the Word -- drag stuff around, make barricades. But we don\u0027t really spend much time working. Most of the time we sing songs, pray, and tell other people about the Word.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to leave? I can get you out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" the woman says, \"I\u0027ve never been so happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you say that? You were a big-time hacker. Now you\u0027re kind of a dip, if I may speak frankly.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay, it doesn\u0027t hurt my feelings. I wasn\u0027t really happy when I was a hacker. I never thought about the important things. God. Heaven. The things of the spirit. It\u0027s hard to think about those things in America. You just put them aside. But those are really the important things -- not programming computers or making money. Now, that\u0027s all I think about.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eY.T. has been keeping an eye on the High Priest and his buddy. They keep moving closer, one step at a time. Now they\u0027re close enough that Y.T. can smell their dinner. The woman puts her hand on Y.T.\u0027s shoulder pad.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to stay here with me. Won\u0027t you come down and have some refreshments? You must be thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotta run,\" Y.T. says, standing up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I really have to object to that,\" the High Priest says, stepping forward. He doesn\u0027t say it angrily. Now he\u0027s trying to be like Y.T.\u0027s dad. \"That\u0027s not really the right decision for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you, a role model?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay. You don\u0027t have to agree. But let\u0027s go down and sit by the campfire and talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just get the fuck away from Y.T. before she goes into a self-defense mode,\" Y.T. says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll three Falabalas step back away from her. Very cooperative. The High Priest is holding up his hands, placating her. \"I\u0027m sorry if we made you feel threatened,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys just come on a little weird,\" Y.T. says, flipping her goggles back onto infrared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the infrared, she can see that the third Falabala, the one who came up here with the High Priest, is holding a small thing in one hand that is unusually warm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe nails him with her penlight, spotlighting his upper body in a narrow yellow beam. Most of him is dirty and dun colored and reflects little light. But there is a brilliant glossy red thing, a shaft of ruby.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a hypodermic needle. It\u0027s full of red fluid. Under infrared, it shows up warm. It\u0027s fresh blood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd she doesn\u0027t exactly get it -- why these guys would be walking around with a syringe full of fresh blood. But she\u0027s seen enough.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Liquid Knuckles shoots out of the can in a long narrow neon-green stream, and when it nails the needle man in the face, he jerks his head back like he\u0027s just been axed across the bridge of the nose and falls back without making a sound. Then she gives the High Priest a shot of it for good measure. The woman just stands there, totally, like, appalled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/725.html","bookId":314,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM"}
