One had been refitted with solid silver restraints to hold the vampire, restraints far stronger than the ones Anthony had once used. As much as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe loved Anthony, she didn\u0027t intend to underestimate DeLongpre\u0027s strength the way her beloved had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had bought a portable crib to hold the infant until she needed it, prepared a second table with leather restraints to hold DeLongpre\u0027s daughter, and obtained the necessary equipment to draw blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had considered many ways to wreak vengeance against Roshan DeLongpre, but using DeLongpre\u0027s blood and that of his daughter to resurrect her beloved was far superior to any of the others. Letting Anthony destroy DeLongpre once and for all would be the coup de grace. As for DeLongpre\u0027s daughter, once Serafina was through with her, Anton could decide whether the chit should live or die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though she had kept all of Anthony\u0027s old shoes and clothes, Serafina had bought him a whole new wardrobe, including underwear, socks, and handkerchiefs. He had always been a little vain, and she didn\u0027t want him to appear in public in clothes that had been out of style for over twenty years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had purchased his favorite blend of coffee, as well as his favorite wine and whiskey. When the day for his return grew closer, she would stock her pantry with his favorite foods. She made a mental note to pick up a bottle of his favorite cologne, a new toothbrush, a new wallet, a new comb, and a razor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, thinking how wonderful it had been to shop for him, to fill her dresser drawers with his things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had bought new sheets and pillows for her bed, wanting everything to be perfect for their new life together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran her hand over the metal table. If only there was a way to test the spell before she tried it on her beloved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only she could make the days and hours pass more quickly!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only her beloved were there beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon.\" The word had become her mantra. \"Soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-27.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
