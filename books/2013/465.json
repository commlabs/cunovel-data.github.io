You understand me? Don’t you pity him!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler shook his head. ‘I-I won’t, Quick. Not for a moment. Let him scream, for all eternity. Let him scream.’ A grim nod, then Quick Ben pushed him back. Hedge wept over the Tiste Edur, wept like a man for whom all light in the world has been lost, and would never return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Fiddler did not know what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching from an unseen place, the Errant stepped back, pulled away as if he would hurl himself from a cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was what he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tipper of balances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, this day-may the Abyss devour him whole-a maker of widows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAscending the beach’s gentle slope, Karsa Orlong halted. He reached down to the sword impaling his leg, and closed a hand about the blade itself, just above the hilt. Unmindful of how the notched edges sliced into his flesh, he dragged the weapon free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood bloomed from the puncture wounds, but only for a moment. The leg was growing numb, but he would have use of it for a while yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill holding the cursed sword by its blade, he pushed himself forward, limped onto the sward. And saw, a short distance to his right, a small hut from which smoke gusted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Toblakai warrior headed over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing opposite it, he dropped the iron sword, took another step closer, bent down and pushed one hand under the edge of the hut. With an upward heave, he lifted the entire structure clear, sent it toppling onto its back like an upended turtle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoke billowed, caught the breeze, and was swept away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore him, seated cross-legged, was an ancient, bent and broken creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man. A god.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho looked up with narrowed eyes filled with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen those eyes shifted, to behind Karsa, and the warrior turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spirit of the Emperor had arrived, he saw. Young-younger than Karsa had imagined Rhulad Sengar to be-and, with his clear, unmarred flesh, a man not unhandsome. Lying on the ground as if in gentle sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his eyes snapped open and he shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short-lived try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad pushed himself onto his side, up onto his hands and knees-and saw, lying close by, his sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Take it!’ the Crippled God cried. ‘My dear young champion, Rhulad Sengar of the Tiste Edur. Take up your sword!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do not,’ Karsa said. ‘Your spirit is here-it is all you have, all you are. When I kill it, oblivion will take you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Look at his leg! He is almost as crippled as I am! Take the sword, Rhulad, and cut him down!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Rhulad still hesitated, there on his hands and knees, his breaths coming in rapid gasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crippled God wheezed, coughed, then said in a low, crooning voice, ‘You can return, Rhulad. To your world. You can make it right. This time, you can make everything right. Listen to me, Rhulad. Trull is alive! Your brother, he is alive, and he walks to the Eternal Domicile! He walks to find you! Kill this Toblakai and you can return to him, you can say all that needs to be said!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Rhulad Sengar, you can ask his forgiveness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that the Tiste Edur’s head lifted. Eyes suddenly alight, making him look… so young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Karsa Orlong felt, in his heart, a moment of regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad Sengar reached for the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the flint sword swung down, decapitating him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head rolled, settled atop the sword. The body pitched sideways, legs kicking spasmodically, then growing still as blood poured from the open neck. In a moment, that blood slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Karsa, the Crippled God hacked laughter, then said, ‘I have waited a long time for you, Karsa Orlong. I have worked so hard… to bring you to this sword. For it is yours, Toblakai. No other can wield it as you can. No other can withstand its curse, can remain sane, can remain its master. This weapon, my Chosen One, is for you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa Orlong faced the Crippled God. ‘No-one chooses me. I do not give anyone that right. I am Karsa Orlong of the Teblor. All choices belong to me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then choose, my friend. Fling away that pathetic thing of stone you carry. Choose the weapon made for you above all others.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa bared his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crippled God’s eyes widened briefly, then he leaned forward, over his brazier of smouldering coals. ‘With the sword, Karsa Orlong, you will be immortal.’ He waved a gnarled hand and a gate blistered open a few paces away. ‘There. Go back to your homeland, Karsa. Proclaim your-self Emperor of the Teblor. Guide your people for ever more. Oh, they are sorely beset. Only you can save them, Karsa Orlong. And with the sword, none can stand before you. You will save them, you will lead them to domination-a campaign of slaughtered “children” such as the world has never seen before. Give answer, Toblakai! Give answer to all the wrongs you and your people have suffered! Let the children witness!’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-465.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
