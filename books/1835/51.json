He’s going to be okay,” he said again. “You know Noah. He’s as tough as nails.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant sagged against Nick and put her head down on his shoulder. Her hand was in his lap and he was holding tight. She hurt everywhere. She couldn’t make up her mind which was worse, her head, her arm, or her leg. Every inch of her body seemed to be throbbing in pain. She wanted to rest, but when she closed her eyes, the room began to spin, and that made her queasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where the hell is the doctor?” Nick demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They just paged him,” Tommy said. He went to his sister and gently brushed her hair away from her face. “You’re going to be all right.” He tried to sound certain, confident, but it came out all wrong, and it sounded like he was asking her a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’ll be fine. I’m just tired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you tell me what happened? You were right behind me when I carried Noah outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was there, and he called to me. He asked me to help him. I think he told me he’d been shot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who called to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Justin Brady,” she answered. “Only he wasn’t really Justin.” She looked up at Nick. “I started to go to him, but then all of a sudden I could hear your voice in my head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was I saying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t believe anything anyone tells you. I knew something wasn’t right about him, and then I saw the glove on his hand. It was a surgical glove, I think.” She looked at Tommy when she added, “I tried to run, but he came after me, and the next thing I remember was waking up inside the van. He took all the door handles off, and I couldn’t get out. Tommy, he showed me a photo of his wife. It was at the picnic, and he showed me a photo. He must have stolen it from someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s talk about this later,” Tommy suggested when he saw how upset she was. “Don’t think about it now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tommy, go hurry up the damned doctor,” Nick barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe physician, a cranky, middle-aged man named Benchley, pulled the curtain back just as Tommy was leaving to go search for him. The doctor took one look at Laurant and then ordered Nick and Tommy to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the bedside manner of a Doberman. Shouting for a nurse to assist him, he glared at Nick when he didn’t move from the table, and once again he demanded that he get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick refused to leave Laurant’s side. He wasn’t diplomatic in his refusal either. Fear made him hostile and belligerent, but he didn’t realize he was up against someone just as belligerent. Dr. Benchley had worked in Los Angeles for over twelve years in a rough inner-city emergency room. He had seen and heard it all. Nothing intimidated him, not even an armed FBI agent with a crazed look in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy stepped in and dragged Nick out of the cubicle before he lost his temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let him examine her,” he said. “He’s a good doctor. Come and sit down in the waiting room. If you sit near the door you can see the curtain from there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, all right,” Nick said, but he couldn’t sit down. He paced instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you go upstairs and wait,” Nick suggested. “Have the nurse page me when Noah comes out of surgery. I want to talk to the doctor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go up in a minute,” Tommy said. “But I want to stay here until Benchley finishes with Laurant. She’s gonna be okay,” he added, more of an assurance for Nick. “She looks bad, but she’ll be all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if she isn’t? Tommy, I damn near got her killed. He had her. The bastard had her pinned up against him with a knife at her throat. I’ve never been so scared in my life. One second. That’s all it would have taken to cut an artery. And it’s all my fault. I should have known.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Known what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick didn’t immediately answer. He was reliving those terrifying moments when he’d crept out onto the balcony and had seen Laurant down below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should have figured it out before he had a chance to grab her. And he never should have gotten that chance. Because of my incompetence, Laurant almost lost her life, and Noah got hit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy had never seen Nick so shaken. “Stop beating yourself up, and tell me what happened. What should you have known?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick rubbed his brow and leaned back against the wall. His gaze was glued to the curtain. He told Tommy everything, and when he was finished, Tommy needed to sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My God, you both could have been killed.” He expelled a long breath and then stood. “You know I’d tell you if I thought you screwed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t screw up,” Tommy insisted. “Pete didn’t figure it out either,” he pointed out. “You did your job. You protected my sister, and you saved her life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, she pretty much saved herself. There I was, armed to the hilt, and she nailed the son of a bitch with a safety pin. Drove it right through his eye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy flinched. “She’s going to have nightmares.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nurse came to get Nick. There was a phone call from Agent Wesson. Tommy stayed in the waiting area. He happened to look down and only then realized he was still wearing his white robes and that Noah’s blood had saturated the garment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wesson found the detonator. It was inside a garage door opener,” Nick said when he returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the bomb?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The abbey’s blocked off, and the bomb squad is coming in by helicopter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, Nick, we’re fortunate that no one else was hurt.” He was trying to keep his friend occupied because he knew Nick had about had it with waiting. He didn’t want him to go charging into the exam room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is the doctor taking so long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s being thorough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re awfully damn calm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of us has to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re her brother, and you saw what she looked like. If I were you and it was my sister in there, I’d be going nuts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laurant’s a strong woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, she’s strong, but a body can only take so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curtain parted, and the nurse who had been assisting the doctor came out. She went to the desk and picked up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor stayed with Laurant. One-on-one with his patient, his bedside manner had vastly improved. He was kind, soft-spoken, and gentle. He numbed the arm and cleaned the wound. Then he wrapped it in gauze to keep it protected until the plastic surgeon arrived to stitch it. He probed the area around her left eye but stopped when she winced. “You’re going to have a doozy of a shiner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor told her he was sending her to radiology. The swelling at the base of her skull worried him, and he wanted to make sure she didn’t have a concussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to keep you overnight for observation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put another strip of tape on the gauze to hold it in place as he remarked, “I heard what happened at the church. Bits and pieces anyway. You’re lucky to be alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant felt numb and a little disoriented. She was finding it difficult to concentrate. She thought the doctor had asked her a question, but she wasn’t certain, and she was too weary to ask him to repeat it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The nurse will help you get into a hospital gown.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Nick? Was he out there with her brother, or had he left? She wanted him to take her in his arms and hold her. She moved her leg and bit her lip to keep from crying out. It felt like it was on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor was turning to leave when he heard her whisper, “I think it’s bleeding again. Could I have a Band-Aid, please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenchley turned around. “You need stitches in your arm. Remember I told you that the plastic surgeon was on his way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was talking to her as though she were a child. He held up two fingers and asked her how many she saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two,” she answered, squinting against the penlight he was shining in her eyes. “I was talking about my leg,” she explained. “I fell down, and it’s bleeding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queasiness was getting worse, and deep breaths didn’t seem to be helping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenchley lifted her skirt and saw the blood on her slip. “What have we got here?” he asked as he gently pushed the slip up over her knee and then lifted her leg. He examined the bloody wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t see the injury. The skirt was in her way. “I just need a Band-Aid,” she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure do,” he agreed. “But first we’re going to need to remove the bullet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surgeon had a busy evening. Pulling his cap off, he walked into the waiting room to report that Noah was in recovery. He assured Nick and Tommy that there hadn’t been any surprises or complications and that the agent was going to be fine. Then he turned around to scrub again and operate on Laurant. While he worked on her leg, the plastic surgeon stitched her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nurse gave Tommy his sister’s watch and engagement ring. Without a thought, he handed them to Nick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant wasn’t in the operating room long, and for a short while she and Noah were in recovery together. She was still unconscious when she was wheeled into a private room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter checking on Noah, Nick went to Laurant’s room and stayed with her all night. As soon as Noah was taken to ICU so that he could be closely monitored, Tommy went back to the abbey to change clothes. Then he returned to the hospital and sat with Noah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete Morganstern arrived around two in the morning. He went to see Noah first. Tommy had fallen asleep in a chair, but he woke up as Pete was reading Noah’s chart. They went out into the hall to talk, and then Tommy told him where he could find Laurant and Nick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant slept fitfully. In those random moments of consciousness she called out to Nick. The anesthetic was slow to wear off. She couldn’t quite manage to open her eyes, but she felt him taking hold of her hand, and she would fall asleep again comforted by his soothing voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m right here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I threw up on Dr. Benchley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s my girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother hour passed. “Nick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m still here, Laurant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt him squeeze her hand. “Did you tell Tommy we slept together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a cough, and then Nick answered, “No, but you just did. He’s standing right here.”`\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell asleep, but this time she didn’t have any dreams or nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Pete walked into the room, he saw Nick bending over Laurant. He stood there and watched him slip the engagement ring on her finger and then clasp the watch around her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s she doing?” he asked, his voice low so he wouldn’t disturb her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a scratch on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That isn’t what I was asking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked into the hallway to talk. Pete suggested they go down to the cafeteria, but Nick didn’t want to leave Laurant. He wanted to be there in case she called out to him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so they sat together in the hallway in chairs Pete carried over from the nurses’ station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came here for two reasons,” he began. “First was to see Noah, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the other reason?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete sighed. “To talk to you and to apologize.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m the one who messed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that’s not true,” he said emphatically. “I messed up, not you. I should have listened to you. When Brenner was arrested, you told me it didn’t feel right to you, and how did I respond? By ignoring everything I trained you to do. I was so certain you couldn’t see the forest for the trees because of your personal involvement in this case. I ignored your instincts, and that was a mistake I won’t ever repeat. Do you realize how close to disaster we came this time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick nodded. He leaned back against the wall and stretched his legs out. “A lot of people would have been killed if that bomb had gone off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete began to question Nick then and didn’t stop until he had heard every detail and was satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reading the article in the paper . . . yes, that’s what set him off,” Pete said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His wife was almost perfect. That’s what you heard him tell Laurant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Nick said. “Stark’s wife had to have known what was coming. Once Stark decided she couldn’t get any better, that she was as perfect as she could be, he was going to kill her, just like he killed his mother. Knowing all the facts now, I think maybe her mind did snap, and that’s why she took the little boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll never know what her motive was,” Pete said. “If I were to speculate, I would suggest that perhaps she thought a family would change things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turn him into a doting father?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think maybe she wanted to end it . . . let us get her instead of him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete nodded. “You could be right. What about Laurant?” he asked then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The doctors say she’ll be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to be staying around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick knew what Pete was asking. “I’ll stay long enough to tell her how sorry I am I got her into all of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m leaving.” His mind was made up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over at Pete. “Damn. I really hate it when you say that. You sound like a shrink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t shield your heart, Nick. Running away won’t solve your problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re going to tell me what my problem is, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I am,” he agreed smoothly. “Loving Laurant makes you human, and that’s what’s frightening you. It’s that simple.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not running away. I’m going back to work. What kind of a life could I offer her? She deserves to be happy and safe, damn it, and I can’t guarantee that. Stark used her and Tommy to get to me. It could happen again. God knows, I’ve made enemies since I started working for you. What if another creep comes after her? No, I can’t let that happen. I won’t take that chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you’ll isolate yourself even more than you already have? Is that it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve made your mind up?” Pete pressed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heartbreaker-buchanan-renard-1/page-51.html","bookId":1835,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:23 PM"}
