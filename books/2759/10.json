Maddy doesn’t seem like a bitch to me, but then again, I think I know why she’s acting so cold. I know, sort of, what happened last night. No one else here does. They must all think she’s snubbing me for no reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of Jacey’s cajoling brings my attention back to the present, where my sister is practically sitting in Brand’s lap as she tries to coerce him into telling her stories from combat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrand shoots me another desperate look over her head, so I take pity and rescue him. Brand might be an incredible hulk of muscle, but Jacey’s always turned him into knots. He just thinks that no one knows that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jace, you know he can’t talk about that. That shit’s all classified. And you don’t have the security clearance level to hear it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey glares at me. “I don’t have a security clearance at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at her. “That’s my point. Give the guy a break. Besides, I’m sure we should probably leave. We’re taking up a table.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t go yet,” Jace whines, picking up another bite of her cake. “I’ve missed you guys. A lot. And I hardly ever get to see you, even now that you’ve been home for months. Don’t you find that weird?” She pauses, takes another bite, then turns to me. “Just have one more cup of coffee,” she tells me bossily. “I’ll even make it decaf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scoots off Brand’s lap and darts off for the kitchen before I can even answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrand grins at me. “Some things never change. Jacey’s still got you wrapped around her little finger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “Whatever. She was sitting on your lap. Seriously, though. You know I feel bad for her. She always thinks our dad is going to change—that he’ll miraculously take an interest in her and then when he doesn’t, she’s devastated. She’s never gonna learn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re always gonna be there to take his place,” Brand adds. “And do the shit he doesn’t. I know you, dude. And I respect the hell out of that. I do. I’m sure Jacey does too, even if she doesn’t show it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My sister’s tougher than she looks,” I answer thoughtfully, watching as she stops to talk to some guy who just walked in the restaurant. “She tries not to get all gushy and shit, but I know she appreciates you too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrand follows my gaze to Jacey, freezing on the guy who is standing with her. Something about the guy seems off. He’s wearing dirty work clothes and he’s muscled and stout. Clearly he does some sort of manual labor. He’s also clearly pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s that?” Brand asks with sharp interest. I shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No clue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t hear what they’re saying, but they seem to be in a heated discussion and the guy’s face turns red. Jacey shakes her head, rolls her eyes and turns to walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the guy grabs her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second he touches her, anger flashes through me, red and hot. Like lightning, Brand and I both shove back from the table, lunging to our feet. I reach my sister in a few strides, with Brand right beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you want to keep your hand, I suggest you let go of my sister,” I say calmly. There’s no need to raise my voice. I know how intimidating I am. And standing together, Brand and I are like a wall. We tower over this little punk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at us and I can see fear in his eyes, even if he doesn’t want to show it. He takes his time, but he makes a show of slowly and exaggeratedly releasing Jacey’s arm, then holding his empty hand in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s better,” Brand tells him. “I would suggest you not do that again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck off,” the guy spits angrily. “This isn’t your business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jared, just leave,” Jacey interjects. “Seriously. You need to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared smiles. “This is a public place. I need some dinner. And I want you to serve me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No fucking way,” Jacey tells him. “Get out. Now. I’m sick of your shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell is going on?” I demand. “Who is this guy and why is he bothering you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before she can answer, Madison emerges from the back hall. When she spots Jared, her eyes widen and she looks startled, then she masks it. She calmly approaches us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” she asks Jacey quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jared won’t leave,” Jacey answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just getting ready to help him out,” I tell Madison. The guy smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Try it,” he dares me. “Just try it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns to me, his slitted eyes challenging me, even though I can see the fear in them. He’s cockier than he is smart and, if I’m not mistaken, a little drunk too. I scoff at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not worth my time. Just leave before you embarrass yourself. Or before I embarrass you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared stares up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know who you are,” he scowls. “Jacey told me all about her big war-hero brother. Well, dumbass, you aren’t overseas now. And you’re not a hero here. So back the fuck off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore the anger that flashes through me quick and hot. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Pax stand up from his table. Mila puts her hand on his arm, as if to urge him to stay put. I smile. She must realize what I already know. I’ve got this. I don’t need assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t need to be a hero to handle a little pussy like you,” I answer him, maintaining my calm. “Get the fuck out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared doesn’t move. So I move him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing his elbow, I drag him toward the door. He struggles against me, but even though he’s strong, he’s much smaller than I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to call the police,” Madison tells him as she tags along at my heels. “Just go, Jared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re both whores,” he spits at her, struggling in my grip to turn and look at her. “I haven’t done anything to you. You need to mind your own fucking business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jacey is my business,” Madison answers coolly, stepping around us to open the door for me. “Stop harassing her. We’re calling the police this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time? I glare over my shoulder at Jacey, who has the good grace to look sheepish. This is the first I’ve heard of someone harassing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinning, I slam the punk against the doorjamb. Behind me I hear Madison suck in her breath, but I ignore it. This asshole’s back makes a satisfying thunk against the wood and I dig my fingers into his collarbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call my sister a whore again, and you won’t have any teeth left,” I warn him. “Got it?” He squirms and I release him, shoving him hard toward the parking lot. “Get the fuck out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spits on the ground, then starts to walk away. “Good thing you had your buddies to help you,” he calls back to me. “Next time you won’t be so lucky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gets into his car and I glance over my shoulder. Both Brand and Madison’s brother-in-law are standing behind me, as if I need backup for this pathetic piece of shit. I shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, trust me. I won’t need help. And there better not be a next time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy flips me off and spins out, squealing his tires as he tears out of the parking lot. I turn around to find Madison facing me, her hands on her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was that really necessary?” she asks. “I was going to call the cops. Violence really wasn’t appropriate. I have customers here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her in shock. “I thought you’d be happy that I removed him from your dining room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You thought wrong. I had the situation under control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m astounded now. “Oh, really? And how exactly were you controlling it? By threatening to call the police? Assholes like that don’t listen to reason, Madison. You have to speak in the language that they understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m sure you’re fluent in asshole-speak.” Madison stares at me icily for a moment longer, then spins around and stalks off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t give myself enough time to ponder the fact that the kitten has claws before I whirl around, pinning Jacey with my glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the fuck was this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey shrugs. Over her shoulder I see Madison walking her brother-in-law back to his table, then turning her head to talk with her sister. But instead of thinking about what they might be saying, I return my focus to my current problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s an ex-boyfriend who can’t take no for an answer,” she answers. “He’s just an asshole who takes rejection very personally. Not that big of a deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He sort of is,” Madison says from behind me. I glance at her, surprised that she came back after her little show of theatrics. She looks at me, her pretty face drawn. “His behavior could be a big deal, I mean. He practically attacked my little sister last year. And he’s been bothering Jacey for a while. At least a month. I keep telling her to call the police but she won’t. I figured I should tell you that. Maybe you can get her to see reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ruined her dramatic exit to come back and tell me something to help Jacey? Interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Madison, God.” Jacey snaps. “I don’t need the police involved in this. It’s embarrassing. Jared is an asshole and he’s annoying, but he’s not really going to do anything. Most of the time he just texts me… sends me pictures of his naked junk and shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison stares at her. “Jacey, he’s already doing something. Not only is he still harassing you, but he’s here in my place of business creating a scene.” She lowers her voice now and dips her head closer to Jacey, as if what she’s getting ready to say is for Jacey’s ears only. But I can still hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jace, my dad had that kind of temper. It doesn’t get better. Those kind of guys are bullies who will intimidate you until you push back, until you make him see that he can’t treat you like that. That you won’t let him treat you like that. You have to step up and do something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m still now as I watch her. She doesn’t know it, but she just showed me something about herself, something that makes her vulnerable. Someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can’t think about that right now. Right now I have to deal with my sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to talk,” I tell Jacey, taking her by the elbow and guiding her back to the table. “What exactly happened when you broke up with that guy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey shakes her head. “Nothing out of the ordinary. I told him that it wasn’t working and he didn’t like it. He texts me nonstop, drives by the cottage, calls and hangs up… it’s frustrating, but he’ll get over it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrand stares at her. “Little hotheads like him sometimes don’t just ‘get over’ something. He’s clearly got a problem. I’m going to need his name and address.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at my friend. After serving in the Rangers with him, I know exactly what he’s capable of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stand down, soldier,” I mutter to him. “This is civilian life. We aren’t going to pay the asshole a visit. Not yet, anyway.” I turn to my sister. “I’m not leaving you here alone. When is Gran coming back from Florida?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-leave-beautifully-broken-2/page-10.html","bookId":2759,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM"}
