It would buy me some time to figure out what had happened, what risk remained, talk to Dr. Petersen …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. And Victor. I had to call Eva’s dad. Get him on a flight to New York as soon as possible. Cary. He should be here, too. Once I had more facts and a support system for my wife, then I could tell her. Just a few hours. That was all I needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled to ignore the sick fear that Eva wouldn’t forgive me for the delay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was letting Lucky out when I stepped back into the bedroom. A laugh escaped her at the puppy’s enthusiasm. The joyous sound, one I loved so much, pierced me like a knife in the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKissing Lucky’s head, she looked at me with bright eyes. “You should put him on his puppy pad. He’s been locked up awhile.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll take him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed Lucky’s head before passing him over. “I hear a bath running.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A soak might do you good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Limber me up?” she teased. The look in her eyes … It killed me. I almost told her, but I couldn’t get the words past the lump in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I turned away and headed down the hallway to the half bath off the living room, where Lucky’s patch of fake grass was. I set him down on it, ran my hands through my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink, damn it. God, I needed a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. A drink. Hard liquor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the kitchen, tried to think of something strong that Eva would actually drink. A digestif, maybe? The house phone. Shit. I went to turn off the ringer and saw that someone had already thought of it. Turning back around, I spotted the coffeemaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething hot. Relaxing. No caffeine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTea. I went the pantry and searched, shoving around the items on the shelves looking for a box of tea Angus kept at the penthouse. Some herbal crap he said smoothed the rough edges. I found it and focused, filling a mug from the instant hot water tap. I dropped two tea bags into it, a liberal pour of rum, then a scoop of honey. I stirred, spilled onto the counter. More rum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing the tea bags into the sink, I headed back to my wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant, when I didn’t find her in the bedroom, I panicked. Then I heard her in the closet and my breath left me in a rush. I set the mug down by the bath, turned the water off, and went to her. I found her sitting on the bench, taking off her shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The dress is ruined, I think,” she said, as she stood in her bare feet, showing me the tear along the left side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll buy you another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flashed me a big smile. “You’re spoiling me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was fucking torture. Every second. Every lie I told. Every truth I left unsaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was flayed by the love in her eyes. The utter trust. Sweat slid down my back. I yanked my jacket off and tossed it aside, clawing at my bow tie and collar until they both came apart and let me breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help me out of this.” She turned her back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unfastened the gown and pushed it off her shoulders, letting it fall to a puddle on the floor. Then I unhooked her bra, hearing her sigh with pleasure as its constriction eased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking her over, I cursed silently at the bruise already shadowing her hip and the abrasions on her arm from the red carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe yawned. “Wow. I’m tired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God. “You should sleep, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot me a heated look over her shoulder. “I’m not that tired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus. Being gutted couldn’t hurt worse. I couldn’t touch her, make love to her … not with my deceit between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard. “All right, then. I’ve got to see to some business first. And get your purse. I made a hot toddy for you. It’s by the bathtub. Just relax and I’ll join you as soon as I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is everything all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to lie any more than I already had, I told her an irrelevant truth. “I’ve missed a lot of work this week. Some pressing things need to be dealt with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. I know that’s my fault.” She kissed my jaw. “Love you, ace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing a robe off the hooks, she slid into it and walked out. I stood there, surrounded by the smell of her, my hands still tingling from the feel of her, my heart pounding with fear and self-loathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky raced in so fast, he ricocheted off the door before barreling into my feet. I picked him up, rubbing the top of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was one nightmare he couldn’t wake me from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaúl waited in my home office, talking briskly on his phone. I joined him, closing the door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ended the call and stood. “The police are on scene. The gunman’s in custody.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Monica?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-121.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
