Lin Ming had completed a third of his divine runic symbol but there were no abnormalities yet in his soul force and his movements were still as steady as before.

And at this time, Clearshadow and Dreampearl had already completed two-thirds of their divine runic symbols; they were twice as fast as Lin Ming. As for Qin Yi, he was even faster. The tiny runes floating in front of him had already started gathering together, forming a variety of strange patterns as they condensed into a divine runic symbol. This was the last process for completion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFinally, Qin Yi drew the last tiny rune. As this tiny rune floated into the air, the thousand some tiny runes shimmered, weaving together in the sky and forming a divine runic symbol. At the same time, Qin Yi took out a gold level god rune from his spatial ring, one that was compatible with the divine runic symbol he created.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFor a first grade level divine runic symbol, a silver god rune was more than enough; a gold god rune would not have any superior effects. The reason Qin Yi chose a gold god rune was because he was hoping to enhance the grade of the divine runic symbol. If he needed to choose a blue soul level god rune he would have used a blue soul level god rune.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe divine runic symbol fused together with the Asura Heavenly Dao’s god rune. The arrangement of the numerous tiny runes was also affected by the god rune’s influence; this was the adding of the Asura Road’s Heavenly Dao Laws to the divine runic symbol.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was the most important step of the divine runic arts.

He flicked his finger and this Fire Melting Symbol turned into a stream of light that flew towards the white-robed Elder responsible for the examination.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe white-robed Elder stretched out his hand and grasped the dazzling divine runic symbol. Then, he probed its internal structure with his sense. He nodded again and again, “Good! Good!

Its use was to be fused into a spirit artifact and increase the spirit artifact’s fire-attribute strength. Normally, a low grade spirit artifact’s fire-attribute strength could increase by 50%, a medium grade spirit artifact’s could be increased by 20%, and a high grade spirit artifact’s wouldn’t have any change at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNow, according to Lin Ming’s estimate, the Fire Melting Symbol that Qin Yi drew up was slightly stronger than average. It should be able to increase a low grade spirit artifact’s fire-attribute strength by 60% and a medium grade spirit artifact’s by 25%. This was extremely rare, because it was already amazing for an ordinary divine runic master to create a Fire Melting Symbol that was on a standard level. To surpass that standard level was as difficult as ascending to heaven.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Qin Yi, you have passed the first grade divine runic master examination!

Then, he walked over to the resting area. Several deacons nodded towards him, feeling a bit strange in their hearts. They suspected that before long, Qin Yi would overtake them in attainments in the divine runic arts, making it seem as if all the effort of their lives had been wasted.

At this time, the two of them had already guessed that Lin Ming would succeed.
