{"id":8695,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Tom went out into the street angry, and justly so, at the unfounded charge which had been made against her. The change in her circumstances had been so sudden, that she hardly realized, as she walked along, that she must return to her old street life. When she did realize it, it was with a feeling of disappointment, not unmixed with apprehension. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tom had only been living at Mrs. Merton’s for three months, but this short time had wrought a considerable change in her. She was no longer the wild, untamed girl who once swept the crossing. She had begun to feel the advantages of respectability, and had become ambitious of acquiring a good education. This feeling originated in the desire of surprising Captain Barnes with her improvement; but she soon began to feel an interest in learning for its own 189sake. She was still spirited and independent, but in a different way. Her old life looked far less attractive, since she had acquired such different tastes. Now to be suddenly thrust back into it seemed rather hard to Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One thing at least could be said, she was no longer “Tattered Tom.” Her old rags had been cast aside, and she was now dressed as well as most school-girls. She no longer looked like a child having no home but the street, but would be supposed by any who noticed her to belong to some family in good circumstances. Now, good clothes exert more influence upon the wearer than we may at first suppose. So it was with Tom. When she wore her old tatters she was quite ready to engage in a fight with any boy who jeered at her, provided he was not too large. Now she would hesitate before doing it, having an undefined idea that her respectable dress would make such a scene unbecoming.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was one question that presented itself to Tom as she walked along, and demanded her earnest attention. This was, “How was she to live?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She could no longer sweep the crossing; she was 190too well-dressed for that. Indeed she was likely to attract attention if she engaged in any of the street occupations to which she had in former times been accustomed. But something must be done. Her whole stock of money consisted of five cents, and this was not likely to last very long. It was far too little to buy such a meal as she got at Mrs. Merton’s. It was doubtful, Tom reflected with a sigh, when she would get another square meal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Suddenly the thought came to Tom, could she not hire out to do chamber-work? She had learned to do this at Mrs. Merton’s. It would be a great deal better than sweeping the crossing, or selling papers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tom did not know how such situations were obtained, but it occurred to her that she could go from one house to another, and apply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With this plan in her mind, she turned round, and walked up town again. When she reached Twenty-First Street she decided to try her luck. Accordingly she went up to the front door of a handsome house with a brown stone front, and rang the bell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The door was opened by a servant, who waited 191respectfully for her to announce her errand, supposing her to be a school-mate of one of the children of the family. Her neat dress favored this mistake.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is the lady of the house at home?” inquired Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who shall I say wishes to see her?” asked the servant, doubtfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Does she want to hire a girl to do chamber-work?” continued Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who wants the place?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I do,” said Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then, she don’t want any,” said the girl, preparing to shut the door, with an entire change of manner. “Don’t you know better than to come to the front door? There’s the basement door below.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “One door’s as good as another,” said Tom, independently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Both are too good for you,” said the servant, angry that under the influence of a mistake she had at first treated Tom with the respect due to a visitor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much are you paid extra for your politeness?” asked Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 192“Never you mind! You needn’t call again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such was the result of Tom’s first application. However, she was not discouraged. She reflected that there were a good many streets in the city, and a good many houses in each street. So she walked on, and rang the bell at the next house. She concluded to take the hint which had excited her indignation, and rang the basement bell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you want a girl to do chamber-work?” she asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now it so happened that a chamber-maid was wanted here, and an order had been sent to an intelligence office for one. It was naturally supposed that Tom had come in answer to the application.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come in,” said the servant. “I’ll tell the missis that you are here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She went upstairs, and shortly reappeared.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You’re to come up,” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tom followed her upstairs, and took a seat in the hall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Soon a lady came downstairs, with a languid step.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 193“Are you the girl that has applied to do chamberwork?” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, ma’am,” answered Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You seem very young. How old are you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Twelve,” answered Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Only twelve? I am surprised that so young a girl should have been sent to me. Have you any experience?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, ma’am.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where have you lived?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At Mrs. Merton’s, No. — Sixteenth Street.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How long were you there?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Three months.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Have you a recommendation from her?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” answered Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why did you leave?” asked the lady, suspiciously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Because she said I took some money, when I didn’t,” replied Tom, promptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A change came over the lady’s face,—a change that betokened little encouragement to Tom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall not be able to take you,” she said. “I 194wonder they should have sent you from the intelligence office.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They didn’t send me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You were not sent from the office? How did you know I wanted a chamber-maid?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I didn’t know,” said Tom. “I thought you might.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I had known that, I should have refused you at once. You can go downstairs, and the servants will let you out at the basement door,—down those stairs.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All right,” said Tom. “I can find the way; you needn’t come with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This last remark led the lady to stare at Tom, uncertain whether she meant to be impudent or not. But Tom looked so unconscious of having said anything out of the way that she passed it over in silence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tom made two more applications, which proved equally unsuccessful. She began to think it would be more difficult to obtain a situation than she had supposed. At any rate, she resolved to defer further 195applications till the morrow. Something might turn up then, she reflected with something of her old philosophy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3007/83021.html","bookId":284,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:42:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:42:22 AM"}
