They just said I\u0027d see you at dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter decades of being in command, my dad would love that sort of evasiveness. He started toward the back of the staircase and gestured for me to follow. I did with a sigh, making a mental note to tell Vlad to have his people be a little more forthcoming than their normal, stonewalling selves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about that,\" I began. \"Vlad\u0027s staff is used to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea the danger you\u0027re in,\" my father cut me off, voice still barely above a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, sure, the European Mafia are scary people-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must not have thought I was moving fast enough because he tugged me behind the staircase. My borrowed coat muted the effects of the voltage, but a wince still crossed his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s him,\" he said, gesturing to Vlad\u0027s coat. \"That man isn\u0027t who he says he is. Vladislav Basarab is an alias, and a twisted one. I know you must care for him, but when I ran his name through my contacts, you wouldn\u0027t believe what I found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStruck by the same exhausted, overstressed irrationalism that led some people to cackle at funerals, I laughed. I couldn\u0027t help it. Maybe this was the last straw for my sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can imagine your face when they told you that was the real name of Dracula!\" I snorted, tears leaking out. \"That\u0027s what you get for snooping instead of being sequestered from the outside world like you\u0027re supposed to under witness protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was like a thundercloud now. \"This isn\u0027t a joke, Leila. The man who goes by the name Vladislav Basarab is so heavily involved in organized crime that my contacts advised me not to investigate him further or I might disappear. Does that sound funny to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganized crime. That was one way to describe it, if you didn\u0027t know that vampire hierarchy predated most current laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" I said, getting control of myself, \"Vlad isn\u0027t who you need to worry about. He won\u0027t hurt you, Gretchen, or me, but you do need to stop investigating him. None of your contacts would be able to dig up anything close to the truth, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then tell me the tru . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice trailed off, and his gaze narrowed. \"Why are there blood specks on your collar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I realized what he intended, he\u0027d yanked my turtleneck down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this?\" he spat, staring at the holes in my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have the chance to reply. Shrapnel appeared, lifting my father off the ground with one meaty arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I asked, aghast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He grabbed for your throat,\" Shrapnel said in explanation, my father\u0027s furious struggles not even causing him to twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leila, run!\" my dad said hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God, what is happening?\" Gretchen screeched, rounding the bottom of the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a bridge had suddenly materialized, I would\u0027ve jumped off it. \"Let him down,\" I told Shrapnel, who released my father with a muttered \"Fine, but if he lunges for your throat again-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t,\" I said shortly. \"Gretchen, stop screaming. Dad, I don\u0027t need to run. Vlad\u0027s people are crazy protective of me and you might not see them, but trust me, they\u0027re around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father stared at me like I was a stranger. \"What have you gotten involved in?\" he asked, so quiet that I could barely hear him above Gretchen\u0027s litany of \"Oh God, oh God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your neck, his alias, this castle.\" My dad\u0027s tone hardened. \"Is that the trouble you\u0027re in? You saw some sick form of role-playing among rich foreigners that went too far?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now I\u0027m struck with deja vu,\" an ironic voice said behind me. \"You may go, Shrapnel. I\u0027ll handle this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrapnel bowed to Vlad and vanished. I was used to people disappearing with vampiric speed, but my sister blanched and my dad\u0027s brows drew together like they\u0027d been yanked by a string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the f**k did he do that?\" he demanded harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had two choices: Tell the truth, or have Vlad mesmerize my dad and sister into believing a lie. Nothing less than mind control would work now that my dad had seen holes in my neck and the two of them watched a bulky guard seemingly disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad moved next to me, his hand resting on my back. \"I\u0027ll honor whatever decision you make, but the truth is always better than a lie, even when it\u0027s the more difficult path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my father\u0027s granite expression and my sister\u0027s frightened one, and sighed. \"They\u0027ll tell people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad flashed a charming smile at my father. \"No they won\u0027t. He\u0027s smart enough to realize that repeating such information is futile. The only people who\u0027d believe him are others of my kind, and they don\u0027t suffer whistleblowers or fools. As for her\"-a nod indicated Gretchen-\"she\u0027ll do as he tells her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sister bristled. \"I\u0027m twenty-two years old. No one tells me what to do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gretchen, be quiet,\" my dad growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at him but didn\u0027t say anything else. My lips twitched despite the seriousness of the situation. Vlad\u0027s instincts were correct-she\u0027d never go against a direct order from our father. Hugh Dalton had always intimidated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me the truth about what\u0027s going on,\" my dad ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, however, had never been intimidated by him. But I did want to try and repair my relationship with my family, and if our reconciliation wasn\u0027t built on honesty, then it wouldn\u0027t be real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show him, Vlad,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze changed from copper to bright, glowing green, and his smile bared teeth that now had two sharp fangs. A muscle ticked in my father\u0027s jaw but his expression didn\u0027t change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fancy contacts and novelty teeth don\u0027t im-press me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think they would,\" Vlad replied in a silky voice. \"But that happens before I do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe levitated into the air, hovering several feet off the ground. Then flames erupted from his hands, first eerie blue, then orange, yellow, and red. They climbed up his arms, licked the edges of his long brown hair, and while their heat was palpable, not a stitch of fabric or a single hair on him burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Vladislav Basarab Dracul, born 1431 as a mortal, but reborn in 1462 as a vampire,\" Vlad stated, staring into my father\u0027s eyes. \"And I am but one out of millions of vampires, ghouls, ghosts, and demons that live in secret among you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiling the drama on a little thick, aren\u0027t you? I thought. Then a thud made my gaze swing to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sister had fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad opened the wine and poured the deep red liquid to the brim before handing me the glass. I accepted it like it was a lifeline, taking a large, graceless gulp. On the plus side, my father no longer thought I was mixed up in a rich, role-playing cult. In the negative column, he was probably on the phone with the Pentagon right now, helping to organize a full-scale attack against any creature that didn\u0027t have a pulse. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-50.html","bookId":2011,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM"}
