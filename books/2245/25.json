Kurisaka\u0027s men lay in steaming piles, blood soaking the floor and walls. Half his mind processed the slaughter in a split second. The other half of Toshi\u0027s brain appraised the gargantuan black man rapidly advancing with a set of outstretched pistols. He was as huge as Kurisaka, round belly, big features. But not as soft or clumsy. He came at Toshi like an athlete, fast and sure of himself, and opened fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo a trained killer like Toshi, the entire clash unfolded in slow motion. Toshi charged too, ducked as he ran, raised his automatic, scanned his target, even as the big man\u0027s first three shots passed close over his head. Toshi recognized the man\u0027s Kevlar instantly, altered his aim from chest to head, squeezed the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took only a single shot. The big man\u0027s left eye exploded with a wet splat, blood thick, squirting like a ketchup packet squeezed too hard. The bullet exploded from the back of his skull, bone and flesh and goo flying, a horror-movie, special-effects nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToshi watched him, fascinated. The giant didn\u0027t fall immediately. He stood up ramrod straight, head twitching, mouth opening and closing. He took four halting steps back, lurching stiffly like a windup robot. Parts of his body refused to believe in death. There was a long, slow exhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he toppled over backward, hit with a floor-shaking impact, arms and legs sprawled wide. Toshi picked his way over and around the bodies of Kurisaka\u0027s men. They had not been Yakuza, but they were tough men, good fighters. And this big black man had been a mighty warrior also. It had been a good death. Toshi stood over him, studied the ruined face. Who was he? What had been his part in this? One of the assassins, perhaps, who wished to claim the bounty on Kurisaka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, he was just another of the many dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoellen Becker emerged from the stairwell and smelled it immediately, the stink of blood and gunpowder and bowels loosened in the final death throes. She looked both directions up and down the hall. At the far end, a man in black stood over Fat Otis\u0027s prone form. Otis had done his job well. She\u0027d handle the lone survivor before moving on to execute Kurisaka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamson\u0027s voice in her earpiece: \"Becker. Dammit, Becker-where are you? I need some help here, and I mean right fucking now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker ripped out the earpiece, tossed it away. You\u0027re on your own, sport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew the six-shooters again, stalked the hall toward her target, deliberate steps. Go in quick. All business. She thumbed back the hammers, the cylinders clicking and turning. Arms up and straight. She took a dozen steps toward him, fixing him in her sights, before squeezing the triggers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d already turned his head, spotted her. He was catlike, leapt to the side. The six-shooters thundered, slugs flying past him. She saw the shoulder material of his jacket rip, dust and thread flying, and she wondered if she\u0027d even drawn blood. She fired the six-shooters until they spun on empty. Click click click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned fire from his crouch, off-balance but on target. Three shots slammed into the Kevlar beneath Becker\u0027s leather jacket, almost knocked the wind out of her. She dove on the carpet, more shots passing over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, saw him ejecting the spent clip. If he reloaded, she didn\u0027t have a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker launched herself up from the carpet and into a full sprint in one smooth motion. She pumped her legs and arms as the clip fell, bounced off the carpet. Becker was within four feet of him as he pulled out another clip. She planted herself. He slapped the new clip home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun, a roundhouse kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the pistol, squeezed the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker\u0027s boot connected with the gun, the shot going off into the ceiling, plaster and dust. The gun flew away. She aimed another punch for the man\u0027s nose. Put him down quick. Get on to Kurisaka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her fist, twisted her arm. She grunted, jerked away, a flurry of fists to his gut and head. He blocked, counterpunched. She blocked the one aimed for her chin, but took a hard hit in the kidney. Becker winced, stepped back to regroup, but he wouldn\u0027t let her. He pressed the attack. A kick followed by another punch. She sidestepped the kick by a fraction of an inch, ducked the punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis bastard is good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped to the floor, attempted a leg sweep. She knew he\u0027d dodge it. She popped up again, jabbed three times fast with her tight little fist. She connected on the bridge of his nose all three times, his head snapping back, eyes round and surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe staggered back out of her reach, wiped his nose and looked at the blood. A thin smile. \"Not bad for a woman.\" Thick accent but clear enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dove for each other, collided in a frenzy of punches, kicks, and blocks. He ducked, twisted. She lost track of him. Then the sudden blur of a fist, the impact spinning her head around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker\u0027s turn to stagger back. She spit a tooth. It landed on the carpet between them. Blood on her lips and chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe charged her, and she punched. He caught her punch under his arm, held on tight, and wrenched. She heard more than felt the snap. He let go, and Becker scooted away from him, her right arm dangling useless and limp at her side. Now the pain. Even through the special drugs, she felt it throb the length of her arm. Oh, God. Oh, no. She willed the pain down to something manageable, fought off a wave of nausea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker punched with her other arm, but her opponent batted it aside. He spun and kicked the broken arm. She screamed, the pain an electric assault on her system. Dark spots hovered in front of her eyes. She backed away quickly, trying to remember how far the stairwell was behind her. Maybe she could run, get away. Becker knew she was kidding herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother blow to the side of her head, and she went to one knee. A kick and she was facedown on the carpet. She tried to push herself up, felt the man grab a fistful of her hair and jerk her head back, heard the snick of his switchblade and didn\u0027t have to guess what it was. An odd moment of clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as it was happening, she could not quite believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker felt the cold steel on her throat, then a white-hot instant of pain, then nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e44\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner tried again: \"Becker, dammit, I\u0027m in a world of shit here. Where the hell are you?\" No answer, and he didn\u0027t have time to wonder why. Another jarring impact against the bathroom door, the top hinge almost pounded apart. The giant on the other side was coming through, and the door would soon be so many splinters. Now or never. Conner had to do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven something incredibly stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tied the grappling-hook end of the nylon line around the pedestal sink. He clipped the other end to his utility belt, made sure it was tight and secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlam against the door again, wood cracking, shouts on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner peeled the backing off one of the explosive charges, slapped it against the center of the window, flipped the switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man on the other side of the door screamed pure rage, threw himself against the door again. The top hinge popped, clanged on the tile floor. Conner put his back against the door, braced his feet against the bathtub. It was like trying to hold back an avalanche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe window exploded, glass shattering outward, raining the sidewalk with glittering shards twelve stories below. Wind gusted and whistled through the bathroom. Conner grabbed the attach¨¦ case, bolted for the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner had seen Bruce Willis do something like this in Die Hard. Conner would have paid a million dollars for a stuntman to take his place. He took a deep breath and jumped headfirst through the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sensation of wind, clothes flapping, eyes crunched to slits. For a split second, Conner swore he was floating upward, arms and legs outstretched, the lights of Pensacola sprawling and tumbling in the night. Then the nylon line jerked tight, almost snapping his back, like God yanking his leash in midair. The city lights blurred, the line flinging him into the glass two floors down. His head smacked. Bells. He struggled for breath, grabbed the line with his free hand, and righted himself. It was a long way down. Conner decided not to look. Anyway, there wasn\u0027t time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slapped the last explosive disk against the window, flipped the switch, and kicked out as hard as he could. He swung out and away from the window, then a slight pause before the return swing. Conner flew toward the window, and the charge detonated, the glass window exploding inward a split second before he swung through into the hotel room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman within began screaming immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the line connected to Conner\u0027s utility belt went slack. A porcelain streak sped past the window. The pedestal sink. An image of the sink pulling him out the window flashed through Conner\u0027s brain. He yelped, fumbled at his belt, unhooking the line just as it was ripped out of his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman still screamed. She threw a lamp. Conner ducked, ran for the door, worked the locks, and escaped into the hall. He ran for the elevators, but saw the stairs and took those instead. He flew down them three at a time, an iron grip on the metal attach¨¦ case. He slipped on the last flight, slid down the stairs on his back. He groaned to his feet, hobbled out the exit, into the parking garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were another dozen people, half-dressed, rushing for cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the beginnings of a madhouse. An ambulance in front of the hotel\u0027s main entrance, a fire truck just pulling up, EMS swarming among panicked hotel guests. A bellboy gesticulating at a policeman. Red and blue flashing and high-pitched sirens a few blocks away signaled more cops on the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner didn\u0027t know if it was possible to look inconspicuous, didn\u0027t know if it was worth trying. He threaded his way through the Chicken Little frenzy of running people, found Fat Otis\u0027s Lincoln, and climbed in the passenger side. He sat low, willing himself invisible, and clutched the attach¨¦ case, Joe DiMaggio, the American icon he\u0027d just repossessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the entrance of the hotel, eyes darted between the front doors and the parking garage. Come on, Otis, buddy. Come on. Where are you? Let\u0027s get the fuck out of here-oh please will you just hurry your fucking ass up and come on come on come on!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner knew, in the way people always seem to know the worst, some kind of tragic clairvoyance, that Otis wasn\u0027t coming. He thumbed the throat microphone. \"Becker, if you can hear me, I\u0027m out of here. Okay? Time to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the static hiss of dead air in his earpiece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner scooted into the driver\u0027s seat, ducked under the steering column. It was easier with the old cars. Some of the new models couldn\u0027t be hot-wired. The repo business was getting tougher. His hands shook, but soon he had the wires out and spliced, started the engine on the first try. He sat up in the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a billion more police had arrived, they were fanning out, widening the perimeter around the hotel entrance. Conner wouldn\u0027t be able to hang out any longer. He looked once more for Otis, but when the SWAT van arrived, Conner figured that was it. Time to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out of the parking spot, drove a dozen feet when a uniformed cop stood in front of him, held up a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner rolled down the window, all smiles. His heart beat like it was trying to escape from his chest. \"What is it, Officer? A fire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cop ignored the question. \"Not through here. Turn it around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner made a three-point turn, tried to keep it smooth. He pulled away, resisted the urge to stomp on the gas. Soon he was away from the hotel, the flashing lights, the racket of sirens, and the jabbering crowd. Conner felt light-headed, stomach woozy. Had he lost too much blood, or was he just exhausted, nerve-fried?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of Otis and felt numb. Was the big guy still alive? Conner\u0027s gut told him no. He made no plans to avenge his friend\u0027s death. He didn\u0027t even want to know, didn\u0027t care about the details. He would claim not to know Fat Otis if the police ever came asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner hoped Otis would understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhira Kurisaka stood naked in his hotel bathroom, the wind on his sweaty skin raising goose bumps. He\u0027d exerted himself almost to the point of collapse. Knocking down the door, ripping the pedestal sink from the floor, and heaving it out the window was all more exercise than he\u0027d had in a long time. He stood at the windowsill, sucking air and looking at the gathering police vehicles below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone cleared his throat. Kurisaka turned, looked down at Toshi standing in the bathroom\u0027s ruined doorway. The Yakuza killer looked bruised and bloodied. His jacket was torn. But the man stood at attention, waited for Kurisaka to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what\u0027s happened,\" Kurisaka said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An attempt on your life, Cousin,\" Toshi said. \"I personally dispatched two of the killers, which is why I was not at your side when the third man broke into your suite. I apologize for the dereliction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Kurisaka said. \"Not an assassination attempt, not this time. They took the DiMaggio card. Your killers were a diversion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToshi\u0027s stoic expression wavered in obvious disbelief. He composed himself quickly. \"We might have a more immediate problem, I\u0027m afraid. The local authorities will be here soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll use the diplomatic credentials,\" Kurisaka said. \"Why else would I have two ambassadors and the deputy minister of the foreign office on the payroll?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToshi doubted it would be that simple but said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurisaka turned back to the open window, gazed at the cityscape. \"I don\u0027t know what to think, Toshi.\" He\u0027d believed his DiMaggio card a prize to be envied. Then Hito Hyatta had yanked the rug out from under him, had made him feel na\u0026amp;Iuml;ve, idiotic. He\u0027d called the card cute. And then, in the middle of the night, someone had felt the card worth a daring raid on Kurisaka\u0027s heavily guarded hotel suite. Kurisaka no longer understood his world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToshi cleared his throat. \"Cousin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do Yakuza generally suffer such an attack unanswered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurisaka thought for long seconds, understanding dawning in his eyes. \"No,\" he said. \"No, we do not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurisaka did not see Toshi\u0027s wide, wicked smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gather the men,\" ordered Kurisaka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToshi\u0027s smile fell. \"They are dead, Cousin. Every last one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyranny Jones\u0027s insomnia had led her to the blank canvas in the breakfast nook. She did much of her painting late at night, her mind racing, unable to find sleep amid the lace and satin in her bedroom, a separate bedroom from Professor Dan\u0027s. She\u0027d begun by painting the canvas, ended up painting herself. First, black toenail polish, then the fingernails black too. She liked it, found a tube of black lipstick, and did the lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bathroom\u0027s full-length mirror, she stripped naked and looked at herself. Tyranny was too tan to go gothic, so she resolved to stay out of the sun until she was nice and pale. She would buy a long, lacey black dress and a pair of combat boots. Yes, a good decision. It felt right, a timely reinvention of herself. Shake things up a bit. What would Dr. Goldblatt say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went upstairs, looked at Dan while he slept. His mouth hung open, a little drool on the chin. He appeared comatose and oblivious. She envied him. She went down the hall to her bedroom, took all the black clothing out of her closet, laid it out on the bed. She understood as a matter of course that she was inventing a project for herself, trying to trick her mind into paying attention to trivia, sorting clothes into piles, slacks and blouses and underwear and pajamas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put on the black pajamas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her bathroom mirror, she studied herself. She looked like a Marilyn Manson fan at a slumber party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer image makeover was interesting but not fully distracting. So Tyranny did something she almost never did. She went downstairs and flipped on the television. Maybe an old movie. Or music videos. It had been ages and ages since she\u0027d zoned out in front of music videos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, a windblown news reporter told Pensacola that all hell had broken loose downtown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-have responded with fire trucks and ambulances. All off-duty police are asked to report in. The slaughter follows on the heels of a similar incident that happened only a few hours earlier at a downtown gentlemen\u0027s club.\" The reporter paused, touched his earpiece, a wire hanging past his shoulder. \"I\u0027m being told authorities have not ruled out the possibility of a terrorist attack. Apparently there is a contingent of Japanese dignitaries staying at the hotel. It hasn\u0027t been determined yet if-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyranny flipped the channel, trying to find better pictures of the calamity. The Channel 2 news copter circled the Intercontinental Hotel, but without flames or smoke billowing from hotel windows it was a fairly boring view. Another channel showed the remains of a pedestal sink embedded in the smashed roof of an SUV. More interesting. She watched awhile longer, hoping to see some bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell chimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this hour?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the front door, looked through the peephole. It was too dark to see anything more than a vague shape. Instead of reaching for the light switch, she said, \"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tyranny, it\u0027s me. Please open the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conner?\" She glanced up at the ceiling, wondered if Dan had heard the doorbell. It was a big house, and Dan was a sound sleeper. She\u0027d told Conner to stay away. Was he here to cause trouble, pick another fight with Dan? He was such a fucking fucking fucking stubborn, stupid- \"Conner, what are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Tyranny, just open the damn door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth, wanted to tell him to fuck off. Go away. She didn\u0027t want to see him, couldn\u0027t endure any more of his pleas or professions of love. Couldn\u0027t stand breaking his heart, didn\u0027t have the energy to figure out how their lives would fit together or even if they could. It was all too much, and all Tyranny wanted was to hide in her room and try on black clothes and listen to a Duran Duran CD over and over again and pretend she wasn\u0027t a fucked-up head case. But no, here was Conner fucking Samson throwing reality in her face in the middle of the night like a selfish goddamn asshole, and yet part of her brain wondered if he\u0027d like the new look, the black lipstick, and she wanted to kill him and kiss him and why wouldn\u0027t he just fuck off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pounded on the door. \"Tyranny!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" She opened the door. \"Fine. Get your ass in here. But stop yelling or you\u0027ll wake- Oh my God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner fell into the light, sprawled facedown in the foyer. He looked like hell, blood-smeared and pale as death. He clutched a metal attach¨¦ case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Conner, oh Jesus, what happened?\" She knelt next to him, gently turned him over, pulled his head into her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been a long night,\" Conner said. \"I think... if it\u0027s okay maybe... I\u0027ll just close my eyes for a minute.\" He passed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conner!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Dan walked in, rubbing his eyes. He spotted Tyranny holding Conner\u0027s head in her lap. \"This is just typical. In my own house.\" He took a closer look, saw the blood. \"Oh, man. He doesn\u0027t look so good.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze/page-25.html","bookId":2245,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM"}
