{"id":51127,"no":1430,"title":"Book 44, Chapter 26 - Unstoppable","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe three Autarch-class void dwellers were in the ninth layer of clouds of the Grassland World, nervously reaching out to the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See anything?” the cyclopean bear said, carfully scanning the primordial chaos outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see a damn thing.” The tentacled stormcloud was extremely cautious as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look out!” The red-eyed, white-furred humanoid’s eyes were glowing with bloody red light as it stared intently towards a distant place, and it suddenly sent a mental warning to the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiiiip! An enormous black five-headed serpent suddenly slithered forward from within the mishmash of primordial chaos, its head glaring ferociously at the three as it charged towards them with an overwhelming aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll block it!” The red-eyed, white-furred humanoid was the closest to the serpent. It felt a sense of fear, but it still sent its two furry arms forward in an attempt to block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoosh! The five heads of the black serpent suddenly attacked simultaneously while using the full power of the entire formation. This strike completely eclipsed that of any ordinary Autarch’s and was every bit the equal of Iyerre’s ultimate attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dodge!” After the black serpent crushed the red-eyed, white-furred creature, it cruised straight towards the tentacled stormcloud. The stormcloud creature was terrified but it still sent out many probing tentacles to try and defend against the impact while preparing to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black serpent slithered closer towards it, the five heads striking simultaneously once more and tearing countless tentacles apart. However, the serpent was noticeably slowed down by them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heartbeat later, the black serpent gave a little wriggle and then shot out once more, its speed skyrocketing to incredible heights as it flew towards the final remaining combatant, the giant cyclopean bear. Autarch Titanos’ avatar was standing in the central head, and it murmured to itself: “Where there is cause, there is effect. Karma lies in all things.” The five heads of the serpent struck out in perfect harmony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! The giant cyclopean bear furiously struck out with its twin paws, managing to block the attack of the black serpent head-on. It was the physically strongest of the Autarch-class void dwellers, and so although it was at a noticeable disadvantage it wasn’t instantly destroyed by the clash.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha, I’m not as fragile as those other two!” the giant cyclopean bear laughed excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Titanos, prepare to enter the Grassland World!” Ning sent mentally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the giant black serpent, a sword suddenly appeared. The sword shone with dazzling light and was filled with awesome power. The five heads of the black serpent were able to cooperate together in perfect harmony thanks to the power of karma, but this sword had transcended mere ‘cooperation’ and represented many different powers being merged into a perfect whole! Ning was commanding all of the long-distance attacks from the seven Autarchs in the outer formation, and he manifested them through his Sword Dao to create a terrifying divine sword that surpassed even the black serpent in power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“CHOP!” The awesome divine sword came crashing down with such power that even the cyclopean bear felt a sense of fear. It hurriedly retreated, seeking to use its paws to defend once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlaaaash! Sword-light descended, annihilating all within its path. The upper body of the giant cyclopean bear was completely destroyed by this strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahhh!” The giant cyclopean bear was completely terrified. Thankfully it had kept its life-core within its lower left leg, and its entire lower body remained within the ninth layer of clouds. As a result, it was sable to survive this strike. The three had only agreed to expose part of their giant bodies, precisely because their life-cores were what really mattered the most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh! The vast sword stabbed straight into the ninth layer of gray clouds. It shuddered slightly, seeking to tear through the surrounding area and rip apart the hundreds of millions of kilometers of clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh?” Thanks to the divine sword, Ning immediately sensed a powerful force resisting him. “Bolin was right. The ninth and outermost layer of clouds is so incredibly durable that ordinary Autarchs have no chance of destroying it at all. Even though we’re joining our power together and summoning the might of the Chaosverse itself, we’d probably only be able to cut apart a hundred thousand kilometers of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutarchs were completely unable to breach the ninth layer of clouds, while a full-force blow from this divine sword was able to break through a hundred thousand kilometers of it. This was a testament to the sword’s might! The more of the clouds you wanted to destroy, the more power was needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Titanos, help me keep the rift in the clouds open,” Ning sent mentally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave that to me!” Titanos sent the black serpent in to cover the rift while sending back, “I’ll leave the attack against the world of grass to you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe towering black serpent slithered its way into the tear within the gray clouds, its five heads slowly swiveling around its body and keeping the tear open, preventing the gray clouds from covering it back up again! It must be understood that once the tear was closed, Ning’s squad wouldn’t even be able to sense the insides of the Grassland World, much less maintain the sword and continue to fuel it with their mana. They had to keep the tear open and prevent it from closing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black serpent was filled with unearthly power, but it was only able to just barely maintain a thousand-kilometer sized rift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sever the connection to the outside world! Quick! Sever it!” the red-robed man shouted frantically. The Grassland World truly was a complete world unto itself and as such could be completely detached from the rest of the Chaosverse, making it impossible for the Chaosverse to sense and detect it. The two men and the woman inside the Grassland World were absolutely horrified at the power of that sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no way to break the link!” the silver-robed woman said frantically. “That black serpent is preventing the clouds from reforming. We can’t break the connection!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not good! That sword is about to attack!” the black-robed man bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant black serpent continued to hold the gray clouds apart within the ninth layer, while the mighty sword transformed to become incomparably vast as it stabbed downwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! The tip of the sword stabbed through the eighth layer, then the seventh layer, the sixth layer…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClang! A violet-gold chain suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The dazzling iridescent chain flew towards the black serpent which was holding the rift in the clouds open, and it was quickly followed by yet another chain as well. The violet-gold chains launched continuous attacks against the giant black serpent. If they were able to destroy it, the clouds would close over and sever the tip of the sword from the outside world, preventing it from controlled and thus causing it to collapse on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClang! Clang! Clang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore and more violet-gold chains appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hm?” The hilt of the absolutely titanic sword remained within the ninth layer of clouds, while the tip of the sword continued to stab downwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Break!” Ning caused a series of sharp surges of sword-ki to fly out from the hilt of the sword. Each stream of sword-ki was shaped like a fish, and a total of thirty-six swordfishes quickly flew out and took up blocking positions before the black serpent. They then began to swim together to form a whirlpool of sword-light which smashed outwards at the encroaching violet-gold chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese thirty-six streams of sword-ki merely represented 20% of the divine sword’s power, but this defensive sword-technique in the form of a vortex of sword-light was still enough to suppress all of the attacking chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now, there were nine violet-gold chains which were furiously assaulting the whirlpool of sword-light, only to be unable to break through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Break! Break! Break!” The toughest layer of clouds was the ninth one. With the black serpent maintaining the tear, the other eight layers were now much easier for the gigantic sword to stab through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! Boom! Boom! The sword continued to penetrate one layer of clouds after another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This sword is too powerful! These native Autarchs must have come together and used something akin to a Daoguard Tower which allows them to summon the power of the Chaosverse, then had Emperor Darknorth merge all of these disparate energies together with his Omega Sword Dao. This sword is so powerful that not even all three of us working together can stop it!” The two men and the woman hidden in the center of the Grassland World began to grow a bit nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I knew that this was going to happen, I would’ve had us rendezvous with Iyerre before coming here. Iyerre could’ve dealt with these problems,” the silver-robed woman said anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIyerre had instructed them to go rescue the Sithe Exalts, while he himself was coming from a completely different region of the Chaosverse. As a result, their reunion was delayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was overconfident in his Grassland World,” the red-robed man said frantically. “That sword is about to pierce through the last layer of clouds!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re hidden here in the depths of the Grassland World, while the sword isn’t able to blink through the earth above us. There’s no way it’ll be able to injure us,” the black-robed man said coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But if we let them cause destruction unchecked, they might end up destroying some of the important components of the Grassland World. Once we lose this weapon, the upcoming battles will be even harder,” the red-robed man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph. That’s not our problem. Staying alive is what matters; losing a weapon is a minor matter. We’ve done our utmost,” the black-robed man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing’s sword was filled with the power of seven Autarch-class combatants. It started at the eighth layer of clouds and stabbed through one layer after another. The clouds sought to form whirlpools of defensive energy to resist, causing the sword to come under tremendous pressure, but it was still able to persevere… and so, just like that, it punched all the way through the first layer of clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bolin, return immediately!” Ning sent mentally. Bolin’s true body was hidden within the first layer of clouds.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-44-chapter-25\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-44-chapter-27\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/desolate-era/de-book-44-chapter-26","bookId":1501,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:14 AM"}
