{"id":86074,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you expect?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison gave a short, humorless laugh. “A good question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen stilled, studying Madison with a growing concern. “Maddy…” She abruptly grimaced. “Sorry, I meant—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maddy’s fine,” she assured her friend. She’d ridiculously thought that insisting on being called Madison would somehow separate her from the naïve girl who’d so eagerly invited Luc into her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was that she would never be able to rid herself of Maddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer past was simply a part of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?” Kristen prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It went just as I planned.” Madison grimaced as she was forced to relive her latest humiliation. “I met Luc at the party and less than a half hour later he was in my hotel room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not surprising,” Kristen murmured, her gaze closely studying Madison’s pale face. “No man could resist a night with Madison Philips.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison shook her head. There were some men who would be attracted to her because she was a famous model, but that wasn’t why Luc had been so eager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Luc couldn’t resist a night with any woman willing to spread her legs,” she said in dry tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen arched a brow. “I told you earlier that the rumor around Vegas is that Luc has become very particular in his choice of companions. I heard one of his friends say that he’d become a monk over the past couple of years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison ignored her friend’s words. Just as she’d ignored Luc’s claim that he’d changed from the shallow flirt he’d been when she’d known him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More likely he became more discreet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s possible, I suppose,” Kristen slowly agreed, frowning as if troubled by Madison’s stark refusal to believe that Luc could change. “What happened when you got to the hotel room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison felt her cheeks heat. She told herself it was embarrassment. She wasn’t the sort of woman who enjoyed sharing the details of her sexual encounters with anyone, not even her best friend. But deep inside she knew that it was the remembered pleasure that made her face flush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod. She ached in places that she’d never realized could ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe delectable ache of a woman who’d been well loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer blush deepened as Kristen raised a questioning brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would think that was pretty obvious,” she mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen chuckled. “So you did the deed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison nodded, although she’d never, ever call what happened between her and Luc ‘doing the deed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat implied a casual hookup. What happened last night was…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything but casual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were together…yes,” she confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen leaned forward. “And how was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mind-blowing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen flashed a teasing smile. “Good for you, girlfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Madison growled, shoving away the coffee as her stomach twisted with a sick sense of inevitability. “Not good for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen’s smile faltered. “You wanted it to be a failure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted…” She made a sound of disgust at the memory of her smug confidence when she’d planned her trip to Vegas. She’d been so certain she wanted nothing more than revenge. It’d never occurred to her that she was using any excuse, no matter how pathetic, just to be with Luc Angeli. “Shit.” She rubbed her temples, the headache better, but still a dull throb behind her eyes. “I’m losing my mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Maddy.” Kristen grimaced with regret. “If you don’t want to talk about this—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He claimed that I’m still in love with him,” Madison broke into her friend’s apology, abruptly revealing the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen would worm it out of her one way or another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen abruptly frowned, her eyes searching Madison’s pale face. “You told me—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what I said.” Madison heaved a resigned sigh. “But I think I must have been in denial.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, Kristen cleared her throat. “Denial?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to believe I hated him.” Madison gave a helpless lift of her hands. “It was certainly better than accepting I couldn’t grow past my childish, schoolgirl crush.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first question that Madison had no trouble answering. She’d made her decision during the long hours of staring at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to my appointment then I’m returning to New York as I planned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen looked like she’d just been slapped. “Going back to New York?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison blinked in surprise. She’d expected sympathy from her friend, not an adamant rejection of her plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you have to talk to Luc,” Kristen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison slid off her stool, her brows furrowed as she glared at her companion. “Have you gone insane? He’s the last person I want to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But…” Kristen looked as if she wanted to give Madison a good kick in the ass. “If you still love him then you have to see if this could work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison was shaking her head before Kristen finished speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA part of her desperately wanted to stay. Just to be near Luc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she realized just how sad and pathetic that would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpending her days hoping to catch some glimpse of Luc, while he was constantly chasing another woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know?” Kristen pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he’s Luc Angeli.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison wondered if her friend was being deliberately obtuse. She knew as well as Madison that staying in Vegas would offer her nothing more than heartache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And he’s not forever-after material,” she muttered in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen shrugged. “Who says?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe indigo eyes narrowed. “Only because you’re a coward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison flinched at the accusation. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristen moved to stand directly in front of Madison, her expression unrepentant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You love Luc, but you’re too afraid of another rejection to give him a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison reached for her purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had nothing to do with courage, she silently reassured herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn’t she proved she could face whatever life could throw at her? That she could overcome any challenge and come out on top?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was just smart enough to avoid repeating her mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m late,” she muttered, turning to head for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maddy,” Kristen called from behind her. “Dammit, I’m not going to let you throw away a chance at happiness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc had broken all speed limits to get to the remote parking lot near Red Rocks. There was a shop on the other side of the lot, but he’d deliberately tucked his Jag behind a large rock formation at the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t know why he was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that wasn’t true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d already been headed to Kristen’s condo when she’d texted him with the info that Madison was going to be at this location and that he needed to be here to meet her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn’t have any idea why Madison would be traveling to this desolate spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right now, he didn’t give a shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing mattered but having the opportunity to speak with her before she left town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing out of his car, he impatiently glanced at the expensive watch wrapped around his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDammit. He’d been so pissed when Madison had left the hotel last night that he’d drunk the entire bottle of champagne that’d arrived only moments after her dramatic departure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expensive wine had helped to dull his outrage at her claim that she’d used him as some sort of sexual purge. But as his anger had cooled, he deeply regretted having consumed so much alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew damned well and good that Madison hadn’t sought him out just for revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt simply wasn’t her nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to have some lingering love for him, even if she refused to admit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, he’d been on the wrong side of tipsy from the champagne, and was forced to sober up before he could go in pursuit. A man didn’t try to convince the woman of his dreams to give him a second chance while he was drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he’d done his best to sleep off his uncharacteristic overindulgence before returning to his home to shower and shave, swiftly changing into a pair of well-worn jeans and T-shirt before heading to out to find Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he awaited her arrival with a growing frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it possible that Kristen had sent him to the middle of nowhere so Madison had time to escape him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was exactly the sort of plot the devious young lawyer would concoct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially if Kristen thought he intended to hurt her friend… \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/first-rapture-the-rapture-1/page-12.html","bookId":1899,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:04 PM"}
