Exactly the sort of thing that springs to mind when I think of Shel Rivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a quick rap at the door. It was pushed open by one of her team members, and in walked Shel and his nice-looking friend, the fellow with the funny name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mr. Grange!\" Jenny said, with a little more enthusiasm than Alex privately thought was necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Teal,\" he corrected her, holding out a ham-size hand for her to shake. \"Nice to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny flicked invisible dust off her lapels. \"It was kind of you to accompany Dr. Rivers this evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Grange replied, pushing his glasses further up on his nose. \"It sure as shit was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I only had dinner sent up for two,\" Jenny said nervously, smoothing her navy skirt. Alex wondered if she\u0027d start disrobing out of sheer nervousness. Had she ever seen Jenny this jittery? She had not. \"But I can certainly call and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we go out?\" Teal asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Oh! I, uh, couldn\u0027t do that.\" She gestured in Alex\u0027s direction. \"My job. I mean, the princess. I mean, I can\u0027t do that. But you\u0027re very very very very very very nice to ask.

She\u0027d never seen Jenny look so defiant and crushed (and cyanotic!) at the same time. \"Don\u0027t be silly,\" she said, after she was sure she wouldn\u0027t snort, or giggle. \"You and Teal can go out.

No? Good, because the closest Chinese place sucks. How about American? You like American? I know a great burger place.

They looked each other in the sudden silence of the room, and burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First trip to Minot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Jenny replied stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, whaddya think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you, uh, gonna be this tense all night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t be here,\" she explained. \"My job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like that Alex gal would let you hang around if she didn\u0027t want you to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Jenny began helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, I jumped at the chance to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny nearly knocked over her water glass. \"You—you did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" He sucked up a terrifying mound of spaghetti, then downed the rest of his beer, then took another bite. \"Your burger okay?\" he asked with his mouth full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine, I had actually eaten before you arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, shit, why\u0027d you order it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ordered it,\" she reminded him. \"But it\u0027s fine.

You look like a million bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a second-day suit,\" she explained. \"Something I wear on the job.

Well, I\u0027m all done sniveling, how about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stifled a sigh as she stole another glance. It was ridiculous, how wonderful he looked, even in casual clothes. Normally she liked her men in Saville Row, but Teal looked fabulous despite what he was wearing. It was the broad shoulders, she decided. No, the hair. No, the glasses—they made him look smart and tough. No, the eyes. The green, green eyes. A pity he was so childish. So large and childish. And large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd perhaps the smallest bit insensitive. Imagine, she had mentioned her vegetarian proclivities in the car and he hadstill ordered her a burger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—should be safe to go back after dessert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to split a tiramisu?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" she said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes. Definitely the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShel stared at Alex, then stared at her some more. Curled up like a cat on the cream-colored chaise lounge, she looked back and raised her dark brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Penny,\" she said after a long moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly? I was thinking that you\u0027re the most gorgeous woman I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever?\" she teased. \"Ever ever? Or ever in real life ever? Because I think Halle Berry is much prettier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever ever. Women on their wedding days don\u0027t look as good as you look in—what are those, little pants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clam diggers,\" she said, giggling into her palm. \"Little pants? Did you think they\u0027d shrunk in the wash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he said impatiently. \"Come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up from her seat and bent over him.
