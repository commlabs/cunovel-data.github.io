What’s the answer? I even goddamn died and was resurrected! And I still don’t have a clue!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some questions have no answers.” Maggie reached up and touched his cheek. “But in truth, Sam, you didn’t escape death. None of us can. It’s still out there. Not even the Incas could escape it in the end.” She drew Sam closer. “For years, I’ve tried to run from it, while you stood back-to-back with your uncle against it. But neither way is healthy, because Death always wins in the end. We end up the worse for trying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what do we do?” He begged her with his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie sighed sadly. “We strive to live as fully as we can.” She stared up into his face. “We simply live, Sam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt new tears. “But I don’t understand. How—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sam,” Maggie interrupted, reaching a finger to his lips. The rescue blanket fell from her shoulder with a soft rustle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just shut up and kiss me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked at her words, then found himself leaning down. Guided by her hands, he discovered her lips. He sank into the softness and heat of her, and he began to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is the reason we live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her tenderly at first, then more passionately. His blood rang in his ears. He found his arms pulling her closer to him, while she reached hands to the back of his neck, tangling in his hair and tumbling his Stetson from atop his head. They struggled toward one another, leaving no space between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that moment, Sam’s heart soared as he understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this kiss, there was no grief… no guilt… no death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly life—and that was enough for anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo years later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursday, October 19, 10:45 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstitute of Genetic Studies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanford, California\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree floors beneath the main research facility, a man wearing a long white lab coat approached the palm pad to a suite of private laboratories. He pressed his hand flat on the blue pad and watched the pressure-sensitive reader flash across his fingers. The light on the panel changed to green. His name appeared in small green letters on the reader:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Dale Kirkpatrick\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of tumbled bolts announced his acceptance by the computerized monitoring station. He removed his palm and pulled the handle. The vacuum seal cracked with a slight whoosh of air, like a short inhaled breath. The middle-aged scientist had to tug harder to pull the door open against the slight negative pressure of the neighboring rooms, a built-in safeguard to keep biologic contaminants from possibly escaping the lab. No expense had been spared on this project. A government think tank, backed by the Pentagon, had invested close to a billion dollars in this project. A good portion of which, he thought with a wry smile, went directly into his personal salary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulder protested with a sharp twinge as he pulled the door fully open. Wincing, he entered the lab and let the door reseal behind him. He rubbed the tender spot alongside his rotator cuff. The bullet wound he had suffered in the halls of Johns Hopkins had required four surgeries to repair. Though he still had occasional pain, he could hardly complain—not only had he survived the attack, he had come away with a small quantity of Substance Z, the test samples used in the electron microscope assay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce word of his find reached the right circles, Dr. Kirkpatrick was allowed to vanish. His death was reported, and he was whisked to the West Coast, to the Institute of Genetic Studies at Stanford. He was granted the lab, and a staff of fourteen with the highest government clearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDale continued down to his office, past the rows of laboratories. As he passed the computer suite, he heard the whir of the four in-line Cray computers as they crunched the day’s data collected by the gene sequencer. The Human Genome Project was a child’s puzzle compared to what his lab was attempting. He estimated it would take four more years to figure out the exact code, but he had the time. Whistling to break the silence of the empty lab, Dale used a keycard to unlock the door and enter his personal office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging out of his lab coat, he hooked the garment on a coat rack, then loosened his tie and rolled up his sleeves. He crossed to his desk and settled into the leather chair with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to dictate the last of his annual review, so Marcy could type it up tomorrow for his inspection. He opened a drawer and removed his personal dictation device. Thumbing it on, he brought the microphone to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Status Report. Conclusions and Assessments,” he dictated, then cleared his throat. “Nanotechnology has always been a theoretical science, more a field of conjecture than hard science. But with the discovery of Substance Z, we are now prepared to bring the manipulation of atoms into the practical sphere of science and manufacturing. For the past two years, we have studied the effects of the ‘nanobiotic’ units found in Substance Z on early embryonic tissue. We have discovered the manipulation has proven most effective at the blastula stage of the human zygote, during which time the cells are the most undifferentiated and pliable. By observing these nanobots at work, and through a process of reverse engineering, we hope to be able to construct the first prototypes in the near future. But for now, we have made a significant discovery of our own, the first step in making nanotechnology a reality: We now know the programmed goal of the nanobots found in Substance Z.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Dale switched off the recorder and stretched a kink from his neck. He was proud of his research, but a nagging doubt still itched at his conscience. Carrying the dictation device, he crossed to the sealed window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce there, he pressed a button and louvered blinds swung open, revealing the contents of the incubation chamber in the next lab. A yellowish broth bubbled and swirled. Small sparks of gilt floated like fireflies in the mix. Flakes of nanobot colonies. Substance Z.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was not the special nutrient broth that had drawn Dale here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanging from two racks were the twelve developing human fetuses. He leaned slightly forward studying them. The pair in the second trimester were already developing their wing buds. Heads, bulbous and too large for the tiny frames, seemed to swing in his direction. Large black eyes stared back at him, lidless for now. Small arms, doubly jointed, slowly moved. One of the fetuses sucked its tiny thumb. Dale spotted the glint of sharp teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised the recorder again and switched it on. “I have come to believe that the gold meteors discovered by the Incas were, in fact, some form of extraterrestrial spore. Unable to transport themselves physically, an alien civilization seeded these nanobot probes throughout the stars. Like a dandelion gone to seed, the probes spread through space, hoping to find fertile ground among the countless planets. Responsive to the patterns of sentient life, the gold probes would attract the curious with their shapeshifting nature and lure in their prey. Once caught, the nanobots would manipulate this “raw material” at the molecular level, ultimately consuming a planet’s sentient biomass and rebuilding their own alien race from it, thus spreading their civilization among the stars.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDale clicked off the recorder. “But not here,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning forward, Dale studied the largest of the developing fetuses. It seemed to sense his attention and reached tiny clawed fists toward him. Sighing, Dale rested his forehead against the glass tank. What will we learn from each other? What will we discover? The lips of the tiny figure pulled back in a silent hiss, exposing its row of sharp teeth. Dale ignored the infantile display of aggression, content with the success of his handiwork. He rested one palm on the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome,” he whispered to the newcomers. “Welcome to Earth.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/excavation/page-71.html","bookId":1525,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM"}
