She puts her gloved hands on my cheeks and says, “My God, look how grown-up you are! I haven’t seen you in so long, honey.” She sweeps me into her arms for a long hug, and I lean into it. She still wears the same perfume, which is weirdly comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillia says, “We were just watching a movie, Mommy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, that’s nice. You’ll stay for dinner, won’t you, Kat? I want to hear all about everything.” When I hesitate, she says, “We’ll order in from Red Hot! You always loved their Mongolian beef, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay,” Lillia urges me, tugging on my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin. “I do love that Mongolian beef.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Cho claps her hands together. “Yes! Wonderful! And I have some really nice gelato, and this decadent salted caramel sauce. We’ll do sundaes!” Putting her arm around me, she says, “It’s good to see you girls together again. I’m glad you have each other to lean on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLillia and I look at each other. I hadn’t thought of it that way, but she’s right. We’re the only two people who really knew Rennie; we’re the only two people who understand that loss. And now Mary’s gone too, it truly is just me and Lil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMARY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI VISIT REEVE NIGHT AFTER night. I meet him in his dreams. Every time, I say it’s the last time, that I need to end Reeve’s life once and for all. But when it’s morning I come back home, read some more of Aunt Bette’s books, and wait until the moon comes out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m startled by the jingling of keys in the front door, and then a stampede of high-heeled shoes crossing the threshold into the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash I’m standing at the bottom of the stairs. It’s five women from the Preservation Society, dressed like they’ve just come from a fancy lunch, in fur-trimmed coats, heels and stockings, and quilted purses hanging from gold chains off their shoulders. They are huddled together like a pack, staring around, wide-eyed. One woman, the youngest, searches the wall for the light switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the switch as she clicks it on. Nothing happens. She tries again a few times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess they turned the electricity off already,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you idiot. The electricity is still on. I’m just not letting you use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince my mother took Aunt Bette away, the Preservation Society has come by too many times to count. Usually they stick to the outside, circling the house, making notes in their notebooks, cupping their hands around their eyes to try to peer into the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’ve never come inside before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t see a thing,” an older woman complains. She takes a step and almost trips over a pile of mail that was shoved through the front door slot. Another white-haired woman catches her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ooh, I’ve got an idea!” the young woman says pertly. She pulls out her cell phone and uses the screen like a flashlight. The place is still a mess from when my mother dragged Aunt Bette away. The woman’s perky smile fades. “Oh my gosh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eldest woman is also the shortest. Her chest is covered in a bib of pearls. “We’ll leave the front door open and just stick to the ground floor.” She steps over a buckled runner carpet. “I’m most anxious to see the state of the living room. I know the Zanes did some renovations, and I pray they were smart enough to leave the fireplace mantel intact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do these women think they’re doing? I know they want to turn the place into some empty dollhouse with fake furniture that no one can live in, but this house has been in my family for more than a hundred years. There’s no way my mom or Aunt Bette would ever sell it. Which means that these women are trespassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey move as a group into the living room. It’s not in great shape. But Aunt Bette and Mom will clean it up when they come back this summer. I hope I’ll be in heaven, or wherever, by then. But it still makes me happy to think that my family will live on in this house, that Aunt Bette and my mom still have each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Polly, make sure you take lots of pictures. This will definitely show the people at the benefit why we need to raise those funds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll have to get our interior guy on this straightaway. Danner, take some notes, and we’ll get a quote.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. We need to call the water company and the gas company and get the utilities shut off during renovation. As for that, all the lighting fixtures must go. I don’t think these built-in shelves are original, but we can look at the blueprints back in the office. We’ll need him to repair the crown moldings and . . . oh good Lord. This wallpaper is atrocious!” The lady with the pearls actually rips a piece off the wall and flicks it onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI helped my mother pick out that wallpaper. We both loved the tiny birds on it and the flecks of foil. It was really expensive. It had to be special-ordered from overseas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother woman is staring at one of Aunt Bette’s paintings on the wall. She lifts it off and tosses it onto the floor, like it’s garbage. “Danner, have them bring two Dumpsters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey can keep dreaming. They can’t remove anything or renovate without an owner’s permission. I’ve heard my mother say that she’d rather sell a kidney than ever part with this house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank goodness Erica decided to donate the house. Another few months and this place would have to be condemned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no way. No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m surprised she wanted to hold on to it after her daughter killed herself in the room upstairs. If I were her, I’d never want to come back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanner holds up her pencil. “Ooh! Actually, this may sound silly, but maybe we should look into having the place spiritually cleansed. I know a woman who does an excellent tarot reading in White Haven. She studied in India and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I’m about to burst out of my skin. And the house feels it too. Cracks bloom on the plaster walls; white dust sprinkles down like snowflakes. The women scream in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey make for the front door, running through a gauntlet of spark and sizzle as I send bolts of electric current flashing out of outlets and light switches. Danner is the last one to the door, and I slam it and trap her inside before she can cross the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other women outside are calling for her. Danner drops her notepad, grabs at the doorknob, and frantically tries to turn it to escape. I pucker my lips and blow some of the electrical sparks down onto the pages, making them catch fire. Their precious notes and measurements crackle into ash. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ashes-to-ashes-burn-for-burn-3/page-30.html","bookId":2728,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM"}
