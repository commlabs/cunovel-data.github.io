I was clearly in over my head, like Coop had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced back at me wickedly, \"No. I will own you, I won\u0027t need those other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"You’ve preyed upon my circumstances. You already do own me.\" The sickening truth of it all was killing me inside. He owned me. He kissed me. I had wanted it. The way he had uttered the threat with such confidence was disturbing, and yet, I had wanted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, but it was bitter and harsh, \"Then I guess we won\u0027t have any issues.\" He stepped out of the doorway and let me pass. As I walked by him, he grabbed my arm and held me to the side of him. The heat of his body was intense and yet inviting. I wanted that kind of warmth to cover me. I hated myself for the thought, as it passed through my brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath was irregular, like he wanted to say something or do something, but he didn’t. He left it as another awkward moment between us… us perfect strangers. Perfect strangers who acted like old lovers, but without reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released me and stepped back inside. I noticed, as I walked to the elevator, the men standing in the long hallway. Had they been there when I arrived? My skills needed honing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was obviously out of my league.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed the elevator button and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door behind me opened again. Panic filled me when I heard him cross the hallway towards me. I didn’t look back, I just waited for whatever thing, he was going to do next. He grabbed my arm, spinning me around. He passed me the white envelope but continued to grip my arm for a moment. His eyes sparkled with something, trouble and temptation maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked and let me go. He walked back to the room and closed the door, as the elevator arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to see the bellhop. I blushed and stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my back against the wall of the elevator, and waited for him to call me ma\u0027am once more. I would clip him in the ear with the envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled to breathe until the elevator stopped on the main floor. I walked across the lobby and tried not to feel like a whore, or have a panic attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop was sitting outside in the valet parking with the cab. I climbed in and noticed it wasn’t him, as I closed the door. It was a lady. I had gotten in the wrong cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was young, not quite thirty, and maybe a little bit butch. She grinned back at me, \"Hey, where to?\" and winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"What? Uhm, Jericho drive in Weston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know what to think or do. I didn’t have the money to pay for the cab. I would have to get the Visa from the other envelope and pay with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove for a block and then pulled into a car wash. \"Mind if I wash the car quick? Hit a bird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"No, of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winked again, \"Supa.\" It was super, but she said it like a true Bostonian. Was she a real cabbie? I was about to relax, when she held up a piece of paper as we got into the car wash. I read the writing and pulled out the white envelope and passed it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fished through it and then held up a small, round battery-looking object. She opened the window a bit and tossed it out into the water. She paused a second and then fired the white envelope out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, \"The first one was the decoy. There was one actually pasted into the envelope seams. They\u0027re getting sneakier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"Oh well, they’ve come a long way in the last few years, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her dark-brown eyes, \"I\u0027m Luce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, \"I know. I knew your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoffed, \"Yeah, apparently everyone did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah I didn’t know him like that,\" she laughed and handed me back the picture and the room key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded the picture and keycard and put them in my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn between the water and soap cycle, the car door opened. Coop jumped in and slammed the door. He shook his head and pulled off the wet coat he was wearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was fun.\" he smirked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing? You should have told me, I was getting a different cabbie. Did you hide in the carwash all this time?\" I asked looking around the car wash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Can\u0027t always get the same driver. Duh.\" He leaned forward and slapped Luce on the arm, \"You get the bugs out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared back at him with a deadly stare. Her body looked thicker than mine, how an agent should look. I bet she could bench press me. I looked at my feeble arms and remembered how they used to look. I used to be beefier. Yoga was relaxing, but I wasn’t building any bulk in those classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop turned and smirked, \"How was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, \"I can\u0027t do it. I\u0027m going to have to run for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned back, \"What? Did he hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, and tried not to think about the thing he did do to me. I shook my head, \"No. He was a perfect gentleman,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce looked back and smirked, \"He\u0027s hot, like what-the-hell hot. I’d let him hurt me for an hour or two. Shit, I might hurt him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued laughing and tried to cover my blush, \"Yeah, uhm—wow. When did arms dealers stop looking like Boris Yeltsin or Bin Laden? I actually remember when George Bush Junior was the hot guy in amongst the dictators and presidents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed with me, but Coop frowned, \"He\u0027s a murderer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I got the impression he didn’t think Mel and James were dead. Of course, there is also the fact, he asked me to murder a fat guy in a cliché, gangster white suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce winced, \"No one looks hot in a white suit. Not since Miami Vice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed at her, \"True story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were instant friends. I liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop looked confused. I liked that too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wash ended, forcing Coop to slink back in the seat. He ducked down quickly when Luce started the car and drove out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t kill that man,\" I muttered, not wanting Luce to hear I was all bark and no bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I know, and yet, you have to.\" His eyes twinkled. The steely blue was gone and in its stead was a sarcastic brightness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my eye twitch with nerves, \"You\u0027re getting off on this, aren’t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and snickered, it was a real snicker like a kid would do. \"I am. You are well known as a former female counter Intel agent. It\u0027s fun to see you freak out and not know what the hell to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce turned back as she drove out of the city, \"It\u0027s true. I am honored to be working with you. It\u0027s good to have you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"No. Not back. I\u0027m not working again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a look in the rearview, \"You sure about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, defeated, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop put his hand on mine and squeezed, \"I’ve got this. Trust me okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking into his eyes, I could see it was back. The flash of light and funny was gone. His eyes were almost gray, they were so icy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did trust him. I didn’t know why, but I did. Maybe because, he was mean enough to be capable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Luce dropped me off, Coop whispered, \"See you in five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped and got out, \"Thanks for the ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, \"No worries. See you soon. Vegas baby!!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed the door and walked up to the house. My house, that for the first time, I was scared of. I didn’t know what would be waiting in the house for me. A small part of me wished it were my kids and my mom waiting for me. I would have even taken James, greeting me at the front door. He was the devil, I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, it was dimly lit from the setting sun and frightening. My home felt as fake as everything else. My life was a mess and the road to fixing it seemed outlandish, even to an ex-Intel agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was standing in the middle of the foyer, terrified to enter the rest of the house and be alone in it, when Coop came through the kitchen. He walked across the rooms, making no noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing his silhouette in the shadows of the house, made me feel better—less alone in the world. He whispered, \"You need to get ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whispered back, \"I know.\" But I didn’t know why we were whispering. I had debugged everything, hadn’t I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Six - The Mile-High Club\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrubbed, shaved, used a loofah on everything, and then got out the tools for the plucking and primping. I didn’t know the last time I\u0027d done it and I didn’t want to admit, why I was doing it. Instead, I told myself it was like shedding the skin of the old me. The me that bought all of James\u0027 lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned when I thought about the fact, I was again thinking not-holy thoughts about the arms dealer who had made me want him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to focus on the mean cougar comment from the little shit downstairs. That was a libido killer if anything was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped the mirror dry and looked at my naked reflection. I looked good…pretty good. Okay, not nineteen good or however old Coop really was. Between him and James, I was feeling fairly hideous. James had me doubting my self-esteem and Coop had me doubting my wiles. Servario on the other hand, was making me feel pretty and sexy. In fact, he made me think things I only thought about when I was alone with a one-handed read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned into the mirror and whispered, \"Your kids and your mother need you. This isn’t about revenge sex. You have more self-respect than to let a man have you and not love you. Try to remember that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy libido had gone a long time without any loving and was prepared to wrestle over the matter. It made comments fly through my brain like, \u0027sex is not love\u0027 and \u0027sometimes a little loving can help you get past things or clear your head\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was already justifying dry humping a criminal and possibly enjoying every second of it. His thick arms and sexy lips made me think there was no ‘possibly‘—I was going to enjoy it. I was going to savor it, like it would be the last time. Of course with him, there was a huge chance it might be the last time. Not to mention, I clearly wasn’t great at it, James had fucked everything that moved for a reason. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-12.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
