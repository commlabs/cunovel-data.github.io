Nine? Ten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it was earlier than that,\" the woman says, tilting her head, consulting the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What year did your father move back to Washington from New York?\" Stephen asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the year Mom died,\" I say, running my hand through my hair, eyeing the waiter removing Marina\u0027s half-empty pitcher of iced tea and my beer bottle-a prop I almost reach for just to have something to hold on to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, right,\" the man murmurs, shaking his head sorrowfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman offers a generous, sympathetic smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t dwell on what happened, so it\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that after you were at...?\" Stephen stops again, stuck. \"Where did you go to school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You went to Camden, right?\" the woman asks, guessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it was actually during Camden when it happened,\" I say. \"But she\u0027d been sick a long time.\" I stare at them hard, making them grasp that it really doesn\u0027t matter now. What does is: I\u0027ve forgotten Marina\u0027s last name, what deck she\u0027s on, her room number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the last time we saw you you were practically a baby,\" the man says, chuckling, shifting modes. \"You wouldn\u0027t remember. It was at a fund-raiser at your parents\u0027 place in Georgetown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring a hand to my forehead. \"Dimly, yeah, dimly I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just saw your father a month ago in Washington,\" Lorrie offers. \"Far out,\" I\u0027m saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was at a dinner in a new restaurant on Prospect Street with Sam Nunn, Glen Luchford, Jerome Bunnouvrier and Katharine Graham, as well as two of the forensic experts on the defense team of the O. J. Simpson trial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God,\" I groan. \"I wish I\u0027d been there. It sounds like a blast. I\u0027ve gotta split.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how\u0027s your sister?\" Lorrie asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, she\u0027s cool. She\u0027s in Washington too,\" I\u0027m guessing. \"But I\u0027ve gotta split.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where are you off to?\" Stephen asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now? Back to my cabin,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I meant in Europe,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLorrie keeps smiling at me, staring warmly, sending definite horny vibes my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think Paris,\" I say. \"Actually Cherbourg, then, um, Paris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman immediately glances over at her husband when I say this but ultimately it\u0027s awkwardly done and the director has to retake this simple reaction shot four more times before proceeding to the rest of the scene. \"Action\" is called again and in the background extras resume their positions: old people milling around, the Japanese splashing all over the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Stephen asks. \"What takes you to Paris?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, I\u0027m going to... photograph Jim Morrison\u0027s grave for... Us magazine and... that\u0027s, um, for one, yeah...\" Pausing for emphasis, I then add, \"And I\u0027m also going to visit the Eiffel Tower, which everyone I know says is a \u0027must-see,\u0027 so-o-o...\" I pause again. \"And the Gothic Eurobeat scene is really big just now, so I might check that out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wallaces stare at me blankly. Finally Lorrie clears her throat. \"Where are you staying in Paris?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember hotels Chloe and I stayed at and, avoiding the obvious, choose \"La Villa Hotel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes, on Rue Jacob, just off Boulevard Saint-Germain,\" Lorrie says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the one,\" I say, pointing cheerfully at her. \"I\u0027ve gotta split.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And was that your traveling companion?\" Stephen asks, gesturing at the empty chaise Marina was lounging on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsure of how to answer, I ultimately go with, \"Oh no, not really. I\u0027m on my own.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-101.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
