Jamie tried to protect Gavin\u0027s head by pushing his face into the crook of her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharp pain radiated throughout her body from the stones they rol ed over, and when they finally reached the ledge, Gavin\u0027s body took most of the impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughter was getting closer. Blood poured over Jamie\u0027s left eye, blocking her vision. She wiped the blood away with the back of her hand and then pul ed Gavin back against the rock wall . She was desperately trying to hide them from their enemy. Gavin groaned when she was tucking him under the overhang. She slapped her hand over his mouth and then flattened herself on top of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong minutes passed before she realized the hideous laughter had stopped. Her shoulder and upper arm were throbbing. Jamie reached up to try to rub the ache away. She whimpered when she felt the hilt of the dagger protruding from her arm, and let her hand drop back to her side. She realized that the sharp object had been her dagger—someone had thrown her own dagger at her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard someone cal ing to her, but did not answer until she recognized the voice. \"Marcus! We\u0027re here, on the ledge,\" Jamie shouted then, though her relief was so great it weakened her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, Jamie, what—\" Marcus asked when he leaned over the edge of the cliff and saw Jamie\u0027s bloody face peering up at him. \"Give me your hand, lass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful, Marcus. Don\u0027t kneel so close to the edge. Someone tried to hurt Gavin and me. Look behind you to make certain it\u0027s safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus did as she ordered, and when he turned back to her, the look on his face began to frighten her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavin\u0027s injured,\" she rushed out, ignoring his outstretched hand again. \"If I leave him, he might rol off the ledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus nodded. When he started to withdraw his hand, Jamie suddenly reached up and grabbed hold. \"I want Alec,\" she cried. \"But I don\u0027t want you to leave us here, Marcus. Please don\u0027t leave us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior gave her hand a good squeeze. \"Hold on to Gavin, Jamie. I won\u0027t leave you. I\u0027l shout for help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought that was the most wonderful idea she\u0027d ever heard and told him so in long, rambling sentences. Her mind was so fil ed with pain now, she could barely make any sense. \"Jamie, let go of my hand. I know you trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a tender smile. \" \u0027Tis the reason you grabbed hold of me,\" he told her. \"Now you must let go of me. Hold Gavin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d kept his voice soft, soothing. \"Yes,\" she agreed, trying to keep her concentration on what he\u0027d told her. \"Hold Gavin. I will , Marcus. I\u0027l protect him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally let go of his hand. \"That\u0027s a good lass,\" she heard him say as she scooted back to Gavin. She put Gavin\u0027s head in her lap. \"Alec will be here in just a few minutes, Gavin. Marcus will keep us safe until he arrives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus\u0027s deep bel ow sent several pebbles cascading down the slope. Jamie closed her eyes against the noise. The ledge suddenly started spinning around and around until all her thoughts began to whirl together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she couldn\u0027t think at all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie didn\u0027t wake up until she felt someone pul ing on her hands. She opened her eyes and saw Alec bending over her. \"Alec,\" she whispered in wonder. She tried to reach out to him, but the pain in her upper arm stopped her. She managed a weak smile instead, as she noticed she was still on the ledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was grim. When she noticed that, she began to frown. \"Don\u0027t build me a box. Promise me, Alec. Don\u0027t build me a box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tel by his puzzled look that he didn\u0027t know what she was talking about. \"You were going to build Angus a box,\" she reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t build you a box, love,\" Alec whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled again. \"I\u0027m so happy to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands shook. \"I\u0027m happy to see you, too,\" he told her in a gruff voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lost my dagger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked as though she was having as much difficulty as he was believing that statement. She frowned up at him while he gently brushed her hair away from her face, trying to remember the other question she wanted to ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave up after a minute. \"Alec, the dagger—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about your dagger, love,\" Alec soothed. \"Can you move your legs, Jamie? I want to take you into my arms and lift you up to my men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweetheart, let go of Gavin now. Let me—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, love, Gavin,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie looked down when Alec started prying her hands away from Gavin\u0027s chest. She remembered everything then. \"He was hit by a rock,\" she said. \"The blow knocked him backwards, Alec. He was going to fal over the steep edge. I got behind him,\" she rushed on. \"He was so heavy. I couldn\u0027t keep him from fal ing, so I put my arms around his waist and pushed us both down toward the slope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at her husband, ignoring his worried grimace. \"I couldn\u0027t remember which direction, but I guessed the right way, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did,\" he told her in a hoarse whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to take him up first,\" she ordered. Her voice was surprisingly clear now; she was so blissful y relieved to have Alec taking charge she wanted to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec decided not to argue with her. He eased Gavin up, over his shoulders in much the same way a woman would wear a shawl, and then stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis legs were braced apart for balance as he slowly lifted the sleeping soldier high above his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got his hands,\" Marcus shouted down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec moved Gavin\u0027s legs away from the rock once the weight was taken away. He knelt down beside Jamie again. His eyes looked suspiciously misty to her. She realized then that she must have caused him considerable worry. \"I\u0027m going to be fine, Alec. I told you I wouldn\u0027t leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t believe she was trying to comfort him. \"No, you\u0027re not going to leave me,\" he muttered affectionately. \"I can see the blood on your face is all bluster,\" he added, remembering those words from her remarks about Angus\u0027s chest wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dagger\u0027s in my shoulder,\" she blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t show any reaction to that statement. Jamie immediately decided the injury wasn\u0027t as horrible as she imagined. Stil , she needed to have him tel her so before she quit her worrying. \"Is it awful, Alec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he answered. \"It isn\u0027t in your shoulder, either, Jamie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can feel it,\" she argued. She tried to turn her head to look for herself, but Alec grabbed hold of her chin. \"It\u0027s in your upper arm,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re most fortunate. It went through the fat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any fat,\" Jamie argued. She watched him tear a strip from his plaid, yet stil didn\u0027t guess what his intent was. \"Clear through, Alec? Oh, God, it\u0027s going to hurt something fierce when it\u0027s—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never finished her sentence. Alec had the dagger out of her flesh as quick as lightning and was wrapping the strip of cloth around her arm before she could get enough strength back to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There! That didn\u0027t hurt, did it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It did!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush, love,\" he soothed. \"You would have worried about the dagger coming out until you\u0027d made yourself sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right and they both knew it. \"If you had to get yourself stabbed, I imagine you picked the best spot. The dagger didn\u0027t hit bone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a gasp. \"I knew you\u0027d think this was all my fault,\" she told him. Her mind concentrated on his contrary remark and she barely noticed Alec had lifted her into his arms and was slowly standing up. \"I didn\u0027t get myself stabbed and you damn well know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, love, but it\u0027s good of you to remind me,\" he told her. He was lifting her above his head now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie started to look down. He felt her tense in his grasp. He thought to warn her not to look down, then decided against it. His caution would only remind her of her precarious position. \"At least you found your dagger,\" he announced, sounding outrageously cheerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is that,\" she snapped. \"Alec, you\u0027re hurting me,\" she cried out when his hand accidental y brushed against her arm. She closed her eyes against the excruciating pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Jamie. I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you, lass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agony in his voice tugged at her heart. \"It didn\u0027t hurt overly much,\" she said quickly. She felt someone lifting her away from Alec and opened her eyes again. Marcus had her in his arms an instant or two later, and then Alec was over the rise again and she was gently given back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt barely bothered her injuries at all when Alec gained his stal ion. He kept her well cushioned in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis strength was such a comfort to her. She sighed against his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why haven\u0027t you asked me if I saw the attacker?\" she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know who it was,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I know, too,\" Jamie whispered. \"But you\u0027l have to give me the name first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that didn\u0027t make any sense, and Alec\u0027s grim expression suggested he\u0027d rather not discuss the topic now. She ignored the suggestion, of course, and asked, \"Who was the witness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What witness?\" he asked. His concentration centered on keeping his stal ion at an easy gait, and he barely took the time to look down at his wife\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The witness to Helena\u0027s death,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours later, Jamie was propped up in her bed in the great hall . Alec had kicked the screen to the floor in his hurry to get her settled. The screen had been carried outside and the hall was now crowded with her clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec tended to her injuries. She\u0027d given him instructions about the proper powders to use, and made him refashion the bandage on her arm twice before she was satisfied. Gavin was awake, too. He had a fierce headache. Jamie wouldn\u0027t let anyone give him any ale, though. She ordered cold cloths on his head and water to drink. He\u0027d have to suffer through his headache, she dictated from her bed, and that was that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie never made a sound or showed a grimace while she was being patched up. In truth, vanity was her real motive, not courage. She wasn\u0027t about to act cowardly in front of her relatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Murdock had made that task easy for her. The dear priest sat on the edge of the bed and held her hand all during Alec\u0027s work. Little Mary Kathleen was carried in and settled next to her mother when Alec was finished. The three-year-old started crying when she saw the bandage on Jamie\u0027s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec soothed the child by tel ing her to give her mother a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary immediately did as Alec suggested and was rewarded by her mama\u0027s surprised announcement that she was feeling ever so much better now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl fel asleep a few minutes later, cuddled up against Jamie\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie saw Marcus motion to Alec. \"You\u0027ve found her, then?\" she called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one answered her. Alec started toward the door. \"Alec, bring Annie inside,\" she said. \"I want to ask her why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec shook his head. \"I\u0027l listen to what she has to say outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027l decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Murdock squeezed Jamie\u0027s hand when she started to cal out to her husband again. \"Leave it in his hands, lass. He\u0027s a compassionate man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie nodded. \"He doesn\u0027t like admitting it, but he is compassionate. Annie\u0027s mind is twisted,\" she whispered. \"Alec will remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the sound of that horrid, inhuman laughter fil ed the hall and she found herself clutching the priest\u0027s hand for comfort. Annie\u0027s words lashed out with the sting of a whip. The venom she screeched was made worse by her singsong tone of voice. \"I\u0027l be your wife, I will . No matter how long it takes me, Kincaid. It\u0027s my right. My right. Helena took you away from me. I chal enged you then, Alec, and I\u0027l chal enge you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie heard another loud burst of laughter, and then Annie started chanting again. \"I\u0027l kil again and again and again until you\u0027ve learned your lesson. It\u0027s my right to stand beside you. It\u0027s—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden silence, after such demoniacal sounds, was startling to Jamie. She tried to get out of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay where you are, Jamie,\" Gavin ordered from the foot of the bed. He loomed over her like an angry avenger. His command was ruined when he put his hands to his head and groaned. \"I shouldn\u0027t have yel ed at you, milady, but Alec wants you to stay put.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have yel ed at me because it made your head pound,\" Jamie countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, too,\" Gavin admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie moved her feet out of the way just in the nick of time. Gavin col apsed on the foot of her bed and let out another pitiful groan as he fel back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe guessed he was trying to turn her attention away from the happenings outside by demanding her sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have complete faith in my husband,\" she told Gavin. \"You needn\u0027t carry on so to turn my concentration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I can have a drink of ale?\" Gavin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bed is getting damn crowded,\" Alec announced from the top of the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie smiled. She waited until he\u0027d kissed her properly before asking, \"It\u0027s finished?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Alec? You were supposed to marry her, weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edgar had planned to unite the Kincaids with their clan to gain peace. I was pledged to Annie, aye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s so much younger than you…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s only one year younger than you, Jamie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seems so much a child stil ,\" she whispered. \"Edgar changed his mind after Helena\u0027s husband died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec nodded. \"He did. Helena was carrying her babe, and the king wanted to give her a good home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie nodded, understanding. And then she gave him a magnificent smile. He had to shake his head over her strange reaction. \"She didn\u0027t want to leave you either, Alec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stil didn\u0027t comprehend her joy until she turned to Father Murdock and said, \"Tomorrow you\u0027l have to bless Helena\u0027s grave. She must have a requiem mass, too. The entire clan must be there, Alec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want her to be reburied in consecrated ground, Jamie?\" Father Murdock asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"We\u0027l extend the consecrated cemetery to include that whole section. Alec and I will , of course, be buried next to Helena. It is fitting, isn\u0027t it, husband?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-43.html","bookId":1852,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM"}
