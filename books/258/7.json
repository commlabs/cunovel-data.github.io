RUTHVEN\u0027S STORY.","content":"\"I am so glad to see you both back, safe and sound!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was Mrs. Alice Ruthven who spoke, as she embraced first her daughter and then Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And we are glad enough to get back, mother,\" answered Marion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was so frightened, even after Old Ben went after you. We watched the lightning, and when it struck the wreck——\" Mrs. Ruthven stopped speaking and gave a shiver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We weren\u0027t in such very great danger,\" answered Jack. Then he looked at the lady curiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it, Jack? You have something on your mind,\" she said quickly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The youth looked at Marian, who turned red.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I—I—that is, mother, Jack knows the truth,\" faltered the girl.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The truth?\" repeated Mrs. Ruthven slowly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Marion has told me the truth,\" said Jack, in as steady a voice as he could command. \"And so I—I—am not your son.\" He could scarcely speak the words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Jack!\" The lady caught him in her arms. \"So you know the truth at last?\" She kissed him. \"But you are my son, just as if you were my own flesh and blood. You are not angry at me for keeping this a secret so long? I did it because I did not wish to hurt your feelings.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I am not angry at you, Mrs. Ruth——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Call me mother, Jack.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am not angry, mother. You have been very kind to me. But it is so strange! I can\u0027t understand it all,\" and he heaved a deep sigh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have been a son to me in the past, Jack; I wish you to continue to be one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I have no real claim upon you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, you have, for my late husband and myself adopted you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Marion told me that you never heard one word regarding my past.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She told the truth. We tried our best, but every effort ended in failure. Your mother called you Jack ere she died, and that was all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What of our clothing? Was none of it marked, or had she nothing in her pocket?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, the clothing was not marked, and she had nothing in her pocket but a lace handkerchief, also unmarked. That handkerchief I have kept, with the clothing. And I have also kept a ring she wore upon one of her fingers.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Was that marked?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It had been, but it was so worn that we could not make out the marking, nor could the two jewelers by whom we had the ring inspected.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would like to see the ring.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will get it,\" returned Mrs. Ruthven, and left the room. Soon she came back with a small jewel casket, from which she took a ring and a very dainty lace handkerchief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here is the ring,\" she said, as she passed it over to Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It looks like a wedding ring,\" said the youth, as he gazed at the circlet of gold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I believe it is a wedding ring.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack looked inside and saw some markings, but all were so faint that it was impossible to make out more than the figures 1 and 8.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Those figures stand for eighteen hundred and something, I imagine,\" said Mrs. Ruthven. \"They must give the year when your mother was married.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose you are right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The ring belongs to you, Jack. I would advise you to be careful of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you please, I would like to have you keep it for the present.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will do that willingly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The handkerchief was next examined. But it seemed to be without markings of any kind, and was soon returned to the jewel case along with the ring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now tell me how Marion came to tell you of the past,\" said Mrs. Ruthven, after putting the jewel case away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I made her tell me the truth,\" said Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But how did you suspect this at first?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because of something St. John said to Darcy Gilbert.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What did he say?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, it doesn\u0027t matter much—now, mother. He told Darcy I wasn\u0027t your son.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What else did he say?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, I think I had better not say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you must tell me, Jack; I insist upon knowing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He told Darcy that I was a nobody, and that I would have to go away some day.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At these words Mrs. Ruthven\u0027s face flushed angrily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"St. John is taking too much upon his shoulders,\" she cried. \"This is no business of his.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I may be a nobody, but, but\"—Jack stammered—\"if he says anything to me, I am afraid there will be a row.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He shall not say anything to you. I will speak to him about this. Leave it all to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But he shall not insult me,\" said Jack sturdily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marion had left the apartment, to change her clothing, so she did not hear what was said about St. John. A few words more on the subject passed between the lady of the plantation and the youth, and then the talk shifted back to Jack\u0027s past.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Some day I am going to find out who I am.\" said the boy. \"There must be some way to do this.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you then so anxious to leave me, Jack?\" asked Mrs. Ruthven, and the tears sprang into her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no, mother; I will not leave you so long as you wish me to stay!\" he exclaimed. \"It isn\u0027t that. But this mystery of the past must be solved.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I will help you all I can. But do not hope for too much, my boy, or you may be disappointed,\" and then she embraced him again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Running up to his bedroom, Jack quickly changed the suit which had been soaked the night before for a better one, and then came below again. He hardly knew what to do with himself. The news had set his head in a whirl. At last he decided to go out riding on a pony Mrs. Ruthven had given him a few weeks before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The pony was soon saddled by one of the stable hands, and Jack set off on a level road running between the two Ruthven plantations. At first he thought to ask Marion to accompany him, but then decided that he was in no humor to have anybody along.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I must think this out by myself,\" was the way he reasoned, and set off at a brisk pace under the wide-spreading trees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was less than quarter of a mile away from home when he came face to face with St. John, who was returning from his visit to Old Ben\u0027s boathouse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the two riders approached each other, the young man glared darkly at our hero.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hullo, where are you bound?\" he demanded sharply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think that is any of your business, St. John,\" replied Jack, who was just then in no humor to be polite.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Humph! you needn\u0027t get on your high horse about it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am not on a high horse, only on a small pony.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t joke me, Jack—I don\u0027t like it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As you please, St. John.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s got into you this morning?\" demanded the young man curiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, if you want to know, I don\u0027t like the way you have been talking about me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oho! so that is how the wind blows.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have taken the pains to call me a nobody,\" went on Jack hotly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I told the truth, didn\u0027t I?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I consider myself just as good as you, St. John Ruthven.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you indeed!\" sneered the spendthrift.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do indeed, and in the future I will thank you to be more careful of what you say about me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have a right to tell the truth to anybody I please.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t deny that. But I consider my blood just as good as yours.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you? I don\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your opinion isn\u0027t worth anything to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Humph! still riding a high horse, I see. Let me tell you, you are not half as good as a Ruthven, and never will be. How my aunt could take you in is a mystery to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She is not as hard-hearted as you are.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She is very foolish.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She is my foster mother, and I\u0027ll thank you to speak respectfully of her,\" cried Jack, his eyes flashing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course you\u0027ll stick by her—as long as she\u0027ll let you. You have a nice ax to grind.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t understand your last words.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She owns considerable property, and you will try to get a big share of it for yourself, when she dies.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have never given her property a thought. I want only what is rightfully coming to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is nothing coming to you by right. The property ought to go to Marion and the other Ruthvens.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"By other Ruthvens I suppose you mean yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am one of them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you so anxious to get hold of my aunt\u0027s plantation?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t want to see my aunt waste it on such a low upstart as you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack\u0027s eyes flashed fire, and riding close to St. John he held up his little riding whip.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You shan\u0027t call me an upstart!\" he ejaculated. \"Take it back, or I\u0027ll hit you with this!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You won\u0027t dare to touch me!\" howled St. John in a rage. \"You are an upstart, and worse, to my way of thinking.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scarcely had the words left his lips when Jack brought down the riding whip across the young man\u0027s shoulders and neck, leaving a livid red mark behind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh!\" howled the spendthrift, and gave a jerk backward on the reins, which brought his horse up on his hind legs. \"How dare you! I\u0027ll—I\u0027ll kill you for that!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you take it back or not?\" went on Jack, raising the whip again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Instead of replying St. John reached over to hit the youth with his own whip. But Jack dodged, and then struck out a second time. The blow landed upon St. John\u0027s hand, and he jerked back quickly. The movement scared the horse, and the animal plunged so violently that the rider was thrown from the saddle into some nearby bushes. Then the horse galloped away, leaving St. John to his fate.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3023/83624.html","bookId":258,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:58:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:58:59 AM"}
