We\u0027re going to have to improve your line, love. Do you have any idea how trite it is??\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you feeling horny, darling??Get out your little black book and we\u0027ll try to find someone who\u0027s available for you tonight?It was as though he needed to exorcise her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided he would see her once more, to give her the comeuppance she deserved, and then forget about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTANNER WAITED THREE days and telephoned. \"Princess?\" \"Who is this?\" He was ready to slam down the phone. How many goddamn men called her Princess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe managed to keep his voice calm. \"This is Tanner Kingsley.\" \"Oh, yes. How are you?\" Her tone was completely indifferent. I\u0027ve made a mistake, Tanner thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should never have called her. \"I thought we could have dinner again sometime, but you\u0027re probably busy, so let\u0027s forget-\" \"What about this evening?\" Tanner was caught off guard again. He could not wait to teach the bitch a lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOUR HOURS LATER, Tanner was seated across a table from Paula Cooper at a small French restaurant east of Lexington Avenue. He was surprised by how pleased he was to see her again. He had forgotten how vital and alive she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve missed you, Princess,\" Tanner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Oh, I\u0027ve missed you, too. You\u0027re really something. You\u0027re very special.\" They were his words coming back to him, mocking him. Damn her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like the evening was going to be a replay of their last meeting. On Tanner\u0027s other romantic evenings, he had always been the one who controlled the conversation. With Princess, he had the unsettling feeling that she was always one step ahead of him. She had a quick comeback for everything he had to say. She was witty and swift and took no nonsense from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women Tanner dated were beautiful and willing, but for the first time in his life, Tanner felt that perhaps something had been missing. They had been too easy. They were all agreeable, but they were too agreeable. There was no challenge. Paula, on the other hand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about you,\" Tanner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"My father was rich and powerful and I grew up as a spoiled brat-maids and butlers-waiters to serve us at the swimming pool, Radcliffe, and a finishing school-the whole bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen my father lost it all and died. I\u0027ve been working as an executive assistant to a politician.\" \"Are you enjoying it?\" \"No. He\u0027s boring.\" Her eyes met his. \"I\u0027m looking for someone more interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE NEXT DAY, Tanner called again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Princess?\" \"I was hoping you would call, Tanner.\" Her voice was inviting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner felt a small frisson of pleasure. \"Were you?\" \"Yes. Where are you taking me to dinner tonight?\" He laughed. \"Anywhere you would like to go.\" \"I\u0027d like to go to Maxim\u0027s in Paris, but I\u0027ll settle for going anywhere if I can be with you.\" She had thrown him off guard again, but for some reason, her words warmed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY HAD DINNER at La Cote Basque on Fifty-fifth Street, and throughout dinner, Tanner kept looking at her and wondering why he was so attracted to her. It was not her looks; it was her mind and personality that were dazzling. Her whole essence blazed with intelligence and self-confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was the most independent woman he had ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir conversations ranged over myriad subjects, and Tanner found her to be remarkably knowledgeable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want to do with your life, Princess?\" She studied Tanner a moment before answering. \"I want power?the power to make things happen.\" Tanner smiled. \"Then we\u0027re a lot alike.\" \"How many women have you said that to, Tanner?\" He found himself getting angry. \"Will you stop doing that? When I say you\u0027re different from any woman I\u0027ve ever-\" \"Ever what?\" Tanner said, exasperated. \"You frustrate me.\" \"Poor darling. If you\u0027re frustrated, why don\u0027t you go take a shower-?\" The anger started again. He had had enough. He rose. \"Never mind. There\u0027s no use trying to-\" -at my place.\" Tanner could hardly believe what he was hearing. \"Your place?\" \"Yes, I have a little pied-a-terre on Park Avenue,\" she said. \"Would you like to take me home?\" They skipped dessert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE LITTLE PIED-A-TERRE was a sumptuous apartment, beautifully furnished. Tanner looked around, amazed at how luxurious it was, and how elegant. The apartment suited her: an eclectic collection of paintings, a refectory table, a large chandelier, an Italian settee, and a set of six Chippendale chairs and a couch. That was all that Tanner had time to see before she said, \"Come see my bedroom.\" The bedroom was done in white, with all-white furniture, and a large mirrored ceiling over the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner looked around and said, \"I\u0027m impressed. This is the most-\" \"Shh.\" Paula began to undress him. \"We can talk later.\" When she had finished undressing Tanner, she started slowly taking off her own clothes. She had a body that was erotic perfection. Her arms were around Tanner and she was pressed against him, and she put her lips to his ear and whispered, \"That\u0027s enough foreplay.\" They were in bed and she was ready for him, and when he was inside her, she squeezed her hips and thighs tightly together and then relaxed them, and squeezed again and repeated it, getting Tanner more and more excited. She kept shifting her body slightly, so that each sensation was different for him. She gave him voluptuous gifts he had never imagined, stimulating him to an ecstatic pitch of excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch later, they talked far into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were together every evening after that. Princess was constantly surprising Tanner with her humor and charm, and gradually, in his eyes, she had become beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eONE MORNING, ANDREW said to Tanner, \"I\u0027ve never seen you smile so much. Is it a woman?\" Tanner nodded. \"Yes.\" \"Is it serious? Are you going to marry her?\" \"I\u0027ve been thinking about it.\" Andrew regarded Tanner for a moment. \"Maybe you should tell her.\" Tanner squeezed Andrew\u0027s arm. \"Maybe I will.\" The following night, Tanner and Princess were alone in her apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner began, \"Princess, you once asked me to say to you something I had never said to a woman before.\" \"Yes, darling?\" \"Here it is. I want you to marry me.\" There was a moment\u0027s hesitation, and she grinned and flew into his arms. \"Oh, Tanner!\" He looked into her eyes. \"Is that a yes?\" \"I want to marry you, darling, but-I\u0027m afraid we have a problem.\" \"What problem?\" \"I told you. I want to do something important. I want enough power to make things happen-to change things. And the root of that is money. How can we have a future together if you don\u0027t have a future?\" Tanner took her hand. \"There\u0027s no problem. I own half of an important business, Princess. One day I\u0027m going to make enough money to give you everything you want.\" She shook her head. \"No. Your brother, Andrew, tells you what to do. I know all about you two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe won\u0027t let the company grow, and I need more than you can give me now.\" \"You\u0027re wrong.\" Tanner reflected a moment. \"I want you to meet Andrew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE THREE OF them had lunch the following day. Paula was charming, and it was obvious that Andrew liked her immediately. Andrew had been worried about some of the women his brother had been taking out. This one was different. She was personable and intelligent and witty. Andrew looked over at his brother, and his nod meant \"good choice.\" Paula said, \"I think that what Kingsley Group is doing is wonderful, Andrew, helping so many people around the world. Tanner\u0027s told me all about it.\" \"I\u0027m grateful that we can do it. And we\u0027re going to do even more.\" \"You mean the company\u0027s going to expand?\" \"Not in that sense. I mean that we\u0027re going to send more people to more countries where they can be helpful.\" Tanner said quickly, \"Then we\u0027ll start to get contracts for assignments here and-\" Andrew smiled. \"Tanner is so impatient. There\u0027s no hurry. Let\u0027s do what we were meant to do first, Tanner. Help others.\" Tanner looked over at Princess. Her expression was noncommittal. The next day, Tanner telephoned. \"Hi, Princess. What time should I pick you up?\" There was a moment of silence. \"Darling, I\u0027m so sorry. I can\u0027t keep our date tonight.\" Tanner was caught by surprise. \"Is anything wrong?\" \"No. A friend of mine is in town and I have to see him.\" Him? Tanner felt a pang of jealousy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand. Then tomorrow night we\u0027ll-\" \"No, I can\u0027t tomorrow. Why don\u0027t we make it Monday?\" She was going to spend the weekend with whoever it was. Tanner hung up, worried and frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMONDAY NIGHT, PRINCESS apologized. \"I\u0027m sorry about the weekend, darling. It\u0027s just that this is an old friend who came to town to see me.\" Into Tanner\u0027s mind flashed a picture of Princess\u0027s beautiful apartment. There was no way she could afford that on a salary. \"Who is he?\" \"I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t tell you his name. He\u0027s-he\u0027s too well known and he doesn\u0027t like publicity.\" \"Are you in love with him?\" She took Tanner\u0027s hand and said softly, \"Tanner, I\u0027m in love with you. And only you.\" \"Is he in love with you?\" She hesitated. \"Yes.\" Tanner thought: I have to find a way to give her everything she wants. I can\u0027t lose her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NEXT DAY, at 4:58 a.m., Andrew Kingsley was awakened by the sound of his ringing telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a call for you from Sweden. Hold on, please.\" A moment later, a voice with a slight Swedish accent said: \"Congratulations, Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley. The Nobel Committee has chosen you to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for this year, for your innovative work in nanotechnology? The Nobel Prize! When the conversation was over, Andrew hurriedly dressed and went straight to his office. The minute Tanner arrived, Andrew rushed to tell his brother the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner threw his arms around him. \"The Nobel! That\u0027s wonderful, Andrew!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonderful!\" And it was. Because now all of Tanner\u0027s problems were about to be solved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later, Tanner was talking to Princess. \"Do you see what this means, darling? Now that Kingsley Group has a Nobel Prize, we can get all the business we can handle. I\u0027m talking about big government contracts and huge corporations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be able to give you the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fabulous, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you marry me?\" \"Tanner, I want to marry you more than anything in the world.\" When Tanner replaced the receiver, he was euphoric. He hurried into his brother\u0027s office. \"Andrew, I\u0027m getting married.\" Andrew looked up and said warmly, \"That\u0027s good news. When is the wedding?\" \"We\u0027ll set it up soon. The whole staff will be invited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN TANNER WENT into his office the following morning, Andrew was waiting for him. He was wearing a boutonniere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that for?\" Andrew grinned. \"I\u0027m getting ready for your wedding. I\u0027m so happy for you.\" \"Thank you, Andrew.\" The news spread quickly. Since the wedding had not been officially announced, no one said anything to Tanner, but there were knowing looks and smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTANNER WENT INTO his brother\u0027s office. \"Andrew, with the Nobel, everybody will be coming to us. And with the prize money-\" Andrew interrupted. \"With the prize money, we can afford to hire more people to send to Eritrea and Uganda.\" Tanner said slowly, \"But you\u0027re going to use this award to build up this business, aren\u0027t you?\" Andrew shook his head. \"We\u0027re doing just what we set out to do, Tanner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner looked at his brother a long moment. \"It\u0027s your company, Andrew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTANNER TELEPHONED HER as soon as he had made his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Princess, I have to go to Washington on business. You may not hear from me for a day or two.\" She said teasingly, \"No blondes, brunettes, or redheads.\" \"No chance. You\u0027re the only woman in the world I\u0027m in love with.\" \"And I\u0027m in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE FOLLOWING MORNING, Tanner Kingsley was at the Pentagon, meeting with the army chief of staff, General Alan Barton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought your proposal was very interesting,\" General Barton said. \"We were discussing whom we were going to use for the test.\" \"Your test involves micro-nanotechnology, and my brother just got a Nobel Prize for his work in it.\" \"We are well aware of that.\" \"He is so excited about this that he would like to do it pro bono.\" \"We\u0027re flattered, Mr. Kingsley. We don\u0027t have many Nobel laureates offering their services.\" He looked up to make sure the door was closed. \"This is top secret. If it works, it\u0027s going to be one of the most important components of our armament. Molecular nano-technology can give us control of the physical world at the level of individual atoms. Until now, efforts to make chips even smaller than they are have been blocked by the electron interference called \u0027cross talk,\u0027 when electrons are uncontrolled. If this experiment is successful, it will give us significant new defense weapons and attack weapons.\" Tanner said, \"There\u0027s no danger to this experiment, is there? I don\u0027t want anything to happen to my brother.\" \"You need not worry. We will send over all the equipment you need, including the safe suits and two of our scientists to work with your brother.\" \"Then we have a go-ahead?\" \"You have a go-ahead.\" On his way back to New York, Tanner thought, Now all I have to do is convince Andrew. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-17.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
