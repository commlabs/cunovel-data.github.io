He stops outside of a doorway and nods, \"Same as last time. You ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. It\u0027s true, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m scared of losing the thing I can\u0027t live without.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe points, \"I\u0027ll go first, stay close and the lights will come on for me, not you. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swipes and enters the large lab. The lights flick on, but we don’t get two steps before a man comes up to Bernie, \"What are you doing here?\" He\u0027s older with a gray beard. He\u0027s not my father, I can tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie nods back at me, \"You all are acting crazy tonight. This chick told me I wasn’t allowed to come in the building unaccompanied. I told her I don’t need a guard, but she won\u0027t listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man glances at my gun and nods, \"She\u0027s right. We are on lock down. The prisoner we have back there is Michael\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose, \"I guess I have to tell you too. Michael wants him injected with a 3507. He wants to be able to track him. He asked me to come do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looks confused, \"A tracker? Why? The man\u0027s in a coma. He ain\u0027t going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie tilts his head, \"That group of rebels may come and take him; Michael is sure they\u0027ll try the city gates tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man steps aside, \"Just be fast. I don’t want anyone up here tonight.\" He gives me a look, \"You stay with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, confused at his gullibility. These people have lived safely in these walls too long. Morons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie walks us both to the back of the room. He scans the lab door, opening it for me. My gut kicks in when I see Will lying on the table. He\u0027s relaxed and clean again, naked from the waist up, with a large, white bandage on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door closes, I take a step towards Will but Bernie makes a noise, \"No miss, you stand over to the side, please. I don’t want you interfering with my work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell by his tone, we are being watched. I step to the side, pressing my back against the wall and waiting as he grabs a huge needle from the case. He leans over the computer next to the case and starts typing. The seconds feel like hours. The ten feet between me and Will feel like miles. His breath is funny and forced. The machine next to him makes his chest lift and fall. It makes him live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie stands, grabbing the huge needle and glances at me, \"Come hold his arm down, just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it\u0027s the moment he\u0027s giving me to say goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay my gun against the wall and take the couple steps I need to, to be next to his bed. Hesitantly and slightly shaky, I lift my fingers to his forearm, holding his warm skin in my hands for what might be the last time. His stern smile flashes in my eyes, but I push it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie leans across him with the needle, \"He may jump, hold him down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, gripping tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill makes a funny noise, tossing his head a little. His eyes flutter for a second and hope fills me, but then he settles back in. Bernie injects the huge needle into his arm. Will tenses. I hold him still, fighting my tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like a thousand whispers pass between my fingers and his arm. A thousand things I needed to say, or just one maybe. One thing to make sure he knows. I nearly lower my face onto his chest and close my eyes; he\u0027s become my human Leo. I can sob into his chest just like Leo\u0027s and feel the same safety and comfort. His arms wrap around me the same way. He makes the world be quiet for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeeze once more and a subtle smile creeps across his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie pulls the needle out. I don’t move though. I hold his arm, like it\u0027s the only thing stopping me from going nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep down, I know nothing is going to stop me when he\u0027s gone. I\u0027ll kill everyone. I know that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie smiles like he\u0027s about to sell me something, \"Okay, let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks to the door. I let go of Will, turning my back slowly, and try not to feel every step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie closes the door, leaving nonchalantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights flick on, leaving it dark behind us where the door was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the gray beard walks towards us, constantly in the light as they switch on for him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie nods, \"Yup. Have a good night, Frank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Night, Bernie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get into the stairwell and Bernie slumps against the wall. He takes a huge breath, \"Okay. We gotta find that HEMP.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"What did you inject him with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, \"A 3507. Now if they try taking him anywhere, we can find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that going to hurt him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk down the stairs, \"Where is this black lab?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks back, \"I think it\u0027s across the street. Michael\u0027s got a secret lab he thinks none of us know about. I didn’t know it was called the black lab. The HEMP is under the lab, I guess.\" He jogs down the stairs, shouting back at me, \"I assumed it was where he was making his monsters. I sort of lost interest in that, after I started seeing the mess we were making.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip the gun tighter and follow him to the bottom of the stairs. He stops and smirks, \"I wonder…\" He walks to a door, swiping his pass at the scanner. It doesn’t open. He gets a grin on his face, and drops to his knees, and pulls something from his pocket. He works on the scanner for a minute and then scans his pass again. The door opens. He gives me a look, \"Kill anyone we see in here, that’s our only option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and walk in after him. He says it all grim and frightened, but I planned on that anyway. I don’t tell him that. He already looks at me like I\u0027m scary; we don’t need to make it worse. I pass him my gun, \"Don’t shoot unless I say shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows and nods. I pull my bloodstained knife out of my boot and creep ahead in the long corridor. It\u0027s narrow and lit with sporadic, round wall lights. They are dim and orange, and remind me of the light in Brian\u0027s bunker. I grip the knife, creeping along the wall, listening to everything and nothing, all at once. I don’t like narrow hallways, I decide this now. I like the openness of the forest. This feels like I might never escape or the walls are going to close in on me. Bernie\u0027s careless footsteps are the thing I hear until a cough fills the silence. I put a hand up, halting Bernie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance around the corner ahead of me, seeing a man with a gun and his hand against his lips. He coughs again and leans into the wall. I tuck the blade behind my back and walk toward him slowly, not making any sounds. He yawns and closes his eyes for a second. I almost stop and wait for him to open his eyes, but the coward in me pushes on. I pull the blade softly, not making a sound, and swing it wide as I reach him. His eyes fly open, but it\u0027s too late. His jugular is hit. He drops his gun, but I catch it as he slumps along the wall, bleeding out. I sling the rifle over my shoulder and tiptoe further down the hall. I reach a door and look back at Bernie. He pulls out the screwdriver he had before and drops to his knees, fiddling with it like the other one. He scans and the door unlocks. I push it open, peeking around the corners for movement. The area is completely dark. I step in and the light flicks on above me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate this city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie closes the door, standing under the light with me. The hallway only goes one way, so I walk ahead with the lights announcing me to anyone who is ahead. I can\u0027t see into the black oblivion of the rest of the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath speeds up with my heartbeat. I don’t know that we\u0027re in the right place, or that we\u0027ll see anything that helps. I don’t know if that was the last time I\u0027ll ever see Will alive. I don’t know anything, but that my feet don’t want to take any more steps, and my heart is aching like there is no tomorrow. Granny used to say that, ‘like there is no tomorrow.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop when the lights show a door. Bernie opens it and closes it, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe move ahead, keeping a close eye on the darkness, and the fact it isn’t moving or making noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body hair is standing on end. I have a disturbing feeling that the infected are going to pop out any second. They always manage to when it\u0027s dark and creepy and you\u0027re lost. They may be brain dead, but they have an uncanny ability to time their arrivals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands start shaking as I round another corner. Bernie is opening every door he sees, but is still moving along behind me. I reach the end of the hallway and glance back at him. In the white light of the spotlight, I see the frustration on his face. I feel it too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re wasting time. Will could be dying upstairs, Anna could be getting discovered, or Jake and Sarah could be fighting for their lives at the house. He sighs and messes with the scanner on the door and opens it. There is a flight of stairs before us. The lights are the dim, orange, round ones—thank God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie smiles, \"About time.\" He walks ahead into the dim light and looks down over the edge of the metal staircase. It looks flimsy, and when we step on it, our steps echo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I don’t like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"Me either.\" He starts down the stairs, but I grab his arm, \"Let me go first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slip past him, wiping sweat from my brow. My footsteps are slightly quieter than his on the metal stairs. I walk toe first, looking down over the edge the entire time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red light starts to flash above our heads when we\u0027re halfway down. I look back at Bernie, \"We\u0027ve been discovered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns, \"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point at the flashing light, \"Same alarm as the breeder farms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs, \"That goes off all the time. Random things make it go off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Not when I\u0027m around; it\u0027s always me.\" I start to run down the stairs, wishing Leo was with me. His senses don’t get messed up by the buildings, he\u0027s a wolf through and through. I\u0027m only a wolf in the woods. My eyes and senses are distracted by the building closing me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get to the bottom of the stairs, I see a panel and steam just like the boiler room at the farms. My belly starts to ache. I lift the rifle, looking around the room. Pipes and bits of machinery make up the room. The walls are dank with sweat from whatever these things are and the heat they\u0027re making. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-20.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
