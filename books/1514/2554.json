Promptly, he laughed bitterly and said, “Now is not the ideal time to learn the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu clenched her teeth and asked, “Can you use some techniques to stop him for a while?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong thought for a moment and said, “Though he is extremely powerful, it shouldn’t be impossible for me to stop him for a while.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter he spoke, Lin Dong clenched his hand. Then, a light formation quickly emerged on his palm. After which, it expanded with the wind and transformed into a giant light array, enveloping the entire mountain forest in the process.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSwoosh.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter the Ancient Universe Formation was formed, Lin Dong tossed the Great Desolate Tablet and the Mysterious Divine Palace towards that formation and strengthened it. With their help, it was possible to completely stabilize that formation. Therefore, no matter how powerful the Seventh Seat King was, it was likely that he would need to spend some time in order to break that formation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, the meridians within Lin Dong’s body twitched after he setup that defensive formation. Immediately, there was more cold sweat on his forehead. Evidently, he was seriously injured and he even felt giddy in his mind. However, he forcefully suppressed it. After all, if he was to lose consciousness now, there was likely no way he could escape death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“The Ancient Universe Formation should be able to stop him for a while. However, it can merely delay him.” Lin Dong panted as he looked at the Ancient Universe Formation that enveloped the entire mountain forest. Currently, there was an extremely powerful energy surging on the formation, isolating that place from the outside world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Don’t worry, it’s not so easy to kill me. If I am pushed to my limits, I will just make the Ancient Universe Formation self-destruct. At that time, that fellow will also end up suffering.” Lin Dong gritted his teeth and said. Although he would have to pay a high price to do so, he could not be bothered about it at this moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu shook her head. Then, she glanced at Lin Dong before her pretty face reddened, “Can you release me first?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOnly now, did Lin Dong realize that the both of them were lying in a far too intimate position. In fact, his entire body was lying above Ling Qingzhu’s delicate figure. Although the soft sensation that he felt could lead one’s thoughts astray, now was not an appropriate moment. Therefore, he forcefully smiled and was just about to stand up, when the injuries on his body were once again triggered by his movements. Immediately, his body weakened before he crumbled on top of Ling Qingzhu again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu gasped softly after her body was pressed down by him. She tilted her head and saw Lin Dong clenching his teeth bitterly. Meanwhile, there was a pained expression on his face.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen she saw the miserable expression on Lin Dong’s face, a gentle emotion gradually surged into Ling Qingzhu’s eyes. She hesitated for a moment, before she used her hands to gently wipe off the perspiration on his forehead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“We must leave here first. I will make the Ancient Universe Formation self-destruct later on. Carry me and go. The Sky Devouring Corpse will help us to stop him.” Lin Dong approached Ling Qingzhu’s delicate ear, before he gritted his teeth and said. As he spoke, he could sense weariness setting in rapidly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe was going to suffer huge losses this time around. Not only was he going to lose the Ancient Universe Formation, but it was also highly likely that he would lose the Sky Devouring Corpse. Other than the incident back at the Unique Devil City, this was the only other time he suffered such a huge loss.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Ling Qingzhu gently shook her head after she heard his words. Then, she suddenly extended her small hand. Meanwhile, there was a dark red pill on her palm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You… eat it.” Ling Qingzhu placed that pill into Lin Dong’s mouth before she softly said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Healing medicine?” Lin Dong was startled. Without hesitation, he swallowed that pill. Soon after, he felt that something was amiss. In fact, a strange fiery hot sensation surged the moment that pill entered his body. Furthermore, the giddy sensation within his mind intensified. In fact, he felt so giddy that his eyelids began to droop.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You… what did you feed me?” Lin Dong muttered in a blurry state.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It’s nothing. Everything will be fine once you wake up.” Ling Qingzhu used her delicate hands to stroke Lin Dong’s face, before she softly bit her red lips and said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn his heart, Lin Dong vaguely felt that something was amiss. However, he was currently seriously injured. Therefore, as that feeble and fatigue sensation surged, it prevented him from awakening. Finally, his eyelids collapsed before his vision turned pitch-black.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu looked at Lin Dong, who had fallen into a slumber. Meanwhile, her gorgeous face was completely fiery red. Then, she gently bit her silver teeth before she muttered softly, “The Zenith Sensing Art is a secret of our Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace that has never been passed to an outsider. Technically speaking, there is no training manual for it. It is just a profound and mysterious sensation. Moreover, its powerful strength originates from the sensing location.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Furthermore… in order for you to sense that mysterious existence, other than inheriting it at birth, the only other way … is to do it through pair\u0026nbsp;cultivation where both parties can sense it together.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf Lin Dong was still awake at this moment, he would be bewildered by her words. After all, he never expected that such a method was required to learn the “Zenith Sensing Art”. It’s no wonder Ling Qingzhu was outraged when Lin Dong first mentioned this to her. It’s actually because…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu gently supported his body. After which, she bit her lips before she said, “The person hiding within his body, come out now.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA light began to glimmer on the surface of Lin Dong’s body. After which, Yan drifted out. When he saw the boiling red expression on Ling Qingzhu’s face, he involuntarily laughed dryly. However, there was an odd emotion within his eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What you have given him… to eat…” Yan looked at Ling Qingzhu and laughed dryly, “Is it an aphrodisiac?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This is the only way for him to learn the ‘Zenith Sensing Art’.” Ling Qingzhu lowered her eyes. Her face was as red as blood as she spoke.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYan was a little speechless at this moment. He finally understood that Ling Qingzhu had likely thought of this scene when Lin Dong first mentioned that he wanted to learn the “Zenith Sensing Art”. It was also most likely why she asked Lin Dong to never mention this matter again. Clearly, she was struggling with it in her heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough she had a cold personality and appeared to be indifferent to everything, there was no way she could treat this matter in the same way. This was especially since the other party was Lin Dong. Therefore, she merely followed quietly beside him during this journey. Clearly, she was using this method to overcome certain obstacles in her heart and make up her mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, at the final moment, she still lacked the courage. Therefore, she decided to use this method, which left one neither able to laugh nor cry. After all, regardless of how cold a lady was, she would still be as timid and embarrassed as an ordinary girl when dealing with such matters.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYan sighed. Since Lin Dong was able to get this cool, haughty and intelligent girl to use such a stupid method, he could be considered as fairly “capable”.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Can I trouble you with something?” Ling Qingzhu suddenly lifted her head, before she looked at Yan and asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Do not tell him about this.” Ling Qingzhu carefully rubbed off the blood on the corner of Lin Dong’s lips, before she softly said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Why?” Yan was startled. Clearly, he did not understand her thoughts. A girl like Ling Qingzhu obviously viewed such matters with great importance. In fact, she typically wore a veil to conceal her appearance and it was difficult for an ordinary man to see her actual face. Moreover, her body was still pure and had only been touched once by Lin Dong in a complete accident. Therefore, it must have been difficult for her to make such a sacrifice.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I do not want him to feel only guilt when he thinks of me.” Ling Qingzhu shook her head and said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYan smiled bitterly and nodded. It seems like Ling Qingzhu clearly understood why Lin Dong wanted to learn the “Zenith Sensing Art”. Given his character, if he knew how much Ling Qingzhu had to sacrifice in order for him to do so, it was likely that he would feel extremely guilty towards her. This was something that the haughty Ling Qingzhu did not want to see.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I will try my best to keep this secret.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Thank you.” Ling Qingzhu smiled sweetly. The demeanor she displayed at this moment caused Yan to be startled. He quickly sighed before he drifted far away.

Then, she turned to look at Lin Dong. After which, she waved her hand before a glow shot out from her sleeve. Soon after, it transformed into a sparkling bamboo house. This was clearly a Soul Treasure. However, other than hiding from the rain, it was of little use.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu gently carried Lin Dong as she walked into that bamboo house.

If she knew, it was likely that she would have directly killed him on that mountain top with her sword.
