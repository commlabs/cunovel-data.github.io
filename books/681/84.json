He suggested this tactfully at first, and then, as Hal did not take the hint, he began to press the matter, showing signs of irritation. The mine was open now—what more did Hal want? When Hal suggested that Cartwright might order it closed again, Percy revealed the fact that the matter was in his father\u0027s hands. The superintendent had sent a long telegram the night before, and an answer was due at any moment. Whatever the answer ordered would have to be done. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a grim look upon Hal\u0027s face, but he forced himself to speak politely. “If your father orders anything that interferes with the rescuing of the men—don\u0027t you see, Percy, that I have to fight him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But how can you fight him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “With the one weapon I have—publicity.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You mean—” Percy stopped, and stared.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I mean what I said before—I\u0027d turn Billy Keating loose and blow this whole story wide open.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, by God!” cried young Harrigan. “I must say I\u0027d call it damned dirty of you! You said you\u0027d not do it, if I\u0027d come here and open the mine!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But what good does it do to open it, if you close it again before the men are out?” Hal paused, and when he went on it was in a sincere attempt at apology. “Percy, don\u0027t imagine I fail to appreciate the embarrassments of this situation. I know I must seem a cad to you—more than you\u0027ve cared to tell me. I called you my friend in spite of all our quarrels. All I can do is to assure you that I never intended to get into such a position as this.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, what the hell did you want to come here for? You knew it was the property of a friend—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s the question at issue between us, Percy. Have you forgotten our arguments? I tried to convince you what it meant that you and I should own the things by which other people have to live. I said we were ignorant of the conditions under which our properties were worked, we were a bunch of parasites and idlers. But you laughed at me, called me a crank, an anarchist, said I swallowed what any muck-raker fed me. So I said: \u0027I\u0027ll go to one of Percy\u0027s mines! Then, when he tries to argue with me, I\u0027ll have him!\u0027 That was the way the thing started—as a joke. But then I got drawn into things. I don\u0027t want to be nasty, but no man with a drop of red blood in his veins could stay in this place a week without wanting to fight! That\u0027s why I want you to stay—you ought to stay, to meet some of the people and see for yourself.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, I can\u0027t stay,” said the other, coldly. “And all I can tell you is that I wish you\u0027d go somewhere else to do your sociology.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But where could I go, Percy? Somebody owns everything. If it\u0027s a big thing, it\u0027s almost certain to be somebody we know.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Said Percy, “If I might make a suggestion, you could have begun with the coal-mines of the Warner Company.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hal laughed. “You may be sure I thought of that, Percy. But see the situation! If I was to accomplish my purpose, it was essential that I shouldn\u0027t be known. And I had met some of my father\u0027s superintendents in his office, and I knew they\u0027d recognise me. So I had to go to some other mines.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Most fortunate for the Warner Company,” replied Percy, in an ugly tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hal answered, gravely, “Let me tell you, I don\u0027t intend to leave the Warner Company permanently out of my sociology.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well,” replied the other, “all I can say is that we pass one of their properties on our way back, and nothing would please me better than to stop the train and let you off!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3236/88618.html","bookId":681,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:12:55 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:12:55 AM"}
