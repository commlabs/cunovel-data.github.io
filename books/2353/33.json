She brushed her hand over its smooth surface as if touching it would explain its mystery; but it remained silent. To her surprise, it wasn’t hot. It was barely warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seems like if we’d been traveling so far so quickly, our space ship would be burning with heat,” she commented, walking toward Gabe, who held his gun like an extension of his long arm. Pointing down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d think. Maybe the sat phone’s got an error and we really didn’t travel that far. We won’t know until we get out of this underground launching pad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go.” Marina, suddenly antsy, started toward the far wall. She presumed there was an exit just as there had been an entrance at the beginning of their journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold up,” Gabe ordered. “Let’s wait a few to make sure that the arrival of this—ping pong ball—didn’t send some kind of alert.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d rather not wait in here and be cornered if it did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’d rather rush out to meet whatever’s coming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess that’s the difference between you and me. And you the trained spook; me, I’m just an ordinary girl.” Marina continued her way to the wall she was sure contained a door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ordinary’s not a word I’d use.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing she knew, the wall was rough and cold against her back, and Gabe was looking down at her, fingers solid on her arms. His eyes were very blue, and very serious. And very close. “You might be used to taking risks in rescue missions, but this is different. This is guns and terrorism and God knows what else—it’s my expertise, Marina. You’ve got to take a step back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he was right. Even though his sudden proximity sent her mind spinning in a whole lot of different directions, she nodded. “All right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded back at her. And then he bent forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth fit over hers and she lifted her chin to meet him head-on. Her eyes closed, and she settled her hands against his warm chest, curling her fingers over the tops of wide shoulders. He was good; it was good. A delicious warmth erupted under her skin, sending little shivers down her back and along her arms as they tasted and sampled and tested out the attraction between them. Hip to hip, thigh sliding between thigh, cold, rough wall scraping the back of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter awhile, he pulled gently away and she opened her eyes when their mouths broke apart. His lips were full and they parted in a little smile. “I’ve been wanting to do that since you stepped out of the shower,” he said. “At the hotel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hadn’t…until I saw your face after that plane ride.” She slid her hands down from his shoulders, feeling the solidness of his pecs, then pulled away. He was still smiling, his eyes glinting with humor at her comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as if a switch had been turned on—or off, depending how she looked at it—he sobered. His face tightened, his gaze sharpened, his muscles tensed against her. He was back in the game. “I don’t know if we’re really in Siberia or not, but either way, we’re at a disadvantage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but if we find the Skaladeskas, I’ll be the one they’ll listen to,” she reminded him. “I’m one of them.” Marina felt along a groove in the wall and slipped her fingers in. Nothing happened when she pressed or pushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re looking for the way out, it’s over here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina turned just in time to see the door open. She moved along the wall to stand next to Gabe, out of sight of whatever might lie beyond the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized she was holding her breath when she was forced to expel it, several minutes later, when nothing happened. No sounds of alarms, no alerting cries, no booby-traps springing up or open around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started forward, but Gabe snatched her wrist and propelled her behind him. “I’m going first. I’ve got the weapon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Okay. Maybe I do need to learn how to fire one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little late for that now, don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s never too late.” She followed him through the doorway into a passage of sorts. A hall, not a cave chamber, of pure white. The ceiling was rounded and she felt rather like a hobbit stepping through a round door, into a hall illuminated by the glow of lights set into the ceiling, studded along the way every six or eight feet. “Guess we’re not in Kansas anymore, huh, Toto?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped damp palms over her jeans, realizing her only tool was that small light slipped into her pocket. She wished she’d taken up Gabe’s offer of a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d walked perhaps a mile in the white corridor without meeting anyone, or hearing any sound but the dull pad of their own footsteps. The air and the temperature remained constant, so Marina couldn’t tell if they were still underground, or heading further into the earth. If the passage tilted slightly downward at one point, it rounded back up at another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was fresh, not stale or musty as one might expect a long, uninterrupted hall to contain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, they came to a door. The same pure white as the walls, it nevertheless differentiated itself by its smooth metal and a barely discernable line down the middle where it likely split open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina looked at Gabe, who’d found the small niche which contained buttons and switches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The labels are in English,” he told her. “Ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and he flipped a switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors peeled apart and they found themselves in a spacious room. Room wasn’t quite the word, Marina considered, stepping through the door. It felt more like an airport terminal; in particular, with its four-storey ceiling, glass walls and open stairways, the building reminded her of Munich Airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had entered at the highest of four levels, and could look down from a shiny silver railing. Each floor had rubber-like flooring with flat circles raised no more than three or four millimeters as if to provide traction on what would have been a smooth surface. One side of the building was a dark and solid wall, while the other, made of huge triangular-shaped pieces of glass fitted together with massive metal rods, allowed a noon-time-strength burst of sunshine in. The railing at which Marina and Gabe stood was a mere eight feet wide; behind them was a dark wall, and in front of them was a drop clear down to the first level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she’d stepped from the center-splitting door, Marina had registered the buzz of activity below and backed away. People moved about their business below, and it was only good fortune that no one had cause to look up in their direction. And a blessing that they’d come out on the uppermost floor instead of any other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe nudged her with his elbow, and raised his eyebrows. Did she want to go further?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn straight. She nodded back. She was in this up to her gills; and besides, if this was possibly a community of Skaladeskas—or at least people who knew them—she was bound to find out something about her father. And if they were, indeed, responsible for the three earthquakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina looked down again, huddling behind one of the great steel columns that held up the ceiling, which was made of the same material as the walls as they curved up into a half-dome above them. There were about two dozen or so people visible at any given time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould she and Gabe blend in among them without being noticed? Certainly they’d have to change their clothing, as the people moving below were all wearing light-colored, loose pants and shirts. Not a uniform exactly; at least as far as she could tell; but definitely not the jeans and flannel shirts she and Gabe had donned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this a company; a business? Or a residential community of sorts? Despite its similarity to one, it wasn’t an airport terminal. Or would strangers stick out like the intruders they were?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe had begun to move along the solid metal wall behind them, and Marina turned just as he opened a door that had previously been hidden. She hurried to his side and, when he slipped through the sliver of entrance, she followed without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door closed behind them and they stepped into the room with perfect synchronization. Computers lined one half-moon wall made of glass, and chairs that reminded Marina of the stools in a beauty salon studded the long workspace that lined a blank wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlipping a switch that appeared to lock the door behind her, Marina felt safe enough to wander over to one of the terminals and sit down at the chair. The monitor screen showed white fuzz and its computer keyboard was tucked under the desk on a movable tray, just as ergonomically correct as her own workstation back at the University of Michigan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Marina pulled the tray out, she was slightly surprised to see that the characters were the standard QWERTY-format keyboard. She’d half-expected there to be the foreign characters of a non-Anglo language … .most particularly, Skaladeska.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she shifted the bullet-shaped mouse, the white fuzz evaporated from the monitor and she found herself looking at the very familiar Windows Desktop screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat clinched it for her. Gabe’s GPS phone was wrong. They had to still be in Canada—or perhaps they’d shifted back to the States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn idea perked in her mind, and on a whim, knowing it was a long shot, she clicked on the email program icon. Perhaps, perhaps, there was something interesting in there. Like maybe an email from Victor to herself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe email program popped open, but before she could begin to scroll through it, Gabe came up behind her and tossed a bundle of clothing into her lap. “Let’s get out of our clothes and into something less obvious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, but cream is so not my color.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe ignored her; instead, he jabbed a thumb toward a half-open door at the end of the worktable. “I’ll be the lookout while you change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid off the chair, noticing that he’d already made the switch. Gone were the jeans and green and rust plaid shirt; replacing them were a pair of off-white linen-like trousers and a natural-fiber-colored top that buttoned down the front. His feet were still clad in the same hiking boots he’d been wearing since they’d been kidnapped back in L’Anse. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/siberian-treasure/page-33.html","bookId":2353,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:32 AM"}
