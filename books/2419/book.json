But he’s in store for a whole lot more. His big brother Garrett--computer whiz, Jimmy Buffett fanatic, and all-around eccentric—is hoping to retire a multimillionaire by the fall. He’s bet his career and the Navarre family ranch to do it. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThen Garrett’s oldest friend and business partner is murdered—and Garrett is the only suspect. As Tres delves into Garrett’s bizarre world to find the truth behind the murder, he comes face to face with the damaged relationships, violent lives, and billion-dollar schemes of a high-tech world gone haywire. Connecting them all is beautiful Lake Travis and the shocking secret that lies within its depths. Now, as Tres struggles with his own troubled family past and to clear his brother’ s name, he finds himself stalked by a cold-blooded killer—one who could spell the death of both Navarres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
