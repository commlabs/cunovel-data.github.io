And that governments and policy-makers hadn’t listened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn’t about a difference in religious opinions, or societal or economic practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was about something that affected every living being on the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet to the Skaladeskas, it was their religion. The essence of their beliefs: to protect their goddess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A new kind of holy war,” he breathed. For the health of the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarrow nodded. Then she moved over to the cart she’d pulled in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the why. And now we’ve figured out how they did it. How they caused the earthquakes.” She summarized the situation as she unhooked the straps on the luggage cart and hefted the box onto Colin’s conference table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this?” He had risen from his desk and came around to help her, but by then, she was already standing back, gesturing to the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s got the symbol on it—see.” She flipped the box; it was heavy, and clunked onto the table with a sharp thud. On the bottom, she showed him the faint etching that was indeed the symbol of the Skaladeskas. “But why would they put their symbol on it? They would know it would implicate them immediately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy Christ.” The tension that had settled between his shoulders, that had been there since he secretly sent Gabe off to find Alexander, began to lessen. At last. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This, best as we can determine, is a controller that served two functions that ultimately caused the earthquake in Allentown. I have teams searching the other sites for similar equipment, but as of now, this is the only one we’ve found. The ballistics team believes it was used to control and direct a small drill that dug diagonally through the earth’s crust several miles away to under the site of the earthquake’s epicenter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once under the epicenter, the drill deposited a very powerful explosive of a very small size—only a foot or so in diameter. And then the controller detonated the explosive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that caused the earthquakes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That caused them, without a doubt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin rubbed his thumb over the symbol etched on the box. “You asked why they would put their sign on it? The sign of Gaia, their goddess—that’s what Dr. Alexander told me. It represents the deity of the earth. Perhaps as a form of blessing? As if to confirm that their actions were being made in her name? For her?” He looked up and Helen was nodding in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, that could be. And … if it weren’t for you, we would have no way of assigning this symbol to the Skaladeskas anyway. They would not expect us to make the correlation. There’s nothing in our database with this symbol on it. You’re the only connection. How fortunate for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin chose not to meet her eyes. “I would never have guessed … .They’ll do it again. Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. They haven’t claimed responsibility for the events yet … but they will. They’ll want to. If they are acting in the name of their deity, they’ll be happy to tell us.” She paced again, somehow having acquired a pen that she slapped rhythmically against her palm. “Given the right kind of leader, any religion can turn evil—we’ve seen it happen since the beginning of organized worship. When a holy war is declared, the end justifies any means to those crusaders. We need to be ten steps ahead of them, Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we can’t penetrate their shell, then we’ll have to wait for their warnings, their claims of responsibility, and their implicit hints and threats. I’m not willing to wait. You came to me with your background knowledge about these people—your team needs to get in there and find out what’s going on, who the leader is, and how we can stop their next threat. You know as well as I do that there will be one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-28-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 10, 2007\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorthern Ontario\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out, by the time Marina and Gabe landed with their prisoners and contacted Colin Bergstrom, everything had blown wide open. There was no question about them proceeding as Marina had suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially since when they swept the plane, they’d found a map and documentation that appeared to outline the remainder of the journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can finish the flight plan and follow this map to the meeting point,” Marina said. Her reluctance to follow through on this mission had evaporated; now determination burned as strongly in her as it did in Gabe. She had come this far, through this much danger. She’d lost her chance to see the Lam Pao Archive. She would resolve this mess and find her dad. If he was still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we wait too long, whoever’s at the other end will get suspicious and we’ll lose our chance to find out where we’re going,” she told Gabe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just want to fly that plane again.” Another dry comment she hadn’t expected from the sarcastic spook, but she didn’t deny it. She loved her P210, but the Mirage was an awesome plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen MacNeil finally made contact with Colin Bergstrom, the CIA director was overwhelmingly relieved to hear from them. After listening to his operative’s debrief, he shared news of his own, his voice blaring over the speakerphone at the local police station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have been contacted by an inspector in Saudi Arabia. A man was murdered there, and a business card was left with the Skaladeska symbol on it. That alone indicates that there is something brewing, and that we are not just following a hunch. There’s more, but first I am going to fax you a drawing of the man who is believed to be the murderer. Dr. Alexander, if you would please examine the drawing and give me your opinion, it would be appreciated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Marina waited for the fax to come in, Gabe lifted the receiver and got a further confidential debrief from his director.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve made the connection between the Skalas and the earthquake in Allentown. Helen Darrow’s team found the controller that detonated an underground bomb, and controlled the drill. It has the Skaladeska symbol on it. They caused those earthquakes, they’re implicated in at least two murders—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—and your fax just arrived, and Marina has identified that photo as the man who broke into her home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we can add attempted kidnapping to the list. Unnecessary at this point, but I’ll let Darrow know. I agree with Dr. Alexander—you need to follow up on this map and travel route and see if you can locate some of these people. They’ve got to be planning something else—why would they stop at one incident? And not even take credit for it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They wouldn’t. We’ll go on and see what we can find out. You need to get me a sat phone and a weapon stat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to send up some backup personnel, too, but it’s going to take at least twenty-four hours to get them approved and up there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t wait. Get me the phone and the gun. Marina is insistent that we keep the trail hot, and I’m afraid I agree with her, despite the risk of involving a civilian. We might lose our chance of meeting whoever we were supposed to meet up with if we’re delayed. Or they might hear about the capture of their colleagues. And we’re more likely to be successful with just the two of us than some big team, if we get into Skaladeska territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marina’s hot to go, and I’m afraid that if we don’t manage the investigation, she’ll do it on her own. I have to tell you, I’m not happy about being in this position.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBergstrom spoke abruptly, “Taking a civilian isn’t the most optimal of plans, but I’m not going to miss this opportunity. We brought Marina Alexander into this because of who she is, and who she knows. And what she might know but doesn’t yet remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She has the mark of the Skaladeskas on her—that could be invaluable to us. Even though she may not realize it, whatever she knows about them is more than anyone else does. She’s been in dangerous situations before; she knows how to handle herself. And you’ve convinced me that a small team makes better sense in this case. Hold on … let me see about your phone and gun. I should be able to get them to you pretty quick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe stood at the desk in the police chief’s office, thankful for the privacy, and shuffled his feet. He could hear Bergstrom’s movements in the background over the phone, and his low-toned voice rumbling as he spoke and, likely, manipulated, begged, borrowed, and stole. He wondered if Helen was there, and whether she knew he was on the other end of this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, Gabe, you have thirty hours on your own.” Colin came back on the line, breathless but firm. “And I don’t want Dr. Alexander running the operation, so you’ll have to keep a rein on her. Darrow wants to send her team up there too, but I’ve managed to convince her to hold off for thirty hours. Get me what you can in that time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly twenty hours later, after a stop for refueling and a generous nap, Marina landed the Mirage at an airport near Waswanipi, Quebec. It was mid-morning, but since they were in the Land of the Midnight Sun, the sun had been shining like it was noon for hours. It was surprisingly chilly; near forty degrees, though Marina had expected it to be closer to sixty since it was July. The gloves and hat would come in handy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe had arranged for a rental car when they stopped for fuel, and it was waiting in the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The old key under the mat trick, eh?” Marina commented as she climbed into the Land Rover. “Somehow I expected the CIA to be a little less simplistic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe started the engine. “You watch too many spy movies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch them? I’m in one! That tunnel from Dad’s cellar under the lake was too much like Dr. No’s underwater room. And I like Hitchcock better than Bond anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better than Bond?” Gabe pulled the Land Rover out of the airport parking lot and flipped the switch to turn on the heater fan. A blast of welcome, warm air burst into the vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Much better than Bond. At least Hitchcock’s films are somewhat believable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, we’ll see if you still think Bond is unbelievable when we’re done with this op.” He cast her a grin as they sped along the road. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/siberian-treasure/page-29.html","bookId":2353,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:32 AM"}
