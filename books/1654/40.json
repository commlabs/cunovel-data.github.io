My men and I will make sure you get there safely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” one of the traders asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If the trade routes shut down due to Mutie attacks, all towns will suffer. I’ve seen what happens when a settlement becomes too isolated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSalvation had been a good place, full of warmhearted people, but they didn’t trust outsiders much, and they hadn’t encouraged traders like these to come into town. From what my family had told me and I’d observed, Longshot handled all of that outside the town gates, allegedly preventing bad morals from getting in. But in the end, that seclusion didn’t save them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we’d appreciate the escort. We can spare some provisions once we arrive, and I’ll help you find a place in town to rest up for a night or two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know if you caught my name last night amid all the revelry. I’m Vince Howe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Deuce Oaks.” That was the first time I’d offered two names, and Fade shot me a surprised look, but he smiled. I needed to tell him that Momma Oaks had given her blessing for him to use their name too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pleasure, ma’am. I guess you know, but you run a right remarkable group. I’m sorry for your losses, but I don’t know when I saw more impressive battle.” I acknowledged that with an inclination of my head, and he continued, “We’ll be ready to go in less than an hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took that opportunity to use the sanitary facilities one last time, so I jogged over to the lab and banged until the scientist appeared. Dr. Wilson was happy to let me in, and for a minute, I thought he might follow me all the way to the wash closet. He stopped in the hall, fortunately, and said, “Come see me before you depart, all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a distracted gesture, I agreed and then washed up. It felt wrong to start a new journey with grave dirt still smeared on my skin, embedded beneath my nails. When I came out, damp and clean, I felt renewed. For a few moments, I considered ducking out because I was in no mood to chat with the scientist. But in the end, I kept my promise and headed to the lab to speak with the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s on your mind?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had two cups of tea steaming on the table, along with some buttered toast, so I joined him. On the road, I missed bread, and while this wasn’t fresh, the melted butter made up for the rest. The drink was pale but strong with a medicinal scent. It tasted better than it smelled, however, with a gentle tang of mint. I drank mine because it was wet and hot, pleasant in a dry throat, and then I devoured the food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientist watched me in silence, but once I finished, he said, “Your friend, Tegan, is quite extraordinary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell her, not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m appealing to you as her commander. A mind like hers shouldn’t be wasted on the life of a common soldier. Let her stay with me. I could use an assistant … and I’ve been looking for someone like her my whole life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “You don’t know Tegan if you think I have any say over whether she stays or goes. But I’ll fetch her and you can put the invitation to her yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving the dregs in my mug, I left the lab and went looking for Tegan. She was sitting alone in a patch of spring sunlight. The men gave her a wide berth, probably because of the tear streaks down her dusty cheeks. Dr. Wilson was right; she wasn’t cut out for this life, but she was lucky in that there was no reason she couldn’t cry when she felt sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The good doctor would like a word,” I said, offering my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed glad of the distraction, and we walked back to the lab together. Once inside, the scientist stated his case with more eloquence than he’d offered me, outlining all the opportunities for study and the wondrous things he could teach her. He concluded with “It’s long been my dream to pass on my knowledge, but until now, I’d encountered no suitable candidates. But you, my dear, you’re perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTegan considered, her lips parted in astonishment. “It’s a kind offer, Dr. Wilson, but I’ll see this through. Company D relies on me for healing, and the men will suffer without my care.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see you were right about not being her captain,” Dr. Wilson said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. “Deuce is my friend … she didn’t order me to follow her. In fact she tried to talk me out of it. Should I survive, then I’ll gladly come back to study with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll endeavor to wait until that day,” Wilson said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hot flush colored Tegan’s cheeks, and I smothered a smile. “I’m sorry. That sounded presumptuous, didn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did ask you to stay. It’s not wrong to assume I’d like you to come back some day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I thank you for the opportunity, Dr. Wilson. I hope we meet again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed like the cue for us to leave, so we said our farewells and met the men in the town square. The wagons were loaded, and I was ready to see the last of Winterville. Despite their cowardice the night before, the townsfolk saw us off, and a few asked if I’d let them enlist. I was tempted to refuse, as I had with Rex, due to their inexperience, but I could tell by their guilt-racked expressions that they wanted to make up for their inaction. And in truth, we needed the bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked the three men up and down. “Any of you know how to shoot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shook their heads. But one of them said, “Please. I’m a smith. I can keep your weapons in good repair. Surely that’s worth something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a burly sort with broad shoulders and scarred hands. So I beckoned them all on. Since we had wagons to protect, this journey would take much longer than it did when the men ran at a Hunter’s pace. More time on the road meant more chances for trouble, and we were all weary, but if we delivered the supplies safely to Lorraine, other volunteers might join our cause. John Kelley was spreading our story, and I suspected Vince Howe would add to it as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese things took time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were on the road for over a week, and Stalker’s scouts did most of the heavy lifting. Sometimes we fought preemptive battles against the Freaks, so they had no chance to lay an ambush for the wagons. As I’d predicted, it was slow going, and there was little time to spend with Fade, apart from the way I treated the rest of the men. From his occasional looks, he was missing the way it felt when we were together, but the job came first, as it ever had. This was familiar from our time in the summer patrols, but I minded more than I had then. For the first time, I could imagine a quiet life with Fade, a little cottage like Momma Oaks had shared with Edmund in Salvation. I was tired of smoky campfires and nights spent alone in a bedroll on the ground. I’d learn to grow things, and he could find work that didn’t require killing. On a starry night like this, those were dreams too distant for building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the eighth night, I woke to pure chaos. The mules were screaming, Freaks were all around us. My men recovered as fast as they could, and the traders aimed their rifles, shooting into the dark. Between the crack of gunfire and cries of pain, I had no idea where anyone was. Gavin, the brat from Winterville, had climbed on top of the crates and was lying on his stomach, firing with complete calm. I spotted Fade fighting some distance away, but I didn’t see Tegan or Stalker. There was no time to search further, because three Freaks were on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whipped out my knives and whirled into the fight. As my vision sharpened, I spied Tegan on the other side of the wagon. Morrow fought madly toward her side, his blade a silver arc in the dark. By his worried expression, he didn’t like how they were surrounding her. I didn’t care for it either, but Stalker was closer. Another Freak charged her back; she was already blocking with everything she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she was good with her staff, she wasn’t infallible. In a few more seconds, she’d go down. Stalker stopped defending and took four slashes across his back. He sprinted. I registered the precise moment when he realized he could save Tegan or land the killing blow, but not both. Not in time. A second later, he threw himself between her and the Freak that would’ve torn out her spine. He took both talons in the chest before Morrow and I reached them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Freak who went after Tegan from behind had a vicious scar across its face, received in some prior battle with human soldiers. It looked like a knife wound—and when it saw us—it loped off, more evidence that they were growing more cunning. This one preferred to live to fight another day. The rest of the monsters spun on us, but Fade and Morrow were there, fighting like wild things to keep them away. They died in piles beneath their furious blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKneeling beside Stalker, I sealed my palms against the wounds. Blood bubbled up from between my fingers. The dawn showed signs of brightening into a sunny day, and he shouldn’t be dying. Tegan sobbed, calling for her medicine bag, but by his crooked smile, he knew it was no use. Stalker pulled my fingers away and clutched them tight, until our skin was slick and red. His breath grew wet and harsh, his eyes winter pale in his stark face. I drew him up into my arms, as if I could force him to live if I held him tight enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said I could never make it right … but this helps, doesn’t it? The world’s getting the better deal, her for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to speak for the tears thickening my throat, I stared down, memorizing his features. Though I couldn’t care for him like he wanted, he’d been my friend since we made peace in the ruins. He’d fought brave and true by my side. His ideas, his genius, had helped me build Company D, and I didn’t know how to win without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStalker squeezed my fingers, his voice harsh and labored. “Promise, promise you’ll finish this for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By everyone I love, I swear it,” I choked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d … ask you to … kiss me good-bye,” he whispered, “but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could finish the wheezing words, I leaned down and pressed my lips to his cheek. He smiled, and it felt as if he were already gone, his body lighter in my arms. My heart broke over and over with each of his wet, rasping breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lashes fluttered like butterfly wings. “I could’ve made you happy, dove.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot in the way he’d wanted, of course. But I had loved sparring with him, loved his pragmatic outlook, and his loyalty when he granted his trust. But he didn’t hear. The spark that made him Stalker had gone, leaving a limp body in my arms. All around the campsite, Company D protected me from the straggling Freaks, but the battle felt far away. I was gone too, weeping in silence. It wasn’t the way a leader behaved, but I was only a girl, mourning a fallen friend. So the battle raged on, but I had no fight left in me. My daggers lay useless at my sides. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/horde-razorland-3/page-40.html","bookId":1654,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:42 PM"}
