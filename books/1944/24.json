Very little got past Jack Griffin. \"It could,\" she murmured and continued to concentrate on her knitting for fear he\u0027d read the absolute delight in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My guess—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not at liberty to say another word, Jack. An announcement will be made by the mayor tomorrow morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Cedar Cove is going to get its health clinic, after all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte kept her head lowered. \"That\u0027s a distinct possibility, but you didn\u0027t hear it from me, understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack chuckled. \"Sure enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the only reason you\u0027re here?\" Charlotte asked. She wondered who\u0027d mentioned the news about the clinic. Bess had come over earlier and Charlotte had shared it with her dear friend. Bess had been thrilled, but she never could keep a secret, no matter how much she promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack got up and stared into the kitchen. \"I didn\u0027t actually stop by because of the clinic. That was a convenient excuse. Where\u0027s Olivia hiding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I most certainly am not hiding,\" her daughter announced, moving to the kitchen doorway where she stood with her arms crossed. \"I—I was taking Mother\u0027s pie out of the oven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, dear, I\u0027d forgotten all about it. I didn\u0027t hear the timer.\" Charlotte was so flustered that the cherry pie had completely slipped her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I should give you two a moment alone,\" Charlotte said, walking past Olivia to check on the pie. Never in all her life had it taken her longer to complete a single row of knitting. She couldn\u0027t quite stifle a sigh. In the last thirty minutes, she\u0027d been up and down more times than an elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia remained in the kitchen doorway and it was all Charlotte could do not to push her forward. Jack wasn\u0027t standing in the living room because he liked the view. He\u0027d come for his wife and if Olivia had a lick of sense she\u0027d realize it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at each other and finally Jack spoke. \"I promise I won\u0027t leave the peanut butter out again,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte resisted the urge not to giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia sniffled. \"Oh, Jack, I didn\u0027t mean any of those terrible things I said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just that I—I guess I really am a neat freak...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head. \"I\u0027m a slob. I\u0027ll try harder, I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia flew out of the kitchen then. Charlotte peered into the living room and discovered that Jack had his arms around his wife. They hugged each other for a long moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was going to be all right, she thought with relief. They\u0027d have their difficulties but their commitment and love for each other was strong enough to keep them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready to go home?\" Olivia asked her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nodded and kissed the top of her head. \"Do you really think I\u0027m a sex fiend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack!\" Olivia glanced over her shoulder and Charlotte pretended not to have heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best compliment I\u0027ve had in years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, honestly.\" The laughter was back in Olivia\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArm in arm, they walked out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSex fiend. Her daughter didn\u0027t know how lucky she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob caught sight of the other car as he rounded the corner. He\u0027d spent the last three hours with the theater group, rehearsing his role as the attorney Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago. It was now after ten and this late at night, Harbor Street\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas nearly deserted. He noticed that the blue SUV took each turn he made, the bumper dangerously close to his own. Bob felt his heart leap into his throat just as the vehicle eased back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was being followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob took a left at Heron and the SUV turned left, as well. Knowing he tended to jump to conclusions, he wanted to be sure and made an immediate right. Again the vehicle behind him turned in the same direction. At least it maintained a safe distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was convinced; he was indeed being followed. His heart racing, Bob reached for his cell phone. This wasn\u0027t an emergency and the car stayed well behind him but it was obvious the driver was tailing him. His first thought was to call Peggy, but he didn\u0027t want to needlessly alarm his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor could he phone the sheriff\u0027s office. No crime had been committed—yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d ignored the warnings he\u0027d gotten from Sheriff Davis and Roy. After all this time, Bob had refused to believe he was in any real danger. He\u0027d thought everyone was overrel acting, and the only reason he\u0027d agreed not to accept guests was to appease Peggy. All at once, he wasn\u0027t so sure about anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roy,\" he mumbled aloud with relief. He\u0027d call his friend Roy would know what to do. But try as he might, Bod couldn\u0027t remember his home number. He might be able to dig it up from the recesses of his memory, but the only number he could recall was for the office. At this time of night, Roy would almost certainly be at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Just great. Think You can figure this out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Bob remembered reading one of those \"what to do in case of an emergency\" articles in some long-ago publica tion. If you\u0027re being followed, he recalled, the advice was to drive to a police station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, Bob drove directly to the Cedar Cove Sheriff\u0027s Office, where he pulled into the half-circle driveway. He stayed in his vehicle as the blue SUV drove past. It slowed briefly, and then sped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension caused him to tighten his hold on the steering wheel. He sat in the driver\u0027s seat and forced his pulse to return to normal by taking deep, even breaths. When he was certain his legs would support him, he opened the car door and climbed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t leave your car there,\" a uniformed officer informed him as he walked into the station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to explain, then changed his mind. He might be making more of this than necessary. \"I\u0027ll move it in just a moment. I need a phone book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll move it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob wanted to argue, to explain, but decided against both. It was easy enough to pull his vehicle around. He parked in the street, then walked back to the station and located a public telephone near the restrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up Roy McAfee\u0027s home number and used his cell phone to place the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McAfee,\" Roy snapped, sounding like the police detective he\u0027d once been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone was following me,\" Bob said without introduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\" Roy\u0027s voice was hard as steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob leaned his shoulder against the wall. \"At the sheriff\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Did you get the license plate number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob closed his eyes and shook his head. \"No. I was so rattled I didn\u0027t even think to look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What make was the car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he remembered. \"A blue SUV. Ford, I think. Or maybe a Chevy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t narrow it down much. Are you sure you didn\u0027t get any of the plate number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob wanted to kick himself. \"No, sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m all right.\" He hoped his voice didn\u0027t betray how badly this had unsettled him. \"What should I do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drive over to my house. I\u0027ll meet you and follow you home. We can talk there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He climbed back in the car and started the engine. His hand trembled as he turned the ignition key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked the rearview mirror every few seconds during the drive to Roy and Corrie\u0027s. He thought he saw the SUV once, but if so it kept a respectable distance that didn\u0027t allow him an opportunity to read the license plate. But by then he was so jumpy he would\u0027ve suspected any car that came within two blocks of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he arrived at the McAfees\u0027 home, Roy was already in the car. He pulled in directly behind Bob and followed him down Heron to Cranberry Point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy was standing at the back door waiting for him as if she knew something was wrong. He was only a few minutes later than he\u0027d told her he\u0027d be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" she asked as he walked from the garage to the house, Roy directly behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes Bob swore his wife had a sixth sense. \"I was followed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened with alarm. \"Just now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I called Roy from the sheriff\u0027s office. To be on the safe side he decided to follow me home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" Hannah stepped into the kitchen, her expression curious—and more than a little wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we should all sit down,\" Peggy suggested. Roy came into the house with Bob, and the four of them sat in the family room. Hannah, who was dressed for bed, resembled a lost waif with her long hair falling about her face and huge, frightened eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us the whole story, from the beginning,\" Roy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t all that much to tell. Bob explained how the car had come right up on his bumper when he first drove down Harbor Street\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then pulled back. How the driver had maintained a reasonable distance as Bob took a number of twists and turns to establish whether or not he was being followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever it was didn\u0027t want to be identified,\" Roy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you recognize the person in the car?\" Peggy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob shook his head. \"No—I didn\u0027t really look. I mean, when the car first came up behind me the only thought that went through my mind was how close on my tail it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you notice if the driver was a male or female?\" Roy asked. \"One person or two?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob felt like an utter failure. He should be able to answer at least that question, but in all honesty he couldn\u0027t. \"One, I think. Male.. .but I\u0027m not sure.\" Disgusted with himself, he shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know. I couldn\u0027t tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy reached for his hand and her fingers curled around his. He was sure she didn\u0027t realize how tightly she squeezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else you can remember?\" Roy prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. But if it happens again, I\u0027ll know what to look for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again?\" Peggy gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob could tell she was badly shaken, but he couldn\u0027t come up with a single reassurance. Not even one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do you think it might be?\" Bob asked his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever it is wanted you to know you were being followed.\" Roy said, \"otherwise he wouldn\u0027t have made it this obvious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why else?\" Peggy cried. \"He\u0027s trying to frighten us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob had news for her; the attempt had worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...who would do such a thing?\" Hannah asked. \"What sort of person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might have nothing to do with the murder,\" Roy told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else could it mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy shrugged. \"That I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Roy thought he was providing comfort, his tactic hadn\u0027t worked. Not in Bob\u0027s opinion, anyway. He was nervous and unable to hide it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to bed,\" Hannah said into the silence. \"Unless you need me for anything?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-24.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
