Leaning against her father\u0027s desk, she gasped for breath, her eyes stinging with unshed tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel Santos. Even after all these years, his effect on her was like getting hit by a bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her eldest brother filling the doorway. \"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John said Miguel was here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" It wasn\u0027t fair that his dark sexuality was even more potent now than it had been in high school. He was businessman for God\u0027s sake. A \"corporate raider,\" although he called what he did \"activist shareholding.\" He should have a paunch. And thinning hair. Instead he was a delectably mature version of the quarterback he\u0027d been in high school. His dark T-shirt hadn\u0027t hidden his beautifully defined biceps or his lean waist. She bet he still had washboard abs and a heavily muscled back. And the rest of him...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus. One look at him and she swore she could feel him pushing inside her. She remembered that all too well. The searing pleasure of his entry. The sensation of utter surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussell stepped into the office, his blue eyes dark with concern. \"What did he want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlowing out a shaky breath, she moved to one of the two chairs facing the desk and sat. \"Retribution. He tried to play it off, but he was seething. I could feel it from several feet away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he\u0027s not over you.\" He scrubbed a hand over his shadowed jaw, his gaze thoughtful. \"And we all know you never got over him. Maybe this is a second chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At what? Hurting each other?\" She swiped at her wet eyes. Everything was knotted up inside her, making her lightheaded and queasy. \"His life is in New York. Mine is here in California.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things are different now.\" Leaning his hip into the desk, Russell crossed his arms and looked back out the door into the busy service bays. Air tools whirred loudly, drowning out the sound of multiple radios, each playing a different genre to suit the tastes of the auto tech who owned it. \"Business is hopping. We\u0027ve got a solid nest egg - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not different,\" she argued. \"I don\u0027t want to raise a family away from my own family. I don\u0027t want to sit in a penthouse apartment, planning dinner parties and waiting for my husband to come home late only to leave early the next morning. I\u0027m not the right girl for that life and Miguel can\u0027t settle for anything less. This isn\u0027t Pretty Woman, Russ. The girl from the wrong side of the tracks doesn\u0027t always end up with the millionaire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did not just compare yourself to a prostitute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cinderella, then. That better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly. In any case, Miguel wouldn\u0027t be settling with you,\" Russell bit out, bristling with an older brother\u0027s pride. A consummate ladies\u0027 man himself, he didn\u0027t tolerate the same nonchalance in men she dated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wouldn\u0027t be getting this either.\" She waved a hand that encompassed her greasy uniform from neck to ankle. \"One of the things I\u0027ve always loved about him was his acceptance of me just the way I am. It turns him on that I wrench and get dirty. If I slipped on a pair of heels and a strand of pearls he\u0027d probably need Viagra to fuck me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe actually couldn\u0027t imagine Miguel ever needing Viagra for any reason, but -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa.\" Russ held up a hand. \"TMI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made her smile briefly. \"I have to call Mrs. Santos. Let her know he\u0027s on the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long is he in town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to see him again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hot shiver coursed through her. The sexual ferocity on Miguel\u0027s face had made her wet. It had always been that way between them, their desire simmering below the surface, ready to boil over at the slightest provocation. \"Yes. Dinner. Tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I feel good about that. If he\u0027s pissed off, I don\u0027t want you anywhere near him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith\u0027s brows rose. \"I\u0027m a grown woman. That\u0027s not your call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been hurt enough as it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got a right to be mad, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuss stilled. \"He knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She rubbed at the knot of fear and regret in her stomach. \"But that doesn\u0027t change anything. It\u0027s his birthday tomorrow. If he wants to ring in the occasion by working out his frustration in the sack, well... I really don\u0027t mind. It\u0027s been a long assed dry spell for me and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovering his ears, her brother was up and out the door in a heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was reaching for the phone when he poked his head back in. \"What?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll run point tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer love for him swelled and constricted her chest. \"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely. Mom said I\u0027m losing my \u0027favorite uncle\u0027 status to Johnny. Can\u0027t have that. I have a rep to maintain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing her fingers to her lips, she blew him a kiss. \"You can drop him off at Mrs. Santo\u0027s house in the morning before you come in to work. And have I told you lately that you\u0027re the best?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a nasty right hook, too. You tell Miguel that if he gets out of hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith stepped out of her classic red Corvette and sucked in a deep, fortifying breath. With one forearm on the frame of the driver\u0027s side window and the other on the roof, she stared at the small bungalow behind Victorian Secrets Bed and Breakfast. Its original purpose, back when the property had been built two hundred years ago, was as the housekeeper\u0027s residence. The main house was once the governor\u0027s mansion. Seated on two acres in the middle of an otherwise modern residential area, the two story bed and breakfast had a wide wraparound porch and huge yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, the place had memories. She was certain Miguel had chosen it for that very reason. To unsettle her, maybe. Which was also the likely reason for why he didn\u0027t appear when she honked the horn. He was going to make her go inside, make her face the ghosts of their past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith shoved the car door closed and headed for the bungalow\u0027s entrance. Her stilettos clicked across the driveway, beating out a staccato rhythm that couldn\u0027t keep up with her racing heart. With effort, she resisted the urge to smooth the skirt of her dress. It was classic black, in a soft jersey and wraparound style. The crisscrossing halves created a plunging neckline that revealed the upper swells of her breasts and a hint of blue lace demi-bra, the hue of which matched her eyes. The whole ensemble was new, from her earrings to her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of it as armor. Her only defense against Miguel was his desire for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the door, she knocked on the inset glass. He called for her to come in, so she entered, but nothing could have prepared her for what she found inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said, sounding completely unapologetic as he scrubbed at shower-damp hair with a towel. \"I had a business call that took longer than expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the door by stumbling back and leaning heavily against it, her knees weakened by a lust so ferocious it made her dizzy. Brazenly unabashed, Miguel stood in the living room completely nude, his gorgeous caramel-hued skin on display, his beautiful abs and biceps flexing as he dried himself. His body was the stuff of orgasmic dreams, hard and rippling with muscle. Wide shoulders tapering down to a lean waist and hips. Maturity graced him, turning his formerly sinewy and lanky body into a powerhouse of potent masculinity. He personified the fantasy of a sensual Latin lover, dripping sex and confidence, free of any inhibitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze fell to his cock and stayed there helplessly, her mouth watering at his virility. He was half-erect and impressive. When he was fully aroused, as he was quickly becoming under the avidity of her gaze, he was a sexual god. A small sound escaped her, a needy cry as her pussy grew slick and soft with wanting. He had been her first lover, her virginity given to him in the bedroom that waited just a few feet behind him, a room in which he\u0027d ruined her for other men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharp possessiveness sunk its claws into her, curling her hands into fists. The need to claim him, and that decadently sinful body he\u0027d once pledged to her, was so voracious she burned with it. Mine, she thought savagely. He\u0027s mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe towel fell to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith panted through parted lips as he came toward her in a riveting display of golden skin and sinuous muscle. His eyes, so dark they were nearly black, smoldered with carnal intent. The curve of his exquisite mouth was etched with cruelty. He was so hot with lust and anger she was surprised the dampness on his skin didn\u0027t steam away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver of fear sharpened the knife\u0027s edge of her hunger. She was aching with emptiness, tense with expectation, heartbroken that they should be at this place - wanting each other so deeply they were sick with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miguel,\" she breathed as his hands caught her by the hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go anywhere like this,\" he bit out, sounding furious. His face was pressed into her hair, his breathing harsh against her ear. One hand cupped the back of her thigh, kneading with almost painful squeezes as he moved up and under the hem of her dress. He palmed her bare cheek before sliding around to the front, growling when he found the wet satin covering her pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith gasped at the electric contact, her hips thrusting forward without volition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching her around the waist with his arm, he hitched her up hard against him. His questing fingers found the edge of her thong\u0027s elastic band and eased beneath it, sliding through the silky moisture that slickened her folds to rub her clit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jolted against him, her body strung so tight she thought she might snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hot and creamy, Faith,\" he taunted softly, circling the clenching opening of her vagina. \"And I\u0027m hard and aching for you. Were you thinking of me when you stepped into this thong and pulled it on? Were you thinking of what it would do to me? How crazed it would make me? Did the thought of me desperate to fuck you turn you on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. It\u0027s been a long time. Wouldn\u0027t want there to be any awkwardness.\" Her voice came out with the husky assurance of a practiced seductress, but inside she was a young woman again, madly in love and overwhelmed by a hunger that could only be appeased by a man who resented her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/all-revved-up-dangerous-1/page-2.html","bookId":1920,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:01 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:01 AM"}
