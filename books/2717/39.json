Awkward, we know. That’s why we are issuing a voluntary recall of the Git R Done 447 Personal Safety® handgun. Issuing this voluntary recall shows how much we care, and it is hard to dislike or take legal action against those who really care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCUT TO: Image of the Git R Done 447 with a red circle and line through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVO, CONT’D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you purchased a Git R Done 447, please do not fire the weapon.

Let’s take stock of everything we have.” Taylor marched before the line of sleepy beauty queens, inspecting them drill sergeant–style. “Miss Nebraska, what are the island’s natural resources, please? Report.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Lou scratched at a bite on her leg with the toes of her other foot, holding on to Adina for balance. “Um, trees. Plants. Grubs. Fish. Coconuts. Water. Mud. That’s all I can think of right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very good. Miss New Mexico, what salvaged materials do we have from the plane?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss New Mexico listed things off, using her fingers to keep count. “Some teeth-bleaching trays, padded bras, three safety razors, bobby pins, thongs, the jars of Lady ’Stache Off and the radio Jennifer and Sosie found, the hot roller sets, two straightening irons, bathing suits, assorted shoes, some makeup, and a few evening gowns, including that unholy beaded green thing over there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was Miss Massachusetts’s, I think,” Brittani said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetra smirked. “Maybe it wasn’t the plane crash that killed her. Maybe she actually saw herself in that dress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s not speak ill of the dead, no matter how hideous their fashion sense,” Taylor instructed. “All right, Teen Dreamers. These are our tools. Starting today, we are adding a new survival skills portion to our pageant. I want you to treat this with the seriousness you would your other duties, like tanning and exfoliation. You need to wow the judges. Think about what you can make with what we’ve got.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s like an episode of Design This!21 All we need is Roger Piston to come in and say, ‘Do your magic!’” Miss Montana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m turning our program over to Miss California and Miss Colorado. Please give them the same attention you would the makeup artist showing you how to contour your nose and make your lips look bigger under the lights, which I never have to do as my lips are in perfect proportion to my face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShanti and Nicole stood side by side, but they’d left plenty of space between them. Nicole’s arms were crossed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShanti cleared her throat. “The first thing —”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who said you were first?” Nicole interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to go first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. But it’s nice to be asked.

Drink enough and you’ll die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiara raised her hand. “But will you still be bloated?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShanti ignored her. “It’s a tropical climate, so we get some rain every day. We can make a tarp out of Miss Massachusetts’s ugly evening gown to collect that rainwater to drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Montana made a face. “Ew.

It was an intricate system of weights and counterweights. But the engineering was best-case scenario, and their meager resources were worst-case. Nothing was working and the girls soon grew frustrated. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-queens/page-39.html","bookId":2717,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
