He had met the man ten years before, when Raych had been sent to lure Jo-Jo Joranum to his destruction, and one look was more than enough.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Namarti had changed little in ten years. Anger and hatred were still the dominant characteristics one could see in him-or that Raych could see in him, at any rate, for he realized he was not an impartial witness-and those seemed to have marinated him into leathery permanence. His face was a trifle more gaunt, his hair was flecked with gray, but his thin-lipped mouth was set in the same harsh line and his dark eyes were as brilliantly dangerous as ever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; That was enough and Raych kept his eyes averted. Namarti, he felt, was not the type of person who would take to someone who could stare lm straight in the face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Namarti seemed to devour Raych with his own eyes, but the slight sneer his face always seemed to wear remained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He turned to Andorin, who stood uneasily to one side, and said, quite ;is though the subject of conversation were not present, \"This is the man, then.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Andorin nodded and his lips moved in a soundless \"Yes, Chief.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Namarti said to Raych abruptly, \"Your name.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Planchet, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You believe in our cause?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, sir.\" He spoke carefully, in accordance with Andorin\u0027s instructions. \"I am a democrat and want greater participation of the people in the governmental process.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Namarti\u0027s eyes flicked in Andorin\u0027s direction. \"A speechmaker.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He looked back at Raych. \"Are you willing to undertake risks for the cause?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Any risk, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You will do as you are told? No questions? No hanging back?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I will follow orders.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Do you know anything about gardening?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Raych hesitated. \"No, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re a Trantorian, then? Born under the dome?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I was born in Millimaru, sir, and I was brought up in Dahl.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Very well,\" said Namarti. Then to Andorin, \"Take him out and deliver him temporarily to the men waiting there. They will take good care of him. Then come back, Andorin. I want to speak to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; When Andorin returned, a profound change had come over Namarti. Ibis eyes were glittering and his mouth was twisted into a feral grin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Andorin,\" he said, \"the gods we spoke of the other day are with us to an extent I couldn\u0027t have imagined.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I told you the man was suitable for our purposes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Far more suitable than you think. You know, of course, the tale of how Hari Seldon our revered First Minister, sent his son-or foster son, rather-to see Joranum and to set the trap into which Joranum, against my advice, fell.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes,\" said Andorin, nodding wearily, \"I know the story.\" He said it with the air of one who knew the story entirely too well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I saw that boy only that once, but his image burned into my brain. Do you suppose that ten years\u0027 passage and false heels and a shaved mustache could fool me? That Planchet of yours is Raych, the foster son of Hari Seldon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Andorin paled and held his breath for a moment. He said, \"Are you sure of that, Chief?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"As sure as I am that you\u0027re standing here in front of me and that you have introduced an enemy into our midst.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I had no idea-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t get nervous,\" said Namarti. \"I consider it the best thing you have ever done in your idle aristocratic life. You have played the role that the gods have marked out for you. If I had not known who he was, he might have fulfilled the function for which he was undoubtedly intended: to be a spy in our midst and an informant of our most secret plans. But since I know who he is, it won\u0027t work that way. Instead, we now have everything. \" Namarti rubbed his hands together in delight and, haltingly, as if he realized how far out of character it was for him, he smiled-and laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46699.html","bookId":169,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:44:06 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:44:06 AM"}
