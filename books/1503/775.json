From Bing’er, they had already learned what happened to Zhou Weiqing. Furthermore, when they were departing for the Xuantian Continent, Tian’er had allowed Bing’er to accompany Zhou Weiqing alone, and they would wish to repay her kindness.

Everything else aside, Tian’er was bearing his child although they weren’t actually married yet, this was no small matter! After all, she was the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, Xue AoTian’s only daughter. However, from the fact that Xue AoTian had actually allowed her to come here, he should not be too angry.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHearing Zhou Weiqing mention her father, Tian’er stuck out her tongue and said: “Father was quite furious. I was almost unable to return here. That was really the first time I saw father’s expression change so much, being in such a rage yet having that helpless look on his face. Luckily, he was unable to endure my constant coaxing and pestering, so I managed to return.

Father also said that with both our bloodline inheritance nurturing him, especially with the nourishment and protection of the Saint Energy, our child’s defense will be so strong that even his own attacks will not be effective.

Worse still, it looked like the Nether Realm had some connections with some of the powers in the Boundless Mainland. Of course, from the current situation, all signs pointed to the Blood Red Hell being the power in question. The destructive attribute energies they had displayed during the Heavenly Jewel Tournament was the greatest proof.
