I walked to Armstrong\u0027s, glanced in the window, but went on walking to Fifty-eighth and around the corner and halfway down the block. I went into Joey Farrell\u0027s and stood at the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much of a crowd. Music on the jukebox, some baritone crooner backed up with a lot of strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Double Early Times,\" I said. \"With water back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there, not really thinking of anything, while the bearded barman poured the drink and drew the chaser and set them both before me. I had placed a ten dollar bill on the counter. He cracked it, brought my change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the drink. Light danced in the rich amber fluid. I reached for it, and a soft inner voice murmured Welcome home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI withdrew my hand. I left the drink on the bar and took a dime from my pile of change. I went to the phone and dropped the dime and dialed Jan\u0027s number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFine, I thought. I\u0027d kept my promise. Of course I might have misdialed, or the phone company might have fucked up. Such things have been known to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the dime back in the slot and dialed again. I let it ring a dozen times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFair enough. I got my dime back and returned to the bar. My change was as I\u0027d left it, and so were the two glasses in front of me, the bourbon and the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought, Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe case was finished, solved, wrapped up. The killer would never kill anyone again. I had done a whole lot of things right and felt very good about my role in the proceedings. I wasn\u0027t nervous, I wasn\u0027t anxious, I wasn\u0027t depressed. I was fine, for Christ\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was a double shot of bourbon on the bar in front of me. I hadn\u0027t wanted a drink, I hadn\u0027t even thought of a drink, and here I was with a drink in front of me and I was going to swallow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? What the hell was the matter with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I drank the fucking drink I would end up dead or in the hospital. It might take a day or a week or a month but that was how it would play. I knew that. And I didn\u0027t want to be dead and I didn\u0027t want to go to the hospital, but here I was in a gin joint with a drink in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left the drink on the bar. I left my change on the bar. I got out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt half past eight I walked down the flight of basement stairs and into the meeting room at St. Paul\u0027s. I got a cup of coffee and some cookies and took a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought, You almost drank. You\u0027re eleven days sober and you went into a bar you had no reason to be in and ordered a drink for no reason at all. You almost picked up the drink, you were that close to it, you almost blew eleven days after the way you sweated to get them. What the hell is the matter with you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chairman read the preamble and introduced the speaker. I sat there and tried to listen to his story and I couldn\u0027t. My mind kept returning to the flat reality of that glass of bourbon. I hadn\u0027t wanted it, I hadn\u0027t even thought about it, and yet I\u0027d been drawn to it like iron filings to a magnet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought, My name is Matt and I think I\u0027m going crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speaker finished what he was saying. I joined in the applause. I went to the bathroom during the break, less out of need than to avoid having to talk to anybody. I came back to the room and got yet another cup of coffee that I neither needed nor wanted. I thought about leaving the coffee and going back to my hotel. The hell, I\u0027d been up two days and a night without a break. Some sleep would do me more good than a meeting I couldn\u0027t pay attention to in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my coffee cup and took it to my seat and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there during the discussion. The words people spoke rolled over me like waves. I just sat there, unable to hear a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was my turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Matt,\" I said, and paused, and started over. \"My name is Matt,\" I said, \"and I\u0027m an alcoholic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the goddamnedest thing happened. I started to cry. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-49.html","bookId":2323,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:25 AM"}
