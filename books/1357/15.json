He returned to the stove, which he took it upon himself to watch, whilst his companions regained their berths in search of a little warmth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was then six in the evening, and Penellan set about preparing supper. He went down into the steward’s room for some salt meat, which he wished to soak in the boiling water. When he returned, he found André Vasling in his place, cooking some pieces of grease in a basin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I was there before you,” said Penellan roughly; “why have you taken my place?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “For the same reason that you claim it,” returned Vasling: “because I want to cook my supper.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You will take that off at once, or we shall see!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We shall see nothing,” said Vasling; “my supper shall be cooked in spite of you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You shall not eat it, then,” cried Penellan, rushing upon Vasling, who seized his cutlass, crying —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Help, Norwegians! Help, Aupic!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These, in the twinkling of an eye, sprang to their feet, armed with pistols and daggers. The crisis had come.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Penellan precipitated himself upon Vasling, to whom, no doubt, was confided the task to fight him alone; for his accomplices rushed to the beds where lay Misonne, Turquiette, and Nouquet. The latter, ill and defenceless, was delivered over to Herming’s ferocity. The carpenter seized a hatchet, and, leaving his berth, hurried up to encounter Aupic. Turquiette and Jocki, the Norwegian, struggled fiercely. Gervique and Gradlin, suffering horribly, were not even conscious of what was passing around them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nouquet soon received a stab in the side, and Herming turned to Penellan, who was fighting desperately. André Vasling had seized him round the body.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the beginning of the affray the basin had been upset on the stove, and the grease running over the burning coals, impregnated the atmosphere with its odour. Marie rose with cries of despair, and hurried to the bed of old Jean Cornbutte.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Vasling, less strong than Penellan, soon perceived that the latter was getting the better of him. They were too close together to make use of their weapons. The mate, seeing Herming, cried out —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Help, Herming!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Help, Misonne!” shouted Penellan, in his turn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Misonne was rolling on the ground with Aupic, who was trying to stab him with his cutlass. The carpenter’s hatchet was of little use to him, for he could not wield it, and it was with the greatest difficulty that he parried the lunges which Aupic made with his knife.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile blood flowed amid the groans and cries. Turquiette, thrown down by Jocki, a man of immense strength, had received a wound in the shoulder, and he tried in vain to clutch a pistol which hung in the Norwegian’s belt. The latter held him as in a vice, and it was impossible for him to move.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At Vasling’s cry for help, who was being held by Penellan close against the door, Herming rushed up. As he was about to stab the Breton’s back with his cutlass, the latter felled him to the earth with a vigorous kick. His effort to do this enabled Vasling to disengage his right arm; but the door, against which they pressed with all their weight, suddenly yielded, and Vasling fell over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of a sudden a terrible growl was heard, and a gigantic bear appeared on the steps. Vasling saw him first. He was not four feet away from him. At the same moment a shot was heard, and the bear, wounded or frightened, retreated. Vasling, who had succeeded in regaining his feet, set-out in pursuit of him, abandoning Penellan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Penellan then replaced the door, and looked around him. Misonne and Turquiette, tightly garrotted by their antagonists, had been thrown into a corner, and made vain efforts to break loose. Penellan rushed to their assistance, but was overturned by the two Norwegians and Aupic. His exhausted strength did not permit him to resist these three men, who so clung to him as to hold him motionless Then, at the cries of the mate, they hurried on deck, thinking that Louis Cornbutte was to be encountered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e André Vasling was struggling with a bear, which he had already twice stabbed with his knife. The animal, beating the air with his heavy paws, was trying to clutch Vasling; he retiring little by little on the barricading, was apparently doomed, when a second shot was heard. The bear fell. André Vasling raised his head and saw Louis Cornbutte in the ratlines of the mizen-mast, his gun in his hand. Louis had shot the bear in the heart, and he was dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hate overcame gratitude in Vasling’s breast; but before satisfying it, he looked around him. Aupic’s head was broken by a paw-stroke, and he lay lifeless on deck. Jocki, hatchet in hand, was with difficulty parrying the blows of the second bear which had just killed Aupic. The animal had received two wounds, and still struggled desperately. A third bear was directing his way towards the ship’s prow. Vasling paid no attention to him, but, followed by Herming, went to the aid of Jocki; but Jocki, seized by the beast’s paws, was crushed, and when the bear fell under the shots of the other two men, he held only a corpse in his shaggy arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We are only two, now” said Vasling, with gloomy ferocity, “but if we yield, it will not be without vengeance!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Herming reloaded his pistol without replying. Before all, the third bear must be got rid of. Vasling looked forward, but did not see him. On raising his eyes, he perceived him erect on the barricading, clinging to the ratlines and trying to reach Louis. Vasling let his gun fall, which he had aimed at the animal, while a fierce joy glittered in his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ah,” he cried, “you owe me that vengeance!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis took refuge in the top of the mast. The bear kept mounting, and was not more than six feet from Louis, when he raised his gun and pointed it at the animal’s heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Vasling raised his weapon to shoot Louis if the bear fell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis fired, but the bear did not appear to be hit, for he leaped with a bound towards the top. The whole mast shook.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Vasling uttered a shout of exultation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Herming,” he cried, “go and find Marie! Go and find my betrothed!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Herming descended the cabin stairs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile the furious beast had thrown himself upon Louis, who was trying to shelter himself on the other side of the mast; but at the moment that his enormous paw was raised to break his head, Louis, seizing one of the backstays, let himself slip down to the deck, not without danger, for a ball hissed by his ear when he was half-way down. Vasling had shot at him, and missed him. The two adversaries now confronted each other, cutlass in hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The combat was about to become decisive. To entirely glut his vengeance, and to have the young girl witness her lover’s death, Vasling had deprived himself of Herming’s aid. He could now reckon only on himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis and Vasling seized each other by the collar, and held each other with iron grip. One of them must fall. They struck each other violently. The blows were only half parried, for blood soon flowed from both. Vasling tried to clasp his adversary about the neck with his arm, to bring him to the ground. Louis, knowing that he who fell was lost, prevented him, and succeeded in grasping his two arms; but in doing this he let fall his cutlass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Piteous cries now assailed his ears; it was Marie’s voice. Herming was trying to drag her up. Louis was seized with a desperate rage. He stiffened himself to bend Vasling’s loins; but at this moment the combatants felt themselves seized in a powerful embrace. The bear, having descended from the mast, had fallen upon the two men. Vasling was pressed against the animal’s body. Louis felt his claws entering his flesh. The bear, was strangling both of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Help! help! Herming!” cried the mate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Help! Penellan!” cried Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Steps were heard on the stairs. Penellan appeared, loaded his pistol, and discharged it in the bear’s ear; he roared; the pain made him relax his paws for a moment, and Louis, exhausted, fell motionless on the deck; but the bear, closing his paws tightly in a supreme agony, fell, dragging down the wretched Vasling, whose body was crushed under him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Penellan hurried to Louis Cornbutte’s assistance. No serious wound endangered his life: he had only lost his breath for a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Marie!” he said, opening his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Saved!” replied Perfellan. “Herming is lying there with a knife-wound in his stomach.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And the bears —”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Dead, Louis; dead, like our enemies! But for those beasts we should have been lost. Truly, they came to our succour. Let us thank Heaven!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis and Penellan descended to the cabin, and Marie fell into their arms.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1475/44237.html","bookId":1357,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:10:18 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:10:18 PM"}
