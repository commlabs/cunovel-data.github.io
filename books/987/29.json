You must judge for me. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They brought a card—the housemaid with the fan-teeth held it gingerly between black finger and blacker thumb—and it carried the name Mr. R.H. Hoffer in old Gothic letters. A hasty rush through the file of bills showed me that I owed nothing to any Mr. Hoffer, and assuming my sweetest smile, I bade Fan of the Teeth show him up. Enter stumblingly an entirely canary-coloured young person about twenty years of age, with a suspicious bulge in the bosom of his coat. He had grown no hair on his face; his eyes were of a delicate water-green, and his[Pg 306] hat was a brown billycock, which he fingered nervously. As the room was blue with tobacco-smoke (and Latakia at that) he coughed even more nervously, and began seeking for me. I hid behind the writing-table and took notes. What I most noted was the bulge in his bosom. When a man begins to bulge as to that portion of his anatomy, hit him in the eye, for reasons which will be apparent later on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He saw me and advanced timidly. I invited him seductively to the only other chair, and \"What\u0027s the trouble?\" said I.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wanted to see you,\" said he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am me,\" said I.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I—I—I thought you would be quite otherwise,\" said he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am, on the contrary, completely this way,\" said I. \"Sit still, take your time and tell me all about it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He wriggled tremulously for three minutes, and coughed again. I surveyed him, and waited developments. The bulge under the bosom crackled. Then I frowned. At the end of three minutes he began.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 307]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wanted to see what you were like,\" said he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I inclined my head stiffly, as though all London habitually climbed the storeys on the same errand and rather wearied me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then he delivered himself of a speech which he had evidently got by heart. He flushed painfully in the delivery.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am flattered,\" I said at the conclusion. \"It\u0027s beastly gratifying.

I felt as though I were walking in a dream; having been till then ignorant of the fact that earth held young men who held five-act tragedies in their insides. The young man gave me the whole of the performance, from the preliminary scene, where nothing more than an eruption of Vesuvius occurs to mar the serenity of the manager, till the very end, where the Roman sentry of Pompeii is slowly banked up with ashes in the presence of the audience, and dies murmuring through his helmet-vizor: \"S.P.Q.R.R.I.P.R.S.V.P.,\" or words to that effect.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For three hours and one-half he read to me.
