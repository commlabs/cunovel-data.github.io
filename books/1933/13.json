Until the end, Carol had hoped the two of them would be able to settle their differences and reunite. After the divorce, though, it seemed Ellie was intent on moving forward with her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m away from home so much,” her brother said. “It gets lonely, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was what Ellie had implied but Carol had refused to accept it. Rick would never do such a thing, she’d told herself. He was her older brother, her hero. Still, she had to know. “You…didn’t have an affair, did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said. “It wasn’t like that…But Ellie—well, she can’t accept the fact that I’m around beautiful women on the job and away from home. It became a trust issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol wouldn’t feel entirely comfortable with Doug constantly being around other women, either, but she didn’t say so. Her brother didn’t need to hear about her own insecurities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why she felt that way,” Rick went on. “It’s Ellie I love.” He wiped his face in a weary gesture. “I tried to convince her that she’s the only woman for me but she wouldn’t listen. I can’t believe she threw away our marriage because she didn’t trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol couldn’t believe it, either, but she kept her thoughts to herself. There were two possibilities: Ellie had been jealous and irrational or there was more to Rick’s behavior than he was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did everything I could to talk Ellie out of the divorce,” he continued. “Okay, so maybe I was tempted, but hell, what am I supposed to do every night? Sit in my hotel room and watch television? I did go out occasionally. Can you really blame me for that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe there was some basis for Ellie’s distrust. Still, Carol found it practically inconceivable that her brother would cheat on his wife. He was an honorable man but he was a man, and if he had a drink with a flight attendant or a female pilot now and then—was that so bad? Perhaps Ellie had simply overreacted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose I should be grateful we delayed having a family,” he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol agreed; if there was anything to be grateful for, it was that. She hated the thought of children suffering the upheaval of a broken home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellie wanted kids, but I wasn’t ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any idea what I should do now?” he asked, peering at her as if she could provide him with answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe patted his arm gently, not knowing how to respond. Rick could be his own worst enemy. He’d always been a sociable person, the life of the party, a natural daredevil, and she’d loved and admired him as her gallant older brother. It saddened her to see how unhappy he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to prove yourself to Ellie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But how?” he cried. “I’m telling you, Carol, I’m at my wits’ end. Ellie claims she doesn’t want to see me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps you could write to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Write what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A letter,” she said. “Better yet, use e-mail. Tell her you’re an idiot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think she already knows that.” For the first time since they’d started talking, she saw a hint of smile on his face. “What if she won’t answer me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t take no for an answer. Let her know you aren’t giving up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should I send her flowers? That kind of thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring her strawberries and fresh fruit from the Pike Place Market.” Fresh fruit was available in Juneau, but it was extremely expensive. “A whole basket,” Carol suggested. “As I recall, Ellie loves blueberries.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She does?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rick! You should know that. She was your wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the problem,” her brother moaned. “I didn’t pay her near enough attention. I didn’t realize how much I loved her until it was too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you’re going to make up for lost time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, and it was the same boyish smile she remembered from childhood. “Your enthusiasm is catching. You really think I can win her back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she cried. It felt good to have her brother turn to her, to need her help. Rick had made a mistake and hadn’t fought for his marriage, but she’d do everything she could to support him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALIX TOWNSEND\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL aurel owed Alix, so she had her roommate cover for her the minute Jordan Turner showed up at the video store on Tuesday night. As soon as she saw that he was getting ready to leave, she slipped out front and pretended to be on break. Her hand shook as she lit a cigarette; she leaned against the building and took a deep drag, hoping the nicotine would calm her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door opened and Jordan stepped outside, Alix called to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over his shoulder. “How’s it going?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. I didn’t see you earlier,” she lied. “I put aside The Matrix for you if you’re still interested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, sure, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I aim to please.” She reached for her cigarettes and silently offered him one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should’ve guessed he was a nonsmoker. She stared at the tip of her lit cigarette. “I’m trying to cut back. These are the low-nicotine cigarettes, but I swear I’m going to end up with a hernia getting any taste out of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled at her stupid joke and a warm, happy feeling came over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve seen you around the neighborhood,” Jordan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alix Townsend. Alix, spelled A-L-I-X.” She thrust out her hand, which he shook. “You’re Jordan Turner,” she went on before he had a chance to introduce himself. “Your driver’s license is on file. You live off Fifth Avenue, don’t you?” She didn’t mind letting him know she was interested. She thought of the boy she’d once known with the same name, but that was years ago, back in grade school. He’d been a decent kid, and she’d had a crush on him, but it felt like something that had happened in another time and another place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, that’s me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be the same Jordan Turner? She studied him, wondering if it was possible. She took another deep drag of the cigarette in an effort to calm her rattled nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, this couldn’t be the same Jordan Turner, she decided. Still, her memories of him were fleeting and she wasn’t absolutely sure. She might have dredged up the courage to ask, except that he continued the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t work far from here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he stopped in for videos on his way home from work. Lots of people did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can tell a lot about a person from the videos they rent,” she said casually. She tossed the cigarette onto the sidewalk and crushed it with the toe of her combat boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll bet you can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to know what I learned about you?” This was one of her best conversational gambits—character analysis through movie selection—although she didn’t have much opportunity to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, and she was struck by how cute he was when he smiled. Laurel couldn’t understand what Alix saw in a guy as average as Jordan. She couldn’t explain it to her friend, either. Someone attracted to a guy who rented XXX videos just wouldn’t get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan leaned against the wall beside her. “Go ahead and tell me what you’ve figured out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlustered now, Alix suddenly found it difficult to express herself. She faltered and struggled with what she wanted to say and to her utter humiliation, she couldn’t do it. In one final attempt to redeem herself, she gestured weakly with her hands and said. “They’re cool, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cool?” Jordan repeated. “You mean I pick cool movies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” She wanted to crumple onto the sidewalk and disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat was radiating from her face. “I’ve got to get back to work,” she said gruffly and without another word, she practically ran back into the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make matters worse, Laurel was waiting for her. “How’d it go?” her roommate asked eagerly the instant Alix returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix glared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel raised both hands. “That bad, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sick feeling attacked Alix’s stomach. It was like the nausea she’d experienced as a kid when her parents started to fight. That painful sensation used to corrode her stomach—as if she were somehow responsible for every bad thing that had befallen their lives. Jordan might be the same Jordan Turner she’d once known, but there’d been no time to ask. And she couldn’t now, not after she’d run away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?” Laurel asked, studying her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix brushed aside the question and marched to the back of the store, where she walked into the employee rest room. The toilet was disgusting. She didn’t want to guess how long it’d been since the last cleaning. The blue additive didn’t begin to disguise the yellow ring around the inside of the bowl. Funny she’d notice that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in front of the sink, Alix stared into the mirror. The voices that came to taunt her were familiar ones. They were the ugly, negative voices that shouted words she tried to ignore. Voices that laughed in her face and said she was a loser. No matter what she did or how hard she tried, she’d never amount to anything. Her life was doomed. This was her lot. She’d never earn more than minimum wage, never be loved, never have a real home with things that normal people took for granted, like a phone and a dishwasher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing her hands to her face, Alix closed her eyes and felt the dark misery descend. She could feel its oppressive weight settle on her shoulders, shoving her down to a place deep inside. She tried unsuccessfully to shake off the depression, tried to shake off the ugly words that echoed in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe repulsive names her mother had called her rang through her head. She could hear a teacher’s chastisement and belittling comments next, and the humiliation returned as strong now as it had been twelve years earlier. She wanted to bury all the hurtful words. Instead they reverberated through her mind with such force she nearly slumped to the rest room floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded at the door, startling her. Alix jerked her head toward the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alix, you in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel. Damn. “What?” she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The guy you were just talking to. I don’t know his name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlix bit her lower lip. “You help him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He asked for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” she asked, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” Laurel said irritably. “Am I supposed to read minds, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be out in a minute, all right?” Alix straightened, brushing her hands through her hair as she came to grips with this information. She wondered what possible reason Jordan could have for seeking her out. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shop-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-1/page-13.html","bookId":1933,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM"}
