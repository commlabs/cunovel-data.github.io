Is this furniture all yours?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Such as it is.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You won\u0027t want it. Any articles that you do not value you had better send to an auction store to sell. The flat is already well furnished.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A tenant on the floor below has offered to buy the furniture,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Does he make you a fair offer?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He offers thirty-five dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [172]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A low price, but it will save you trouble to accept it. When that matter is arranged I will send my carriage, and take you and your sister right over to your new home.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Without dwelling upon details, it is sufficient to say that before sunset the two sisters found themselves installed in a pretty and cosey home in a much better part of the city. There was a parlor, fronting on the street, a kitchen, and there were three sleeping-rooms, so that each of the little family could have one. The parlor contained a piano, a bookcase, well filled—this had not belonged to the recent tenants, but was supplied, without the knowledge of Rose, by Miss Wilmot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Adeline uttered a cry of delight as she went from room to room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is delightful!\" she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Here is an easy-chair for you,\" said Miss Wilmot. \"It will be more comfortable than a rocking-chair, even.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This, too, had been added by the thoughtful spinster.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now open the piano and let me hear you play,\" said Miss Wilmot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [173]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While Rose was playing, her benevolent friend nodded approvingly more than once.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ll do,\" she said. \"I confess I had some doubts about your qualifications as a teacher, but I can see that you are a brilliant performer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If I can obtain pupils, I hope to suit,\" said Rose, modestly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have some in view. An acquaintance of mine, Mrs. Tilton, of West Forty-second street, is in want of a music-teacher for her two girls. I will send you there, with a note, to-morrow. But first I must give you a hint. How much were you intending to charge for a lesson?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I had not thought,\" said Rose, hesitating. \"How would fifty cents do?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Fifty cents!\" repeated Miss Wilmot, with a rising inflection. \"If you undervalue yourself to that extent, no one will think you know how to teach. You must charge two dollars per lesson.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But will anybody pay me so much?\" asked Rose, amazed. \"To one who has only been earning thirty-five cents a day at vest-making, [174] fifty cents an hour seems very large pay.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My dear child, be guided by me. I know the world, and the world will set very much the same value upon you that you set on yourself. Ask Mrs. Tilton two dollars an hour.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But if she objects to pay it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Say that you are sorry that you cannot make any arrangements.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am afraid I can\u0027t keep a straight face when I ask such a price, Miss Wilmot.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes, you will! Don\u0027t feel nervous. If you lose the pupils, I will see that you don\u0027t suffer by it. By the way, put on your best dress, for it is desirable that you make a favorable first impression.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will follow your advice, Miss Wilmot,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can\u0027t do better.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next day Rose rang the bell at the door of a fine brown-stone house on West Forty-second street.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is Mrs. Tilton at home?\" she asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, miss. Who shall I say wishes to see her?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [175]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The music-teacher.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rose was shown into the drawing-room, and presently Mrs. Tilton entered. She was a tall, blonde lady of fashionable appearance, thoroughly worldly, and influenced by externals to a large extent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I believe Miss Wilmot has written you in reference to the subject of my call,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Miss Beaufort. You are a music-teacher?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rose bowed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My two little girls have made a beginning, but have only taken two quarters each. I wish them to have every advantage.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rose bowed again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course, any one recommended by Miss Wilmot can hardly fail to be competent. May I ask, Miss Beaufort, where you live?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"At the Wilmot Flats, in West Twenty-fifth street.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you are a tenant of Miss Wilmot?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, madam. My brother and sister and myself live together.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course you have a piano at home?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [176]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, madam,\" answered Rose, glad to answer the question in the affirmative.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I asked because it might at times be more convenient—when we were preparing for company, for instance—to send your pupils to you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just as may suit you, madam.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, as to your terms, Miss Beaufort?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I charge two dollars per lesson,\" answered Rose, as boldly as she could.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Isn\u0027t that high?\" asked Mrs. Tilton. \"Most lady teachers do not charge as much.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am quite aware of that,\" said Rose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think some charge only a dollar per lesson.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I presume you are right,\" said Rose; but, obedient to Miss Wilmot\u0027s suggestions, she didn\u0027t offer to reduce her own price. \"I hope to make my services worth the amount I ask.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you won\u0027t accept a less price?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should prefer not to do so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Tilton was not a generous woman. She was disposed to haggle about prices, and had Rose applied to her for work as a seamstress she would have driven a hard bargain [177] with her, but, as the friend and protégé of Miss Jane Wilmot, a lady of the highest social consideration, she did not venture to follow her own economical inclinations. In fact, Mrs. Tilton was not of an old family. Her husband had recently become rich, and though she aspired to be fashionable, there were circles to which she could not obtain admission. She plumed herself on her acquaintance with Miss Wilmot, and would not, on any account, have had Rose report to that lady that she had been unwilling to pay her price. Two dollars an hour seemed high, but she knew very well that she must buy social recognition, and that she valued above money.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well,\" she said, after a pause; \"I will pay your price. Can you give me Tuesday and Friday afternoons from three to five?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, madam.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then we will commence next Tuesday, if you please. By the way, my neighbor, Mrs. Green, also desires to secure instruction for her daughter, and I promised to ask you to call.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [178]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will do so now if the lady is likely to be in,\" said Rose, gladly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think you will find her in, now. You may hand her my card.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Green lived but three doors away. She was at home, and engaged her, without any demur as to price, to give her daughter two hours a week, Monday and Thursday afternoons being selected.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As Rose walked home she could hardly credit her good fortune. Six lessons a week at two dollars apiece would amount to twelve dollars, and leave her plenty of time to herself. Twelve dollars! and till now her weekly income, laboring all day, had been less than three dollars.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Addie,\" she said, after recounting her success to her sister, \"do you know I feel quite like a young lady of fortune? I am almost afraid that it is all a dream, and that I shall wake up some day and find myself back again at Mrs. Flanagan\u0027s.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let us enjoy it as long as it lasts, Rose,\" said Adeline. \"I wish I could help. I don\u0027t like to have the whole family leaning on you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [179]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Adeline had her wish. Three days later Miss Wilmot came in with two little girls.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They want to take lessons in drawing,\" she said. \"They have a taste, but their father is a mechanic, and they have been unable to gratify it. Now, I have been thinking that I will let you pay the rent by instructing them, and leave your sister her whole time to teach music.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should like nothing better,\" said Adeline, brightening up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then they will begin at once.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Adeline was fond of children, and found instruction in her favorite accomplishment no task, but a positive pleasure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall not be a burden upon you, Rose, any longer,\" she said, cheerfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should think not. If you pay the rent, it will be no light help. I shall insist on contributing my share, and will pay you fifteen dollars a month to make matters even.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Adeline protested, but Rose was firm. Her invalid sister\u0027s spirits were raised, and life was no longer monotonous, now that she felt herself of some use in the world.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [180]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you know, Rose,\" she said, \"I don\u0027t think I should be happier if our share of grandfather\u0027s money had come to us, as we once anticipated.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80918.html","bookId":467,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM"}
