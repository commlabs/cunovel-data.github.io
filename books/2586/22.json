From this distance it’s hard to see details, their appearances blurring. My body buzzes with the hope that Catcher won’t be there. That I’m wrong about Elias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I see the flash of his hair, the white-blond of it shimmering in the shadows. I see the familiar curve of his cheek, the line of his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatcher shuffles through the herd of Mudo, stopping to stand among them, his lips parted as if he’s moaning. I press my palm to my mouth, biting it to keep from screaming. I didn’t realize until now just what it would mean to see him like this. The pain and the horror are unbearable. I shove my fists into my eyes, wanting to claw out the vision of Catcher as Mudo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands start to shake and I can’t force them to stop. I try not to stare at my fingers, at the blood that’s dried in the cracks of my skin. Not my blood but someone else’s. The enormity of the last few days slams into me—the walls between the compartments where I’ve stashed each bit dissolve. I toss the knife aside, scarlet red still blurring the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve just stabbed someone and his blood coats my skin and clothes. I wipe my hands on the ground until they sting but still they’re stained crimson. Catcher’s gone. Returned. Mudo. I never got to tell him good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything is wrong. Everything has changed. I’ve lied and broken rules and killed someone. I’ve broken my promises and failed. I don’t know who I am anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the sobs break over me. Painful, they flatten me to the ground. I don’t have the energy to fight anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI startle when arms wrap around me but I don’t bother protesting. I’m too ready to give up on everything, willing to let whatever happens to me happen. But then I can tell by the way he pulls me to himself, by the way he holds me as if he could push the pieces of me back together again, that it’s Elias. I can tell by his smell and his strength and the way he leans his cheek against my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how he found me—how he knew I was here—and I don’t care. I want to hate him; I should hate him for who he is and what he’s done to Catcher. But for just a moment I allow myself to soak in his comfort because I need his strength. To fall into the feeling of him against me, another heartbeat with mine. And then I take a deep breath and lash out. Pushing him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You monster!” I sound feral, my voice a tear-fueled growl. I take everything and channel it into rage as if he’s the reason for all my pain. Wanting someone else to blame other than myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares at me without answering and I lunge at him. “You horrible monster!” I pound on his chest. “I hate you I hate you I hate you!” It feels so good to scream. To feel as though I could tear apart the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes my wrists in his hands and pushes me away. He sees the blood along my arms, across my chest. His eyes flare wide, his breath a gasp. He throws me to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you hurt?” he demands. He pulls at my shirt, his fingers searching the skin along my stomach and sides. I writhe against him but he straddles me, keeping me on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury boils over inside me and I scream. He grabs my face, holding my head steady. His fingers dig into my cheeks, forcing my gaze on him. “Gabry, where are you hurt?” I’m surprised to feel the way he trembles and I realize that he’s scared, that he’s panting with fear. I feel the fight drain out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not,” I whisper. But I want to tell him that I hurt everywhere, that I hurt so deeply I don’t know how to fix it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sits back on his heels, still straddling me, looking down at me. I take advantage of his hesitation and gather all my strength and buck my hips up, throwing him to the side. I roll and grab the knife. I pounce on him, holding the blade against his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re disgusting.” I have a hard time finding the words I want to say. “What did you do to Catcher?” I shake him and his eyes bulge a little as the blade nicks the corner of his jaw. “What did you do?” I shout into his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur breathing is like a storm, my heart the thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” a voice behind me says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything stops. My throat hitches. I don’t want to turn around. I don’t want it to be a trick or a joke. I don’t want confirmation that the hope charging through me is a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare down at Elias. He smiles, just barely—a painful sort of smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow and turn slowly. Catcher stands there, half in the shadow of the arch, hesitating before he runs toward me. The air compresses in its familiar way before our bodies collide and he grabs at me and I grab at him, not understanding what’s going on—how he’s still alive and for the moment not caring. He’s here in my arms now and that’s all that matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin is almost unbearably hot against my own but he feels strong and his heartbeat reverberates through me. He’s nothing like the weak, dying person I left a few days ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push away from him and stand back, glancing between him and Elias, who still lies prone on the ground. It’s hard to find the right words. “What’s going on?” I ask. “I don’t understand. You’re supposed to be …” I can’t say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dead.” Catcher says it for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mudo,” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles. “Same thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help but let my eyes trail down his neck to the spot on his shoulder where the bite mark is. It’s still an angry red welt, scabs stretching over where each of Mellie’s teeth punctured the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s been almost a week since you were bitten,” I say, shaking my head. None of this makes sense; he’s supposed to be dead. The Infected aren’t supposed to last that long. A bare sort of singing feeling starts to weave through me: hope. Catcher’s still here. He’s still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was there, I saw it. You told me.” My voice rises, all the pain and fear and regret that built up in me ever since that night breaking free. “You told me you were infected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He still is,” Elias says from the ground. I look over at him. He’s sitting, one arm draped around a knee. Remnants of three scratches trail down his face from the first night I met him in the ocean and a bruise blossoms around his eye from the other time I attacked him on the beach. Now he presses a hand to his side where I just hit him and a small red cut from my knife edges along his jaw. There are traces of blood on his white tunic from where he held me, where Daniel’s blood seeped from me to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clench and unclench my hands, frustrated at not understanding. “People don’t last this long infected,” I say. “It’s been too much time. I don’t understand.” They glance at each other and then Elias slowly stands. He picks up the knife I’d dropped by his head and holds it out to me, handle first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s immune,” Elias says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him, everything around us still and somber except for my heartbeat, which can’t contain itself. And then I stare at Catcher, waiting for him to explain. Because there’s no such thing as immunity. They’d have told us growing up if there were. “That doesn’t exist,” I finally say. “No one is immune. They’ve always made sure we understood that: No one is immune.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back and forth between Elias and Catcher. It’s what they tell us from when we’re old enough to listen. It’s what we’ve always known: There’s no cure, there’s no immunity, there’s no escape. Once you’re bitten, you’re infected and dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said it yourself. It’s been six days, Gabrielle,” Catcher says. “There’s no other explanation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m looking at Elias. I’m trying to decide if I trust him. If I can trust a Souler. He seems to understand what’s going on here, to know more than he’s saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to believe him. I want to think that Catcher will be okay. That I haven’t failed him. That something in this world can be good. Even though it goes against everything I’ve known and believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have so many questions but only one thing matters to me now. I stare at Catcher, barely able to breathe. “You’re okay?” I ask him. “You’re … you’re better now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as he clenches his hands by his sides. As the muscle along his jaw tightens and jumps. “I’m still infected,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does that mean?” I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElias answers before Catcher can. “It means the Mudo don’t sense it when he’s around them. It means they don’t attack him. It means the infection won’t kill him—he won’t turn—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatcher cuts him off. “It means we can go home.” He walks over to me and takes my hand, presses it against his chest. His skin is so hot I can feel the heat of him through his clothes. “Go back to the way things were,” he adds. “Pretend none of this ever happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElias crosses his arms over his chest, his lips pursed tight. But I don’t care about him anymore. All I can feel is my heart singing. He’s okay. Catcher’s going to live! Just moments before, I thought he was already dead, already Mudo. I thought I’d never have the chance to talk to him again, to hold him and have him understand me. And suddenly all that fear is washing away and hope is budding inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can go back to Vista, Gabry. We can go back to the way it was before. You and me and Cira …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean my forehead against his shoulder so that he can’t see my expression. The air in my throat chokes me but whether it’s sobs or hysterical laughter I don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reality of our situation strikes deep. He still thinks things can go back to how they were. That his infection is the only thing that’s happened in the past week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now I’ve killed someone. Even if I wanted to, I can’t ever go back to Vista. The Militia will find out it was me. They’ll execute me for killing one of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s impossible for me to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t believe how out of control everything’s suddenly become. My deepest wish—that Catcher would be okay—has come true but at the expense of everything else. If I’d only known. If I’d even dreamed it was a possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t they tell us about immunity?” I ask, my voice on the edge of a wail. It’s not fair, none of this is fair. My mind scrambles, trying to figure out a way to make it work, to get back to my old life but everything leads back to the reality of Daniel’s death and Cira’s punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter now,” Catcher says, his hand wrapping around mine. “I’m okay, that’s what matters. I can’t wait to tell Cira.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m already shaking my head and backing away. “You can’t,” I tell him. He steps closer but I hold up my hands, waving him away. “We can’t go back,” I say, almost choking on the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElias says nothing, just tilts his head as he watches me, his expression unreadable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll find a way to make it work,” Catcher says, but I’m shaking my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t work,” I tell him. I twist my fingers, running the pad of my thumb along the cut on my hand, feeling the pain radiate up my arm, grounding me. “I lied about Cira,” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the heat wavering on the concrete, at the clouds building in the sky above, anywhere but at Catcher. “They came after us that night, the Militia. I got away but the others didn’t. The Council voted to send them all to the Recruiters.” My voice is limp as I finish, afraid of what he’ll say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatcher’s head falls back. I watch as he clenches and unclenches his jaw. “You didn’t tell me,” he says, his voice even. “I asked about her and you said she was okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” My words carry hardly any sound at all. I’m overwhelmed by how everything’s shifted and changed underneath me again. “I’m sorry,” I add uselessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns away from me, pushes his hands into his hair and yanks. “Where is she now?” he asks. His frustration and anger cut through me, slicing at my happiness that he’s still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have her in the Council House.” I swallow. I want to explain, to tell him that I thought he was dying. That I didn’t want to add to his pain. But I don’t. “The Recruiters arrived today. They’d started the swearing-in ceremony when I came here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bangs a fist against the stone arch and I jump at the sudden violence. I want to go to him, to pull away his pain and anger. But I don’t. I’m afraid he’ll push me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe places both hands on the wall and breathes deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at Elias. Embarrassed that he’s watching this, that he knows what I’ve done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to go get Cira,” Catcher says, his voice muffled. He turns to face us. “I’m not letting them take her. I told her I’d protect her and I will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?” I ask. “They’re not going to give her up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he looks at me his eyes are cold and hard. “I don’t care,” he says. “I’ll find a way.” He stalks into the amphitheater, down toward the stage, and I start after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Catcher, wait!” I call out. Without even turning around he throws up a hand, waving me off. I stand there watching him go, Elias behind me. I’m afraid to face him, mortified at being dismissed by Catcher in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when I thought I was putting all the pieces back together they’ve cracked and fallen into different patterns, this time with sharper edges. I don’t know how to make it work, how to make it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA familiar feeling of uselessness tingles inside me. “I’ve messed it all up again,” I say. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-tossed-waves-the-forest-of-hands-and-teeth-2/page-22.html","bookId":2586,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:37 PM"}
