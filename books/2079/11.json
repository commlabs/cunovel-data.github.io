{"id":88712,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe U-Haul whirred across smooth resonant pavement and Rashel tried to guess where they were. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad been drawing a map in her mind, trying to imagine each turn they made, each change of the road\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderneath them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan sat slouched, blocking the back doors of the truck. His eyes were small and mean, and they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflickered over the girls constantly. In his right hand he held a taser, a hand-held electrical stun gun, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel knew he was dying to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the cargo was being very docile. Daphne was beside Rashel, leaning against her very slightly for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomfort, her dark blue eyes fixed vacantly on the far wall. They were shackled together: although both\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily and Ivan had been checking Daphne constantly for signs of waking up, they were dearly taking no\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the opposite side of the truck were the two other girls. One was Juanita, her wavy bronze hair\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etangled from two days of lying on it, her bee-stung lips parted, her gaze empty. The second girl was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etowhead, with flyaway hair and Bambi eyes staring blankly. Ivan called her Missy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about twelve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel allowed herself to daydream about things to do to Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she focused. The van was stopping. Ivan jumped up, and a minute later he was opening the back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoors. Then he and Lily were unshackling the girls and herding them out, telling them to hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel breathed deeply, grateful for the fresh open air. Salty air. Keeping her gaze aimless and glassy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe looked around. It was twilight and they were on a Charlestown dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep moving,\" Ivan said, a hand on her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, Rashel saw a sleek thirty-foot power cruiser bobbing gently in a slip. A figure with dark hair was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon the deck, doing something with lines. Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barely glanced up as Ivan and Lily hustled the girls onto the boat, and he didn\u0027t help steady Missy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen she almost lost her balance jumping from the dock. His mood had changed again, Rashel realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed withdrawn, turned inward, brooding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move!\" Ivan shoved her, and for an instant, Quinn\u0027s attention shifted. He stared at Ivan with eyes like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblack death, endless and fathomless. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t say a word. Ivan\u0027s hand dropped from Rashers back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily led them down a short flight of steps to a cramped but neat little cabin and gestured them to an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL-shaped couch behind a dinette table. \"Here. Sit down. You two here. You two there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel slipped into her seat and stared vacantly across at the sink in the tiny galley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all stay here,\" Lily said. \"Don\u0027t move. Stay.\" She would have made a great\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eslave overseer, Rashel thought. Or dog trainer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lily had disappeared up the stairs and the door above had banged shut, Rashel and Daphne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esimultaneously let out their breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You doing okay?\" Rashel whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. A little shaky. Where d\u0027you think we\u0027re going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel just shook her head. Nobody knew where the vampire enclaves were. An idea was beginning to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eform in her mind, though. There must be a reason they were traveling by boat-it would have been safer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand easier to keep the prisoners in the U-Haul. Unless they were going to a place you couldn\u0027t get to by\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eU-Haul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn island. Why shouldn\u0027t some of the enclaves be on islands? There were hundreds of them off the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeastern coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a very unsettling thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn an island they would be completely isolated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNowhere to escape to if things got bad. No possible hope of help from outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel was beginning to regret that she\u0027d brought Daphne into this. And she had the ominous feeling that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen they got to their destination, she was going to regret it even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat sliced cleanly through the water, heading into darkness. Behind Quinn was the skyline of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoston, the city lights showing where the ocean ended and the land began. But ahead there was no\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehorizon, no difference between sky and sea. There was only formless, endless void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inky blackness was dotted with an occasional solitary winking light-herring boats. They only seemed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto make the vastness of empty water more lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn ignored Lily and Ivan. He was not in a good mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let the cold air soak into him, permeating his body, mixing with the cold he felt inside. He imagined\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehimself freezing solid-a rather pleasant thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust get to the enclave, he thought emptily. Get it over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis last batch of girls had upset him. He didn\u0027t know why, and he didn\u0027t want to think about it. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere vermin. All of them. Even the dark-haired one who was so lovely that it was almost too bad she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas certifiably insane. The little blond one was crazy, too. The one who, having had the luck to fall out of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe frying pan once, had come right back, coated herself with butter and breadcrumbs, and jumped in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdiot. Someone like that deserved...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn\u0027s thought broke off. Somewhere deep inside him was a little voice saying that no one, however\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eidiotic, deserved what was going to happen to those girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re the idiot. Just get them to the enclave and then you can forget all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enclave... it was Hunter Redfern who had first thought of enclaves on islands. Because of Dove,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need a place where the Redferns can live safely, without looking over their shoulders for humans\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith stakes. An island would do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn hadn\u0027t objected to the classification of himself as a Redfern-although he had no intention of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emarrying Garnet or Lily. Instead he said, practically, \"Fishermen visit those islands all the time. Humans\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eare settling them. We\u0027d have company soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are spells to guard places humans shouldn\u0027t go. I know a witch who\u0027ll do it, to protect lily and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarnet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter had grinned. \"Because she\u0027s their mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Quinn had said nothing. Later he\u0027d met Maeve Harman, the witch who had mingled her blood with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe lamia. She didn\u0027t seem to like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter much, and she kept their youngest daughter, Roseclear, who was being raised as a witch, away\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom him. But she did the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they\u0027d all moved to the island, where Garnet finally gave up on Quinn and married a boy from a nice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elamia family. Her children were allowed to carry on the Redfern name. And as time went on, other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenclaves had sprung up....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut none quite like the one Quinn was heading for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted on his seat in the cockpit. Ahead, there was a horizon again. A luminous silver moon was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erising above the pond-still dark water. It shone like an enchantment, as if to guide Quinn\u0027s way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrrrunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel winced as the boat docked. Somebody wasn\u0027t being careful. But they\u0027d arrived, and it could only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe an island. They\u0027d been heading east for over two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne lifted her head weakly. \"I don\u0027t care if they eat us the minute we get off, as long as I get to feel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esolid ground again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This practically is solid ground,\" Rashel whispered. \"It\u0027s been dead calm the whole way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell that to my stomach.\" Daphne moaned, and Rashel poked her. Someone was coming down the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lily. Ivan waited above with the taser. They herded the girls off the boat and up onto a little dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel did her vacant-eyed staring around again, blessing the moonlight that allowed her to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t much of a dock. One wharf with a gas pump and a shack. There were three other powerboats\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all. Rashel couldn\u0027t see any sign of life. The boats rode like ghost ships on the water. There\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas silence except for the slap of the waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrivate island, Rashel thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about the place made the hair on the back of her neck rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Lily in front and Ivan in back, the group was herded to a hiking trail that wound up a cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s just an island, Rashel told herself. You should be dancing with joy. This is the enclave you wanted to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eget to. There\u0027s nothing... uncanny... about this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as they reached the top of the cliff, she saw the rocks. Big rocks. Monoliths that reminded her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeerily of Stonehenge. It looked as if a giant had scattered them around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were houses built among them, perched on the lonely cliff, looking down on the vast dark sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all seemed deserted, and somehow they reminded Rashel of gargoyles, hunched and waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily was headed for the very last house on the sandy unpaved road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of those huge \"summer cottages\" that was really a mansion. A massive white frame house,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwo and a half stories high, with elaborate ornamentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock coursed through Rashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frame house. Wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis place wasn\u0027t built by vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lamia built out of brick or fieldstone, not out of the wood that was lethal to them. They must have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebought this island from humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel was tingling from head to toe. This is definitely not a normal enclave. Where are all the people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere\u0027s the town? What are we doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move, move.\" Lily marched them around the back of the house and inside. And at last, Rashel heard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe sounds of other life. Voices from somewhere inside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t get to see who the voices belonged to. Lily was taking them into a big old-fashioned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekitchen, past a pantry with empty shelves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the pantry was a heavy wooden door, and on a stool by the door was a boy about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel\u0027s age. He had bushy brown hair and was wearing cowboy boots. He was reading a comic book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Rudi,\" Lily said crisply. \"How\u0027re our guests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet as little lambs.\" Rudi\u0027s voice was laconic, but he stood up respectfully as Lily went by. His eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflickered over Rashel and the other girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWerewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel\u0027s instincts were screaming it. And the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ename... werewolves often had names like Lovell or Felan that meant wolf in their native language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRudi meant \"famous wolf\" in Hungarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest guards in the world, Rashel thought grimly. Going to be hard to get past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRudi was opening the door. With Lily prodding her from behind, Rashel walked down a narrow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eextremely steep staircase. At the base of the stairway was another heavy door. Rudi unlocked it and led\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel stepped into the cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she saw was something she\u0027d never seen before. A large low-ceilinged room. Dimly lit. With two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erows of twelve iron beds along opposite walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a girl in each bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeenage girls. All ages, all sizes, but every one beautiful in her own unique way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like a hospital ward or a prison. As Rashel walked between the rows, she had to fight to keep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher face blank. These girls were chained to the beds, and awake... and scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrightened eyes looked at Rashel from every cot, then darted toward the werewolf. Rudi grinned at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem, waving and nodding to either side. The girls shrank away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a few seemed brave enough to say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long do we have to stay here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go home!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last two beds in each row were empty. Rashel was put into one. Daphne looked both sick and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrightened as the shackles dosed over her ankles, but she went on gamely staring straight ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep tight, girlies,\" Rudi said. \"Tomorrow\u0027s a big day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he and Lily and Ivan walked out. The heavy wooden door slammed behind them, echoing in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe stone-walled cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel sat up in one motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne twisted her head. \"Is it safe to talk?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so,\" Rashel said in a normal voice. She was staring with narrowed eyes down the rows of beds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the girls were looking at them, some were crying. Some had their eyes shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne burst out with the force of a breaking dam, \"What are they going to do to us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Rashel said. Her voice was hard and flat, her movements disciplined and precise, as she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eslid the knife out of her boot. \"But I\u0027m going to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, you\u0027re gonna saw through the chains?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" From a guard on the side of the sheath, Rashel pulled a thin strip of metal. She bared her teeth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eslightly in a smile. \"I\u0027m going to pick the lock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Okay. Great. But then what? I mean, what\u0027s happening here? What kind of place is this? I was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpecting some kind of-of Roman slave auction or something, with, like, everybody dressed in togas and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampires waving and bidding-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may still see something like that,\" Rashel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid. \"I agree, it\u0027s weird. This is not a normal enclave. I don\u0027t know, maybe it\u0027s some kind of holding\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecenter, and they\u0027re going to take us someplace else to sell us....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I\u0027m afraid not,\" a quiet voice to her left said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel turned. The girl in the bed beside her was sitting up. She had flaming red hair, wistful eyes, and a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ediffident manner. \"I\u0027m Fayth,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shelly,\" Rashel said briefly. She didn\u0027t trust anyone here yet. \"That\u0027s Daphne. What do you mean,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027re afraid not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not taking us somewhere else to sell us.\" Fayth looked almost apologetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027d like to know what they\u0027re going to do with us here,\" Rashel said. She sprung one lock on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshackles and jabbed the lockpick into the other. \"Twenty-four girls on an island with one inhabited\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehouse? It\u0027s insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a bloodfeast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel\u0027s hand on the lockpick went still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked over at Fayth and said very softly, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re having a bloodfeast. On the spring equinox, I think. Starting tomorrow night at midnight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne was reaching across the gap for Rashel. \"What, what? What\u0027s a bloodfeast? Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s...\" Rashel dragged her attention from Fayth. \"It\u0027s a feast for vampires. A big celebration, a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebanquet. Three courses, you know.\" She looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound the room. \"Three girls. And there are twenty-four of us....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough for eight vampires,\" Fayth said quietly, looking apologetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re saying that they take a little blood from each of three girls.\" Daphne was leaning anxiously\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoward Rashel. \"That\u0027s what you\u0027re saying, right? Right? A little sip here, a little sip there-\" She broke off\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas Rashel and Fayth both looked at her. \"You\u0027re not saying that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daphne, I\u0027m sorry I got you into this.\" Rashel took a breath and opened the second lock on her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshackles, avoiding Daphne\u0027s eyes. \"The idea of a bloodfeast is that you drink the blood of three people in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone day. All their blood. You drain them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne opened her mouth, shut it, then at last said pathetically, \"And you don\u0027t burst?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel smiled bleakly in spite of herself. \"It\u0027s supposed to be the ultimate high or something. You get the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epower of their blood, the power of their lifeforce, all at once.\" She looked at Fayth. \"But it\u0027s been illegal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFayth nodded. \"So\u0027s slavery. I think somebody wants it to make a comeback.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any idea who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I know is that somebody very rich has invited seven of the most powerful made vampires here for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe feast. Whoever he is, he really wants to show them a good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To make an alliance,\" Rashel said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The made vampires ganging up against the lamia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the spring equinox... they\u0027re celebrating the anniversary of the first made vampire. The day Maya\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebit Thierry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just wait a minute,\" Daphne said. \"Just everybody press pause, okay? How come you know about all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis stuff?\" She was staring at Fayth. \"Made vampires, this vampires, that vampires, Maya... I never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheard of any of these people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maya was the first of the lamia,\" Rashel said rapidly, glancing back at her. \"She\u0027s the ancestress of all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe vampires who can grow up and have children-the family vampires. The made vampires are different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re humans who get made into vampires by being bitten. They can\u0027t grow any older or have kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Thierry was the first human to get made into a vampire,\" Fayth said. \"Maya bit him on the spring\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eequinox... thousands of years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel was watching Fayth closely. \"So now maybe you\u0027ll answer her question,\" she said. \"How do you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow all this? No humans know about Night World history-except vampire hunters and damned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaybreakers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFayth winced, and then Rashel understood why she seemed so apologetic. \"I\u0027m a damned Daybreaker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a Daybreaker?\" Daphne prompted, poking Rashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Circle Daybreak is a group of witches who\u0027re trying to get humans and Night People to... I don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow, all dance around and drink Coke together,\" Rashel said, nonplussed. She was confused and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erevolted-this girl had seemed so normal, so sensible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To live in harmony, actually,\" Fayth said to Daphne. \"To stop hating and killing each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne wrinkled her nose. \"You\u0027re a witch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m human. But I have friends who\u0027re witches. I have friends who\u0027re vampires. I know lamia and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehumans who\u0027re soulmates-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be disgusting!\" Rashel almost shouted it. It took her a moment to get hold of herself. Then,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreathing carefully, she said, \"Look, just watch it, Daybreaker. I need your information, so I\u0027m willing to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ework with you-temporarily. But watch the language or I\u0027ll leave you here when I get the rest of us out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen you can live in harmony with eight vampires on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her effort at control, her voice was shaking. Somehow Fayth\u0027s words seemed to keep echoing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein her mind, as if they had some strange arid terrible importance. The word soulmates itself seemed to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ericochet around inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Fayth was acting oddly, too. Instead of getting mad, she just looked at Rashel long and steadily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she said softly, \"I see...\" Rashel didn\u0027t like the way she said it. She turned toward Daphne, who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas saying eagerly, \"So we\u0027re going to get out of here? Like a prison break?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. And we\u0027ll have to do it fast.\" Rashel narrowed her eyes, trying to think. \"I assumed we\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave more time... and there\u0027s that werewolf to get past. And then once we do get out, we\u0027re on an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eisland. That\u0027s bad. We can\u0027t live long out in the wild-it\u0027s too cold and they\u0027d track us. But there has to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea way....\" She glanced at Fayth. \"I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any chance of other Daybreakers showing up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFayth shook her head. \"They don\u0027t know I\u0027m here. We\u0027d heard that something was going on in a Boston\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclub, that somebody was gathering girls for a bloodfeast. I came to check it out-and got nabbed before I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade my first report.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027re on our own. That\u0027s all right.\" Rashel\u0027s mind was in gear now, humming with ideas. \"Okay, first,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe\u0027ll have to see what these girls can do-which of them can help us-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFayth and Daphne were listening intently, when Rashel was interrupted by the last thing she expected to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehear in a place like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of somebody shouting her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rashel!
