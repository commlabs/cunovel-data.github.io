There is a motor connected to a big drum up in the top of the hangar, and the door is counterbalanced so that turning the drum winds up the cable that pulls it up. I suppose the motor reverses to run it down and——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What was that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sandy’s voice was tense and strained.\n\u003cbr\u003e 14\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They heard the strange, hollow sound again, seeming to come from the metal wall, but impossible to locate at once because of the echo.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rap—tap—tap!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Somebody’s knocking,” Dick gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not somebody—something!” corrected Sandy. “The same ‘something’ that worked the door and shut it!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Gracious-to-gravy!” exclaimed Larry, “you don’t believe in ghosts, do you, Sandy? Not really!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No human hand touched the switch that ran that door down!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I think it did!” challenged Larry. “We thought we saw somebody at the back of the hangar—that’s why we came in! I’m going to see where he is, what he’s doing and why he’s trying to fright—frighten us!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He broke his sentence in the middle of a word because the queer knocking repeated itself, but with quick presence of mind he completed his phrase to steady Sandy, whose face was growing drawn with dismay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Larry took a swift, sharp look around the enclosure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There’s a big, closed can for waste and oily rags,” he commented, “but anyone would suffocate who hid in that!”\n\u003cbr\u003e 15\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, there’s a clothes cupboard—in the back corner,” Dick said. “Let’s look in that, you and I. Sandy, you stay back and keep watch.” Dick, quick to see Larry’s attitude toward Sandy, wanted to have a dependable chum at his side as he investigated while he hoped to give Sandy more confidence by leaving him in the lighted part of the building, under the smudged, dusty skylight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Come on!” agreed Larry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With Dick he walked boldly enough to the built-in wooden cupboard, protected from dust by a heavy burlap hanging.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Throwing the curtain aside sharply, both youths peered in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nothing but old overalls and some tools on the floor,” Dick commented.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s peculiar,” Larry said doubtfully. “Nobody here—but—” a new idea struck him. Quietly he gestured toward the amphibian, old, uncared for, looking almost ready to fall apart, its doped wings stained with mould, its pontoons looking as if the fabric was rotting on them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dick, instantly catching Larry’s notion, went to the forward seat, while Larry took the second compartment behind the big fuel tank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nobody here,” he reported, and investigated, by climbing in the vacant part of the fuselage toward the tail.\n\u003cbr\u003e 16\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This place is empty, too,” Dick agreed. “Where could?——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh!”—Sandy almost screamed the word as the dull, hollow knocks came again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Larry leaped from the wing-step, sent his sharp gaze rapidly around the enclosure and, of a sudden, gripped Dick’s arm so tightly that the plump youth winced and grew chilly with apprehension.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At once he saw Larry’s amazed, relieved expression and followed the older comrade’s eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With an instant return of his old amused self he threw back his head and let out a deep howl of delight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh—ho-ho-ho-ha-ha! Oh, my!—ho-ho——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What’s the matter with you?” demanded Sandy. “Have you gone silly?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh—ho-ho! Suspicious Sandy!—ho-ho!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Larry explained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You got us all worked up and worried,” he told Sandy, “with your suspicions. And all the time——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ho-ho-ha-ha! All the t-time, we were like mice racing around a treadmill.” Dick had to speak between chuckles. “All the time we ran around in circles so fast we didn’t see the end of the cage. Sus—suspicious Sandy! Thinking we would be trapped and held for ransom! Ho, golly-me! Look around you, Sandy!”\n\u003cbr\u003e 17\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sandy looked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His face slowly changed, gradually became red.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh!” His voice was sheepish. “You mean the switch for the motor over by that small metal door they use when they don’t want to run up the big one?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That runs the motor,” Larry agreed. “The cable must have slipped on the drum and let the door go down——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But,” Sandy clung obstinately to his theories, “why did Jeff pick this haunted place and cut the ignition—and why was the door up in the first place?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What do we—ho-ho—care?” Dick chuckled. “Another thing—even if the electric current is off and the motor doesn’t work—look at that small, hinged door—do you see that the knob of the spring lock—is on—our—side!” He broke out in a fresh cackle of laughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But—those raps——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For reply Larry strode over to the metal door set in the wall for use when anyone chose to enter or leave the hangar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Throwing it open, he faced Jeff.\n\u003cbr\u003e 18\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Took you long enough to answer!” grumbled Jeff. “What made you fool with that door and shut yourselves in?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What made you cut the ignition!” snapped Sandy, working on the idea he had read in so many detective stories that a surprise attack often caused a person to be so startled as to reveal facts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Larry and Dick turned their eyes to Jeff.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The older pilot, staring at his accuser for an instant, as though hesitating about some sharp response, suddenly began to chuckle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That-there is one on me!” he admitted. “You must have mighty quick eyes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t miss much!” Sandy said meaningly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “None of us do!” Dick caught the spirit of Sandy’s accusing manner. “I know you’ve been here before, too. There are lots of chunks of old chewing gum stuck around in that front compartment of the amphibian—and someone has been working on it, too. I saw the signs.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Chewing gum?” Jeff was startled. Swiftly he strode across the dimly sunlit floor, got onto the forward step, peered into the cockpit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That-there certainly is queer,” he commented. “You’re right. Gum is stuck every place, wads of it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 19\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And you chew gum!” snapped Sandy, unwilling to be left out of the suddenly developing “third degree” he had begun. Jeff made a further inspection, touched a bit of the dried gum curiously, stepped down and stood with a thoughtful face for a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently he walked to an old soap box holding metal odds and ends, washers, bolts and so on. This he up-ended. He sat down, his lean jaws working as he chewed his own gum slowly. Around him, like three detectives watching the effect of a surprise accusation, stood the chums.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently Jeff looked up at them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Looks bad, this-here, don’t it?” He grinned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dick, Larry and Sandy were silent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I guess I better explain,” Jeff decided. “I didn’t think you was so suspicious and quick or I’d of done different.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You can’t trap us!” challenged Sandy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Trap you?——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, didn’t you make friends with us and let us work on your crate and help get passengers that you never took up? Didn’t you say you’d give us a joy-ride, then come straight here, cut out your ignition and make believe you had a dead stick, land and then try to get us into this haunted hangar?” Sandy ran out of breath and stopped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I do think you ought to explain!” Larry said quietly.\n\u003cbr\u003e 20\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, I did all that—and I guess I will explain. I meant to, anyhow—or I wouldn’t have brought you here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They waited, neither convinced nor satisfied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fixing accusing eyes on Sandy, Jeff spoke:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I never dreamed you’d be suspicious of me! I made friends with you all and tried you out to be sure you were dependable and honest and all that—and I did bring you to this place because it is so far from telephones and railroads. But I didn’t think you’d get the wrong idea. I only wanted you in a place it would take time to get away from if you refused to help me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Help you—help you with what?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Speaking seriously, Jeff replied to Larry’s challenge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Help me save the most valuable set of emeralds in the world from being—destroyed!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2096/59523.html","bookId":523,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:24:10 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:24:10 AM"}
