For the second time that night the realization worried him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Nathan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat scared the hell out of him. He reacted to her whispered pledge as though he\u0027d just been slashed with a whip. His accommodating body went from warm flesh to cold steel in the space of a heartbeat. She let go of him. He rolled over onto his side away from her. She suddenly found herself staring at his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for him to acknowledge her words of love. Long minutes passed before she accepted the fact that he wasn\u0027t going to say anything. His snoring helped her come to that conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt like crying. She didn\u0027t, though, and found a small victory in that new strength. Then she concentrated on finding something else to be pleased about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least he hadn\u0027t left the cabin after they\u0027d made love, she thought to herself. She supposed she should be thankful for that. But in truth, she wasn\u0027t overly thankful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was shivering. Sara rolled away from Nathan\u0027s heat and reached for the quilts. When she was finally settled under the blankets she and Nathan were back to back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt lonely, vulnerable. And it was all his fault, she thought to herself. He was the one who was making her feel so miserable. She decided then and there that if it wasn\u0027t her sole duty to love him with all her heart, she just might hate him. Lord, he was coldhearted. Stubborn, too. He had to know how much she needed to hear his words of love and yet he refused to give them to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did love her, didn\u0027t he? Sara thought about that worry a long while. Then Nathan rolled over and took her into his arms again. He grumbled in his sleep as he roughly pulled her up against his chest. Her hair was caught under his shoulder. His chin rubbed the top of her head in what she thought was an affectionate gesture, and she suddenly didn\u0027t mind that he\u0027d forgotten to tell her he loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes and tried to go to sleep. Nathan did love her, she told herself. His mind was just having a little difficulty accepting what his heart already knew… had always known, she corrected herself, from the moment they were wed to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn time her husband would realize. Why, it was only because he had such a cranky disposition that it was taking him longer to accept than it would most ordinary husbands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do love you, Nathan,\" she whispered against his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was gruff from sleep yet tender when he said, \"I know, baby. I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was snoring again before she could gather enough nerve to ask him if he\u0027d been pleased by her fervent declaration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still couldn\u0027t go to sleep. She spent another hour trying to think of a way to make Nathan realize his good fortune in having her for his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way to Nathan\u0027s heart certainly wasn\u0027t through his stomach, she decided. He wasn\u0027t about to eat anything she prepared for him. The man was distrustful by nature, and her soup had soured him on her cooking skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally settled on a sound plan. She\u0027d sneak up on her husband by way of his staff. If she could prove her value to the crew, wouldn\u0027t Nathan begin to see how wonderful she really was? It shouldn\u0027t be difficult to convince the men how goodhearted and sincere their mistress was. Yes, they were a superstitious lot to be sure, but men were only men, after all, and gentle words and kind actions would surely woo their loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, if she really put her mind to the problem she could certainly find a true method to win the men\u0027s loyalty in less than a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all wearing cloves of garlic around their necks by the end of the week in an attempt to ward off Lady Sara\u0027s mischief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d spent the entire seven days trying to gain their confidence. When she found out why they were wearing the smelly necklaces she was so disgusted with her staff that she quit trying to win them over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also quit running back to her cabin whenever they glared at her. She just pretended she hadn\u0027t noticed. She wasn\u0027t about to let any of them know how upsetting their conduct was to her. She kept her composure and her tears firmly in check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Nathan and Nora knew how she really felt. Sara kept both of them informed about her injured feelings. Nathan did his best to ignore the situation. Nora did her best to soothe her niece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem, of course, was that each minor accident, no matter what the cause, was blamed solely on Sara\u0027s very presence. They thought the woman was cursed, and that was that. The minute Chester noticed a fresh wart on his hand he blamed Sara. His hand had brushed against hers, he remembered, when they passed on deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she reason against such idiocy? Sara put that question to Nathan at least twice a day. His answers never made a lick of sense, though. He either grunted with what she interpreted as true irritation or shrugged with what she knew was total indifference to her plight. He was as sympathetic as a goat, and each time he finished giving her his oblique opinion she kissed him just to be contrary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the following Monday Sara didn\u0027t think her life could get any bleaker. But then, she hadn\u0027t counted on the pirates. They attacked the ship on Tuesday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt started out to be a nice, sunny, peaceful day. Matthew was taking Nora for a stroll along the decks. Nora\u0027s arm was linked through Matthew\u0027s, and the two of them took turns whispering to each other and laughing like children. The elderly couple had become extremely close over the past weeks. Sara thought Matthew was just as smitten as Nora appeared to be. He had taken to smiling quite a lot, and Nora seemed to be blushing just as often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Sara set out on her stroll Jimbo walked beside her. She was never allowed to be alone. She believed it was because her staff had turned so belligerent on her. When she made that comment to Jimbo, though, he shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That might be a little part of it,\" he said, \"but the full truth is that the captain doesn\u0027t want anything else broken, Sara. That\u0027s why you\u0027ve got yourself a guard trailing you day and night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, the shame of it all,\" Sara cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimbo had difficulty holding back his grin. Sara was certainly given to drama. He didn\u0027t want her to think he was laughing at her, though. \"Now, now, it isn\u0027t that terrible,\" he remarked. \"You needn\u0027t sound so forlorn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara was quick to rally. Her face heated up, and she let him see her irritation. \"So that\u0027s how it\u0027s to be, is it?\" she asked. \"A few little mishaps and I\u0027m now condemned by my staff as a witch and condemned by my own husband as a defiler of property? Jimbo, must I remind you that nothing out of the ordinary has happened since the fire, and that was over seven days ago. Surely the men will come to their senses in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing out of the ordinary?\" Jimbo repeated. \"You cannot be serious, Sara. Have you forgotten Dutton\u0027s little mishap, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have to bring up that unfortunate incident. Sara gave him a disgruntled look. \"He didn\u0027t drown, Jimbo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimbo rolled his eyes heavenward. \"No, he didn\u0027t drown,\" he agreed. \"But it was mighty close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I did apologize to the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, you did,\" Jimbo said. \"But what about Kently and Taylor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which ones are they?\" Sara asked, deliberately feigning ignorance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ones you knocked stupid two days ago when they slipped on the cannon grease you spilled,\" he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot place the blame for that solely on my shoulders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t?\" he asked. He was eager to hear the excuse she would give to explain away those injuries. \"You did spill the grease, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she admitted. \"But I was on my way to fetch a rag to mop up the mess when those men rushed past me. If they hadn\u0027t been in such a hurry to get away from me, they would have stopped, of course, and I could have warned them about the slippery deck. So you see, Jimbo, the blame really belongs on their superstitious shoulders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shouted warning of a ship in the distance stopped their conversation. Within a blink of the eye the deck was filled with men running to their posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara didn\u0027t understand what all the commotion was about. Nathan bellowed her name before Jimbo could give her a proper explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan, I didn\u0027t do it,\" she cried out when she saw him striding toward her. \"Whatever has happened, I swear to you that I had nothing to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat vehement speech gave Nathan pause. He actually smiled at her before grabbing hold of her hand and dragging her toward their cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re not responsible,\" he told her, \"though the men will probably blame you all the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it they\u0027re going to blame me for this time?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re about to have some unwanted guests, Sara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unwanted?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached their cabin. Nathan pulled her inside but left the door open. It was obvious he wasn\u0027t planning on staying long. \"Pirates,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color immediately left her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare faint on me,\" he ordered, though he was already reaching out to catch her in the event she decided not to obey him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed his hands away. \"I\u0027m not going to swoon,\" she announced. \"I\u0027m furious, Nathan, not frightened. Damn if I\u0027ll let my staff think I\u0027ve brought on pirates, too. Make them go away, Nathan. I\u0027m not up to another upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in for quite a battle, Nathan knew, but he wasn\u0027t going to share that information with his wife. In truth, he was worried, for he knew he should have used the faster clipper for their journey. They would never be able to outrun the bastards closing in on them. The Seahawk was too bulky and too weighted down to accomplish that feat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me your promise that you\u0027ll be careful,\" Sara demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored that command. \"Matthew took Nora below,\" he said. \"Stay here until he comes for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter giving her that order he turned and strode out the doorway. Sara ran after him. He was forced to stop when she threw her arms around his waist. It was either that or drag her up the steps with him. Nathan turned around then, peeling her hands away as he moved. \"For God\u0027s sake, woman, now isn\u0027t the time to demand a good-bye kiss,\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to tell him, no, that certainly wasn\u0027t the reason she\u0027d stopped him, but he waylaid her intent by giving her a quick kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he pulled away she smiled at him. \"Nathan, now isn\u0027t the time to be… romantic,\" she said. \"You have a fight on your hands. Do see to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did you stop me?\" he demanded to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted you to promise me you\u0027d be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re deliberately trying to make me crazy, aren\u0027t you, Sara? It\u0027s all a plot to make me lose my mind, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer that ridiculous question. \"Promise me, Nathan. I won\u0027t let go of your shirt until you do. I love you, and I\u0027ll worry unless you give me your word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" he countered. \"I\u0027ll be careful. Happy now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and hurried back into her cabin to prepare herself for the coming battle. She rushed over to the desk drawers, intending to find as many weapons as possible. If the pirates were actually successful in breaching the ship, Sara was determined to help her husband any way that she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found two loaded pistols in the bottom drawer and one wickedly sharp dagger in the center slot. Sara tucked the knife into the sleeve of her gown and put the pistols in a blue reticule. She wrapped the strings of the purse around her wrist just as Matthew came charging into the cabin. A loud booming sound echoed in the distance. \"Was that one of our cannons or one of theirs?\" Sara asked, her voice shivering with her worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew shook his head. \"It was one of theirs,\" he answered. \"They missed their mark. They aren\u0027t close enough to do any damage yet. That\u0027s the reason we aren\u0027t firing our own cannons, Sara. Come with me now. I\u0027ve got Nora safely tucked away below the water level. You can wait it out there with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara didn\u0027t argue, knowing full well that Nathan was behind the order, but she felt very cowardly. It didn\u0027t seem honorable to her to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was pitch black in the hull. Matthew went down the rickety steps first. He lifted her over the first rung, explaining that the wood was filled with rot and would be replaced just as soon as he had time for the chore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the bottom and turned a sharp corner the soft glow of a single candle led the way to where Nora patiently waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara\u0027s aunt was settled on top of a wooden box. Her bright red shawl was draped around her shoulders. The older woman didn\u0027t look at all afraid. \"We\u0027re about to have an adventure,\" she called out to her niece. \"Matthew, dear, do be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew nodded. \"It would be an adventure all right, if we didn\u0027t have such precious cargo on board,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What precious cargo?\" Sara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe he\u0027s referring to you and me, dear,\" Nora explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Matthew agreed. He started back up the squeaky steps. \"Now we\u0027ve got to defend instead of offend,\" he added. \"It\u0027s going to be a first for the crew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara didn\u0027t know what he was talking about. It was apparent that Nora did understand, though. Her smile said as much. \"What do you suppose Matthew meant by that remark, Aunt?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora briefly considered telling Sara, then just as quickly discarded the notion. She decided that her niece was too innocent to understand. Sara still saw everything as good or evil. In her idealistic mind there weren\u0027t any shades of gray. In time she would come to understand that life wasn\u0027t that simple. Then she would be able to accept the fact that Nathan had led a rather colorful life. Nora hoped she would be there when Sara was told she was married to Pagan. She smiled just thinking about her niece\u0027s reaction to that news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe the crew would fight more vigorously if they didn\u0027t have to keep us safe,\" Nora said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t make any sense,\" Sara argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora agreed but changed the topic instead of saying so. \"Is this where the munitions are kept?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe it is,\" Sara answered. \"Do you suppose those kegs are filled with powder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must be,\" Nora said. \"We must watch the candle flame. If a fire started down here—well, I needn\u0027t tell you what could happen. Don\u0027t let me forget to blow out the flame when Matthew comes to fetch us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship suddenly felt as though it had just let out a giant belch. It shook from aft to stem. \"Do you think they hit us with that shot?\" Sara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It certainly felt as though they did,\" Nora answered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-22.html","bookId":1790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM"}
