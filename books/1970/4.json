That’s what it’s called?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure it’s not called The Slam-er?” She laughs cleverly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. “Ha-ha. You’re so funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe enters the location into the GPS and frowns at the long line of cars in front of us. “It says it’s like five miles into town… It’s going to take forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrow on the road as the traffic crawls forward. “No, it won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” Lila stabs a finger at me, reeling in her seat. “You promised Blake you wouldn’t race his car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI down shift and the engine purrs to life. “I’m not going to race it. I’m just going to shoot the gaps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe secures her seatbelt over her shoulder. “I don’t even want to know what that means, but I swear to God, if we end up driving into the median, I’ll never talk to you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“O ye of little faith.” I rev up the RPMs and swerve over to the next lane, cutting off a red Camry. The driver honks the horn and Lila grips the edge of the leather seat. “You know I’ve seen you drive this crazy before, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glares at me. “And I’m okay when I’m the driver and know I have control of the situation.” I flinch at her words and she adds, “It gives me a sense of safety.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loathe hearing the word “control.” It reminds me of how much my mind craves it. It’s sort of like an addiction, like alcohol or cigarettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit the brakes as the front of the car verges on the back end of a lifted truck. There’s a tiny gap over to the next lane and I debate if it’s doable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you dare,” Lila warns with fear in her blue eyes. “It’s too narrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy in the side lane slows down and I redline the RPMs, crank the wheel at the last second, and squeeze us over easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila huffs out a breath as she slumps back in the seat. “If I didn’t love you so much, I’d totally hate you.” She fusses with her blonde hair and wipes some smeared eyeliner out from underneath her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continue dodging in and out of traffic until we reach the exit. Driving like this makes me feel alive and by the time we reach the club Micha is playing at, adrenaline is coursing through my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This place looks sketchy.” Lila crinkles her nose at the warehouse nestled between Larry’s Biker Bar and The Adult Video Store. It’s late, and the stars and moon light up the dry leaves and cigarette butts on the asphalt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said that about Star Grove too.” I kick open the door and step outside. “And you survived that place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes as she climbs out of the car. “Star Grove doesn’t look nearly as bad as this place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe head across the parking lot, walking close to each other when a group of guys smoking behind a truck make catcalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I still can’t believe Blake let me borrow his car.” I jump over a pothole. “If I owned a Mustang, I sure as hell wouldn’t lend it out to someone I barely knew, especially after I told him I like to race.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you it’s because he likes you.” She elbows me as we turn down the alley that leads to the front entrance of the club. “I have an eye for these things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has a girlfriend, Lila. And it seemed like they really love each other.” I sidestep a Dumpster and emerge onto the busy sidewalk. Cars drive up and down the road and bright graffiti decorates the metal exterior of the neighboring buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePausing in front of the entrance, I pull my hair out of the ponytail and it falls to my shoulders. Letting go of Lila’s arm, I quickly tie the lace of my boot, then unfasten two of the top buttons on my plaid shirt and smooth out the wrinkles on my denim skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow, I’ve never seen you this fussy before,” Lila comments as she refastens the ribbon lacing up the front of her maroon shirt. “It’s very entertaining.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why, but I suddenly feel really nervous,” I admit, tousling my hair with my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s because you love him.” Lila bats her eyelashes and I shove her gently. “Relax. It’s because you haven’t seen him for, like, a month. Honestly, I’m a little afraid to be in the same room as you two. You’ll probably have your clothes off and on the floor in a matter of seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling my eyes, I enter the club where a bouncer with snake tattoos on his muscular arms and a scar on his lip blocks the path to the table area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“IDs please.” His tone suggests we don’t have them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila and I take our fake IDs out of our pockets and hand them to him. He evaluates them carefully and gives them back to us, stepping aside to let us through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk into an open room filled with tables and chairs. The air is musty, the bar is crammed with people, and the music is loud, but the sound of the singer’s voice is more familiar than the beat of my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aw, look at him up there all hot and sexy,” Lila says, but I barely hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of my concentration focuses on the stage near the far back wall. Beneath the low lighting, Micha sings one of his own songs, playing the guitar with his head tipped down and his hair hanging in his sparkling aqua eyes. My hands ache to touch him, tangle through his hair, feel the softness of his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe band plays in the background and it takes my breath away as his lyrics flow over my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence in your eyes is more than I can take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at me for once and see how my heart aches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou keep me alive. You keep me breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I want, all I need is you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room blends away and it’s just him and me. I hear Lila move away from me, probably heading to the bar to order a drink. It takes Micha only seconds to find me in the middle of the crowded room, like our hearts sense each other. He tries to maintain a straight face as he spills out the lyrics, but a trace of a smile reveals at his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finishes out the last set with a final chord, and then quickly turns to Naomi, who’s wearing a tight black dress and knee-high boots. Micha says something to her as he hands her the guitar. She nods, tucking her black hair behind her ear, and he hops off stage, and his long legs stride for me as he shoves through the crowd. He doesn’t slow down until he scoops me up in his arms, not caring that there are a ton of people watching us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fasten my legs around his waist and he kisses me intensely, stealing every ounce of oxygen from my lungs. Our bodies and tongues conform together, and the heat of him sears my skin. His lip ring scores into my bottom lip, but I want more. Begging him closer, I breathe him in, tasting him, wanting to feel him as much as possible before we part again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he leans back, a fire flares deep inside his aqua eyes and my stomach somersaults with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, I’ve missed you, pretty girl.” He kisses me again and his hands wander all over my body. Reluctantly, he pulls away, breathless. “Don’t take this the wrong way, but what are you doing here? Is something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, nothing’s wrong. Lila said I needed to come see you before you left.” I trace my fingers along the back of his neck and he shivers from my touch. “She said that she was sick of my bad attitude and that I needed to get you out of my system, at least for a day or so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bites at his lip, stifling a smile. “You know you could never get me out of your system. It’s not possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but I can try,” I tease. “In fact, I could try a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA naughty look dances in his eyes. “I like the sound of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves in for another kiss, deliberately this time, but with equally as much passion as all our kisses. “I have two more songs to play and then you and I can leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink dazedly. “Where are we going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lets out a breathy laugh as he presses up against me. “First things first. We’re going to go back to the hotel and take care of some much needed business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try not to smile, but it’s impossible. “And then what are we going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we’ll go out and do something fun,” he promises, setting me back on the floor. He kisses my forehead, and then moves back through the crowd to the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find Lila at the bar and plop down in a barstool next to her. My gaze locks on Micha on stage as he starts to play a cover of his sad-turned-happy song—our song, as he tells me all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh thank God.” Lila stirs the red fruity drink in her hand. “You’re happy again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing my lips together, I suffocate my giddiness, but eventually it surfaces. It’s terrifying, feeling this way. I didn’t realize how down I was until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicha\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the first time I’ve ever been excited to be done performing. I can’t wait to get out of the club and take her back to the room. The entire time I’m singing, my eyes are fixed on her. Deep down, I’m singing only to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finish, the band clears the stage. I hold up a finger at Ella, letting her know I’ll be a second, and then go into the room where our instruments are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone got a nice surprise,” Naomi comments as she pulls her long, black hair up into a bun and glances at herself in the cracked mirror on the wall. “Looks like you won’t be going out with the band tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we’ll come out with you.” I put my guitar into the case and clip the locks. “But I’m going back to the hotel room first and you guys might want to steer clear of it for a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes and Dylan, our drummer, lifts up his hand to give me a high-five. Dylan likes to call himself “The Ladies Man” and spends a lot of time bragging about his hookups while we’re on the road. It’s annoying as shit and I dismiss his high-five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take my guitar with you and I’ll text you later.” I hand Naomi the case and walk backward for the door. “Oh yeah, and would you mind if Ella’s friend hung out with you guys for a while?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forever-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-2/page-4.html","bookId":1970,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:39 AM"}
