Jade washed with the slivers of rose-scented soap and water from the basin. She only then realized how sore she was. She was thoroughly irritated with him and with herself by the time she returned to her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine looked like he was settled in for the night. The pillows were now propped up behind his head. He looked extremely comfortable. She tightened the belt on her robe and frowned at him. \"Caine, you really have to understand something,\" she began in a firm voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that, sweet?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated it when he smiled at her so innocently. It made her heart start pounding and her mind empty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof every thought. She had to stare at the floor in order to continue. \"This can\u0027t happen again. Not ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt won\u0027t do you any good to argue with me, Caine. My mind\u0027s set. Now it\u0027s time for you to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer to her fervent order, Caine lifted the covers and motioned her over with the crook of his finger. \"Come to bed, Jade. You need your rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a loud groan. \"Are you going to be difficult?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please be serious,\" she demanded when he winked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am being serious,\" he countered. \"But realistic, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Realistic?\" She moved closer to the side of the bed, nibbling on her lower lip while she thought about the best ploy to get him moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mistake was in getting too close, she realized a little too late. Caine easily captured her. She suddenly found herself flat on her back next to him. His warm, heavy thigh locked her legs in place and one of his hands held her high around her waist. Jade realized that even in the forceful action, he\u0027d been careful not to touch her injury. He was such an incredibly gentle man. Arrogant, too. She was good and trapped, and he had the audacity to smile over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now then,\" he said. \"I\u0027m realistic because I know this has only just begun,\" he explained. \"Jade, quit pinching me. You can\u0027t honestly believe I won\u0027t ever touch you again, can you? Married couples .. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare mention marriage to me again,\" she interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he agreed. \"Since it seems to be so upsetting to you, I\u0027ll wait awhile before bringing up that topic. Still, you agree that you\u0027ll be staying here for approximately two weeks, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was back to being logical. Jade actually found that flaw quite comforting now. \"Yes, though it surely won\u0027t be two weeks now. I\u0027ve already been here more than half a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" he returned. \"Now then, do you think in all the time we have left that I\u0027m going to live like a monk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t possible,\" he countered. \"I\u0027m already hurting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" he muttered. \"Damn it, Jade, I want you again. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Caine, you have to behave yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice sounded hoarse to her, but it was all his doing, she told herself. He was deliberately provocative. He stared down into her eyes as he slowly untied the belt to her robe. Then his fingers grazed the tips of her breasts. While he continued to hold her gaze, he slowly stroked a path down her belly. His fingers moved lower into the soft curls at the junction of her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed the valley between her br**sts while his fingers slowly stoked the fire in her. Jade closed her eyes and instinctively moved against his hand. His tongue made her ni**les hard and when he eased his fingers inside her, she let out a groan of half pleasure, half pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved upward to kiss her mouth, demanding her response. His tongue wet her lips. When he\u0027d gained her cooperation, he leaned back. \"You\u0027re already getting hot for me, aren\u0027t you, love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine,\" She whispered his name as she tried to pull his hand away. He wouldn\u0027t be deterred. She could barely think. \"You must stop this torment. You have to fight this attraction. Oh God, don\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to fight it,\" he returned. He nijjbled on her earlobe. \"I like the attraction, Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was incorrigible. She let out a ragged sigh, then let him kiss her senseless again. She barely protested at all when he took her robe off and settled himself between her thighs. The hair on his legs tickled her toes and she was suddenly quite overwhelmed by all the wonderful differences in their bodies. He was so hard, so firm all over. Her toes rubbed against the backs of his legs and her ni**les strained for more of his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine? Will you promise me something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything,\" he answered, his voice ragged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can have this time together, but when Nathan returns, then it has to be over. We . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t make promises I won\u0027t keep,\" he interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded angry. \"You\u0027ll change your mind,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound damn certain. Why? What is it you\u0027re hiding from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027ll get bored with me,\" she rushed out. She wrapped her arms around him. \"Kiss me, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a frantic edge to her voice. Caine responded in kind. The kiss was like wildfire, and soon completely out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis full attention was centered on pleasing her. He took his time building the tension by slowly driving\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher mad. He kissed each and every goose bump on her breasts, suckled both ni**les until she was whimpering for release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he slowly moved down her body. His tongue teased her flat stomach, and when he moved lower still, her moans became gasps of raw pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth deliberately scraped against the soft curls. His tongue stroked the silky petals until they were sleek with moisture. And all the while his fingers caressed her with erotic deliberation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t get enough of her. His tongue repeatedly stabbed against her as his fingers slid in and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands tore at the sheets. The pleasure he forced on her stunned her. She had no idea a man made love in such a way. It was obvious Caine knew what he was doing. He made her wild with her need for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she felt the first rush of ecstasy, when she instinctively tightened in pleasure and agony around him, he moved up and over her. She couldn\u0027t stop the splendor from consuming her. Caine drove inside her, hard, hot, full, just as she found her own release. She squeezed him tight and clung to him in joyful surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to hold back, yet found himself powerless to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made him desperate for his own release. His seed poured into her in a blazing orgasm that made\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim forget to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil this night, he\u0027d never given himself so completely. A part of him had always held back. He\u0027d always been able to maintain his own rigid control. Yet he hadn\u0027t been able to withhold anything from this special woman. Odd, but he didn\u0027t look at his acceptance as surrender. In truth, it was a victory of sorts, for in his heart he knew she hadn\u0027t been able to hold back either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt cleansed in body and soul. This incredible gift they\u0027d just shared filled him with contentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took all his strength to roll to his side. He was pleased when she followed him and snuggled up against him. He wrapped his arms around her and held her tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can still taste you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God.\" She sounded mortified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"I like the taste of you. You\u0027re all honey and female, love. It\u0027s a sexy combination. A man could become addicted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he growled. \"But I\u0027m the only one who\u0027s ever going to taste you. Isn\u0027t that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pinched her bottom to gain his answer. \"Yes, Caine,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I hurt you again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe feigned a sigh. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t have stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tucked her face under his chin. Long minutes elapsed before she spoke again. \"I shall never, ever forget you, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he hadn\u0027t heard her. His deep, even breathing indicated he\u0027d already fallen asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she should wake him and demand that he go back to his own room. Sterns was bound to be disappointed when he found them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tightened his hold on her when she tried to roll away from him. Even in sleep, the man was as possessive as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade didn\u0027t have the heart to wake him. She closed her eyes and let her thoughts scatter like the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell asleep minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dreamed of angels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dreamed of sharks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning the physician, Sir Harwick, arrived to have a look at Jade. He was an elderly man with dark gray hair and blue eyes that sparkled like the ocean on a calm day. He was impeccable in both his dress and manners. Jade thought he looked like a wily raccoon, for the hair on the sides of his face had been coached into sweeping curves that ended just a scant inch or so away from the edges of his severely pointed nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she\u0027d predicted to Caine, Sir Harwick did poke and prod at her. Caine stood at the foot of the bed, his hands clasped behind his back, acting like a sentinel guarding his treasure. When the physician finished his examination, he decreed that rest was the best ticket for her condition. Since Jade didn\u0027t believe she was in any special condition, she ignored all his suggestions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine looked as if he were memorizing every dictate. He was determined to make an invalid out of her, she decided. When Harwick suggested a cold compress for the fading bump on the side of her temple, Caine immediately went to fetch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was thankful she had the physician all to herself. \"I understand you were called upon to examine Caine\u0027s father,\" she began. \"I was sorry to hear he wasn\u0027t feeling well. Is he better now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe physician shook his head. \"There\u0027s little anyone can do for him,\" he announced. \"It\u0027s a pity. He\u0027s given up on life since Colin was taken from him. Why, Colin was his favorite son, you understand, and the loss has broken him.\" \"Why do you say that Colin was his favorite?\" she asked. \"He\u0027s the firstborn from the second wife,\" Harwick explained. \"Caine\u0027s mother died when he was just a youngster. The boy couldn\u0027t have been more than five or six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was apparent that Sir Harwick enjoyed a good gossip session. He pulled up a chair next to the side of the bed, took his time settling in, and then said in an enthusiastic whisper, \"The first marriage was forced, you see, and from what I understand, it was a most unhappy union. Henry certainly tried to make a go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine\u0027s father,\" Harwick instructed. \"Henry hadn\u0027t become the Duke of Williamshire yet as his own father was still living. For that reason, he had more time to devote to his marriage. It didn\u0027t wash, though. Caine\u0027s mother was a shrew. She made life a living hell for both her husband and her son. Why, she tried to turn him against his own father, if you can believe such blasphemy. When she died, no one mourned her long.\" \"Did you ever meet this woman?\" \"I did,\" he answered. \"She was attractive, but her beauty hid a black heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And is the Duke\u0027s second marriage happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my, yes,\" Harwick answered. He made a sweeping gesture with his hand. \"Gweneth\u0027s a fine woman. She set the ton on its ear, she did, when she first started attending their functions with her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, the elite follow her lead almost as fervently as they follow Brummel\u0027s dress and manners. I must say that Gweneth has been a good wife and mother. The children are all very close to each other鈥攖he proof, you see, that she did her job well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you include Caine, Sir Harwick, when you speak of the children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" Harwick replied. \"The others look up to Caine, for he is the eldest, but he tends to separate himself from the family. Unless someone tries to harm one of his brothers or sisters, of course. Then Caine involves himself.\" He paused to lean forward in his chair, then whispered in a conspiratorial\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evoice, \"Some say with a vengeance.\" He wobbled his eyebrows to emphasize that remark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do they say with a vengeance?\" she asked. Her voice sounded worried to her but Harwick didn\u0027t seem to notice. Jade didn\u0027t want him to quit the conversation just yet. She schooled her expression to show only mild interest and even managed a smile. \"You\u0027ve made me most curious, sir,\" she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarwick looked pleased by her interest. \"My dear, Caine\u0027s made it well known he\u0027s hunting Pagan. Why, he had his men post the reward notice all over town. The gamblers have given odds. Ten to one favor Caine, of course. He\u0027ll get the pirate,\" he predicted. \"And when he does, God have mercy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, God have mercy,\" she agreed. \"But Caine\u0027s father is ill, you mentioned?\" she asked again, trying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto pull him back to their initial topic. \"Just how ill is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gravely so,\" Harwick announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there nothing that can be done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarwick shook his head. \"Gweneth\u0027s nearly out of her mind worrying about Henry. The man doesn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeat or sleep. He can\u0027t go on this way. No, I fear he\u0027ll be the next one to die if he doesn\u0027t come to terms with Colin\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps he needs a little assistance,\" Jade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who needs assistance?\" Caine asked from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your papa,\" Jade called out. She turned back to Sir Harwick then. \"What is this I heard about a friend\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof yours disappearing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, poor Sir Winters,\" Harwick answered. \"A fine physician he was, too,\" he added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he gave her such an expectant look, Jade said, \"You speak as though he\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m certain he is,\" Sir Harwick stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine stood on the other side of Jade\u0027s bed, trying without much success to force the cold compress on her injury. Jade was far more interested in hearing the physician\u0027s opinions than bothering about her puny bump. She kept waving the cloth away. Caine kept pushing it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarwick observed the silent struggle a long minute, trying all the while not to smile. These two were certainly a pair, all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s next question pulled him back to their topic. \"Why do you think Winters is dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has to be,\" Harwick countered. \"His cook was the last to see him alive,\" he explained. \"Winters was strolling through his back gardens. He turned the corner and simply vanished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long ago was this?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Near to three months now,\" the physician answered. \"Of course we all know what happened to him.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-19.html","bookId":1791,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM"}
