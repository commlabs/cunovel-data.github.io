The towpath was made for horses, not wheels, and it was uneven, muddy, and mined with loose boulders and tree roots. Harris was sweating and cursing by the time they reached the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lock-keeper was sitting outside his little house, smoking a pipe and enjoying the mild afternoon air. He was a middle-aged man of slow speech and slower movements. He regarded the two cyclists with some amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs spoke, because Harris was out of breath. \"We\u0027re police officers,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so?\" said the lock-keeper. \"What\u0027s the excitement?\" He looked as excited as a cat in front of a fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs took the photograph of Die Nadel out of his wallet and gave it to the man. \"Have you ever seen him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lock-keeper put the picture on his lap while he held a fresh match to his pipe. Then he studied the photograph for a while, and handed it back. \"Well?\" Harris said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. He was here about this time yesterday. Came in for a cup of tea. Nice enough chap. What\u0027s he done, shown a light after blackout?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs sat down heavily. \"That clinches it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris thought aloud. \"He moors the boat downstream from here and goes into the restricted area after dark.\" He spoke quietly, so that the lock-keeper would not hear. \"When he comes back, the Home Guard has his boat staked out. He deals with them, sails a bit further to the railway, scuttles his boat and... hops a train?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs said to the lock-keeper: \"The railway line that crosses the canal a few miles downstream-where does it go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs said, \"Oh, shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs got back to the War Office in Whitehall at midnight. Godliman and Billy Parkin were there waiting for him. Bloggs said, \"It\u0027s him, all right,\" and told them the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin was excited, Godliman just looked tense. When Bloggs had finished, Godliman said: \"So now he\u0027s back in London, and we\u0027re looking for, in more ways than one, a needle in a haystack again.\" He was playing with matches, forming a picture with them on his desk. \"Do you know, every time I look at that photograph I get the feeling I\u0027ve actually met the damn fellow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, think, for God\u0027s sake,\" Bloggs said. \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman shook his head in frustration. \"It must have been only once, and somewhere strange. It\u0027s like a face I\u0027ve seen in a lecture audience, or in the background at a cocktail party. A fleeting glimpse, a casual encounter. When I remember it probably won\u0027t do us any good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin said, \"What\u0027s in that area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, which means it\u0027s probably highly important,\" Godliman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. Parkin lit a cigarette with one of Godliman\u0027s matches. Bloggs looked up. \"We could print a million copies of his picture; give one to every policeman, ARP warden, member of the Home Guard, serviceman, railway porter; paste them up on boardings and publish them in the papers...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman shook his head. \"Too risky. What if he\u0027s already talked to Hamburg about whatever he\u0027s seen? If we make a public fuss about the man they\u0027ll know that his information is good.

He picked up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman looked at his watch. \"There\u0027s not much more we can do tonight, but I don\u0027t feel like going home. I shan\u0027t sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin stood up. \"In that case, I\u0027m going to find a kettle and make some tea.\" He went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matches on Godliman\u0027s desk made a picture of a horse and carriage. He took away one of the horse\u0027s legs and lit his pipe with it. \"Have you got a girl, Fred?\" he asked conversationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not since?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman puffed at his pipe. \"There has to be an end to bereavement, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs made no reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman said, \"Look, perhaps I shouldn\u0027t talk to you like a Dutch uncle. But I know how you feel; I\u0027ve been through it myself. The only difference was that I didn\u0027t have anyone to blame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t remarry,\" Bloggs said, not looking at Godliman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, and I don\u0027t want you to make the same mistake. When you reach middle age, living alone can be very depressing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I ever tell you they called her Fearless Bloggs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs finally looked at Godliman. \"Tell me, where in the world will I find another girl like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she have to be a hero?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After Christine...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"England is full of heroes, Fred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment Colonel Terry walked in. \"Don\u0027t get up, gentlemen. This is important, listen carefully. Whoever killed those five Home Guards has learned a vital secret. There\u0027s an invasion coming, you know that. You don\u0027t know when or where. Needless to say, our objective is to keep the Germans in that same state of ignorance. Most of all, about where the invasion will come. We have gone to some extreme lengths to ensure that the enemy be misled in this matter. Now, it seems certain, he will not be if their man gets through. He has, it is definitely established, found out our deception. Unless we stop him from delivering his news, the entire invasion-and therefore, one can safely say, the war-is compromised. I\u0027ve already told you more than I wanted to, but it\u0027s imperative that you understand the urgency and precise consequences of failure to stop the intelligence from getting through.\" He did not tell them that Normandy was the invasion site, nor that the Pas de Calais via Eeast Anglia the diversionary one, though he realised Godliman would surely conclude the latter once he had debriefed Bloggs on his efforts to trail the murderer of the Home Guardsmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs said: \"Excuse me, but why are you so sure their man found out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry went to the door. \"Come in, Rodriguez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall, handsome man with jet-black hair and a long nose entered the room and nodded politely to Godliman and Bloggs. Terry said: \"Senhor Rodriguez is our man at the Portuguese Embassy. Tell them what happened, Rodriguez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stood by the door. \"As you know, we have been watching Senhor Francisco of the embassy staff for some time. Today he went to meet a man in a taxi, and received an envelope. We relieved him of the envelope shortly after the man in the taxi drove off. We were able to get the licence number of the taxi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m having the cabbie traced,\" Terry said. \"All right, Rodriguez, you\u0027d better get back. And thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall Portuguese left the room. Terry handed Godliman a large yellow envelope, addressed to Manuel Francisco. Godliman opened it- it had already been unsealed-and withdrew a second envelope marked with a meaningless series of letters: presumably a code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the inner envelope were several sheets of paper covered with handwriting and a set of ten-by-eight photographs. Godliman examined the letter. \"It looks like a very basic code,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need to read it,\" Terry said impatiently. \"Look at the photographs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman did so. There were about thirty of them, and he looked at each one before speaking. He handed them to Bloggs. \"This is a catastrophe.\" Bloggs glanced through the pictures, then put them down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman said, \"This is only his backup. He\u0027s still got the negatives, and he\u0027s going somewhere with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three men sat still in the little office, like a tableau. The only illumination came from a spotlight on Godliman\u0027s desk. With the cream walls, the blacked-out window, the spare furniture and the worn Civil Service carpet, it was a prosaic backdrop for dramatics. Terry said, \"I\u0027m going to have to tell Churchill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, and the colonel picked it up. \"Yes. Good. Bring him here right away, please, but before you do, ask him where he dropped the passenger. What? Thank you, get here fast.\" He hung up. \"The taxi dropped our man at University College Hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs said, \"Perhaps he was injured in the fight with the Home Guard.\" Terry said, \"Where is the hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About five minuses\u0027 walk from Euston Station,\" Godliman said. \"Trains from Euston go to Holyhead, Liverpool, Glasgow... all places from which you can catch a ferry to Ireland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liverpool to Belfast,\" Bloggs said. \"Then a car to the border across into Eire, and a U-boat on the Atlantic coast. Somewhere. He wouldn\u0027t risk Holyhead-to-Dublin because of the passport control, and there would be no point in going beyond Liverpool to Glasgow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman said, \"Fred, you\u0027d better go to the station and show the picture of Faber around, see if anyone noticed him getting on a train. I\u0027ll phone the station and warn them you\u0027re coming, and at the same time find out which trains have left since about ten thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs picked up his hat and coat. \"I\u0027m on my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman lifted the phone. \"Yes, we\u0027re on our way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were still plenty of people at Euston Station. Although in normal times the station closed around midnight, wartime delays were such that the last train often had not left before the earliest milk train of the morning arrived. The station concourse was a mass of kitbags and sleeping bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs showed the picture to three railway policemen. None of them recognised the face. He tried ten women porters: nothing. He went to every ticket barrier. One of the guards said, \"We look at tickets, not faces.\" He tried half a dozen passengers without result. Finally he went into the ticket office and showed the picture to each of the clerks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very fat, bald clerk with ill-fitting false teeth recognised the face. \"I play a game,\" he told Bloggs. \"I try to spot something about a passenger that tells me why he\u0027s catching a train. Like, he might have a black tie for a funeral, or muddy boots means he\u0027s a farmer going home, or there might be a college scarf, or a white mark on a woman\u0027s finger where she\u0027s took off her wedding ring... know what I mean? Everybody got something. This is a dull job, not that I\u0027m complaining-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you notice about this fellow?\" Bloggs interrupted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. That was it, see-I couldn\u0027t make him out at all. Almost like he was trying to be inconspicuous, know what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you mean.\" Bloggs paused. \"Now, I want you to think very carefully. Where was he going, can you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said the fat clerk. \"Inverness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027s going there,\" said Godliman. \"He\u0027s a professional-he knows we can ask questions at railway stations. I expect he automatically buys a ticket for the wrong destination.\" He looked at his watch. \"He must have caught the 11:45. That train is now pulling into Stafford. I checked with the railway; they checked with the signalmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to stop the train this side of Crewe. I\u0027ve got a plane standing by to fly you two to Stoke-on-Trent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parkin, you\u0027ll board the train where it\u0027s stopped, outside Crewe. You\u0027ll be dressed as a ticket inspector, and you\u0027ll look at every ticket and every face on that train. When you\u0027ve spotted Faber, just stay close to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloggs, you\u0027ll be waiting at the ticket barrier at Crewe, just in case Faber decides to hop off there. But he won\u0027t. You\u0027ll get on the train, and be first off at Liverpool, and waiting at the ticket barrier for Parkin and Faber to come off it. Half the local constabulary will be there to back you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all very well if he doesn\u0027t recognise me,\" Parkin said. \"What if he remembers my face from Highgate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman opened a desk drawer, took out a pistol, and gave it to Parkin. \"If he recognises you, shoot him.\" Parkin pocketed the weapon without comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman said: \"You heard Colonel Terry, but I want to emphasise the importance of all this. If we don\u0027t catch this man, the invasion of Europe will have to be postponed possibly for a year. In that year the balance of war could turn against us. The time may never be this right again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs said: \"Do we get told how long it is to D-Day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman decided they were at least as entitled as he; they were going into the field, after all. \"All I know is that it\u0027s probably a matter of weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin was thinking, \"It\u0027ll be June, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang and Godliman picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment he looked up. \"Your car\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs and Parkin stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman said, \"Wait a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood by the door, looking at the professor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was saying, \"Yes, sir. Certainly. I will. Good-bye, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs could not think of anyone Godliman called Sir. He said: \"Who was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman said, \"Churchill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"what did he have to say?\" Parkin asked, awestruck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman said, \"He wishes you both good luck and Godspeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage was pitch dark. Faber thought of the jokes people made, \"Take your hand off my knee. No, not you, you.\" The British would make jokes out of anything. Their railways were now worse than ever, but nobody complained any more because it was in a good cause. Faber preferred the dark; it was anonymous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been singing, earlier on. Three soldiers in the corridor had started it, and the whole carriage had joined in. They had been through \"Be Like the Kettle and Sing\", \"There\u0027ll Always Be an England\" (followed by \"Glasgow Belongs to Me\" and \"Land of My Fathers\" for ethnic balance), and, appropriately, \"Don\u0027t Get Around Much Any More.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been an air raid warning, and the train slowed to thirty miles an hour. They were all supposed to lie on the floor, but of course there was no room. An anonymous female voice had said, \"Oh, God, I\u0027m frightened,\" and a male voice, equally anonymous except that it was cockney, had said: \"You\u0027re in the safest place, girl they can\u0027t \u0027it a moving target.\" Then everyone laughed and nobody was scared any more. Someone opened a suitcase and passed around a packet of dried-egg sandwiches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the sailors wanted to play cards. \"How can we play cards in the dark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peel the edges. All Harry\u0027s cards are marked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train stopped unaccountably at about 4 A.M. A cultured voice -the dried-egg-sandwich supplier, Faber thought-said, \"My guess is we\u0027re outside Crewe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing the railways, we could be anywhere from Bolton to Bournemouth,\" said the cockney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train jerked and moved off, and everyone cheered. Where, Faber wondered, was the caricature Englishman with his icy reserve and his stiff upper lip? Not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later a voice in the corridor said: \"Tickets, please.\" Faber noted the Yorkshire accent; they were in the north now. He fumbled in his pockets for his ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the corner seat, near the door, so he could see into the corridor. The inspector was shining a flashlight onto the tickets. Faber saw the man\u0027s silhouette in the reflected light. It looked vaguely familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe settled back in his seat to wait. He remembered the nightmare: \"This is an Abwehr ticket\" and smiled in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he frowned. The train stopped unaccountably; shortly afterward a ticket inspection began; the inspector\u0027s face was vaguely familiar... It might be nothing, but Faber stayed alive by worrying about things that might be nothing. He looked into the corridor again, but the man had entered a compartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train stopped briefly-the station was Crewe, according to informed opinion in Faber\u0027s compartment-and moved off again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber got another look at the inspector\u0027s face, and now he remembered. The boarding house in Highgate! The boy from Yorkshire who wanted to get into the Army!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber watched him carefully. His flashlight moved across the face of every passenger. He was not just looking at the tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Faber told himself, don\u0027t jump to conclusions. How could they possibly have got on to him? They could not have found out which train he was on, got hold of one of the few people in the world who knew what he looked like, and got the man on the train dressed as a ticket inspector in so short a time...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin, that was his name. Billy Parkin. Somehow he looked much older now. He was coming closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be a look-alike, perhaps an elder brother. This had to be a coincidence. Parkin entered the compartment next to Faber\u0027s. There was no time left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber assumed the worst, and prepared to deal with it. He got up, left the compartment, and went along the corridor, picking his way over suitcases and kitbags and bodies, to the lavatory. It was vacant. He went in and locked the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was only buying time: even ticket inspectors did not fail to check the toilets. He sat on the seat and wondered how to get out of this. The train had speeded up and was travelling too fast for him to jump off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, someone would see him go, and if they were really searching for him they would stop the train. \"All tickets, please.\" Parkin was getting close again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber had an idea. The coupling between the carriages was a tiny space like an air-lock, enclosed by a bellowslike cover between the cars of the train, shut off at both ends by doors because of the noise and draughts. He left the lavatory, fought his way to the end of the carriage, opened the door, and stepped into the connecting passage. He closed the door Behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was freezing cold, and the noise was terrific. Faber sat on the floor and curled up, pretending to sleep. Only a dead man could sleep here, but people did strange things on trains these days. He tried not to shiver. The door opened behind him. \"Tickets, please.\" He ignored it. He heard the door close. \"Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.\" The voice was unmistakable. Faber pretended to stir, then got to his feet, keeping his back to Parkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he turned the stiletto was in his hand. He pushed Parkin up against the door, held the point of the knife at his throat, and said, \"Be still or I\u0027ll kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his left hand he took Parkin\u0027s flashlight, and shone it into the young man\u0027s face. Parkin did not look as frightened as he ought to be. Faber said, \"Well, well, Billy Parkin, who wanted to join the Army, and ended up on the railways. Still, it\u0027s a uniform.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin said, \"You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know damn well it\u0027s me, little Billy Parkin. You were looking for me. Why?\" He was doing his best to sound vicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why I should be looking for you. I\u0027m not a policeman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber jerked the knife melodramatically. \"Stop lying to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honest, Mr Faber. Let me go-I promise I won\u0027t tell anyone I\u0027ve seen you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber began to have doubts. Either Parkin was telling the truth, or he was overacting as much as Faber himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin\u0027s body shifted, his right arm moving in the darkness. Faber grabbed the wrist in an iron grip. Parkin struggled for an instant, but Faber let the needle point of the stiletto sink a fraction of an inch into Parkin\u0027s throat, and the man was still. Faber found the pocket Parkin had bees reaching for, and pulled out a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ticket inspectors do not go armed,\" he said. \"Who are you with, Parkin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all carry guns now... there\u0027s a lot of crime on trains because of the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParkin was at least lying courageously and creatively. Faber decided that threats were not going to be enough to loosen his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis movement was sudden, swift, and accurate. The blade of the stiletto leaped in his fist. Its point entered a measured half inch into Parkin\u0027s left eye and came out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber\u0027s hand covered Parkin\u0027s mouth. The muffled scream of agony was drowned by the noise of the train. Parkin\u0027s hands went to his ruined eye. \"Save yourself the other eye, Parkin. Who are you with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Military Intelligence, oh God, please don\u0027t do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who? Menzies? Masterman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God... Godliman, Godliman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Godliman?\" Faber knew the name, but this was no time to search his memory for details. \"What have they got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A picture. I picked you out from the files.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What picture? What picture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A racing team, running, with a cup, the Army.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eye-of-the-needle/page-10.html","bookId":2679,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:56 AM"}
