As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew I was too late��and I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clock tolled again, and the sun beat down from the exact center point of the sky. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-1.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
