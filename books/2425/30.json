My heart is full of it. For some reason I am not afraid although there is much death very close. Do you love me a little?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027And we shall have our love.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Giddap,\u0027 said one of the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, on the surface, it was getting lighter, and from below the cliff Bond heard the great twin Diesels stutter and roar. There was a light flutter of breeze to windward, but to leeward, where the ship lay, the bay was a gunmetal mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Big appeared up the shaft, a businessman\u0027s leather brief-case in his hand. He stood for a moment looking round, gaining his breath. He paid no attention to Bond and Solitaire nor to the two guards standing beside them with revolvers in their hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at the sky, and suddenly called out, in a loud clear voice, towards the rim of the sun:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thank you, Sir Henry Morgan. Your treasure will be well spent. Give us a fair wind.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe negro guards showed the whites of their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Undertaker\u0027s Wind it is,\u0027 said Bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Big Man looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All down?\u0027 he asked the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yassuh, Boss,\u0027 answered one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Take them along,\u0027 said The Big Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went to the edge of the cliff and down the steep steps, one guard in front, one behind. Mr. Big followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engines of the long graceful yacht were turning over quietly, the exhaust bubbling glutinously, a thread of blue vapour rising astern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two men on the jetty at the guide ropes. There were only three men on deck besides the Captain and the navigator on the grey streamlined bridge. There was no room for more. All the available deckspace, save for a fishing chair rigged right aft, was covered with fish-tanks. The Red Ensign had been struck and only the Stars and Stripes hung motionless at the stern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few yards clear of the ship the red torpedo-shaped paravane, about six foot long, lay quietly on the water, now aquamarine in the early dawn. It was attached to a thick pile of wire cable, coiled up on the deck aft. To Bond there looked to be a good fifty yards of it. The water was crystal clear and there were no fish about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Undertaker\u0027s Wind was almost dead. Soon the Doctor\u0027s Wind would start to breathe in from the sea. How soon? wondered Bond. Was it an omen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAway beyond the ship he could see the roof of Beau Desert among the trees, but the jetty and the ship and the cliff path were still in deep shadow. Bond wondered if night-glasses would be able to pick them out. And if they could, what Strangways would be thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Big stood on the jetty and supervised the process of binding them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Strip her,\u0027 he said to Solitaire\u0027s guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond flinched. He stole a glance at Mr. Big\u0027s wrist watch. It said ten minutes to six. Bond kept silence. There must not be even a minute\u0027s delay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Throw the clothes on board,\u0027 said Mr. Big. \u0027Tie some strips round his shoulder. I don\u0027t want any blood in the water, yet.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolitaire\u0027s clothes were cut off her with a knife. She stood pale and naked. She hung her head and the heavy black hair fell forward over her face. Bond\u0027s shoulder was roughly bound with strips of her linen skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You bastard,\u0027 said Bond through his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Mr. Big\u0027s direction, their hands were freed. Their bodies were pressed together, face to face, and their arms held round each other\u0027s waists and then bound tightly again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond felt Solitaire\u0027s soft breasts pressed against him. She leant her chin on his right shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I didn\u0027t want it to be like this,\u0027 she whispered tremulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond didn\u0027t answer. He hardly felt her body. He was counting seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the jetty there was a pile of rope to the paravane. It hung down off the jetty and Bond could see it lying along the sand until it rose to meet the belly of the red torpedo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe free end was tied under their armpits and knotted tightly between them in the space between their necks. It was all very carefully done. There was no possible escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond was counting the seconds. He made it five minutes to six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Big had a last look at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Their legs can stay free,\u0027 he said. \u0027They\u0027ll make appetizing bait.\u0027 He stepped off the jetty on to the deck of the yacht.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two guards went aboard. The two men on the jetty unhitched their lines and followed. The screws churned up the still water and with the engines at half speed ahead the Secatur slid swiftly away from the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Big went aft and sat down in the fishing chair. They could see his eyes fixed on them. He said nothing. Made no gesture. He just watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secatur cut through the water towards the reef. Bond could see the cable to the paravane snaking over the side. The paravane started to move softly after the ship. Suddenly it put its nose down, then righted itself and sped away, its rudder pulling out and away from the wake of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coil of rope beside them leapt into life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look out,\u0027 said Bond urgently, holding tighter to the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir arms were pulled almost out of their sockets as they were jerked together off the jetty into the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second they both went under, then they were on the surface, their joined bodies smashing through the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond gasped for breath amongst the waves and spray that dashed past his twisted mouth. He could hear the rasping of Solitaire\u0027s breath next to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Breathe, breathe,\u0027 he shouted through the rushing of the water. \u0027Lock your legs against mine.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him and he felt her knees pressing between his thighs. She had a paroxysm of coughing, then her breath became more even against his ear and the thumping of her heart eased against his breast. At the same time their speed slackened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hold your breath,\u0027 shouted Bond. \u0027I\u0027ve got to have a look. Ready?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pressure of her arms answered him. He felt her chest heave as she filled her lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the weight of his body he swung her round so that his head was now quite out of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were ploughing along at about three knots. He twisted his head above the small bow-wave they were throwing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secatur was entering the passage through the reef, about eighty yards away, he guessed. The paravane was skimming slowly along almost at right angles to her. Another thirty yards and the red torpedo would be crossing the broken water over the reef. A further thirty yards behind, they were riding slowly across the surface of the bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixty yards to go to the reef.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond twisted his body and Solitaire came up, gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill they moved slowly along through the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive yards, ten, fifteen, twenty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly forty yards to go before they hit the coral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secatur would be just through. Bond gathered his breath. It must be past six now. What had happened to the blasted mine? Bond thought a quick fervent prayer. God save us, he said into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he felt the rope tighten under his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Breathe, Solitaire, breathe,\u0027 he shouted as they got under way and the water started to hiss past them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they were flying over the sea towards the crouching reef.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a slight check. Bond guessed that the paravane had fouled a niggerhead or a piece of surface coral. Then their bodies hurtled on again in their deadly embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty yards to go, twenty, ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus Christ, thought Bond. We\u0027re for it. He braced his muscles to take the crashing, searing pain, edged Solitaire further above him to protect her from the worst of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the breath whistled out of his body and a giant fist thumped him into Solitaire so that she rose right out of the sea above him and then fell back. A split second later lightning flashed across the sky and there was the thunder of an explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped dead in the water and Bond felt the weight of the slack rope pulling them under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis legs sank down beneath his stunned body and water rushed into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was this that brought him back to consciousness. His legs pounded under him and brought their mouths to the surface. The girl was a dead weight in his arms. He trod water desperately and looked round him, holding Solitaire\u0027s lolling head on his shoulder above the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing he saw was the swirling waters of the reef not five yards away. Without its protection they would both have been crushed by the shock-wave of the explosion. He felt the tug and eddy of its currents round his legs. He backed desperately towards it, catching gulps of air when he could. His chest was bursting with the strain and he saw the sky through a red film. The rope dragged him down and the girl\u0027s hair filled his mouth and tried to choke him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he felt the sharp scrape of the coral against the back of his legs. He kicked and felt frantically with his feet for a foothold, flaying the skin off with every movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hardly felt the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow his back was being scraped and his arms. He floundered clumsily, his lungs burning in his chest. Then there was a bed of needles under his feet. He put all his weight on it, leaning back against the strong eddies that tried to dislodge him. His feet held and there was rock at his back. He leant back panting, blood streaming up around him in the water, holding the girl\u0027s cold, scarcely breathing body against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a minute he rested, blessedly, his eyes shut and the blood pounding through his limbs, coughing painfully, waiting for his senses to focus again. His first thought was for the blood in the water around him. But he guessed the big fish would not venture into the reef. Anyway there was nothing he could do about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he looked out to sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sign of the Secatur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh up in the still sky there was a mushroom of smoke, beginning to trail, with the Doctor\u0027s Wind, in towards the land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were things strewn all over the water and a few heads bobbing up and down and the whole sea was glinting with the white stomachs of fish stunned or killed by the explosion. There was a strong smell of explosive in the air. On the fringe of the debris, the red paravane lay quietly, hull down, anchored by the cable whose other end must lie somewhere on the bottom. Fountains of bubbles were erupting on the glassy surface of the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the edge of the circle of bobbing heads and dead fish a few triangular fins were cutting fast through the water. More appeared as Bond watched. Once he saw a great snout come out of the water and smash down on something. The fins threw up spray as they flashed among the tidbits. Two black arms suddenly stuck up in the air and then disappeared. There were screams. Two or three pairs of arms started to flail the water towards the reef. One man stopped to bang the water in front of him with the flat of his hand. Then his hands disappeared under the surface. Then he too began to scream and his body jerked to and fro in the water. Barracuda hitting into him, said Bond\u0027s dazed mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one of the heads was getting nearer, making for the bit of reef where Bond stood, the small waves breaking under his armpits, the girl\u0027s black hair hanging down his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a large head and a veil of blood streamed down over the face from a wound in the great bald skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond watched it come on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Big Man was executing a blundering breast-stroke, making enough flurry in the water to attract any fish that wasn\u0027t already occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond wondered whether he would make it. Bond\u0027s eyes narrowed and his breath became calmer as he watched the cruel sea for its decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surging head came nearer. Bond could see the teeth showing in a rictus of agony and frenzied endeavour. Blood half veiled the eyes that Bond knew would be bulging in their sockets. He could almost hear the great diseased heart thumping under the grey-black skin. Would it give out before the bait was taken? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-30.html","bookId":2425,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:48 PM"}
