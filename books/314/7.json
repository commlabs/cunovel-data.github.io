MetaCops has a franchise just down the road that serves as headquarters. As for a jail, some place to habeas the occasional stray corpus, any half-decent franchise strip has one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey are cruising in the Mobile Unit. Y.T.\u0027s hands are cuffed together in front of her. One hand is still half-encased in rubbery goo, smelling so intensely of vinyl fumes that both MetaCops have rolled down their windows. Six feet of loose fibers trail into her lap, across the floor of the Unit, out the door, and drag on the pavement The MetaCops are taking it easy, cruising down the middle lane, not above issuing a speeding ticket here and there as long as they\u0027re in their jurisdiction. Motorists around them drive slowly and sanely, appalled by the thought of having to pull over and listen to half an hour of disclaimers, advisements, and tangled justifications from the likes of these. The occasional CosaNostra delivery boy whips past them in the left lane, orange lights aflame, and they pretend not to notice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it gonna be, the Hoosegow or The Clink?\" the first MetaCop says.

Loiter in the parking lot of a Buy \u0027n\u0027 Fly and you\u0027d get a suntan. Then WorldBeat Security would come and arrest you. All that security-inducing light makes the Visa and MasterCard stickers on the driver\u0027s-side window glow for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Y.T. is card-carrying,\" Y.T. says. \"What does it cost to get off?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you keep calling yourself Whitey?\" the second MetaCop says. Like many people of color, he has misconstrued her name.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Not whitey.
