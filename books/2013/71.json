May it prove dull and uneventful’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thank you, Bugg. How go things here?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re waiting for another shipment of materials. When that arrives, we can finish up. Your master has pulled another of my crews over for that shoring-up project at his estate, but until the trusses arrive that’s not as inconvenient as it might be.’ He glanced at Venitt. ‘Do you have any idea when Hivanar will be finished with all of that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Strictly speaking, it’s not shoring-up-although that is involved.’ He paused, rubbed at his face. ‘More of a scholarly pursuit. Master is extending bulwarks out into the river, then draining and pumping the trenches clear so that the crews can dig down through the silts.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg frowned. ‘Why? Is he planning to build a breakwater or a pier?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. He is recovering… artifacts.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenitt watched the old man look back at the edifice, and saw the watery eyes narrow. ‘I wouldn’t mind seeing those.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Some of your foremen and engineers have done just that… but none were able to work out their function.’ And yes, they are linked to this thing here. In fact, one piece is a perfect replica of this, only on a much smaller scale. ‘When you deliver your message, you can ask to see what he’s found, Bugg. I am sure he would welcome your observations.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps,’ the old man said distractedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well,’ Venitt said. ‘I had best be going.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Errant ignore you, Venitt Sathad.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you, Bugg.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If only…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last statement was little more than a whisper, and Venitt glanced back at Bugg as he crossed the courtyard on his way out. A peculiar thing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, old men were prone to such eccentricities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDismounting, Atri-Preda Bivatt began walking among the wreckage. Vultures and crows clambered about from one bloated body to the next, as if confused by such a bounteous feast. Despite the efforts of the carrion eaters, it was clear to her that the nature of the slaughter was unusual. Huge blades, massive fangs and talons had done the damage to these hapless settlers, soldiers and drovers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd whatever had killed these people had struck before-the unit of cavalry that had pursued Redmask from Drene’s North Gate had suffered an identical fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her wake strode the Edur Overseer, Brohl Handar. ‘There are demons,’ he said, ‘capable of this. Such as those the K’risnan conjured during the war… although they rarely use teeth and claws.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBivatt halted near a dead hearth. She pointed to a sweep of dirt beside it. ‘Do your demons leave tracks such as these?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Edur warrior came to her side. ‘No,’ he said after a moment. ‘This has the appearance of an oversized, flightless bird.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oversized?’ She glanced over at him, then resumed her walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer soldiers were doing much the same, silent as they explored the devastated encampment. Outriders, still mounted, were circling the area, keeping to the ridge lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rodara and myrid herds had been driven away, their tracks clearly visible heading east. The rodara herd had gone first, and the myrid had simply followed. It was] possible, if the Letherii detachment rode hard, that they would catch up to the myrid. Bivatt suspected the raiders would not lag behind to tend to the slower-moving beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, Atri-Preda?’ Brohl Handar asked from behind her. ‘Do we pursue?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not turn round. ‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Factor will be severely displeased by your decision.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that concerns you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not in the least.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing. The Overseer was growing more confident in his appointment. More confident, or less cautious-there had been contempt in the Tiste Edur’s tone. Of course, that he had chosen to accompany this expedition was evidence enough of his burgeoning independence. For all of that, she almost felt sorry for the warrior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If this Redmask is conjuring demons of some sort,’ Brohl Handar continued, ‘then we had best move in strength, accompanied by both Letherii and Edur mages. Accordingly, I concur with your decision.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It pleases me that you grasp the military implications of this, Overseer. Even so, in this instance even the desires of the Factor are of no importance to me. I am first and foremost an officer of the empire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are, and I am the Emperor’s representative in this region. Thus.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-71.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
