As he neared the women\u0027s tent, the obvious answer to their sudden compulsion to have needles and shears suddenly struck him, and he stifled a curse as he quickened his pace. They were undoubtedly destroying the clothing they\u0027d been given, he realized angrily!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna stifled a scream of terrified surprise when the Wolf yanked the tent flap back and ducked inside, but Jenny merely started and then slowly rose to her feet, a suspiciously polite expression on her features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see what you\u0027ve been doing,\" Royce snapped, his gaze slashing from Brenna, whose hand rose protectively to her throat, to Jenny. \"Show me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Jenny said with sham innocence. \"I was only now beginning to work on this shirt,\" she prevaricated as she carefully laid aside his shirt with the armholes she\u0027d just sewn closed. Reaching to the pile of clothing she intended to wear, she held up a pair of thick woolen hose for his inspection and pointed to the neatly mended, two-inch rent down the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompletely baffled, Royce stared at the nearly invisible, tight seam she\u0027d sewn. Proud, haughty, undisciplined, and headstrong she was, he admitted to himself, but she was also a damned expert seamstress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it pass your inspection, milord?\" she prompted with a tinge of amusement. \"May we keep our jobs, sire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she\u0027d been anyone else but his captive and the haughty daughter of his enemy, Royce would have been sorely tempted to lift her in his arms and kiss her soundly for her badly needed help. \"You do excellent work,\" he admitted fairly. He started to leave, then he turned back, his arm holding the tent flap back. \"My men would have been cold, their clothing torn and inadequate for the coming harsh weather. They\u0027ll be happy to know that what they have is at least wearable until the winter clothing arrives here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny had foreseen that he might realize how dangerous she and Brenna could be with a pair of shears, and that he might also arrive to inspect their work, hence she\u0027d had the hose readily available to put him off the track. She had not, however, expected him to pay her an honest compliment, and she felt somehow uneasy and betrayed now that he\u0027d shown he had at least one drop of humanity in his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he left, both girls sank back down upon the rugs. \"Oh dear,\" Brenna said apprehensively, her eyes on the pile of blankets in the corner that they had slashed to ribbons. \"Somehow, I haven\u0027t thought of the men here as—people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny refused to admit she\u0027d been thinking the same way. \"They are our enemy,\" she reminded them both. \"Our enemy, and papa\u0027s enemy, and King James\u0027s enemy.\" Despite that stated belief, Jenny\u0027s hand recoiled from the scissors when she reached out to touch them, but then she made herself pick them up and stoically hacked away at another cloak while she tried to decide the very best plan for their escape tomorrow morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong after Brenna had fallen into an exhausted slumber, Jenny lay awake, considering all the things that could go right—and wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrost lay sparkling on the grass, lit by the first rays of the rising sun, and Jenny arose silently, careful not to awaken poor Brenna any sooner than was necessary. After systematically reviewing all the alternatives, she\u0027d arrived at the best possible plan, and she felt almost optimistic about their chances to make good an escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it time?\" Brenna whispered, her voice choked with fright as she rolled onto her back and saw Jenny already wearing the thick woolen hose, man\u0027s shirt, and jerkin that they\u0027d each be wearing beneath their habits when their guard escorted them into the woods where they were allowed a few minutes\u0027 privacy to tend to their personal needs each morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time,\" Jenny said with an encouraging smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna paled, but she arose and with shaking hands, she began to dress. \"I wish I weren\u0027t such a coward,\" Brenna whispered, her hand clutched over her pounding heart as she reached with her free hand for the leather jerkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a coward,\" Jenny assured her, keeping her voice low, \"you simply worry to great excess—and well in advance—about the possible consequences of anything you do. In fact,\" she added, as she helpfully tied the strings at the throat of Brenna\u0027s borrowed shirt, \"you\u0027re actually braver than I. For if I was as frightened of consequences as you are, I\u0027d never have the courage to dare the slightest thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna\u0027s wavery smile was silent appreciation for the compliment, but she said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have your cap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Brenna nodded, Jenny picked up the black cap she herself would soon put on to hide her long hair, and she lifted up her gray habit, tucking the cap in the waist of her hose. The sun rose a little higher, turning the sky a watery gray as the girls waited for the moment when the giant would appear to escort them to the woods, their loose convent robes hiding the men\u0027s clothes they wore beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment drew near, and Jenny lowered her voice to a hush as she reiterated their plan for the last time, afraid lest Brenna forget what she must do in the fright of the moment. \"Remember,\" she said, \"every second will count, but we must not appear to move too quickly or we\u0027ll draw notice. When you remove your habit, hide it well beneath the brush. Our best hope for escape lies in their looking for two nuns, not two boys. If they spot our habits, they\u0027ll catch us before we can leave the camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna nodded and swallowed, and Jenny went on. \"Once we\u0027re free of our habits, keep your eyes on me and move quietly through the brush. Don\u0027t listen to anything else or look at anything else. When they realize we\u0027re gone, they\u0027ll raise a shout, but it means nothing to us, Brenna. Don\u0027t be frightened of the uproar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" Brenna said, her eyes already huge with fright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll stay in the woods and move around the south border of the camp to the pen where the horses are kept. The searchers won\u0027t expect us to head back toward the camp, they\u0027ll be looking for us in the opposite direction—moving into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we near the pen, you stay just inside the woods, and I\u0027ll bring the horses. With luck, whoever watches the mounts will be more interested in the search for us than he is the horses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna nodded silently and Jenny considered how best to phrase the rest of what she must say. She knew that if they were seen, it would be up to her to try to create a diversion so that Brenna could make good her own escape, but convincing Brenna to go on without her was not going to be easy. In a low, urgent voice, Jenny said finally, \"Now then, in case we become separated—\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-13.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM"}
