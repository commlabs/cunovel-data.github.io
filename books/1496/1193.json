Outdo You....","content":"\u003cp\u003eHe was none other than Song Que!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis aura was weak and faltering, and he was covered with wounds. In many places, bone was visible amidst the blood and gore. Because of a smoking, black handprint that could be seen on his chest, his five yin organs and six yang organs were nearly destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was missing an eye, and clearly… was on his last legs. It was as if he remained standing by sheer willpower alone, as strong and tall as a mountain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, the Vile-Prince had dispatched all of his demigods to assist Prince Prince Ur-Demon and the other celestials in delaying Bai Xiaochun. By that point, the Vile-Prince had already begun to go completely crazy. He had spent several days trying to break down Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, and had reached a critical juncture in which success was just around the corner….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when Song Que barged into Vile-Prince Mansion. Black robes fluttering, and spear in hand, he began to slaughter the devas who stood in his way, slowly making his way toward the grand hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when the most critical of moments arrived, he struck the door with his spear, backing it with all of the cultivation base power he could muster, as well as his unswerving determination. By this point in his life, he cared not for matters of life and death, and therefore held nothing back in his attempt to break open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door shattered, the Vile-Prince began to descend into utter madness. All of his schemes and plots had come down to his very moment, only to have Song Que interrupt him. Furious, he began to vent his rage on Song Que!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSong Que, with his deva cultivation base, did not shrink back! Without any hesitation, he began to fight the Vile-Prince, who was a demigod!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the fighting did not reach the spectacular level of the original fight between Bai Xiaochun and Daoist Heavenspan, it was momentous, to say the least. Blood spattered as the two combatants fought madly, with Song Que drawing upon all of the murderous aura he had built up over the years!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that he wasn’t a match for the Vile-Prince, and yet, he didn’t hesitate at all to fight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, he was fighting for his beloved aunt!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t care much about Zhou Zimo, but simply could not ignore Song Junwan. She was his closest relative! And when he saw her swollen belly, he also knew that he was fighting for his nephew, a nephew whose father could only be Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he had always wanted to outdo Bai Xiaochun, and never really liked him very much, he could not forget everything that Bai Xiaochun had done for him since their original meeting in the Fallen Sword Abyss. Song Que was a proud person, but by this point in his life, he felt no grudge toward Bai Xiaochun. And although he realized that Bai Xiaochun was his superior… he had always believed himself capable of catching up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thus, he came to fight. For his aunt, for his nephew… and for Bai Xiaochun’s flesh and blood!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fought without regrets, filled with the desire to do battle to the very end!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vile-Prince was already shaken. He had never before met a deva who could endure under the fury of his attacks. And yet, over and over again, Song Que held strong, making it impossible for the Vile-Prince to continue his work with the spell formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it seemed beyond the bounds of possibility, Song Que, a mere deva, held out for the time it takes an incense stick to burn. He could see that, despite the fact that Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo seemed incomparably weak as they sat there in the spell formation… they were still alive!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd their children were still safe!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he didn’t hold out for enough time… the consequences would be too horrific to imagine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo last for the time it takes an incense stick to burn required that Song Que sustain mortal injuries, but hold strong…. As the Vile-Prince threw everything he could at him, Song Que ignored the pain and injuries and repeated one thing to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHold strong. Hold strong! \u003cem\u003eHold strong!!!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bai Xiaochun finally shot down from the sky and entered Vile-Prince Mansion, Song Que knew that it had all been worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vile-Prince was in a state of madness, gasping for breath as he unleashed one attack after another. “Why won’t you just die, dammit!? Die!!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see Bai Xiaochun approaching, and his heart pounded with defiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was close! So close!!” Staring venomously at the dying Song Que, the Vile-Prince turned and fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that same moment, Bai Xiaochun\u0027s divine sense enveloped the entire mansion. Ignoring the fleeing Vile-Prince, he rushed into the main hall to confirm that Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo were safe. Then, it was with grief and sorrow that he turned to look at Song Que, who stood there, his life slipping away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSong Que managed to look up at Bai Xiaochun, and then slowly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in the face of imminent death, he stood tall and straight. He still looked manly and handsome, his eyes flickering with regret at having to leave the world of the living. Voice hoarse, he said, “Bai Xiaochun….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When we met in the Fallen Sword Abyss, you snatched the heavenstring energy that was meant for me. You outdid me by just a hair. In the Blood Stream Sect, you did the same thing. Outdid me by a hair….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was the same in the River-Defying Sect… and at the Great Wall. It’s almost like the two of us are cursed by a magic spell. Even in the Wildlands, you still outdid me….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I used to wonder… if you would always outdo me.” He staggered to the side a bit. He could hardly keep his eyes open at this point, and could sense his consciousness fading. As his last bit of energy drained away, he spoke his final words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bai Xiaochun, you always did better than me. You always beat me. But today… I, Song Que, managed to outdo you!” With that, he threw his head back and laughed whole-heartedly. Tears streamed down his face as he slowly closed his eyes…. He couldn’t hold out any longer. The spear in his hand dissolved into ashes, and he toppled forward onto the ground….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSong Que had perished!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor his entire life, he had struggled defiantly… always trying to catch up. But this time, just as he had said, he really did outdo Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t wish to give in to death, but had no choice. However, as his consciousness faded away… he was happy….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun trembled as he looked at Song Que’s corpse, completely aware that without his sacrifice, his own wives and children would be dead. Song Que had offered up his own life for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Song Que….” he murmured, tears beginning to roll down his cheeks. The pain he felt in this moment was the type that could shake heaven and earth. He suddenly found himself recalling old memories of Song Que, back in the Wildlands, at the Great Wall, in the River-Defying Sect, the Blood Stream Sect and finally… their initial meeting in the Fallen Sword Abyss!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re… the true chosen!” He couldn’t stop the tears, but at the same time, knew that time was limited. He had to endure the pain and sorrow, no matter how hard it was. He quickly sent Song Que’s corpse to the damaged fan, then turned and destroyed the spell formation in the grand hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw the faint violet light coming from the totem tattoo on Song Junwan’s arm, he immediately recognized the aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bruiser….” he murmured. Then he looked at the swollen bellies of Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, and reached out to touch them. He could sense the unborn children inside of them, moving. They seemed happy. All of a sudden, he felt powerful bonds of attachment connecting them to him. Considering how tiny and weak they were, Bai Xiaochun knew that protecting them was now the most important mission in his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mothers protected you before,” he murmured, “but from here on out… dad will keep you safe!” Unsure of how to describe the feelings inside of him, he quickly sent the unconscious Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo to the damaged fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that he was the owner of the fan, it was a simple task to send people there as long as they didn’t fight back. After doing so, he looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of making his escape… he decided to seek vengeance!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vile-Prince… was still alive!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1190\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1192\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1191","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
