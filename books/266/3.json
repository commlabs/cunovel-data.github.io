{"id":8045,"no":3,"title":"SECTION I REVEILLE Chapter 1","content":"　　0430 Hours, August 17, 2517 (Military Calendar) / Slipstream space unknowncoordinates nearEridanus Star SystemLieutenant Junior Grade Jacob Keyes awoke. Dull red light filled his blurry vision and he choked on theslime in his lungs and throat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sit up, Lieutenant Keyes,” a disembodied male voice said. “Sit. Take a deep breath and cough, sir. Youneed to clear the bronchial surfactant.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes pushed himself up, peeling his back off the formfitting gel bed. Wisps of fogoverflowed from the cryogenic tube as he clumsily climbed out. He sat on a nearby bench, tried toinhale, and doubled over, coughing until a long string of clear fluid flowed from his open mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sat up and drew his first full breath in two weeks. He tasted his lips and almost gagged. The cryoinhalant was specially designed to be regurgitated and swallowed, replacing nutrients lost in the deepsleep. No matter how they changed the formula, though, it always tasted like lime-flavored mucus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Status, Toran? Are we under attack?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Negative, sir,” the ship’s AI replied. “Status normal. We will enter normal space near the EridanusSystem in forty-five minutes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes coughed again. “Good. Thank you, Toran.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re welcome, Lieutenant.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eridanus was on the border of the Outer Colonies. It was just far enough off the beaten path for piratesto be lurking . . . waiting to capture a diplomatic shuttle like theHan . This ship wouldn’t last long in aspace action. Theyshould have an escort. He didn’t understand why they had been sent alone—butJunior Lieutenants didn’t question orders. Especially when those orders came from FLEETCOM HQ onplanet Reach.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wake-up protocols dictated that he inspect the rest of the crew to make sure no one had run intoproblems reviving. He looked around the sleep chamber: rows of stainless steel lockers and showers, amedical pod for emergency resuscitations, and forty cryogenic tubes—all empty except the one to hisleft.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other person on theHan was the civilian specialist, Dr. Halsey. Keyes had been ordered to protecther at all costs, pilot this ship, and generally stay the hell out of her way. They might as well have askedhim to hold her hand. This wasn’t a military mission; it was baby-sitting. Someone at Fleet Commandmust have him on their blacklist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cover of Dr. Halsey’s tube hummed open. Mist rippled out as she sat up, coughing. Her pale skinmade her look like a ghost in the fog. Matted locks of dark hair clung to her neck. She didn’t look mucholder than him, and she was lovely—not beautiful, but definitely a striking woman. For a civilian,anyway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her blue eyes fixed upon the Lieutenant and she looked him over. “We must be near Eridanus,” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes almost saluted reflectively, but checked the motion. “Yes, Doctor.” His face reddenedand he looked away from her slender body.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had drilled in cryogenic recovery a dozen times at the Academy. He’d seen his fellow officers nakedbefore—men and women. But Dr. Halsey was a civilian. He didn’t know what protocols applied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes got up and went to her. “Can I help you—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She swung her legs out of the tube and climbed out. “I’m fine, Lieutenant. Get cleaned up and dressed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She brushed past him and strode to the showers. “Hurry. We have important work to do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes stood straighter. “Aye, aye, Ma’am.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With that brief encounter, their roles and the rules of conduct crystallized. Civilian or not—like it or not—Lieutenant Keyes understood that Dr. Halsey was in charge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bridge of theHan had an abundance of space for a vessel of its size. That is, it had all themaneuvering room of a walk-in closet. A freshly showered, shaved, and uniformed Lieutenant Keyespulled himself into the room and sealed the pressure door behind him. Every surface of the bridge wascovered with monitors and screens. The wall on his left was a single large semicurved view screen, darkfor the moment because there was nothing in the visible spectrum to see in Slipspace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Behind him was theHan ’s spinning center section, containing the mess, the rec room, and the sleepchambers. There was no gravity on the bridge, however. The diplomatic shuttle had been designed forthe comfort of its passengers, not the crew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It didn’t seem to bother Dr. Halsey. Strapped into the navigator’s couch, she wore a white jumpsuit thatmatched her pale skin, and had tied her dark hair into a simple, elegant knot. Her fingers danced acrossfour keypads, tapping in commands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Welcome, Lieutenant,” she said without looking up. “Please have a seat at the communication stationand monitor the channels when we enter normal space. If there’s so much as a squeak on nonstandardfrequencies, I want to know instantly.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He drifted to the communication station and strapped himself down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Toran?” she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Awaiting your orders, Dr. Halsey,” the ship AI replied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Give me astrogation maps of the system.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Online, Dr. Halsey.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Are there any planets currently aligned with our entry trajectory and Eridanus Two? I want to pick up agravitational boost so we can move in-system ASAP.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Calculating now, Doctor Hal—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And can we have some music? Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto Number Three, I think.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Understood Doctor—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And start a preburn warm-up cycle for the fusion engines.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, Doc—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And stop spinning theHan ’s central carousel section. We may need the power.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Working . . . ”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She eased back. The music started and she sighed. “Thank you, Toran.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re welcome, Dr. Halsey. Entering normal space in five minutes, plus or minus three minutes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes shot the doctor an admiring glance. He was impressed—few people could put ashipboard AI through its paces so rigorously as to cause a detectable pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She turned to face him. “Yes, Lieutenant? You have a question?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He composed himself and pulled his uniform jacket taut. “I was curious about our mission, ma’am. Iassume we are to reconnoiter something in this system, but why send a shuttle, rather than a prowler or acorvette? And why just the two of us?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She blinked and smiled. “A fairly accurate assumption and analysis, Lieutenant. Thisis a reconnaissancemission . . . of sorts. We are here to observe a child. The first of many, I hope.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A child?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A six-year-old male, to be precise.” She waved her hand. “It may help if you think of this purely as aUNSC-funded physiological study.” Every trace of a smile evaporated from her lips. “Which is preciselywhat you are to tell anyone who asks. Is that understood, Lieutenant?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, Doctor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keyes frowned, retrieved his grandfather’s pipe from his pocket, and turned it end over end. He couldn’tsmoke the thing—igniting a combustible on the flight deck was against every major regulation on aUNSC space vehicle—but sometimes he just fiddled with it or chewed on the tip, which helped himthink. He stuck it back into his pocket, and decided to push the issue and find out more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “With all due respect, Dr. Halsey, this sector of space is dangerous.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With a sudden deceleration, they entered normal space. The main view screen flickered and a millionstars snapped into focus. TheHan dove toward a cloud-swirled gas giant dead ahead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Stand by for burn,” Dr. Halsey announced. “On my mark, Toran.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes tightened his harness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Three . . . two . . . one.Mark. ”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The ship rumbled and sped faster toward the gas giant. The pull of the harness increased around theLieutenant’s chest, making breathing difficult. They accelerated for sixty-seven seconds . . . the stormsof the gas giant grew larger on the view screen—then theHan arced up and away from its surface.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eridanus drifted into the center of the screen and filled the bridge with warm orange light.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Gravity boost complete,” Toran chimed. “ETA to Eridanus is forty-two minutes, three seconds.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well done,” Dr. Halsey said. She unlocked her harness and floated free, stretching. “I hate cryo sleep,”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e she said. “It leaves one so cramped.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “As I was saying before, Doctor, this system is dangerous—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She gracefully spun to face him, halting her momentum with a hand on the bulkhead. “Oh yes, I knowhow dangerous this system is. It has a colorful history: rebel insurrection in 2494, beaten down by theUNSC two years later at the cost of four destroyers.” She thought a moment, then added, “I don’tbelieve the Office of Naval Intelligence ever found their base in the asteroid field. And since there havebeen organized raids and scattered pirate activity nearby, one might conclude—as ONI clearly has—thatthe remnants of the original rebel faction are still active. Is that that what you were worried about?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” the Lieutenant replied. He swallowed, his mouth suddenly dry, but he refused to be cowed by thedoctor—by acivilian . “I need hardly remind you that it’s my job to worry about our security.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She knew more than he did, much more, about the Eridanus System—and she obviously had contacts inthe intelligence community. Keyes had never seen an ONI spook—to the best of his knowledge anyway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mainline Navy personnel had elevated such agents to near-mythological status.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whatever else he thought of Dr. Halsey, he would assume from now on that she knew what she wasdoing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey stretched once more and then strapped herself back onto the navigation couch. “Speaking ofpirates,” she said with her back now to him, “weren’t you supposed to be monitoring communicationchannels for illegal signals? Just in case someone takes undue interest in a lone, unescorted, diplomaticshuttle?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes cursed himself for his momentary lapse and snapped to. He scanned all frequenciesand had Toran cross-check their authentication codes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All signals verified,” he reported. “No pirate transmissions detected.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Continue to monitor them, please.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An awkward thirty minutes passed. Dr. Halsey was content to read reports on the navigational screens,and kept her back to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes finally cleared his throat. “May I speak candidly, Doctor?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You don’t need my permission,” she said. “By all means, speak candidly, Lieutenant. You’ve beendoing a fine job so far.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Under normal circumstances, among normal officers, that last remark would have been insubordination—or worse, a rebuke. But he let it pass. Normal military protocols seemed to have been jettisoned onthis flight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You said we were here to observe a child.” He shook his head dubiously. “If this is a cover for realmilitary intelligence work, then, to tell the truth, there are better-qualified officers for this mission. Igraduated from UNSC OCS only seven weeks ago. My orders had me rotated to theMagellan . Thoseorders were rescinded, ma’am.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She turned and scrutinized him with icy blue eyes. “Go on, Lieutenant.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He reached for his pipe, but then checked the motion. She would probably think it a silly habit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If this is an intel op,” he said, “then . . . then I don’t understand why I’m here at all.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She leaned forward. “Then, Lieutenant, I shall be equally candid.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Something deep inside Lieutenant Keyes told him he would regret hearing whatever Dr. Halsey had tosay. He ignored the feeling. He wanted to know the truth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Go ahead, Doctor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her slight smile returned. “You are here because Vice Admiral Stanforth, head of Section Three ofUNSC Military Intelligence Division, refused to lend me this shuttle without at least one UNSC officeraboard—even though he knows damn well that I can pilot this bucket by myself. So I picked one UNSCofficer. You.” She tapped her lower lip thoughtfully and added, “You see, I’ve read your file,Lieutenant. All of it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Youdo know what I’m talking about.” She rolled her eyes. “You don’t lie well. Don’t insult me bytrying again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes swallowed. “Then why me?Especially if you’ve seen my record?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I chose you preciselybecause of your record—because of the incident in your second year at OCS.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fourteen ensigns killed. You were wounded and spent two months in rehabilitation. Plasma burns areparticularly painful, I understand.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He rubbed his hands together. “Yes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The Lieutenant responsible was your CO on that training mission. You refused to testify against himdespite overwhelming evidence and the testimony of his fellow officers . . . and friends.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They told the board of review the secret the Lieutenant had entrusted to you all—that he was going totest his new theory to make Slipspace jumps more accurate. He was wrong, and you all paid for hiseagerness and poor mathematics.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lieutenant Keyes studied his hands and had the feeling of falling inward. Dr. Halsey’s voice soundeddistant. “Yes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Despite continuing pressure, you never testified. They threatened to demote you, charge you withinsubordination and refusing a direct order—even discharge you from the Navy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Your fellow officer candidates testified, though. The review board had all the evidence they needed tocourt-martial your CO. They put you on report and dropped all further disciplinary actions.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said nothing. His head hung low.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is why you are here, Lieutenant—because you have an ability that is exceedingly rare in themilitary. You can keep a secret.” She drew in a long breath and added, “You may have to keep manysecrets after this mission is over.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He glanced up. There was a strange look in her eyes. Pity? That caught him off guard and he lookedaway again. But he felt better than he had since OCS. Someone trusted him again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I think,” she said, “that you would rather be on theMagellan . Fighting and dying on the frontier.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I—” He caught the lie as he said it, stopped, then corrected himself. “Yes. The UNSC needs everyman and woman patrolling the Outer Colonies. Between the raiders and insurrections, it’s a wonder it allhasn’t fallen apart.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Indeed, Lieutenant, ever since we left Earth’s gravity, well, we’ve been fighting one another for everycubic centimeter of vacuum—from Mars to the Jovian Moons to the Hydra System Massacres and on tothe hundred brushfire wars in the Outer Colonies. It has always been on the brink of falling apart. That’swhy we’re here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To observe one child,” he said. “What difference could a child make?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of her eyebrows arched. “This child could be more useful to the UNSC than a fleet of destroyers, athousand Junior Grade Lieutenants—or evenme . In the end, the child may be the only thing thatmakesany difference.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Approaching Eridanus Two,” Toran informed them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Plot an atmospheric vector for the Luxor spaceport,” Dr. Halsey ordered. “Lieutenant Keyes, makeready to land.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/975/29414.html","bookId":266,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:11:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:11:37 AM"}
