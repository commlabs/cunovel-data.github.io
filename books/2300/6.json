They had shared nothing more than a drink and a dance in a nightclub. She knew nothing about him save what he had told her, and for all she knew, everything he\u0027d said could be a lie. How many times had her father and mother warned her to be careful of strangers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit down on her lower lip. Maybe she was an idiot; maybe she was no better than those foolish girls who got into cars with guys they didn\u0027t know and then wound up dead in a ditch with no one to blame but themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her gaze to his. If eyes were the windows to the soul, then his soul was dark and haunted, and yet she had no sense of being in danger. He might be dangerous, she thought, but not to her. She had never been more certain of anything in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cara.\" His voice was thick with an emotion she couldn\u0027t identify. \"I think I\u0027d better go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" She reached out, as if to stop him, then let her hand fall to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s late. You should get some rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too. You probably have to open your shop early in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, but merely grunted softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be at The Nocturne tomorrow night?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint smile played over his lips. \"I will if you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there.\" As if drawn by an invisible hand, she took a step toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved toward her, his gaze burning into hers. \"What time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nine-thirty.\" They were only a breath apart now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nine-thirty,\" he repeated. \"I\u0027ll see you then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart pounding so loud she was sure he could hear it, she waited for him to kiss her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara stared after him as he went down the winding staircase, disappointed that he hadn\u0027t kissed her good\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enight. It wasn\u0027t until he disappeared into the shadows that she wondered how he was going to get through the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince ghosted through the darkness to where he had left his car. He noted in passing that the man, Anton, had gone. Anton. There was something about the man that rubbed Vince the wrong way. Of course, it might be nothing more than a bad case of good, old-fashioned jealousy, but he didn\u0027t think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something dark and sinister about the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince laughed. Dark and sinister. That was rich! There weren\u0027t many things walking around that were darker or more sinister than what he himself had become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince the vampire. Even now, almost a year later, he still couldn\u0027t believe what had happened to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid behind the wheel of the Mustang and pulled away from the curb. Vampire. He supposed he had been like everyone else on the planet, assuming vampires were creatures of myth and legend, until the night he had the misfortune to pick up the wrong chick. He shook his head. She hadn\u0027t looked like a vampire, he thought glumly, let alone one that was thousands of years old! She\u0027d had the body of a siren and the face of an angel, and he\u0027d been helpless to resist her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly, bitterly. As the old saying went, he had chased her until she caught him. They had been in the middle of the best sex he\u0027d ever had when she\u0027d sunk her fangs into his throat. That was his first hint that she wasn\u0027t an ordinary female. The second had come when he tried to fight her off. She was just a little thing, hardly more than five feet tall, and couldn\u0027t have weighed more than a hundred pounds soaking wet, but she\u0027d held him down with one hand, and when he had gotten desperate and drove his fist into her face, she had laughed at him. Then she had drained him to the point of death and given him a choice-live or die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back, he wondered if he would have chosen death if she had told him just what being a vampire entailed. Not that it was all that bad. True, he could no longer eat brunch with his folks on Sundays, but his senses were so acute he could hear the flutter of a moth\u0027s wings. He couldn\u0027t go surfing early in the morning anymore, but he could bench-press a bus. And even though he couldn\u0027t go outside during the day, he\u0027d been surprised to discover that he wasn\u0027t compelled to sleep when the sun was up. He wasn\u0027t sure why. He had even doubted that he was a true vampire until he foolishly went outside one morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a mistake he hadn\u0027t made again. The sun had burned him like acid. He was weak during the day, and so he usually rested until early afternoon and did the brunt of his work after dark. Even drinking blood wasn\u0027t as bad as he had expected it would be. Bad? Hah! It was like the nectar of the gods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was no denying the thrill of the hunt. At first, he had been shocked and shamed by the kick he got out of it, but that hadn\u0027t lasted long. There was nothing else like it, finding prey, smelling their fear, knowing that you held their life in your hands, that you could take only what you needed to survive or you could drain them to the point of death. He had done that only once, but he had never forgotten the ecstasy of drinking a human life, of absorbing the man\u0027s essence, listening to the beat of his prey\u0027s heart grow weaker as his own grew stronger. As exhilarating as it had been, he had never done it again, afraid that if he did, he would turn into the kind of ravening monster that vampires were reputed to be. It was hard enough to hang on to what remained of his humanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only real downside to being a vampire had been moving away from his family. They had always been a close-knit bunch and he missed rough housing with his brothers and babysitting his nieces and nephews, but moving had seemed the easiest solution. He couldn\u0027t tell his kin what he had become and couldn\u0027t keep thinking up new excuses for why he didn\u0027t show up for brunch or why he couldn\u0027t eat dinner, or go to the park with his sister\u0027s kids, or watch his nephew play Little League anymore. It had just been easier\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto sell his business, move away, and start a new life. He\u0027d hated to leave Georgia, but he\u0027d had to move far enough away that his parents couldn\u0027t just hop in the car and drive over for a visit. It hadn\u0027t been easy leaving his friends behind, either, or starting a new life, especially a life with a lifestyle he didn\u0027t know anything about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other drawback to being Undead was finding things to do to pass the time late at night. He couldn\u0027t work all the time, and once the movies, the bowling alley, and the bars closed, there wasn\u0027t a whole heck of a lot to do except visit The Nocturne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe parked the Mustang in the garage and lowered the iron security door. Cat was waiting for him at the bottom of the stairs. With a gravelly meow, the cat followed him upstairs. At one time, the room had been a large office, but Vince had converted it into a combination living room-bedroom. He no longer needed a kitchen, or much of anything else. He had furnished the place with a black leather sofa and chair, a coffee table, a couple of end tables, a home theater system with surround sound, and a stereo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d had the windows plastered over so he didn\u0027t have to worry about the sun finding him. As long as he avoided its light, he was safe inside. On really sunny days, he closed the security door and just left the side entrance open. Satellite TV and a couple hundred DVDs provided entertainment in the wee hours of the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on the TV, and even though the volume was turned low, he could hear it perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping down on the sofa, he stared at the screen; his thoughts turned inward as he idly scratched Cat\u0027s ears. He had been an easygoing guy not too long ago. He\u0027d had friends, played softball on the local team once a week, gone dirt biking with his buddies, had his share of women. He grinned inwardly. Maybe more than his share. Of course, all that had changed when he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had left all his old friends behind because it was easier to move than try to explain the unexplainable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t really trust himself with women, though they seemed to gravitate toward him more than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince becoming a vampire, he could have scored every night, but he had no interest in meaningless sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, it made satisfying his other hunger easier. Talk about a quickie! He smiled at the women who came on to him, mesmerized them, took what he needed to satisfy his hellish thirst, and sent them on their way, none the wiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cara was different. He didn\u0027t want to drink from her... well, he did, but that wasn\u0027t all he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something about her that called to him. For all that she had money and lived with parents who seemed to love her, he sensed she was just as lonely as he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she lived with vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mulled that over for a time, wondering if the vampires were her parents, and if so, how such a thing could be possible. He\u0027d been told that the Undead couldn\u0027t create life, but if they weren\u0027t her parents, who were they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara. She occupied his thoughts until the rising of the sun made his mind and body sluggish and he sought his bed for a few hours\u0027 sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would see her later, after the sun went down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, he closed his eyes and took his rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara woke the next morning with a smile on her face and a fluttery feeling in the pit of her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, she would see Vince. She giggled at the thought. Was this what it was like to be in love? She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebounded out of bed and then, arms outstretched, she twirled around and around, then fell back on the bed again. She was going to see Vince in... she glanced at the clock and groaned. It was only ten-thirty!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleven hours until she would see him. If she knew where he worked, she could stop in and surprise him, she thought, and then sighed. He might not like that. Some men didn\u0027t like to be bothered at work, so it was probably just as well that she didn\u0027t know where his shop was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a quick shower, dressed, and went downstairs to fix breakfast. As usual, the house was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words \"quiet as a tomb\" whispered through the back of her mind. Frowning, she wondered where that thought had come from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read the paper while she ate a leisurely breakfast, then lingered over a cup of coffee. After putting her dishes in the dishwasher, she went upstairs to brush her teeth and put on her makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDi Giorgio was waiting for her when she went out to the garage. He nodded at her, then got into his car and followed her to the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had often wondered what her parents paid him to be her bodyguard. He rarely got a day off. It had to be the most boring job in the world, following her around, sitting in the library when she was at work, sitting outside her house on her days off. She doubted he had much of a social life. He certainly wasn\u0027t married. After all, what woman would be content with a husband that was hardly ever home? She suddenly felt ashamed of herself. Di Giorgio had been her bodyguard since she was twelve years old and she didn\u0027t know a thing about him except that he had come to the United States from Sicily when he was in his mid-twenties. She had always thought of him as a necessary evil, like going to the dentist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled into her parking space, waved at Di Giorgio as she got out of the car, and almost laughed out loud at the surprised look on his face. She vowed then and there to be nicer to him in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded at the other workers as she moved through the library. They were a nice bunch of ladies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of them were in their forties or fifties and they all mothered her. A couple of them flirted with Frank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey grilled her about his private life and asked her to give Frank their phone numbers. Cara found it amusing. Secretly, she wished that Frank would call Mary Garfield, but Frank didn\u0027t seem interested in Mary or any of the other women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara spent the better part of the afternoon returning books to the proper shelves. As the day wore on, she caught herself constantly looking at the clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have a big date tonight,\" Sarah Beth Coleman remarked with a smile. Sarah Beth was Cara\u0027s best friend. She was married to a police officer and pregnant with their first child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never known you to be a clock-watcher before. Have you met someone new?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ladies in the library were always asking her that, hoping she would find a \"nice young man\" and settle down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have,\" Cara said, unable to keep from smiling at the mere thought of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Beth took her by the hand and drew her deeper into the stacks. \"What\u0027s his name? What\u0027s he like?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen do I get to meet him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara laughed. \"I really don\u0027t know anything about him. I just met him last night, but he seems wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s so nice, and so handsome...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like love at first sight to me,\" Sarah Beth said with a teasing grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that how it was with you and Dean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Beth nodded. \"Yes. I took one look at him and I knew he was the one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m meeting Vince tonight after work. I can hardly wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Beth gave her a quick hug. \"I\u0027ll expect a full report tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround eight-thirty, things slowed down. Cara sat at her desk, idly drawing hearts and writing her name and Vince\u0027s inside. It was such a high-school kind of thing to do, but she couldn\u0027t seem to stop, couldn\u0027t help noticing how well their names looked together. She drew a new heart and wrote Mr. and Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordova inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince. She didn\u0027t know anything about him except how he made her feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt five minutes to nine, she cleared her desk and grabbed her coat, told the ladies good night, and practically bolted out the door. Frank Di Giorgio wasn\u0027t far behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nine-thirteen when she pulled up in front of The Nocturne. No doubt she would get a serious lecture from Di Giorgio about the dangers of speeding sometime in the near future, but she\u0027d worry about that later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking in the rearview mirror, she applied fresh lipstick, ran a brush through her hair, took a deep breath, and then got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDi Giorgio followed her as she walked under the black canopy and down the stairs. The man in the hooded black cloak looked her over carefully, then murmured, \"Welcome back, mistress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara smiled faintly, thinking his raspy voice sounded like it belonged to someone who had been dead for a hundred years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped inside the entrance, letting her eyes adjust to the dim light, then walked around the edge of the dance floor to the bar. There was a vacant stool at the end and she sat down, her gaze moving around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if he didn\u0027t show up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it\u0027s about time you got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, she almost fell off the bar stool. \"Vince! Where did you come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mama?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very funny. How did you sneak up on me like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dunno. Just quiet on my feet, I guess.\" He smiled a roguish smile. \"You\u0027re early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I couldn\u0027t wait.\" His gaze moved over her from head to foot. She looked good enough to eat, he thought. Literally. She smelled good, too, like a fragrant breeze on a warm summer day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was your day?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very productive. I kept returning books to the wrong shelf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze slid away from his. \"I couldn\u0027t concentrate. All I could think about was meeting you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Cara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, her eyes wide and innocent. Damn, he wanted to take her home and make love to her all night long, and that was just wrong, because she wasn\u0027t the kind of girl to settle for a one-night stand and he couldn\u0027t offer her any more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! What was he doing here? There was no way they could have any kind of relationship. She was everything that was good and pure and he... he should be staked for what he was thinking!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vince, what\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I say something to make you mad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, darlin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarlin\u0027 . The word wrapped around her like a warm blanket on a cold night. No one had ever called her darlin\u0027 before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince muttered an oath. He had to end this now, before he did something he would regret for the rest of his life-and that could be a hell of a long time. \"I\u0027ve got to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go?\" She looked up at him. \"But I thought...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disappointment in her eyes was like a dagger piercing his soul. \"I\u0027m sorry, Cara. I...\" Dammit, what could he say to wipe that little girl lost look from her eyes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" she said quickly, and he could almost see her defensive walls springing into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cara, listen...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Cara, I was hoping you\u0027d be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning her back on Vince, she pasted a smile of welcome on her face. \"Hello, Anton. It\u0027s so good to see you,\" she said with feigned enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince ground his back teeth together. Damn the man. The jerk\u0027s timing couldn\u0027t have been worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cara...\" Vince laid his hand on her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at him over her shoulder. \"Oh, are you still here? I thought you were leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince nodded. Maybe it was better this way. Turning on his heel, he stalked out of the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara stared after him a moment, the ache she felt inside almost too much to bear. She had spent the whole day looking forward to being with Vince. She had hoped... what had she hoped? That he would be her knight in shining armor? That he would fall head-over-heels in love with her and carry her off to his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecastle? What a fool she had been. Things like that only happened in fairy tales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a beautiful night,\" Anton remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Oh, yes, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his forefinger up and down her arm. \"Would you like to go for a drive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the last thing she wanted, but her bruised ego wouldn\u0027t let her refuse. Vince Cordova might not want her, but Anton found her attractive and wanted her company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing a smile, she said, \"sure\". Any second thoughts she had about going out with Anton were put to rest by the knowledge that Di Giorgio wouldn\u0027t be far behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton escorted her to his car, a late model BMW. Ever the gentleman, he held the door for her before going around to the driver\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glance over her shoulder confirmed that Di Giorgio was right behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton tuned the radio to a station that played soft rock, then leaned back, his arm resting along the back of the seat. \"Any place you\u0027d like to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you in the mood for a hot fudge sundae? I know a place that makes the best ones in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetermined to have a good time, she said, \"Sounds good to me.\" As any woman could tell you, chocolate healed a multitude of hurts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara frowned when he pulled up in front of a bookstore. \"They sell ice cream here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Among other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out of the car and came around to open her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Wiccan Heart,\" Cara murmured. \"Are you into witchcraft?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who, me?\" He shook his head. \"I just like good ice cream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a shiver of unease as she stepped inside. She didn\u0027t know why. It was a lovely place, filled with books and trinkets, crystals and candles in a wide variety of colors. There was an old-fashioned soda fountain in the back corner, complete with stools covered in shiny red leather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara sat down and Anton sat beside her. He smiled at the waitress. \"Two hot fudge sundaes, Lucy Mae, and don\u0027t spare the chocolate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you want,\" Lucy Mae replied with a saucy grin. \"Your mother was asking for you earlier. She wants you to call her at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, thanks.\" Anton grinned at Cara. \"My mother owns the place,\" he explained with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. How nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit tight. I\u0027d better call and make sure she\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Cara watched him walk to the other side of the room, pull out a cell phone, and punch in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enumber, and all the while she had the feeling she should get up\u0027 and go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to do just that when Anton returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, Lucy Mae placed two enormous hot fudge sundaes on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodness!\" Cara exclaimed. \"I\u0027ll never be able to eat all that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you say now, but wait until you taste it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was everything he said it would be and more. \"I\u0027ve never tasted anything like this,\" she said, licking a bit of chocolate from her lower lip. \"What do they put in it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could tell you, but then I\u0027d have to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he was joking, but his words sent an icy chill down her spine. She didn\u0027t know why, but she had always been superstitious about talking about death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, tell me about yourself,\" Anton said. \"All I really know about you is that you\u0027re a librarian, you like hot fudge sundaes, and you live at home. What are your parents like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re just parents like...\" She started to say like everyone else\u0027s, but couldn\u0027t make herself say the words. \"They worry about me and want what\u0027s best for me. I\u0027m sure your mother is the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother,\" he murmured. \"Yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she a witch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you think that?\" he asked, his voice gruff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No reason. I mean, well, it\u0027s a normal assumption, isn\u0027t it? I mean, she owns a Wiccan book shop, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, but it sounded forced. \"Witchcraft and the occult are all the rage now, that\u0027s all. If onions and artichokes are popular next year, she\u0027ll change the name and the decor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara grinned. \"I\u0027d like to see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to meet your parents,\" Anton said. \"Any chance I could wheedle a dinner invitation for, say, Sunday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some other night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"My parents don\u0027t entertain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They just don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That seems odd. I mean, they live in that huge old...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara put her spoon down as she remembered something Vince had said. \"Did you follow me home from The Nocturne the other night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you think that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just answer me, yes or no. Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"What if I did? I just wanted to make sure you got home all right. Is that a crime?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of crazies hang out at The Nocturne. I was worried about you, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You needn\u0027t worry. I\u0027m perfectly safe wherever I go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a bodyguard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents are very protective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sh... no kidding. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever dated a girl who had her own bodyguard.\" Anton glanced around the shop. \"Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably peeking in a window somewhere. He\u0027s very discreet.\" She glanced toward the door when it opened, letting in a blast of cool air and two women wearing long gray cloaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara leaned closer to Anton. \"Are they witches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they certainly look like witches.\" She glanced at her watch. \"I should go, it\u0027s getting late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since I can\u0027t convince you to invite me to dinner on Sunday, how about if I pick you up and take you out? Just one thing,\" he said with a grin, \"your bodyguard has to pay for his own meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara considered it a moment. When she said yes, it was more to soothe her bruised ego than because she wanted to go out with Anton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they left the shop, Cara noticed the two gray-clad women with their heads together. She couldn\u0027t help wondering if they were talking about her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-6.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
