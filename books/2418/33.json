{"id":76382,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, Bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, this girl is hot. We\u0027re talking about \u0027Tell Me Something,\u0027 right here on your country station, KJ97.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clenched my fists and kept walking. It was the fourth time I\u0027d heard the song that week, and I didn\u0027t even listen to country stations. Never do an investigation for a singer, especially an investigation that goes bad. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be sixty years old riding in a department-store elevator someday and the Muzak version of \"Billy\u0027s Senorita\" will come on, and I\u0027ll see the blood and hear the shots in that warehouse all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pushed by a couple of ladies who were asking the soundman for freebies. Ralph Arguello was waiting for us just between the tips of the Boots. He was still in his milky suit, the black shade overlays on his glasses giving the impression that someone had shot him cleanly and bloodlessly through the eyes. He gave me a cross-thumbs handshake. \"Glad you made it, vato. I had to listen to one more pinche redneck song, I was going to shoot somebody.\" Then he sized up Ana DeLeon. \"Long time, chica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not long enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spread his hands. \"She loves me, vato. We got to excuse the lady\u0027s broken heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, Ralph,\" DeLeon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I\u0027d heard someone say that to Ralph, in a barroom on South St. Mary\u0027s, the resulting scene had not been pretty. This time Ralph\u0027s razor stayed in its sheath. Ralph gave DeLeon his standard demonic grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Ana.\" He held up his pinky, touched between his eyes, then pointed toward DeLeon\u0027s head. \"But we know, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLeon said, \"Let\u0027s get to business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph said, \"Chicharron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know where he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do,\" I corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hector\u0027s salvage yard. Hector\u0027s dead, guess who\u0027s minding the store, tying up some loose ends before the cops come by. And taking whatever he can get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First,\" Ana cut in, \"we need to lay some ground rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph turned his palms up. \"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m only here to watch. I hear anything worth following up on, I\u0027ll do so later, legally. I\u0027m not condoning anything illegal. I\u0027m not participating in anything illegal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027d better wait in the car,\" Ralph said evenly. \"That\u0027s legal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not good enough. And unless I have to, I don\u0027t have a name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s my girlfriend,\" I explained helpfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph looked back and forth between us. He chuckled. \"Okay. You a little paranoid, chica?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to find out what I can,\" DeLeon told him. \"I don\u0027t intend to lose my job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph chuckled again. \"Ana, chica, you think cops don\u0027t do this shit all the time? I know a detective — the brass have known for years he\u0027s associating with the Mexican Mafia. He gets the busts on their competition, uses intermediaries, does business with people worse than me. Nobody can prove shit. You should see the car this guy drives to work, man. I know another guy—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s always scum at the bottom of the barrel,\" Ana interrupted. \"I\u0027d expect you to know them all. You don\u0027t know the majority of the SAPD and you don\u0027t know me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never seen Ralph take words like that so calmly, but he just smiled. \"She\u0027s fine when she\u0027s mad, vato. Ain\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suggested, \"How about we go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Miranda Daniels song ended, and KJ97 started raving about the Vince Gill number coming up. Ralph looked over at them with distaste. \"Yeah, vato. Let\u0027s go. Your car or mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Ana. \"We go with Ralph, you\u0027re liable to see him do something illegal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make some U-turns, chica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027ll smoke,\" I warned her. \"Not Marlboros, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the other hand,\" Ralph said, \"that sweet little Miata of yours only got two seats, Ana. Right? Guess somebody could sit on my lap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look at me,\" I objected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAna DeLeon looked back and forth between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no intention—\" Then she faltered. Moral dilemma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph grinned, waved with a flourish toward the curb where his maroon Cadillac El Dorado was parked in a red zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The road to hell is paved with that shit, chica,\" he consoled. \"Right this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe U-Best Scrap Yard on Southeast Military was a fine example of Early Apartheid architecture. Razor wire topped the fence. Sheets of corrugated metal lined the inside of the chain link so you couldn\u0027t see in to contemplate stealing the proprietor\u0027s countless riches. Dandelions choked the base of the fence and the sidewalk glittered with broken beer glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the entrance, narrow lanes twisted between mountains of electronics scraps, broken appliances, car fenders, road signs from defunct businesses. Sitting in folding chairs by the gate were two large Latino men who resembled lounging sea mammals. They were playing dominoes on a three-legged card table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mira, affirmative action,\" Ralph said. \"Yard used to belong to this gringo named Sammy L. He retired, sold the place to Hector, now it\u0027s an equal-opportunity fence spot. Hector got North Side kids, West Side kids — whatever. Didn\u0027t tell the kids what to steal — just took anything they brought. Paid by the pound, I hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph\u0027s tone was disdainful, like this was a business arrangement seriously below his caliber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we watched, a couple of kids strolled out past the human walruses. One kid was Anglo, the other Latino — both about sixteen, both thin and hard-bodied, greasy hair and baggy clothes. Both were counting money from wads of cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like somebody\u0027s still minding the store,\" Ana DeLeon said. She opened the back door and got out. We followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the walruses nudged the other as we approached. They watched, sleepy-eyed, their slightly buck-toothed mouths slack under bristly spots of mustache. The guys must\u0027ve weighed about two-fifty apiece. Their arms were slick, hairless brown slabs; their faces had the apathetic look of men who\u0027d never had to move for anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey barely blinked when Ralph drew his .357. The one on the right didn\u0027t even show expression when Ralph pistol-whipped him across the side of the face and sent him sliding to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe struck walrus slumped there on the pavement, his eyes glazed and stupid, the skin split open in a Z along his cheekbone. Even his blood ran slow, like it too was not used to being picked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friend stayed frozen in his chair, gaping up at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Ana. Her hands were in her back pockets. Her expression hadn\u0027t changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph told the walruses, \"That\u0027s how we say hello, eses. We\u0027re going in to talk to Chicharron now. You keep playing your little game, keep an eye on my car. You do anything else, anything stupid, we teach you how to say good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComprendes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at us in complete silence, amazed. Then, real slow, both nodded. We went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was unnecessary,\" DeLeon grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s more,\" I said, \"do you really think they\u0027re just going to sit still?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph grinned at me, and with a little discomfort I realized he didn\u0027t care in the slightest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center of the scrap yard stood a stilted clapboard office that resembled a henhouse. Its exterior was covered with airbrushed graffiti — faux-cursive names outlined and colored to neon illegibility, scenes of violence and clusters of guns like bouquets, Spanish slogans, gang symbols from a dozen different neighborhoods. The windows were ragged squares made with a power saw. One of them held a large electric wall fan. A running board led up to the uncovered entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, Chich Gutierrez was sitting behind a metal desk, tapping a purple felt-tip pen against some paperwork that fluttered in the breeze of the fan\u0027s high-speed setting. Chicharron was sporting the same vampire look he\u0027d had at the Poco Mas two nights ago — ponytail, silver cross earring, black leather boots, black jeans. He\u0027d shed the trench coat in favor of a white tux shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows. With a quill pen, the fashion statement would\u0027ve been perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, there was a .38 revolver on his desk, but Ralph walked in and knocked it to the floor before Chicharron could even register our faces. The room could comfortably hold two. With four of us, the floor sagged. Ralph pointed his .357 at Chicharron. He said, \"Get up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hum of the fan made Ralph\u0027s voice sound submerged. Chich studied us with black eyes. He looked at the gun, then at Ralph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know who I am, Chich?\" Ralph asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arguello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know to get the fuck up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChich\u0027s eyes slid to Ana DeLeon. They dismissed her, then focused on me. I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Chich stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was dead still except for his mouth, which kept twitching at the corners — from fear or amusement, I couldn\u0027t tell which. He said, \"You going to\u0026nbsp; make this a small mistake or a big one, Arguello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph motioned for him to move to one side. I frisked him, removed two switchblades and a tiny 9mm from his pockets. Ralph found some keys and a cash box in the desk. We threw it all in the corner with the .38.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can sit down now,\" Ralph told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChich sank back into his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ice Hector?\" Ralph asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChich\u0027s mouth twitched. \"That supposed to be a joke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You the man in the white van, Chich. You better start telling me some things about last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck off, Arguello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph moved to the wall fan. He ran a fingernail thoughtfully along the plastic grill, then slid his .357 back in his belt. \"I knew a guy once, got his hand stuck in one of those old metal fans. You know the round ones? Nowadays everything is fucking plastic, man. Look at this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph put his left hand on top of the fan, worked the fingers of his right into the holes of the grill, and pulled. The top wasn\u0027t fastened very well and bowed out. On Ralph\u0027s second pull, the grill ripped away with a watery zing, exposing the white circular haze of spinning fan blades. Ralph dropped the grill to the floor. He had little bloody lines on the pads of his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAna stood in the corner of the room, her black Justin boot resting on Chich\u0027s .38.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheap Taiwanese shit,\" Ralph said. \"You think it\u0027d do much damage, Chich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChich tried for a smile. \"You\u0027re full of it. Fuckin\u0027 pawnshop man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t so chatty when Ralph picked up the open-faced fan and heaved it at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spinning blades caught Chich\u0027s upraised forearms, grinding into him. The sound was like an outboard motor hitting a sandbar. Metal and plastic shuddered and Chich screamed. He lurched backward out of his chair, flailing, cursing, brushing himself violently like he was covered with fire ants, dragging the fan with him, a blade snagged on his tux shirt, the cord ripped free from the outlet. The fan clattered at his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fucking lunatic!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChich held up his arms. They were ridged from wrist to elbow with smile-shaped contusions, some merely deep welts, a few ripped open and bleeding. Ralph walked over to Ana, smiled at her, then bent down and picked up the .38 he\u0027d knocked off Chich\u0027s desk. He pointed it at its owner. \"Get up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m bleeding!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was just an icebreaker, man. Get us through the posturing shit. Now sit in your chair.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-33.html","bookId":2418,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
