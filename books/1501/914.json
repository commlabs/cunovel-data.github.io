I truly don’t have the patience necessary to teach a disciple. However… if I keep adventuring like this, I’ll probably die one day. If I die, I die, but I’m afraid that after enough years pass, even my name shall be forgotten by the vast majority of cultivators.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will be you, my dear disciples, who shall ensure that my name and reputation shall exist unto perpetuity. Once you become my personal disciple, you must accept ten more disciples on my behalf before you attempt your Daomerge. They can be considered honorary disciples of mine,” the Eternal Emperor said. “The skills I impart unto you, you can only impart unto those ten honorary disciples.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your disciple understands.” Ning nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccept ten disciples before his Daomerge? This was a fairly easy oath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then swear the oath,” the Eternal Emperor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing immediately swore a lifeblood oath. If he wanted to transmit certain legacies to his future disciples or to Subhuti and the others in the Three Realms, he could simply transmit his own insights. He would have a Dao that was completely his own, after all! The Eternal Emperor’s legacy primarily served as a guidepost for him, a way to show him how he should walk his future path and avoid certain wrong choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a person walked forward blindly without any guideposts, it would be easy to get lost and make the wrong decisions. Ever step taken by a Samsara Daolord was a step which straddled the line between life and death. There were no ways to take back a misstep! Once you made that misstep, you would die and your Dao would dissipate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm.” The Eternal Emperor watched Ning swear the oath, nodding in satisfaction. He transformed into a streak of light that flew straight into Ning’s body. Ning wasn’t able to resist him in the slightest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumble…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing just stood there in the middle of the wilderness, surrounded by the four retainers of the Emperor. The swordsman, the fisherman, the assassin, and the emperor all stared at him as ripples of power began to emanate from the area around him. Clearly, the many memories and abilities which the Eternal Emperor’s strand of will contained were merging into Ning’s own memories. That strand of divine will held simply too much power and memories, making it physically painful for even someone as mighty as Ning to absorb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin Ning’s sea of consciousness. A large amount of information was flooding into this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Before I succeeded in my Daomerge, I obtained an Eternal sword-art known as the [Heartseal] sword-art. This sword-art has a total of fifteen stances. This is the first stance, the Flysword stance…” A memory fragment entered Ning’s mind. The speaker was Emperor Mirrorsnow, and in the memory he wielded a single sword and began to display the first stance of the [Heartseal] sword-art.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmperor Mirrorsnow’s will was in complete control of these many memory fragments. He made it so that Ning was able to personally watch his memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is second stance, the Mountainsword stance.” Emperor Mirrorsnow put this stance on display as well. This was a far more effective method than simply meditating on sword-intent, as the Eternal Emperor was putting on a personal display. Not only was his sword-intent clear and obvious, he executed every movement in perfect detail and clarity. For the sake of being able to teach better, the Emperor Mirrorsnow displayed every single stance three times. The first time, he went through every single movement extremely slowly. The second time, he would display it without using any divine power or Immortal energy. The third time, he would use it with true, full power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the fifteenth stance, the Heartseal stance. Once the Heartseal forms, eternity shall be gained.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis final memory fragment was of Emperor Mirrorsnow executing sword-arts in a vast region of primordial chaos. When his sword struck out, an utterly titanic seal suddenly manifested which completely extinguished everything in the primordial chaos in the area. One chaos star after another was wiped out by the force of this strike. Ning was able to count over a hundred million chaos stars that were shattered and splintered by the force of this strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing was truly speechless when he saw this. When Emperor Mirrorsnow had unleashed a full-strength attack with this stance, just how wide an area had it covered? His sword was so fast that it had surpassed the concept of speed itself. In fact, it had surpassed even the very concept of spacetime itself. Otherwise, how could it have wiped out that many chaos stars? Even if his sword moved thousands of times faster than the speed of light, how could it possibly fly out that far, that fast?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, it was an undisputable fact that Emperor Mirrorsnow’s sword had wiped out everything in an infinitely vast region, leaving nothing behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, the region which Emperor Mirrorsnow had chosen to display this stance was a region that was completely devoid of life. Otherwise, the number of casualties that would’ve been caused would be incalculable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve completely displayed the [Heartseal] sword-art for you. This was the sword-art I trained in as I progressed, step by step, to gain eternity for myself. It is extremely difficult to train in this sword-art, but it can be separated into four different sets of sword-arts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmperor Mirrorsnow began to display a new set of sword-arts, and Ning instantly understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese four separate sword-arts could be described as the fisherman’s sword, the assassin’s sword, the emperor’s sword, and the killer’s sword. The fisherman, the assassin, and the emperor each used one of these three sets of sword-arts, while the final challenger, the swordsman, used a sword-art that could be considered the most basic, elementary version of the [Heartseal] sword-art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These four sets of sword-arts each represent a separate path. Although they seem quite ordinary, it won’t be hard for you to become a Daolord of the Fourth Step through using one of these sword-arts. However, even if you do reach that level, your accomplishments will be mediocre,” Emperor Mirrorsnow said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, these four sword-arts can actually be separated into ninety-six sword-arts.” Emperor Mirrorsnow once again began to carefully display and describe every single sword-art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason why this transmission had been such a painful and arduous one to accept was primarily because each and every memory fragment contained scenes of the Eternel Emperor personally displaying his sword-arts. A large amount of stances were included, as were various types of sword-intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The [Heartseal] sword-art can be separated into four fairly average sword-arts, which can then be separated into ninety-six low-class sword-arts. If you have sufficiently high insights into the sword, it will be easy for you to learn them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have finished transmitting my sword-arts to you. Now, I shall transmit a divine ability to you, an extremely powerful divine ability that will allow your attacks to explode with power. You will be able to instantly unleash a extreme level of power with it. This divine ability is known as the [Five Seals Sword Dao]…” The transmission of a divine ability was much simpler. It mainly included basic information in how to train in that divine ability, and Ning was able to instantly memorize it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, right. I left behind four golem servants. They shall follow you, my personal disciple, and protect you. That way, I can guarantee you won’t die too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm. I’ve taught you everything I should teach, and I’ve said everything that needs to be said. Train hard and make sure you don’t besmirch my mighty name, dear disciple. If fate wills it, perhaps we shall truly meet in the flesh one day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe transmission came to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack within the desolate wilderness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four retainers continued to watch Ning. While Ning had been accepting the transmission, he had been rippling with waves of power. This state had persisted for two full days before he came to a halt and took a rest. The main reason it had taken this long was because it truly was difficult for Ning to completely absorb all of the information in the memory fragments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Ning had personally watched Emperor Mirrorsnow display his sword-arts, he wouldn’t have been able to understand or memorize the truly profound parts. However, Emperor Mirrorsnow had completely transmitted his memories directly into Ning’s mind. Once the process was complete, Ning would never forget those memories unless he personally wiped them away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh? Why hasn’t Darknorth woken up yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. There are no more ripples; the transmission should’ve concluded.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s probably training.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four retainers chatted amongst themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir guesses were correct. Ning was indeed training. In the Forest of Sword Pagodas, he had only been able to visualize and sense the sword-intents radiating from the pagodas. There was obviously no way he could see or visualize those ancient powers actually displaying their various sword-arts, much less have their memories be directly infused into his mind! The [Heartseal] sword-art was also an incredibly profound sword-art, and one which could be broken down into multiple different sword-arts. This made it extremely easy for Ning to train in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the questions he had regarding the Dao of the Sword were wiped clean. He was continuously gaining a deeper and deeper understanding as his sword-arts dramatically improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis explosively effective training session persisted for more than half a month before it finally came to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whew.” Ning opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Having a master versus not having one… it really is completely different.” Ning glanced at the world around him in a jubilant mood. He knew that he had just completely changed compared to a month ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing now knew how he should advance from the World level all the way to the Eternal Emperor level. In the past, he knew nothing. Now, he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder who is stronger? My master Emperor Mirrorsnow, Violetjewel creator Emperor Violetmount, or the creator of the [Nameless] sword-art,” Ning mused. “Still… the Violetjewels are merely middle-grade Eternal weapons. Once I become a Daolord of the First Step, I’ll probably need to switch them out for something else. As for the [Nameless] sword-art, I only have the first seven stances to them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing understood that in the future, he would spend much of his time meditating on the [Heartseal] sword-art and learning from it, infusing its mysteries into his own Dao of the Sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I could gain the complete [Nameless] sword-art legacy and the complete legacy of Emperor Violetmount, then I would now have three complete legacies. I could simultaneously absorb the teachings and mysteries of all three legacies, then go learn from the Forest of Sword Pagodas. I’ll definitely improve even more quickly then.” When this thought flickered through Ning’s mind, he couldn’t help but grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Darknorth, was that helpful to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems you’ve gained quite a bit from it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Given how strong Darknorth is already, he’ll soon be able to break through to become a Daolord whenever he wishes.” The four retainers all spoke out when Ning woke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing smiled and nodded. “I indeed can break through to become a Daolord. However, that path is not my path.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Unicorn’s Domain had indeed been dramatically improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Unicorn’s Domain was a path akin to the fisherman’s path. Emperor Mirrorsnow’s [Heartseal] sword-art could be divided into four sword-arts, one of which was the [Fisherman’s Sword]. Ning’s highest level of attainment in recent years was in the Unicorn’s Domain, which was his Unicorn’s Domain had dramatically improved just half a month after Ning had received the legacy. Ning could already sense that his accomplishments in the Unicorn’s Domain were enough for him to use it as his core foundation to rebuild his divine body and become a Daolord of the First Step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamsara Daolords. Each step they took resulted in their divine bodies being completely reconstituted! If you took a single wrong step, you would cause your body to crumble. You would die and your Dao would vanish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just as Emperor Mirrorsnow said, although all four sword-arts which make up the [Heartseal] sword-art can allow a person to become a Daolord of the Fourth Step, they will result in mediocrity.” Ning secretly shook his head. Just becoming a Daolord was not enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-27-chapter-10\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-27-chapter-12\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/desolate-era/de-book-27-chapter-11","bookId":1501,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM"}
