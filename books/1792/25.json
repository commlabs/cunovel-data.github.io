Bring half the number over here. They\u0027ll stay with Princess Christina until her aunt returns from the country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been forced by circumstances to bellow his orders. His driver wouldn\u0027t have heard him otherwise. No, the parade of carriages coming down the street was making too much of a clatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he should have felt a shred of shame for what he was deliberately doing. When he spotted the first carriage rounding the corner, the very least he could have done was wave his driver away and shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thompson\u0027s party must have just let out,\" he remarked in a casual voice to the horrified woman hovering behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon actually smiled when he heard her gasp, pleased she understood the ramifications well enough. Then he leaned against the door frame and waved at the startled occupants of the first carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good eve, Hudson, Lady Margaret,\" he shouted, totally unconcerned that his pants were only partially buttoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver his shoulder he told Christina, \"Lady Margaret looks like she\u0027s about to fall out of the carriage, love. She\u0027s hanging halfway out the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lyon, how could you?\" Christina asked, clearly appalled by his conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Destiny, my dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved to three more carriages before he finally closed the door. \"That ought to do it,\" he remarked, more to himself than to the outraged woman looking ready to kill him. \"Now, what were you saying about not marrying me, my sweet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a man without shame,\" she shouted when she could find her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Christina. I\u0027ve just sealed your fate, so to speak. You still do believe in destiny, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to marry you, no matter what scandal you weave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she hadn\u0027t been so infuriated, she might have tried to explain again. But Lyon was grinning at her with such a victorious, arrogant look on his face, she decided to keep the full truth to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drained the anger right out of her. Lyon suddenly pulled her into his arms and kissed her soundly. When he finally let go of her, she was too weak to protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started back up the stairs in search of his shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina held on to the bannister, watching him. \"Do you think ruining my reputation will matter, Lyon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a nice start,\" Lyon called back. \"Remember, what will be is going to be. Your words, Christina, not mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s going to be,\" she shouted. \"I won\u0027t be in England long enough to care about my reputation. Don\u0027t you understand, Lyon? I have to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he\u0027d heard her. She\u0027d shouted loud enough to rattle the walls. Lyon disappeared around the corner, but Christina patiently waited for him to come back downstairs. She wasn\u0027t about to go chasing after him again. No, she knew she\u0027d end up back in bed with him if she went up the stairs. God help her, she\u0027d probably be the one to suggest it. Lyon was simply too appealing, and she was too weak-hearted to fight him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, she told herself, she hated him. The man had the morals of a rattlesnake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dressed when he came downstairs. He was ignoring her, too. Lyon didn\u0027t speak another word until his carriage had returned with two big men and one heavyset maid. Then he spoke to his staff, giving them his orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina was infuriated with his high-handed manner. When he instructed the men to see to her protection, to let no one enter her home without his permission, she decided to protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look he gave her made her reconsider. She was seeing a different side of Lyon\u0027s character now. He was very like Black Wolf when he was addressing his warriors. Lyon was just as cold, as rigid, as commanding. Christina instinctively knew it would be better not to argue with him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to ignore him just as thoroughly as he was ignoring her. That decision was short-lived, however. Christina was staring into the fireplace, trying to pretend the man didn\u0027t even exist, when she heard a rather descriptive curse. She turned just in time to see Lyon jump up from the settee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d sat on her knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Serves you justice,\" she muttered when he held the blade up and glared at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to snatch her weapon away from him, but Lyon wouldn\u0027t let her have it. \"It belongs to me,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you belong to me, you little warrior,\" Lyon snapped out. \"Admit it, Christina, now, or I swear to the Great Spirit I\u0027ll show you how a real warrior uses a knife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir gazes held a long, ponderous moment. \"You really don\u0027t know what you\u0027re trying to catch, do you? Very well, Lyon. For now—until you change your mind, that is—I will belong to you. Does that satisfy you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon dropped the knife and pulled Christina into his arms. He then proceeded to show her just how immensely satisfied he really was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward had left to put dawn a resistance in the West. When the captain of my ship came for me, I made him wait outside my husband\u0027s office while I went inside to steal the jewels. I briefly considered leaving a note for Edward, then decided against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe set sail immediately, but I didn\u0027t begin to feel safe until we were two days out to sea. I stayed below in my cabin most of the time, for 1 was terribly ill. I couldn\u0027t hold any food in my stomach, and I believed it was the weather that was the cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until a week had passed that the truth settled in my mind. I was carrying Edward\u0027s child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod forgive me, Christina, but I prayed for your death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJournal entry September 7, 1795\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday was a trial of endurance for Christina. Although she protested vehemently, Lyon\u0027s servants had her possessions packed up and transferred to his mother\u0027s townhouse by noon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina kept insisting that she wasn\u0027t going anywhere, that the Countess would be home Monday next, and that she would take care of herself until that time. No one paid her the least attention. They followed the instructions from their employer, of course, and though they were friendly enough, one and all suggested she mention her distress to the Marquess of Lyonwood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Christina had not seen Lyon since Friday evening, his presence was certainly felt. He hadn\u0027t allowed her to attend Creston\u0027s ball, or to go anywhere else, for that matter. Christina thought he kept her closeted inside her townhouse so she wouldn\u0027t be able to run away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also the possibility that he was trying to protect her feelings, Christina realized. He might not want her to hear any of the whispers circling the ton about her liaison with Lyon. It was a scandal, to be sure, but a scandal Lyon had personally caused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps Lyon thought she\u0027d be upset about the slurs against her character. She was unmarried, Lyon had been undressed, and half the ton had witnessed the scene. Oh, there was a scandal floating about; Christina had heard Colette, the lady\u0027s maid Lyon had thrust upon her, tell one of the other servants a juicy bit of gossip she\u0027d overheard when she\u0027d gone to do the marketing with the cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina had a splitting headache by midafternoon. It came upon her all at once when she happened to notice the wedding announcement in the newspapers. Lyon had had the gall to post his intention to marry Princess Christina the following Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColette caught her tearing up the paper. \"Oh, my lady, isn\u0027t it romantic the way the Marquess flaunts tradition? Why, he\u0027s doing everything to his liking and doesn\u0027t care what others will say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina didn\u0027t think it was romantic at all. She felt like screaming. She went upstairs to her bedroom, thinking to find a few minutes\u0027 peace, but she\u0027d barely closed the door behind her when she was once again interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA visitor was waiting for her in the drawing room. Since Lyon had ordered that no one was to be allowed entrance, Christina naturally assumed he was the one waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was fighting mad when she stormed into the salon. \"If you think you can…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shout tapered off as soon as she saw the elderly woman sitting in the gold wing-back chair. \"If I think what, my dear?\" the woman asked, looking perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina was embarrassed by her outburst. The woman smiled at her then. Some of the awkwardness left her. Christina could tell the stranger was kind. There were laugh wrinkles around her eyes and her mouth. The top of her gray-haired bun was level with the top of the chair, indicating she was an extremely tall woman. She wasn\u0027t very attractive. Her hooked nose took up a good portion of her face, and she had a slight yet noticeable line of hair above her thin upper lip. She was a heavy-bosomed woman with wide shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed to be about the Countess\u0027s age. \"I do apologize for shouting at you, madam, but I believed you were Lyon,\" Christina explained after making a low curtsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How very bold of you, child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bold? I don\u0027t understand,\" Christina said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To raise your voice to my nephew. Proves you\u0027ve got spirit,\" the woman announced with a brisk nod. She motioned for Christina to sit down. \"I\u0027ve known Lyon since he was a little boy, and I\u0027ve never had the courage to shout at him. Now, allow me to introduce myself,\" she continued. \"I\u0027m Lyon\u0027s aunt. Aunt Harriett, to be correct. I\u0027m his father\u0027s younger sister, you see, and since you\u0027ll soon be the new Marchionness of Lyonwood, you might as well call me Aunt Harriett from the beginning. Are you ready to come home with me now, Christina, or do you need a little more time to prepare? I shall be happy to wait in here, if you could order me a spot of tea. My, it has gone warm again today, hasn\u0027t it?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina didn\u0027t know how to answer her. She watched her take a small fluted fan from her lap, open it with a quick flip of her wrist, and begin to wave it a bit violently in front of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the woman\u0027s advanced years, Christina naturally took a submissive attitude. The elders were to be respected and—whenever possible—obeyed without a word of protest. It was the way of the Dakota, the way Christina was raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina bowed her head and said, \"I am honored to meet you, Aunt Harriett. If you have the patience to listen to me, I would like to explain that there seems to be a misunderstanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Misunderstanding?\" Harriett asked. Her voice sounded with amusement. She pointed her fan at Christina. \"My dear, may I be open with you? Lyon has ordered me to see you settled in his mother\u0027s townhouse. We both know he\u0027ll have his way, regardless of your feelings. Don\u0027t look so crestfallen, child. He only has your best interests at heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, madam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to marry Lyon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer blunt question demanded an answer. She was staring intently at Christina. Very much like a hawk, Christina thought. \"Well, child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina tried to think of a way to soften the truth. \"What I would like to do and what I must do are two separate issues. I\u0027m trying to protect Lyon from making a terrible mistake, madam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage would be a mistake, you say?\" Aunt Harriett asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he marries me, yes,\" Christina admitted. \"I\u0027ve always been known for my bluntness, Christina, so I\u0027m going to ask you right out. Do you love my nephew?\" Christina could feel herself blushing. She looked up at Aunt Harriett for a long moment. \"You don\u0027t need to answer me, child. I can see you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am trying not to love him,\" Christina whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Harriett started fanning herself again. \"I certainly don\u0027t understand that remark. No, I don\u0027t. Lyon did tell me you\u0027ve only just learned the English language, and that you might not make sense all the time. Now, don\u0027t get red in the face, Christina, he meant no criticism. Do you have any idea how remarkable it is that this union will be based on love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I first met Lyon, I believed we were meant to be together… for a short time. Yes,\" she added when Aunt Harriett gave her a puzzled look. \"I believed it was our destiny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Destiny?\" Aunt Harriett smiled. \"What a romantic notion, Christina. I believe you\u0027re just what my nephew needs. He\u0027s such an intense, angry man most of the time. Now please explain what you meant by saying it would be for only a short while. Do you believe you\u0027d fall out of love so quickly? That is a bit of a shallow constitution, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina wasn\u0027t sure what the woman meant by her remark. \"Lyon would like to marry a princess. I would like to go home. It is really very simple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on Aunt Harriett\u0027s face indicated she didn\u0027t think it was simple at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Lyon will have to go home with you,\" Aunt Harriett announced. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027d insist upon visiting your homeland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe absurd suggestion made Christina smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See? I\u0027ve lightened your worry already,\" Aunt Harriett said. \"Why, of course, Lyon will take you home for a visitation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina knew it was pointless to argue with the kind woman\u0027s expectations, and it would have been rude to disagree openly with her. After ordering refreshments, Christina spent the next hour listening to Aunt Harriett tell amusing stories about her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe learned that Lyon\u0027s father had died in his sleep. Lyon was away at school when the tragedy happened, and Christina thought it sad indeed that he hadn\u0027t been by his father\u0027s side. She also learned that Lyon\u0027s wife, Lettie, had died in childbirth. The story was so sad, Christina had to fight back her tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when the hour was up, Christina went with Aunt Harriett to Lyon\u0027s mother\u0027s home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been inside the beautiful townhouse once before, when she\u0027d visited Lady Diana by request, and for that reason the sight of such luxury didn\u0027t quite take her breath away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entrance blazed with candlelight. The receiving room was on the left. It was a good three times the size of all the others Christina had seen. The dining room was on the right. A long, narrow table took up most of the room, polished to such a sheen one could actually see his face in the reflection. There were sixteen chairs lining each side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina assumed there were that many relatives living with Lyon\u0027s mother. Lyon had provided well for his family. There were servants rushing around, fetching and carrying. Aunt Harriett had told her that Lyon paid for it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Diana rushed down the steps to greet Christina. \"Lyon is waiting for you upstairs in the library,\" she announced, tugging on Christina\u0027s arm. \"Oh, you do look lovely in pink, Christina. It\u0027s such a soft color,\" she added. \"Do you know, I wish I were as delicate in stature as you are. Why, I feel like an elephant when I\u0027m standing next to you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-25.html","bookId":1792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:34 PM"}
