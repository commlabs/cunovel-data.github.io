What\u0027s on your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced, wishing my mother wasn\u0027t so good at reading me. \"I\u0027m just tired.\" I forced a smile for her benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure that all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt ate at me. I rarely spent time with my mother, and I wished I hadn\u0027t been distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Mom. I guess I am a little out of it today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started washing our dinner dishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are things with Daemon and Dee?\" We\u0027d made it all day without talking about them. \"They\u0027re doing great. I think I may go watch a movie with them later.\" She smiled. \"Are you going with both of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my eyes. \"Mom, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, I\u0027m your mother. I do have a right to ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure, really. I don\u0027t even know if we are going. It was just an idea.\" I grabbed an apple out of the fruit bowl and took a bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing with your evening, Mom?\" She tried to look nonchalant. \"I\u0027m going out and having coffee with Mr. Michaels tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Michaels? And who is he?\" I asked between bites. \"Wait. Is he that fine-looking doctor at the hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the one and only.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a date?\" I leaned against the counter, grinning around the apple. \"Go Mom.\" My mother blushed - actually blushed. \"It\u0027s just coffee. Not a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat explained why she kept picking out dresses today, going as far as making me choose at least two of the pretty things from her closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I hope you have fun on your not a date, but sounds like a date.\" Smiling, she chattered on about her evening plans and then about a patient she had yesterday. Before she left to get ready, she brought me a couple of dresses she\u0027d found in the back of her closet. \"Well, if you go out tonight, why don\u0027t you wear one of these?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll look pretty in them. They always looked too young for me to wear.\" My nose scrunched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, I\u0027m not the one who has a date tonight.\" She scoffed. \"I don\u0027t either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever!\" I yelled as she raced up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take her long to get ready and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince it wasn\u0027t technically a date, she was meeting him at a little diner in town. I hoped she had a good time; she deserved to have fun. Since Dad had passed away, I don\u0027t think she had even looked twice at a guy. Which meant Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaels must be special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than Dee mentioning that we should get together, there hadn\u0027t been any plans for the night. I knew Daemon was keeping an eye on me from next door all day, but I\u0027d refused to let him hover at my house. They\u0027d told me the Arum were stronger at night and preferred to attack then. I felt pretty safe during the day. I\u0027d wanted to spend a normal day of reading and blogging and hanging out with my mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was strange going about normal stuff after such a huge secret. I felt like they should be out stopping accidents, curing world hunger, and saving kittens caught in trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing the apple core in the garbage, I fiddled with the ring on my finger as I looked over the dresses on the table. I wouldn\u0027t be wearing them on a date anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp knock on the back door jarred me out of my thoughts. I went to the door and Daemon stood there. Even dressed in casual jeans and a plain white shirt that strained against his upper body, he looked utterly magnificent. It was unsettling. And what was even more unnerving was the way he stood there and stared at me. His brilliant jade gaze was intense and consuming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, giving me no clue what kind of mood he was in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh b oy. \"Um, do you want to come in?\" He shook his head. \"No, I thought maybe we could go do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmusement flashed in his eyes. \"Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless you have a review to post or a garden that needs tending.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha. Ha.\" I started to shut the door in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw his hand out, easily stopping it without touching it. \"Okay. Let me try that again. Would you like to do something with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot really, but I was curious. And a part of me was beginning to understand why Daemon was so standoffish. Maybe - just maybe - we could do this without wanting to kill one another. \"Where did you have in mind?\" Daemon pushed away from the house and shrugged. \"Let\u0027s go to the lake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll check the road before I cross this time.\" I followed him, avoiding his amused look. I shoved my hands in the pockets of my shorts and decided to not beat around the bush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not taking me out in the woods because you changed your mind and decided your secret is not safe with me, are you?\" Daemon busted out laughing. \"You\u0027re very paranoid.\" I snorted. \"Okay, that is coming from an alien who apparently can toss me into the sky without touching me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t locked yourself in any rooms or rocked in any corners, right?\" I rolled my eyes and began walking again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No Daemon, but thanks for making sure I\u0027m mentally sound and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" He threw up his hands. \"I need to make sure you aren\u0027t going to lose it and potentially tell the entire town what we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you need to worry about that for several reasons,\" I replied dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon gave me a pointed look. \"You know how many people we\u0027ve been close to? I mean, really close to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a face. It wasn\u0027t hard to imagine what he meant. Oddly, I found myself not liking those images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chuckle was deep and throaty. \"Then one little girl goes and exposes us. Can you see how hard that is for me to...trust?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a little girl, but if I could go back in time and do it all over I wouldn\u0027t have stepped out in front of that truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well that is good to know,\" he responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t regret finding out the truth. It explains so much. Wait, can you go back in time?\" I asked seriously. The possibility hadn\u0027t crossed my mind before but now I honestly wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon sighed and shook his head. \"We can manipulate time, yes. But it\u0027s not something we\u0027d do, and only going forward. At least I\u0027ve never heard of anyone being able to bend time to the past.\" My eyes felt like they were going to pop out. \"Jesus, you guys make Superman look lame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled as he dipped his head down to avoid a low-hanging branch. \"Well, I\u0027m not telling you what our kryptonite is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I ask you a question?\" I asked after a couple of moments of us walking along the leaf-covered trail. When he nodded, I took a deep breath. \"The Bethany girl that disappeared - she was involved with Dawson, right?\" He cut me a sharp sidelong glance. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she found out about you guys?\" Several seconds passed before he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at him again. His face was stoic as he stared straight ahead. \"And that\u0027s why she disappeared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, there was a gap of silence. \"Yes.\" Okay. He was only going to give me one-word answers. Nice. \"Did she tell someone? I mean, why did she...have to disappear?\" Daemon sighed heavily. \"It\u0027s complicated, Kat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplicated meant a lot of things. \"Is she...dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped, digging an odd-shaped pebble out of my sandal. \"You\u0027re just not going to tell me?\" He grinned at me with infuriating ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why did you want to come out here?\" I shook the rock out and put my sandal back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s fun for you to be all evasive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is amusing to watch your cheeks get all pink when you\u0027re frustrated.\" I glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon smirked and started walking again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t say anything until we reached the lake. He went to the edge and glanced back to where I stopped a few feet behind him. \"Besides the twisted fact that I like watching you get all bent out of shape, I figured you\u0027d have more questions.\" Well, it was sick he liked pissing me off. Even sicker was the fact I liked watching him get all pissy, too. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some I won\u0027t answer. Some I will.\" Daemon paused, looking thoughtful. \"Might as well get all your questions out of the way. Then we don\u0027t have a reason to bring any of this up again, but you\u0027re going to have to work for those questions.\" Never bring up the fact that they were aliens? Ha. Okay. \"What do I have to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meet me on the rock.\" He turned back to the lake and kicked off his shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I\u0027m not wearing a bathing suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" He turned around, grinning. \"You could almost strip down - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not going to happen.\" I folded my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figured,\" he replied. \"Haven\u0027t you ever gone swimming in your clothes before?\" Yes. Who hadn\u0027t? But it wasn\u0027t even that warm. \"Why do we have to go swimming for me to ask questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stared at me a moment, then his lashes lowered, fanning his cheeks. \"It\u0027s not for you, but for me. It seems like a normal thing to do.\" The tips of his cheekbones turned pink in the sun. \"The day we went swimming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, taking a step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up, his eyes meeting mine. The green churned slowly, giving an appearance of vulnerability. \"Did you have fun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you weren\u0027t being a jerk and if I ignore the fact that you were bribed into it, then yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile pulled at his lips as he looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had more fun that day than I can remember. I know it sounds stupid, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not stupid.\" My heart lurched. At once, I sort of understood him better. Underneath it all, I think he wanted to be normal. \"Okay. Let\u0027s do this. Just don\u0027t go underwater for five minutes.\" Daemon laughed. \"Deal.\" I kicked off my sandals while he tugged off his shirt. I tried not to stare at him, especially since he was watching me like he expected me to change my mind. Tossing him a quick grin, I stepped up to the water\u0027s edge and dipped my toes in. \"Oh my god, the water is cold!\" He winked at me. \"Watch this.\" His eyes took on that eerie glow, his whole body vibrating and breaking apart into a fiery ball of light...that flew up into the sky and dove straight in, lighting the lake like a pool light. He zipped around and around the rocks in the center, at least a dozen times in as many seconds. Show-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alien powers?\" I asked, teeth chattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater ran off his hair as he leaned over the edge of the rock, extending a hand. \"Come in, it\u0027s a little warmer now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGritting my teeth in preparation for the icy water, I was shocked to discover its temperature wasn\u0027t too bad. It wasn\u0027t warm, but it wasn\u0027t icy cold anymore. Stepping all the way in now, I waded out to the rocks. \"Any other cool talents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can make it so that you can\u0027t even see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took his hand, and he pulled me out into the water and onto the rock, wet clothes and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go, scooting back. Shivering, I welcomed the warmth of the sun-baked rock. \"How can you do things without me seeing?\" Leaning back on his elbows, he looked unaffected by the cold swim. \"We\u0027re made of light. We can manipulate the different spectrums around us, using them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s like we\u0027re fracturing the light, if that makes any sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\" I needed to pay more attention in science class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve seen me turn into my natural state, right?\" When I nodded, he went on. \"And I sort of vibrate until I break apart into tiny particles of light. Well, I can selectively eliminate the light, which allows us to be transparent.\" I pulled my knees to my chest. \"That\u0027s kind of amazing, Daemon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled up at me, flashing a dimple in one cheek before he laid back on the rock, folding his hands behind his head. \"I know you have questions. Ask them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had so many questions I wasn\u0027t sure which one to start with. \"Do you guys believe in God?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seems like a cool guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, not sure whether to laugh at that or not. \"Did you guys have a God?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember there was something like a church, but that\u0027s all. The elders don\u0027t talk about any religion,\" he said. \"Then again, we don\u0027t see any elders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean by \u0027elders\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same thing you\u0027d mean. An old person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a face at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Next question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you such an ass?\" The words came out before I could think twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone has to excel at something, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re doing a great job.\" His eyes opened, meeting mine for a second before closing. \"You do dislike me, don\u0027t you?\" I hesitated. \"I don\u0027t dislike you, Daemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re hard to...like. It\u0027s hard to figure you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you,\" he said, eyes closed, face relaxed. \"You\u0027ve accepted the impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re kind to my sister and to me - even though I admit I\u0027ve been a jerk to you. You could\u0027ve run right out of the house yesterday and told the world about us, but you didn\u0027t. And you don\u0027t put up with any of my crap,\" he added with a soft laugh. \"I like that about you.\" Whoa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. \"You like me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next question?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you guys allowed to date people -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehumans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Allowed is a strange word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes it happen? Yes. Is it advised? No. So we can, but what would be the point? Not like we can have a lasting relationship when we have to hide what we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you guys are like us in other, uh, departments?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon sat up, arching a brow. \"Come again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my cheeks flush. \"You know, like sex?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, you guys are all glowy and stuff. I don\u0027t see how certain stuff would work.\" Daemon\u0027s lips curled into a half smile, and that was the only warning he gave. Moving unbelievably fast, I was on my back and he was above me in a flash. \"Are you asking if I\u0027m attracted to human girls?\" he asked. Dark, wet waves of hair fell forward. Tiny droplets of water fell off the ends, splashing against my cheek. \"Or are you asking if I\u0027m attracted to you?\" Using his hands, he lowered himself slowly. There wasn\u0027t an inch of space between our bodies. Air fled my lungs at the contact of his body against mine. He was male and ripped in all the places I was soft. Being this close to him was startling, causing an array of sensations to zing through me. I shivered. Not from the cold, but from how warm and wonderful he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel every breath he took, and when he shifted his hips, my eyes went wide and I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yeah, certain stuff was definitely working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon rolled off me, onto his back beside me. \"Next question?\" he asked, voice deep and thick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t move. I stared wide-eyed at the blue skies. \"You could\u0027ve just told me, you know?\" I looked at him. \"You didn\u0027t have to show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what fun would there be in telling you?\" He turned his head toward me. \"Next question, Kitten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you call me that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remind me of a little fuzzy kitten, all claws and no bite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, that makes no sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched my scattered thoughts for another question. I had so many, but he\u0027d totally blown my train of thought to smithereens. \"Do you think there are more Arum around?\" Only the barest hint of emotion flitted across his face. He tipped his head back, studying me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are always around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027re hunting you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only thing they care about.\" He returned to staring at the sky. \"Without our powers, they are like...humans, but vicious and immoral. They\u0027re into ultimate destruction and whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard. \"Have you...fought a lot of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\" He eased onto his side, using his hand to support his head. A lock of hair fell over his eye. \"I\u0027ve lost count of how many I\u0027ve faced and killed. And with you lit up like you are, more will come.\" My fingers itched to brush that strand of hair back. \"Then why did you stop the truck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you have preferred I let it pancake you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t even bother responding to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle popped in his jaw as his gaze drifted over my upturned face. \"Honestly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will it get me bonus points?\" he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding my breath, I reached up and brushed back the strand of hair. My fingers barely grazed his skin, but he sucked in a sharp breath and closed his eyes. I pulled my hand away, not sure why I\u0027d done that. \"Depends on how you answer the question.\" Daemon\u0027s eyes opened. The pupils were white, strangely beautiful. He eased down on his back again, his arm against mine. \"Next question?\" I clasped my hands together, over my stomach. \"Why does using your powers leave a trace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humans are like glow-in-the-dark T-shirts to us. When we use our abilities around you, you can\u0027t help but absorb our light. Eventually, the glow will fade, but the more we do, the more energy we use, the brighter the trace. Dee blurring out doesn\u0027t leave much of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truck incident and when I scared the bear, that leaves a visible mark. Something more powerful, like healing someone, leaves a longer trace. A faint one, nothing big so I\u0027m told, but it lingers longer for some reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should\u0027ve been more careful around you,\" he continued. \"When I scared the bear I used a blast of light, which is kind of like a laser. It left a large enough trace on you for the Arum to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the night I was attacked?\" I whispered, my voice hoarse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He dragged a hand down his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arum don\u0027t come here a lot, because they don\u0027t think any Luxen are here. The beta quartz in the Rocks throws off our energy signature, hides us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s one of the reasons why there are a lot of us here. But there must have been one coming through. He saw your trace and knew there had to be one of us nearby. It was my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t your fault. You weren\u0027t the one who attacked me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I basically led him to you,\" he said, voice tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I couldn\u0027t speak. There was this horrible punched-in-the-gut type of feeling that spread to the tips of my fingers and down to my toes. I felt the blood drain out my face so fast it left me dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, what that man had said made sense. Where are they? He\u0027d been looking for them. \"Where is he now? Is he still around? Is he going to come back? What - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon\u0027s hand found mine and squeezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kitten, calm down. You\u0027re going to have a heart attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes dropped to our hands. He didn\u0027t pull his away. \"I\u0027m not going to have a heart attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t a problem anymore,\" he said after a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You...you killed him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I kind of did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kind of did? I didn\u0027t know there was any \u0027kind of\u0027 in killing someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, yes, I did kill him.\" There wasn\u0027t a single ounce of doubt or remorse in his voice, like killing someone didn\u0027t even faze him. I should be afraid, very afraid of him. Daemon sighed. \"We\u0027re enemies, Kitten. He would\u0027ve killed me and my family after absorbing our abilities if I didn\u0027t stop him. Not only that, he would\u0027ve brought more here. Others like us would\u0027ve been in danger. You would\u0027ve been in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the truck? I\u0027m glowing brighter now.\" I ignored the clenching in my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will there be another?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hopefully there are none nearby. If not, the traces on you should fade. You\u0027ll be safe.\" He was guiding his thumb across my hand in a silent alphabet. It was sort of soothing, comforting. \"And if not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll kill them, too.\" He didn\u0027t hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For awhile, you\u0027re going to need to stay around me, until the trace fades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dee said something like that.\" I bit my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t want me to stay away from you guys anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter what I want.\" He glanced down at his hand. \"But if I had my way, you wouldn\u0027t be anywhere near us.\" I sucked in a sharp breath, pulling my hand free. \"Gee, don\u0027t be honest or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand,\" Daemon replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now, you can lead an Arum right to my sister. And I have to protect her. She\u0027s all I have left. And I have to protect the others here. I\u0027m the strongest. That is what I do. And while you\u0027re carrying the trace on you, I don\u0027t want you going anywhere with Dee if I\u0027m not with you.\" Sitting up, I glanced toward the shore. \"I think it\u0027s time I head back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers wrapped around my arm. The skin tingled. \"Right now, you can\u0027t be out there by yourself. I need to be with you until the trace fades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need you to play babysitter.\" My jaw ached from how hard I was clenching it. The whole staying away from Dee pissed me off, but I understood. Doesn\u0027t mean his words didn\u0027t hurt. \"I\u0027ll stay away from Dee until it fades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still not getting it.\" His grip didn\u0027t tighten, but I had a feeling he wanted to shake the crap out of me even though I knew he never would. \"If an Arum gets ahold of you, they aren\u0027t going to kill you. The one at the library -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe was playing with you. He was going to get you to the point that you\u0027d beg for your life and then force you to take him back to one of us.\" I swallowed. \"Daemon - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have a choice. Right now, you\u0027re a huge risk with the trace. You are a danger to my sister. I will not let anything happen to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis love for his sister was admirable, but did nothing to stop the flow of anger rushing through my veins. \"And then after the trace fades? Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I prefer that you\u0027d stay the hell away from all of us, but I doubt that\u0027s going to happen. And my sister does care for you.\" He let go of my arm and leaned back, resting on his elbows. \"As long as you don\u0027t end up with another trace, then I don\u0027t have a problem with you being friends with her.\" My hands balled into fists. \"I\u0027m so grateful to have your approval.\" His little half smile didn\u0027t reach his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smiles rarely did. \"I\u0027ve already lost one sibling because of how he felt for a human. I\u0027m not going to lose another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger was still simmering in me, but his words caught my attention. \"You\u0027re talking about your brother and Bethany.\" There was a pause and then, \"My brother fell in love with a human...and now they\u0027re both dead.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsidian-lux-1/page-18.html","bookId":2165,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:30 PM"}
