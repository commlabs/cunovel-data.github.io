It took like an hour to clean up all the broken glass and ash and stuff from the night before. We had just finished cleaning and counting the money and making out and whatnot when the alarm went off on the Countess\u0027s watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was like, \"Dude, I\u0027m not ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was all, \"Dude, you are more ready than anyone I\u0027ve ever known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was all, \"OMG, I am so going to sex you to death if we live through this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he was all bashful and pretended to be doing something technical so we were ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, like an hour after sundown, I heard them coming. I was at the kitchen counter when the security door downstairs opened, and when I turned around they were just, like there. Lord Flood called them the Animals, but now they were kind of the roadkill. And I like touched the snap on my UV jacket, just to make sure it was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I was all, \"Hey, vampyre scum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the formerly black and now gray one, who was like their leader, was all up in my grille, like, \"We need the money, where is the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was like, \"Step off, undead-tard. There\u0027s no money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was like, \"Don\u0027t fuck with us. Flood and the redhead took like six hundred grand from my apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was all, \"Actually, its like five hundred and eighty-three thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was all, \"Give it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all seven of them were like gathering around me - even the born-again one the Countess had thrashed - like they were going to do the massive gang-suck on me, so I had my finger on my light button all the time, in case I needed to flash-fry the motherfuckers. But I stayed chilly and I was like, \"Are you high?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was all, \"No, I\u0027m not high. No one is high.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they all started whining and whatnot, all, \"We can\u0027t even take a bong hit. We can\u0027t drink a beer. Our systems won\u0027t take it. Being sober sucks. We are useless undead stoners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I was all, \"Step back and behold, bi-atches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m all taking a bottle of Stoli out of the freezer, and mixing in a glass with some of the blood from the pouches, just like the ones we left for the Countess and Lord Flood, and they\u0027re all drooling when they see the blood, so I was thinking, Dont\u0027 make me fry you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I give the glass to the gray vamp, and he\u0027s all, \"Sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the others are like, \"Me, me, me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0027m like mixing Bloody Marys all around, and the greasy hippyish one is like, \"Can we dunk pot cookies in this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m like, \"Of course, stoner vamp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they\u0027re all, \"You are a goddess. And we are not worthy. And oh please, may we have some more?\" Until they started to drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo like two minutes later there\u0027s like this big pile of passed-out vampyres in the kitchen, and I\u0027m all, \"Yo, Foo, I got your shit ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Foo comes out of the bedroom, all cute, holding his UV floodlight like he\u0027s going to save me, then sees that they are all out cold and gives me a big kiss and is like, \"You rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m like, \"You have no idea, my Manga-haired love toy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was like, \"The sedative in the blood, blah, blah, four hours, blah, blah, nerdspeak, geektalk - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m like, \"Whateva, studmumn. Handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it took like two hours for Foo to do all his medical stuff with the Animals, taking some blood and doing various medical nerdism stuff to it, then putting it back in, but finally he was done and I called Jared to tell him that we were on our way to get Lord Flood and the Countess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I like made the other call to make sure everything was all in order and whatnot, and Foo was all, \"Are you sure this is what you want to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was all, \"Foo, theirs is the greatest love of all time. It\u0027s the only thing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was all, \"Okay, as long as you\u0027re sure. Because we can do them the same as we did the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was all, \"No, that won\u0027t work. They have to be together. And you don\u0027t have to live at home anymore. We\u0027ll have a completely sweet love lair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue watched from the alley across the street as the Animals came out the security door, empty-handed, and stumbled into the street. She knew she should have gone herself, but that whole getting-burned-up thing had taught her that perhaps it was better to delegate. That they didn\u0027t have her money was bad enough, but that they didn\u0027t have her money and heat was coming off of them was disastrous. \"Those dumbfucks can\u0027t get anything right,\" she said to herself. \"I\u0027m going to have to kill them all over again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" said a voice from behind her. She whipped around, leading with her long fingernails in a swipe that would have taken off half a man\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElijah caught her hand. He\u0027d found another tracksuit, this one powder blue. \"It\u0027s time to let it go. The genie must go back in the bottle, I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go, I need to go get my money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my dear, you don\u0027t want to do that. The residents of that loft have recently developed a very unpleasant fashion sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re fucking with my income, paleface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need to worry about that anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ends here. Come with me, my dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to come with you? I don\u0027t even know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but we share a special relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Special? You beat my face into the hood of a Mercedes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes. Sorry. To the innocent my behavior can sometimes be distasteful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? Innocent, I\u0027ve fucked thousands of guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well, I\u0027ve killed enough to fill a city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue shrugged. \"Okay, you win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Revenge is a dish best served cold anyway, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or not at all,\" said a male voice behind Elijah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElijah and Blue turned. Three of them stood there in their long coats, looking like sculptures, looking eternal, like they could wait forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can just anyone sneak up on me now?\" said Blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time to go, Elijah,\" said the African woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of you would be here if it weren\u0027t for me,\" Elijah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and we would have been hunted down and killed a long time ago if we hadn\u0027t adhered to your rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, my rules,\" Elijah said, looking down now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many left to clean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElijah looked across the street to the loft windows, then at Blue. She raised an eyebrow, smiled a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s the only one left.\" He lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then finish it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather not,\" Elijah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor of San Francisco wept for his city. He had done what he could, called the police, alerted the newspapers, even tried to take to battle himself, but by the time he\u0027d gathered the courage to return to the Marina Safeway, it had been finished, and he could do nothing more than speculate to the uniformed police officers how the window had been broken and why the store was empty. They\u0027d tried to track down the night crew, but none of them seemed to be home. And his city was plagued by vampires. Now the Emperor wept and consoled the troops, rubbing Bummer behind the ears and gently patting Lazarus on the ribs as he lay sleeping on the dock. The fog was coming slow off the Bay tonight, not windblown like it was so often here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard footsteps before he saw them, then there were five of them. The fiend, the three in the long coats he had seen come in the night before, and a blond woman in a blue party dress. They walked past, and only the fiend turned and paused. The Emperor held Bummer tight, afraid that he would burst into one of his barking fits and all would be lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old man,\" said Elijah. \"The City is yours again.\" Then he joined the others at the end of the dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor could see their motor yacht waiting outside the breakwater - it had to be two hundred feet long, far too big to enter the marina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, then, shall we go?\" said Elijah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get a coat like that?\" asked Blue, nodding toward the tall blond man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond man said, \"You\u0027ll get one when you learn the secret handshake and get your decoder ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue looked at Elijah. \"Is he fuckin\u0027 with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Elijah. He offered her his arm. She took it, and stepped down into the longboat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor watched the vampires disappear into the fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera had six uniforms in SWAT gear with a battering ram ready to take down the door, so he and Cavuto were more than somewhat surprised when it opened almost as soon as they knocked. A shirtless, sleepy-looking Chinese guy with spiky hair stood in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera held up the warrant. \"I have a warrant to search this apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Kay,\" said the Chinese guy. \"Abby, cops are here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skinny broken clown girl appeared at the top of the stairs in a kimono.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, cops,\" said Abby Normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" Rivera said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I live here, cop.\" She popped the p. Rivera hated that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, it\u0027s my apartment,\" said the Chinese guy. \"Do you need to see ID?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that would be nice, kid,\" said Cavuto. He whipped the kid around and marched him up the stairs as the kid read the warrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not bruise the Foo, cop,\" said the broken clown girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera turned to the uniforms and shrugged apologetically. \"Sorry, guys, I guess we got this one.\" They shuffled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you guys looking for?\" asked the Chinese kid. \"Maybe we could speed this up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re looking for Thomas Flood and Jody Stroud. He\u0027s the one on the lease for this apartment and the one down the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah. I\u0027m subletting,\" said the Chinese kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steven Wong,\" Cavuto read off the kid\u0027s license.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera was feeling very, very bad about this. They had found one more body in the Mission with the blood-loss-and-broken-neck MO - the guy had been naked, supposedly someone had stolen his powder-blue tracksuit, so they logged it as robbery, but then, a week ago, the killings stopped. That didn\u0027t mean it was over. He\u0027d made the mistake of thinking it was over with these two before. Rivera had finally gotten the Christian kid at the Safeway to file charges on the redhead for assault. After a long talk with the other stoners, they\u0027d gotten the Flood kid on the arrest warrant for conspiracy. They\u0027d also implied that somehow Flood and the redhead had gotten their share of the old vampire\u0027s money. Maybe they had left town. If they had, well, good, but he still had a slew of unsolved murders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re subletting from Thomas Flood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never met him, actually,\" said Steve. \"We arranged it through the rental agent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, so step off, cop,\" said the skinny girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivera looked around the apartment. There was no need to tear the place apart. Obviously everything in here was new. Mostly decorated in Pier 1 Imports cheap wicker motif and some punky Urban Outfitter flair, which he guessed was the input of the creepy little girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bronze sculptures were out of character, though. A life-sized nude of a young woman, a large snapping turtle, and a life-sized bronze of a couple posed as if in Rodin\u0027s The Kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These must have been expensive,\" Rivera said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. I know the artists,\" the Chinese kid said. \"Some biker guys down the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Foo\u0027s in biotech,\" said the broken clown girl. \"He makes like stupid money, cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s swell,\" said Rivera. He\u0027d watched this neighborhood turn from a rust slum of repair shops and the odd ethnic restaurant to a gentrified hive of hipster professionals in remodeled lofts during the dot-com boom, and it had never turned back. The whole neighborhood was full of kids who spent the equivalent of Rivera\u0027s annual salary on a car they wouldn\u0027t drive a dozen times a year. This kid apparently was just another one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t know these people?\" Rivera said, pointing to the warrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven Wong shook his head. \"Sorry, I\u0027ve never met them. I send my rent directly to the rental agency. You might check with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay then. Sorry to bother you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay then?\" Cavuto said. \"That\u0027s it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not here, Nick. These two don\u0027t know where they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, that\u0027s not enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? You want to spend some time talking to Allison here, see what you can find out?\" Rivera nodded toward the broken clown girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCavuto had tried to keep someone between himself and the skinny girl since they\u0027d come upstairs, but now he looked at her full on and shuddered. \"No, I guess that\u0027s it.\" He turned and lumbered down the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to check your girlfriend\u0027s ID,\" Rivera said to Steve. \"You may not be old enough for her.\" Then he turned and left as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chill, Foo,\" Abby said. \"They\u0027re gone. They won\u0027t be back. Let\u0027s go shopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abby, are you sure about this? It seems cruel.\" He patted the life-sized sculpture of the couple embraced in a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard the Countess say once that it was like being in a dream. They just sort of float, all peaceful and dreamy. The main thing is they\u0027re together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Theirs is the greatest love of all time. It would be wrong for them to be apart, Foo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think we should just change them back. Now that we know the process works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Countess doesn\u0027t want that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can it be wrong? It\u0027s my idea, and I am their dedicated minion and whatnot. I control the dark.\" She ran and jumped into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you do,\" he said. \"Okay, let\u0027s go shopping for stuff for our most fly apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam arrived back at the loft just after dark, feeling very much rested and well fed from his hospital stay, but craving a sip or two of the good stuff, and terribly worried about Chet. He let himself into the stairway with his key, but when he rang the bell, no one answered, so he sat down to wait for the redhead and that guy to bring his bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been there ten minutes before he heard the meowing at the door, and his heart leapt as he opened the outer door to find Chet, his red sweater still intact, purring outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, boy. I missed you, buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam scooped up his kitty and carried him into the stairwell. As soon as the door closed, Chet, the huge shaved vampire cat, was upon him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/you-suck-a-love-story-a-love-story-2/page-18.html","bookId":2052,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:52:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:52:00 PM"}
