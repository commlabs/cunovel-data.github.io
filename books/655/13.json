But on Sunday afternoon he goes walk-a-walk-a with Daddy (but they take Mamma too!), and then he has on his white sailor suit, and his white stockings and red shoes. Aunt Kitty brought him the shoes, and when they came there was a china cat inside one, and a tin frog inside the other. They were surprises, the cat and the frog; Aunt Kitty likes to give surprises.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well! one Sunday morning Mamma and Daddy were going to church, and Maggie was very busy, so she put Johnny in the sand box, and told him[47] to play like a good boy, and he did. He made two forts, one with the red tin pail and one with the blue tin pail; and then he hammered on them with the old kitchen spoon and said, “Bang! bang! bang!” and that made a battle. While he was having the battle, the Boy Over the Fence came and looked through the pickets, and said, “Hurnh! I’ve got new shoes on!” Johnny looked, and he had; new brown shoes, that tied in front. So Johnny said: “I have new shoes too, only they are not on; they are up-stairs, and they are red.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They ain’t!” said the Boy Over the Fence. He was not a very nice boy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cimg width\u003d\"413\" height\u003d\"620\" src\u003d\"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201609/21/13-34-07-80-1.jpg\" alt\u003d\"\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e “HE HELD THEM UP SO THAT THE BOY OVER THE FENCE COULD SEE THEM.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They are!” said Johnny. “Bright red, with wankle buttons. Aunt Kitty bringed them, and there was a cat in one, and a frog in the other, and they were s’prises. And white stockings too, so there!” Then he stopped, for he was out of breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hurnh!” said the Boy Over the Fence. “Let’s see ’em!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Johnny trotted up the back stairs and brought down the white stockings and the red shoes; they were laid out on the chair, with the white suit, all ready for him to put on. He held them up so that the Boy Over the Fence could see them, and said, “So there!” again; it was all he could think of to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the Boy Over the Fence said, “Hurnh!” again, as if that was all he could think of to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just then Maggie opened the kitchen door and said: “Come in this minute of time, Johnny boy, and get your luncheon! see the nice cracker and the lovely mug of milk Maggie has for ye!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [49]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Johnny was hungry, and he dropped the red shoes and white stockings and ran in to have his luncheon. While he was eating it, Maggie told him the story of the Little Rid Hin; (Mamma says it is “Red Hen,” really, but Maggie always says it the other way, and Johnny likes it better); and then she said it was time for his nap, and she whisked him up-stairs and tucked him up in his crib and told him to go to sleep like a good boy, and he went.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By and by he woke up, and Mamma came in to dress him for dinner. She washed his face and hands, and brushed his hair, and put on his white sailor suit; and then she said, “Why, where ever are the shoes and stockings?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked under the chair, and on the bureau, and under the bed. “Johnny,” she said, “I cannot find your red shoes and white stockings. I put them here with your suit, and now they are gone.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh!” said Johnny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [50]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do you know where they are, dear?” asked Mamma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh!” said Johnny again. “I think—they are in—the sand box!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “In the sand box!” said Mamma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The Boy Over the Fence said they wasn’t red,” said Johnny; “and they was, and I gotted them and showed him, and then Maggie called me, and—and—I think that is all I know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My goodness!” said Mamma. And she ran down-stairs and out into the yard to the sand box. But no red shoes or white stockings were there. Mamma looked all about carefully. There was the red tin pail, and the blue tin pail, both turned upside down, and the old kitchen spoon laid across them. And there were the marks of Johnny’s moccasins, and—oh! there were the marks of another pair of shoes, a little bigger than Johnny’s, with heels to them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My goodness!” said Mamma. “You don’t[51] suppose—” but she did not say what you didn’t suppose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked over toward the next yard. There was no one there, but there were muddy footmarks leading from the fence to the sand box, and sandy footmarks leading back from the sand box to the fence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now,” said Mamma, “I am afraid—” but she did not say what she was afraid of.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just as she was stepping out of the sand box, her foot struck against the red tin pail and knocked it over; and—what do you think? Inside of the pail was one red shoe and one white stocking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My goodness!” said Mamma again. Then she turned over the blue tin pail, and there was the other red shoe and the other white stocking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mamma looked very severely over the fence, but no one was there; so she took the shoes and stockings up-stairs and showed them to Johnny. “Oh!” said Johnny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [52]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She told him where she had found them; and then she put them away in the drawer, and brought out Johnny’s old brown moccasins and a pair of rather old brown stockings. “You shall wear these to-day!” said Mamma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But why?” said Johnny. “I like my red shoes and white stockings best.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But you took them out and left them in the sand box!” said Mamma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But I did forget!” said Johnny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But this will help you to remember!” said Mamma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And it did.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1643/48575.html","bookId":655,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:41:03 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:41:03 AM"}
