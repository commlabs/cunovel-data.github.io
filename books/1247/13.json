{"id":13125,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII \"Getting on with It\"","content":"For some moments Burgoyne was completely dumbfounded. He could form no satisfactory reason for the Old Man\u0027s emphatic decision, unless Captain Blair was labouring under a delusion owing to a hitherto unsuspected mental trouble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It seemed incredible that Alwyn\u0027s carefully-thought-out plans and careful preparations (although the latter were only in the initial stages) should have been drastically turned down, especially as they had met with the approval and gained the co-operation of every other surviving officer of the Donibristle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Burgoyne uttered no word of protest. It was not for him to reason why—at least audibly. His sense of duty—impressed upon him from his early days of Osborne—had taught him to receive and carry out orders unquestioningly. So he held his peace and waited.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose you\u0027d like my reasons for the decision, Mr. Burgoyne?\" asked the Old Man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would, sir, if you have no objection.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not in the least,\" rejoined the skipper. \"The chief one is that there is no immediate necessity for you to take this step. As things go we have nothing much to complain about.\" (\"Exactly what Miss Vivian said,\" thought the Third Officer.) \"It is reasonable to assume that Porfirio cannot carry on for long, and release will come possibly long before you could reach the Marshall Islands. It\u0027s a tremendous voyage for an open boat, and the results gained, if any, would not justify the risk. Then, again, there\u0027s the question of reprisals. The pirates would miss the boat and draw perfectly logical conclusions. They would revenge themselves on those who would be still in their power, even to the extent of committing cold-blooded murder. No doubt you think I\u0027m a bit in a blue funk, but I have the advantage of years, and that has taught me to look ahead and not wait till I see a rock under my bows. However, I don\u0027t want to moralize. I hope you see my point?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir,\" replied Alwyn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"However,\" continued the Old Man briskly, \"there\u0027s no reason why you shouldn\u0027t carry on with your preparations. If occasion should arise for someone to leave the island in a hurry, it is as well to be ready for the emergency. But, until occasion does arise, it is folly to precipitate matters, and deliberately seek the path of a typhoon when we are bowling along before a steady breeze. By the by, what has that wash-out Miles been doing?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He was placed in Mr. Branscombe\u0027s party working on board the Donibristle, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"H\u0027m. I\u0027ll tell Branscombe to keep a pretty sharp eye on him. Captain Davis informs me that Miles seems rather fond of that ruffian Strogoff.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that so?\" remarked Alwyn. \"I was under the impression that Strogoff was sent on board the Malfilio.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He was aboard the old Donibristle yesterday, at any rate,\" declared the skipper. \"Miles knows about Miss Vivian, and, although I cannot say definitely, I think he\u0027s the sort of man who wouldn\u0027t hesitate to give the show away if he could make his own case good.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The seriousness of Captain Blair\u0027s words took Burgoyne aback. The Third Officer remembered that little incident of the chocolate. It was but a straw that showed the direction of the wind. Miles had proved himself to be a man of no moral fibre. To what depths would he descend to obtain consideration from the villainous Strogoff?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is why you wanted the boat held in readiness, sir,\" he asked. \"To remove Miss Vivian from the island in the event of discovery?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ve hit it, Mr. Burgoyne. The sooner the preparations are completed the better; but, of course, there may be no necessity for them. I quite agree with you that Minalto is the right man for the job, with you in charge of the boat.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And Colonel Vivian.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He won\u0027t be going,\" declared the skipper. \"I pointed out to him the almost unsurmountable disadvantages of having a cripple in the boat. His health, too, isn\u0027t at all good. He quite saw the force of my contention.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We are speaking, sir, as if the lifeboat were already in our possession.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aye,\" rejoined the Old Man. \"It\u0027s a rough proposition, Mr. Burgoyne, but from what you\u0027ve told me the task is not beyond your ingenuity.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That night Burgoyne carefully revised the altered situation. The perplexing factor in the case was the uncertainty of the time when the boat might be required. He could not completely grasp the meaning of Captain Blair\u0027s decision to refrain from action until Miss Vivian was in immediate danger. It was obvious that the boat must be seized, taken to the western side of the harbour, and provisioned all within a few hours, and be out of sight before dawn. There wasn\u0027t the faintest hope of being able to conceal the boat for several days prior to the dash for freedom. The mere fact that the lifeboat had been removed from the beach would be sufficient to put the pirates on the qui vive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And, again, although a fair amount of provisions had been set aside to victual the boat, nothing had yet been done to hide them in the cave. Neither had any of the people in the secret been able to obtain a receptacle of any description to carry water, and fresh water was indispensable for the voyage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nor had the cave been explored. Branscombe had collected enough rope to make a three-inch hawser of two hundred and fifty feet in length, more than sufficient to reach from the top of the cliff to the beach, but the actual descent had not yet been attempted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clearly a stupendous task confronted Burgoyne. Much had been accomplished, but more remained to be done in secrecy and with dispatch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the following morning Burgoyne rejoined his working-party. Fernando, the half-caste who had succeeded Black Strogoff as overseer-in-chief to the prisoners, nodded and made some remark. The words being Spanish, Alwyn failed to understand them, but evidently they were of a complimentary nature.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before the working-party arrived upon the scene of operations, one of the men who had done a good deal of voyaging on the South American coast explained that Se?or Fernando was delighted that Perez —Burgoyne\u0027s late opponent—had been vanquished. There was no love lost between Fernando and the late leading gun-layer of the Malfilio.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The work of unloading the Donibristle\u0027s cargo had been completed, but most of her stores were taken on board the Kittiwake. It was obviously the intention of the pirates to keep the latter vessel in a seaworthy condition, since she had not been stripped as in the case of the other prizes. In addition, a wireless operator, a German with a knowledge of four or five languages, was constantly on duty on board the Kittiwake. He merely \"caught\" and reported radios from vessels within range of the apparatus, making no attempt to transmit, lest the source of origin might be located.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Instead of being ordered to man the crane, Burgoyne\u0027s party were marched through the tunnel down to the beach. Here they \"stood easy\", while a number of the Malfilio\u0027s crew launched and loaded a boat, placing a number of explosive charges into the stern-sheets. The pirates then pushed off and made for the Donibristle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently the reason for the unusual \"stand easy\" became apparent. Pablo Henriques, being unable to give intelligible orders in English, had reluctantly been compelled to bring Black Strogoff upon the scene.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the next three hours the captives were kept hard at it, laying out anchors in the centre of the deep channel, until a continuous line of warping buoys was laid from the Donibristle\u0027s berth to the entrance to the enclosed harbour. It was heavy and exacting work handling those anchors, weighing anything between five and nine hundredweight. A hitch in the operations, or the slightest lubberly work, might easily result in the capsizing of one of the boats, and more than likely the loss of several of her crew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This task completed, the men expected a respite. They got none. Instead, Black Strogoff ordered them to take other anchors and place them on either side of the narrow channel turning southward between the island and the long narrow mass of rock that protected the entrance to the harbour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fortunately the water inside the lagoon was as smooth as a mill-pond, and by \"knocking-off time\" six pairs of anchors were in position, \"backed\" by pickets and crowbars. Each pair of anchors was connected by cables, buoyed in the centre of the span.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Still \"in the dark\" as to the reason for this strenuous labour, Burgoyne returned with his party to the compound. Three of the men walked back with severe physical discomfort, apparently suffering from what is popularly known as a stiff knee. Within five minutes after they were dismissed they were all right again—and Burgoyne had added three useful crow-bars to the steadily accumulating stock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Literally speaking, Burgoyne had returned empty-handed. Metaphorically he had not; for, strapped to the small of his back was a flat pulley of the \"snatch-block\" type, with a sheave capable of taking a three-inch rope.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All this was attended by great risk to the parties concerned. Although the systematic search to which the prisoners were at first subjected had been discontinued, the pirate guards occasionally went to the length of ordering some of the captives aside; but fortunately the greatly desired articles were smuggled into the compound without detection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During the day Captain Blair had not been idle. Although \"fit for duty\" he had remained in the compound with the idea of obtaining a greatly-needed water-barrel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Directly the working-parties had cleared off, the Old Man, armed with an axe that had been issued to the \"galley\", made his way to the spring that supplied the prisoners with fresh water. There was not a large supply, although the flow was fairly constant, and in order to ensure that a sufficient quantity should always be on hand, a large cask with the head knocked off had been sunk in the sand to catch the trickle of water from the spring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cautiously, so as not permanently to injure the cask, Captain Blair removed three of the hoops and \"started\" some of the closely-fitting staves. Then, wedging the openings with pebbles, he brought the \"chine\" back into position and replaced the chine-hoop. When the sand was replaced around the barrel, it appeared to be intact though utterly leaky.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His next step was to go to the wicket-gate and report the lack of fresh water to Se?or Fernando.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The latter inspected the faulty cask, and by a smattering of English, aided by signs, told the skipper to get another cask from the cooperage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Delighted with the way in which his little \"stunt\" was panning out, Captain Blair ordered the steward and Twill to accompany him. Escorted by Fernando the three men passed through the wicket-gate without difficulty, and proceeded to the store where spare casks and barricoes were kept.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door of the cooperage was open, as was the case with most buildings containing articles of bulk and of no great value, although everything was carefully locked after working hours. Fernando was smoking the inevitable cigarette, and, since Ramon Porfirio\u0027s instructions against smoking in wooden buildings were very exact, he remained outside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It did not take the Old Man long to choose a suitable cask. Into it he placed two barricoes, each capable of holding twelve gallons of water, and jammed them tightly against the bottom of the cask. The head of the latter was then deftly replaced and Captain Blair and his two assistants rolled their prize into the open.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With perspiration oozing from every pore, Barnes and Twill propelled the cask to the gate of the compound. Here Fernando left them, and the guard, taking it for granted that no search was necessary, since the prisoners were escorted, made no attempt to examine the seemingly empty barrel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Under the lee of the cook-house the skipper removed the barricoes and carried them into his quarters. An hour later the prisoner\u0027s water-supply was again normal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the Old Man\u0027s triumph was short-lived. The unexpected and dramatic appearance of the Chinese store-house man, Li Whong, accompanied by a couple of armed pirates, completely took the wind out of his sails.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In pidgin English Li forcibly demanded the return of the barricoes. Vainly Captain Blair tried to explain that he had taken the water-barrels with the idea of saving numerous journeys to the spring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Old Man had to surrender his hard won trophies, and received an admonitory kick from the Chink into the bargain. No wonder, then, he was \"fed up to the back teeth\" when Burgoyne returned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rough luck, sir,\" sympathized Alwyn. \"Wonder how that Chink got wind of it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dashed if I know,\" replied Captain Blair. \"It only shows we\u0027ll have to be most careful. Do you think it safe to carry out your investigations to-night?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think so, sir,\" said Burgoyne. \"For one thing, there\u0027s no moon and the tide\u0027s favourable.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The tide!\" exclaimed the Old Man. \"What\u0027s the tide got to do with it? There\u0027s always a beach above high-water mark down there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Quite so, sir,\" agreed the Third Officer. \"But I want to explore the whole extent of the bay to see if there\u0027s a practicable means of ascent on the other side of the fence. As the tide\u0027s falling, I can keep below high-water mark, and the flood tide will wipe out my footprints.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That didn\u0027t occur to me,\" admitted Captain Blair. \"Well, good luck, and may you fare better than I did.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1610/47709.html","bookId":1247,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:12:13 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:12:13 AM"}
