Hodge helped himself to more coffee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wonder what happened to them afterward,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Does it matter?” said Penfield. “When an emotional problem is solved, the others become unreal.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You don’t consider poverty a real problem?” asked McCall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Only in a social and relative sense. Go look at the natives in the hill-country of any Latin-American state. They live on rice, beans and fifteen cents a day, and remain quite happy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hodge said; “I agree that poverty is a minor matter in this particular case. But it seems to me that you’re assuming too much when you speak of the emotional problem of that couple as solved. It’s not like a sum in arithmetic, with a simple answer in definite figures. There are all sorts of sub- and side-problems involved, to which no definite values can be assigned. For instance, isn’t the memory of the girl, Leece, together with one of Lalette’s outbursts of temper, going to produce an explosive mixture at some point? And aren’t they keeping a good deal from each other?”\n\u003cbr\u003e 423\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Penfield’s long face was thoughtful. “There are secrets in the background of every union,” he said. “Even secrets as black as the murder by witchcraft, and as inexplicable as the failure and recovery of the Blue Star. But it seems to me that they are like the disagreements of parties in a politically stable state. Once the essential agreement to abide has been reached, any difficulties can be resolved or compromised. Another thing—these people have a capacity for . . . well, close attunement to each other. More of it than we have. What puzzles me—” he took a pull at his cigarette “—is a certain preoccupation with sex.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McCall laughed. “Since it was the product of all three of us, that probably came out of Hodge’s mind somehow. Persons of your age and mine . . .”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hodge said; “I don’t know where it came from, but I think I can explain it. It goes with religion, which is so often an outgrowth of sex—or a substitute for it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What really interests me,” said McCall, “is what happened in a political sense.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, the short-range developments seem fairly obvious,” said Penfield, “and long-range ones are always unpredictable.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wonder if it really exists,” said Hodge, as Penfield had the night before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Penfield got up, went to the window, and looked out at the scudding clouds. “I wonder if we do,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe End\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2059/58611.html","bookId":569,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:09:20 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:09:20 AM"}
