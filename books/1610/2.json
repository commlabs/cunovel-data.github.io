I couldn\u0027t see the New Girl. Sid was at last getting to the New Boy after the fuss about Mark. He threw a sign and I started over with Erich in tow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome, sweet lad. Sidney Lessingham\u0027s your host, and a fellow Englishman. Born in King\u0027s Lynn, 1564, schooled at Cambridge, but London was the life and death of me, though I outlasted Bessie, Jimmie, Charlie, and Ollie almost. And what a life! By turns a clerk, a spy, a bawd\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the two trades are hand in glove\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a poet of no account, a beggar, and a peddler of resurrection tracts. Beau Lassiter, our throats are tinder!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the word \"poet,\" the New Boy looked up, but \u0027resentfully, as if he had been tricked into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to spare your throat for drinking, sweet gallant, I\u0027ll be so bold as to guess and answer one of your questions,\" Sid rattled on. \"Yes, I knew Will Shakespeare\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;we were of an age\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and he was such a modest, mind-your-business rogue that we all wondered whether he really did write those plays. Your pardon, faith, but that scratch might be looked to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I saw that the New Girl hadn\u0027t lost her head, but gone to Surgery (Ugh!) for a first-aid tray. She reached a swab toward the New Boy\u0027s sticky cheek, saying rather shrilly, \"If I might . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer timing was bad. Sid\u0027s last words and Erich\u0027s approach had darkened the look in the young Soldier\u0027s face and he angrily swept her arm aside without even glancing at her. Erich squeezed my arm. The tray clattered to the floor\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and one of the drinks that Beau was bringing almost followed it. Ever since the New Girl\u0027s arrival, Beau had been figuring that she was his responsibility, though I don\u0027t think the two of them had reached an agreement yet. Beau was especially set on it because I was thick with Sid at the time and Maud with Doc, she loving tough cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy now, lad, and you love me!\" Sid thundered, again shooting Beau the \"Hold it\" look. \"She\u0027s just a poor pagan trying to comfort you. Swallow your bile, you black villain, and perchance it will turn to poetry. Ah, did I touch you there? Confess, you are a poet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere isn\u0027t much gets by Sid, though for a second I forgot my psychology and wondered if he knew what he was doing with his insights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m a poet, all right,\" the New Boy roared. \"I\u0027m Bruce Marchant, you bloody Zombies. I\u0027m a poet in a world where even the lines of the King James and your precious Will whom you use for laughs aren\u0027t safe from Snakes\u0027 slime and the Spiders\u0027 dirty legs. Changing our history, stealing our certainties, claiming to be so blasted all-knowing and best intentioned and efficient, and what does it lead to? This bloody SI glove!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his black-gloved left hand which still held the mate and he shook it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with the Spider Issue gauntlet, heart of gold?\" Sid demanded. \"And you love us, tell us.\" While Erich laughed, \"Consider yourself lucky, Kamerad. Mark and I didn\u0027t draw any gloves at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with it?\" Bruce yelled. \"The bloody things are both lefts!\" He slammed it down on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are howled, we couldn\u0027t help it. He turned his back on us and stamped off, though I guessed he would keep out of the Void. Erich squeezed my arm and said between gasps, \"Mein Gott, Liebchen, what have I always told you about Soldiers? The bigger the gripe, the smaller the cause! It is infallible!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of us didn\u0027t laugh. Ever since the New Girl heard the name Bruce Merchant, she\u0027d had a look In her eyes like she\u0027d been given the sacrament. I was glad she\u0027d got interested in something, because she\u0027d been pretty much of a snoot and a wet blanket up until now, although she\u0027d come to the Place with the recommendation of having been a real whoopee girl in London and New York in the Twenties. She looked disapprovingly at us as she gathered up the tray and stuff, not forgetting the glove, which she placed on the center of the tray like a holy relic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeau cut over and tried to talk to her, but she ghosted past him and once again he couldn\u0027t do anything because of the tray in his hands. He came over and got rid of the drinks quick. I took a big gulp right away because I saw the New Girl stepping through the screen into Surgery and I hate to be reminded we have it and I\u0027m glad Doc is too drunk to use it, some of the Arachnoid surgical techniques being very sickening as I know only too well from a personal experience that is number one on my list of things to be forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy that time, Bruce had come back to us, saying in a carefully hard voice, \"Look here, it\u0027s not the dashed glove itself, as you very well know, you howling Demons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it then, noble heart?\" Sid asked, his grizzled gold beard heightening the effect of innocent receptivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the principle of the thing,\" Bruce said, looking around sharply, but none of us cracked a smile. \"It\u0027s this mucking inefficiency and death of the cosmos\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and don\u0027t tell me that isn\u0027t in the cards!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;masquerading as benign omniscient authority. The Spiders\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and we don\u0027t know who they are ultimately; it\u0027s just a name; we see only agents like ourselves\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the Spiders pluck us from the quiet graves of our lif elines\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that bad, lad?\" Sid murmured, innocently straightfaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and Resurrect us if they can and then tell us we must fight another time-traveling power called the Snakes\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;just a name, too\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;which is bent on perverting and enslaving the whole cosmos, past, present and future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And isn\u0027t it, lad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before we\u0027re properly awake, we\u0027re Recruited into the Big Time and hustled into tunnels and burrows outside our space-time, these miserable closets, gray sacks, puss pockets\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;no offense to this Place\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that the Spiders have created, maybe by gigantic implosions, but no one knows for certain, and then we\u0027re sent off on all sorts of missions into the past and future to change history in ways that are supposed to thwart the Snakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, lad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And from then on, the pace is so flaming hot and heavy, the shocks come so fast, our emotions are wrenched in so many directions, our public and private metaphysics distorted so insanely, the deepest thread of reality we cling to tied in such bloody knots, that we never can get things straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve all felt that way, lad,\" Ski said soberly; Beau nodded his sleek death\u0027s head; \"You should have seen me, Kamerad, my first fifty sleeps,\" Erich put in; while I added, \"Us girl\u0027s, too, Bruce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know I\u0027ll get hardened to it, and don\u0027t think I can\u0027t. It\u0027s not that,\" Bruce said harshly. \"And I wouldn\u0027t mind the personal confusion, the mess it\u0027s made of my spirit, I wouldn\u0027t even mind remaking history and destroying priceless, oncecalled imperishable beauties of the past, if I felt it were for the best. The Spiders assure us that, to thwart the Snakes, it is all-important that the West ultimately defeat the East. But what have they done to achieve this? I\u0027ll give you some beautiful examples. To stabilize power in the early Mediterranean world, they have built up Crete at the expense of Greece, making Athens a ghost city, Plato a trivial fabulist, and putting all Greek culture in a minor key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got time for culture?\" I heard myself say and I clapped my hand over my mouth in gentle reproof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you remember the dialogues, lad,\" Sid observed. \"And rail not as Crete\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I have a sweet Keftian friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For how long will I remember Plato\u0027s dialogues? And who after me?\" Bruce challenged. \"Here\u0027s another. The Spiders want Rome powerful and, to date, they\u0027ve helped Rome so much that she collapses in a blaze of German and Parthian invasions a few years after the death of Julius Caesar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time it was Beau who butted in. Most everybody in the Place loves these bull sessions. \"You omit to mention, sir, that Rome\u0027s newest downfall is directly due to the Unholy Triple Alliance the Snakes have fomented between the Eastern Classical World, Mohammedanized Christianity, and Marxist Communism, trying to pass the torch of power futurewards by way of Byzantium and the Eastern Church, without ever letting it pass into the hands of the Spider West. That, sir, is the Snakes\u0027 Three-Thousand-Year Plan which we are fighting against, striving to revive Rome\u0027s glories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Striving is the word for it,\" Bruce snapped. \"Here\u0027s yet another example. To beat Russia, the Spiders kept England and America out of World War Two, thereby ensuring a German invasion of the New World and creating a Nazi empire stretching from the salt mines of Siberia to the plantations of Iowa, from Nizhni Novgorod to Kansas City!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and my short hairs prickled. Behind me, someone was chanting in a weird spiritless voice, like footsteps in hard snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Salz, Salz, bringe Salz. Kein\u0027 Peitsch\u0027, gnadige Herren. Salz, Salz, Salz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and there was Doc waltzing toward us with little tiny steps, bent over so low that the ends of his shawl touched the floor, his head crooked up sideways and looking through us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew then, but Erich translated softly. \"\u0027Salt, salt, I bring salt. No whip, merciful sirs.\u0027 He is speaking to my countrymen in their language.\" Doc had spent his last months in a Nazi-operated salt mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw us and got up, straightening his top hat very carefully. He frowned hard while my heart thumped half a dozen times. Then his face slackened, he shrugged his shoulders and muttered, \"Nichevo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it does not matter, sir,\" Beau translated, but directing his remark at Bruce. \"True, great civilizations have been dwarfed or broken by the Change War. But others, once crushed in the bud, have bloomed. In the 1870\u0027s, I traveled a Mississippi that had never known Grant\u0027s gunboats. I studied piano, languages, and the laws of chance under the greatest European masters at the University of Vicksburg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think your pipsqueak steamboat culture is compensation for\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\" Bruce began but, \"Prithee none of that, lad,\" Sid interrupted smartly. \"Nations are as equal as so many madmen or drunkards, and I\u0027ll drink dead drunk the man who disputes me. Hear reason: nations are not so puny as to shrivel and vanish at the first tampering with their past, no, nor with the tenth. Nations are monsters, boy, with guts of iron and nerves of brass. Waste not your pity on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True indeed, sir,\" Beau pressed, cooler and keener for the attack on his Greater South. \"Most of us enter the Change World with the false metaphysic that the slightest change in the past\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a grain of dust misplaced\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;will transform the whole future. It is a long while before we accept with our minds as well as our intellects the law of the Conservation of Reality: that when the past is changed, the future changes barely enough to adjust, barely enough to admit the new data. The Change Winds meet maximum resistance always. Otherwise the first operation in Babylonia would have wiped out New Orleans, Sheffield, Stuttgart, and Maud Davies\u0027 birthplace on Ganymede!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Note how the gap left by Rome\u0027s collapse was filled by the imperialistic and Christianized Germans. Only an expert Demon historian can tell the difference in most ages between the former Latin and the present Gothic Catholic Church. As you yourself, sir, said of Greece, it is as if an old melody were shifted into a slightly different key. In the wake of a Big Change, cultures and individuals are transposed, it\u0027s true, yet in the main they continue much as they were, except for the usual scattering of unfortunate but statistically meaningless accidents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, you bloody savants\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;maybe I pushed my point too far,\" Bruce growled. \"But if you want variety, give a thought to the rotten methods we use In our wonderful Change War. Poisoning Churchill and Cleopatra. Kidnapping Einstein when he\u0027s a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Snakes did it first,\" I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and we copied them. How resourceful does that make us?\" he retorted arguing like a woman. \"If we need Einstein, why don\u0027t we Resurrect him, deal with him as a man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeau said, serving his culture in slightly thicker slices, \"Pardonnez-moi, but when you have enjoyed your status as Doubleganger a soupcon longer, you will understand that great men can rarely be Resurrected. Their beings are too crystalized, sir, their lifelines too tough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon me, but I think that\u0027s rot. I believe that most great men refuse to make the bargain with the Snakes, or with us Spiders either. They scorn Resurrection at the price demanded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brother, they ain\u0027t that great,\" I whispered, while Beau glided on with, \"However that may be, you have accepted Resurrection, sir, and so incurred an obligation which you as a gentleman must honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I accepted Resurrection all right,\" Bruce said, a glare coming into his eyes. \"When they pulled me out of my line at Passchendaele in \u002717 ten minutes before I died, I grabbed at the offer of life like a drunkard grabs at a drink the morning after. But even then I thought I was also seizing a chance to undo historic wrongs, work for peace.\" His voice was getting wilder all the time. Just beyond our circle, I noticed the New Girl watching him worshipfully. \"But what did I find the Spiders wanted me for? Only to fight more wars, over and over again, make them crueler and stinkinger, cut the swath of death a little wider with each Big Change, work our way a little closer to the death of the cosmos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSid touched my wrist and, as Bruce raved on, he whispered to me, \"What kind of ball, think you, will please and so quench this fire-brained rogue? And you love me, discover it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whispered back without taking my eyes off Bruce either, \"I know somebody who\u0027ll be happy to put on any kind of ball he wants, if he\u0027ll just notice her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The New Girl, sweetling? \u0027Tis well. This rogue speaks like an angry angel. It touches my heart and I like it not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce was saying hoarsely but loudly, \"And so we\u0027re sent on operations in the past and from each of those operations the Change Winds blow futurewards, swiftly or slowly according to the opposition they breast, sometimes rippling into each other, and any one of those Winds may shift the date of our own death ahead of the date of our Resurrection, so that in an instant\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;even here, outside the cosmos\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;we may molder and rot or crumble to dust and vanish away. The wind with our name in it may leak through the Door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaces hardened at that, because it\u0027s bad form to mention Change Death, and Erich flared out with, \"Halt\u0027s Maul, Kamerad! There\u0027s always another Resurrection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Bruce didn\u0027t keep his mouth shut. He said, \"Is there? I know the Spiders promise it, but even if they do go back and cut another Doubleganger from my lifeline, is he me?\" He slapped his chest with his bare hand. \"I don\u0027t think so. And even if he Is me, with unbroken consciousness, why\u0027s he been Resurrected again? Just to refight more wars and face more Change Death for the sake of an almighty power\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\" his voice was rising to a climax\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;an almighty power so bloody ineffectual, it can\u0027t furnish one poor Soldier pulled out of the mud of Passchendaele, one miserable Change Commando, one Godforsaken Recuperee a proper issue of equipment!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he held out his bare right hand toward us, fingers spread a little, as if it were the most amazing object and most deserving of outraged sympathy in the whole world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he held out his bare right hand toward us, fingers spread a little, as if it were the most amazing object and most deserving of outraged sympathy in the whole world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New Girl\u0027s timing was perfect. She whisked through us, and before he could so much as wiggle the fingers, she whipped a black gauntleted glove on it and anyone could see that it fitted his hand perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time our laughing beat \u0027the other. We collapsed and slopped our drinks and pounded each other on the back and then started all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ach, der Handschuh, Liebchen! Where\u0027d she get it?\" Erich gasped in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably just turned the other one inside out\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that turns a left into a right\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027ve done it myself,\" I wheezed, collapsing again at the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would put the lining outside,\" he objected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"We get all sorts of junk in Stores.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter, Liebchen,\" he assured me. \"Ach, der Handschuh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll through It, Bruce just stood there admiring the glove, moving the fingers a little now and then, and the New Girl stood watching him as if he were eating a cake she\u0027d baked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the hysteria quieted down, he looked up at her with a big smile. \"What did you say your name was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lili,\" she said, and believe you me, she was Lili to me even in my thoughts from then on, for the way she\u0027d handled that lunatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lilian Foster,\" she explained. \"I\u0027m English also. Mr. Marchant, I\u0027ve read A Young Man\u0027s Fancy I don\u0027t know how many times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have? It\u0027s wretched stuff. From the Dark Ages\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I mean my Cambridge days. In the trenches, I was working up some poems that were rather better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t hear you say that. But I\u0027d be terribly thrilled to hear the new ones. Oh, Mr. Marchant, it was so strange to hear you call it Passiondale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, if I may ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because that\u0027s the way I pronounce it to myself.

All the Tommies called it Passiondale, just as they called Ypres Wipers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How interesting. You know, Mr. Marchant, I\u0027ll wager we were Recruited in the same operation, summer of 1917. I\u0027d got to France as a Red Cross nurse, but they found out my age and were going to send me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old were you\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;are you? Same thing, I mean to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventeen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventeen in \u002717,\" Bruce murmured, his blue eyes glassy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was real corny dialogue and I couldn\u0027t resent the humorous leer Erich gave me as we listened to them, as if to say, \"Ain\u0027t it nice, Liebchen, Bruce has a silly little English schoolgirl to occupy him between operations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the same, as I watched Lili in her dark bangs and pearl necklace and tight little gray dress that reached barely to her knees, and Bruce huildng over her tenderly in his snazzy hussar\u0027s rig, I knew that I was seeing the start of something that hadn\u0027t been part of me since Dave died fighting Franco years before I got on the Big Time, the sort of thing that almost made me wish there could be children in the Change World. I wondered why I\u0027d never thought of trying to work things so that Dave got Resurrected and I told myself: no, it\u0027s all changed, I\u0027ve changed, better the Change Winds don\u0027t disturb Dave or I know about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t die in 1917\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I was merely Recruited then,\" Lili was telling Bruce. \"I lived all through the Twenties, as you can see from the way I dress. But let\u0027s not talk about that, shall we? Oh, Mr. Marchant, do you think you can possibly remember any of those poems you started in the trenches? I can\u0027t fancy them bettering your sonnet that concludes with, \u0027The bough swings in the wind, the night is deep; Look at the stars, poor little ape, and sleep.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat one almost made me whoop\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what monkeys we are, I thought\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;though I\u0027d be the first to admit that the best line to use on a poet is one of his own\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;in fact as many as possible. I decided I could safely forget our little Britons and devote myself to Erich or whatever needed me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-2.html","bookId":1610,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:29 PM"}
