As for Divine Phoenix Island, they were at the very peak of all fourth-grade sects. Thus, the gap in strength between the two parties wasn’t too great. In addition, Divine Phoenix Island had also obtained the assistance of the 19 third-grade sects in the Divine Phoenix Region, as well as support from an alliance with the Five Element Region. Whether or not the South Sea Demon Region would emerge victorious was uncertain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBoth sides had their own scruples and matters to settle.

Later, the two sides would begin a complete large-scale war. The main force of the war was naturally the Xiantian and Houtian realm martial artists.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRevolving Core masters rarely fought. Even if they did, the opponent may look miserable but still be full of energy. In truth, it was an incomparably difficult task to kill the enemy. When it came to a martial artist at the level of a Revolving Core master, defeating one was easy, but completely eliminating one was another matter altogether.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe war went on for a full two and a half months without a single Revolving Core master dying.

But to geniuses, this was also a great chance. Since ancient times, the eras in which Supreme Elders and other characters like that had arisen from within the Sky Spill Continent had always been eras in which the flames of war had blazed all over.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf the young flowery geniuses never experienced and tempered themselves through the true terrors of war, they would never grow. Thus, regardless of whether it was the South Sea Demon Region or Divine Phoenix Island, they would send their core disciples to battle. Mu Dingshan, Mu Xiaoqing, and others had already gone to battle many times. Even Mu Qianyu had fought. Of course, every time she did so, she was accompanied by a Revolving Core master who would ensure her life was never in absolute danger.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………………..\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the front of the South Sea, on an island several hundred thousand miles away from Divine Phoenix Island, Mu Qianyu was standing vigilant on a beach, staring at the endless sea.

There had still been no message or news of Lin Ming, and even Mu Qianyu’s confidence began to waver with the passage of time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese days, as she stood alone, she couldn’t help but remember when she had been at the base of Thundercrash Mountain, and her experiences there with Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt had been over a year ago.

He was an extremely handsome man who held a longsword in his hand. He was Mu Qianyu’s distant cousin, Mu Qingshu, as well as the most outstanding grandson of the Vermillion Bird Faction’s Third Elder. He was 32 years old, and a half-step into the Revolving Core realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe had amazing talent and a splendid background. Within Divine Phoenix Island, Mu Qingshu was a nearly unapproachable man that many beautiful female disciples yearned for. Not to mention the 20 to 30 year old female disciples, but even the younger ones all took Mu Qingshu as their dream lover.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qianyu didn’t bother turning her head. These past few months, when she had gone to battle, it would always be with Mu Qingshu. Even when they lived in their small houses, it would be in neighboring ones.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of this had obviously been arranged by certain individuals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qianyu knew more or less that these was the actions of the Third Elder. From a young age, the Third Elder had brought up matters of marriage and engagement with Mu Qingshu to Mu Yuhuang. At the time, this had been turned down by Mu Yuhuang.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo Divine Phoenix Island, Mu Qianyu’s future marriage was a very important matter. Mu Qianyu was the Saintess of Divine Phoenix Island. One didn’t even need to discuss her lofty status, temperament, or awe inspiring beauty, one just needed to know that the Vermillion Bird bloodline within her body was no less than that of Divine Phoenix Island’s founder. If one could marry Mu Qianyu, they would also be able to obtain the Primordial Yin energy that came from being the one to take her virginity. Thus, one would also gain a very pure Saint Beast bloodline.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWho didn’t desire something so wonderful?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Mu Qianyu were to be married, then the Third Elder believed that his grandson Mu Qingshu was the only one within the entire Divine Phoenix Island who was suitable and qualified to match up to Mu Qianyu. However, Mu Yuhuang had also looked at Mu Qingshu with disdain. Mu Qingshu was okay, but he was only at the level of Mu Dingshan. He wasn’t even a Saint level talent; how could he possibly be worthy of her Mu Qianyu?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut three months ago, Mu Yuhuang had given all of the Vermillion Bird blood essence to Lin Ming, without even the thought that Mu Qianyu would marry Lin Ming in the future. However, the future was hard to predict. After Lin Ming had entered the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm, he had not returned. And thus, all of Mu Yuhuang’s hopes and dreams had faded into nothingness. At this time, some of the Great Elders had united together to attack her!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Yuhuang had no choice but to start thinking about potential allies to consolidate her position in her faction. And the Third Elder was a good candidate to do so.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut if she wanted to win over the Third Elder to her side, the price she had to pay was obvious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Yuhuang didn’t want to take the matter of Mu Qianyu’s future marriage as an exchange. But as she thought about it more, it did seem that besides Mu Qingshu, there was no one in the entire Divine Phoenix Island who had the qualifications to marry Mu Qianyu. If Mu Qianyu had to be married in the future, then the only one she could marry would be Mu Qingshu.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Mu Yuhuang realized this, she also tacitly yielded to the Third Elder’s wishes and made some arrangements. Thus, the situation now was that Mu Qianyu and Mu Qingshu always went out to battle together.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qianyu was well aware of everything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Cousin Qianyu, the skies seem as if they are about to rain soon. How about returning to our lodgings?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Please do not worry about me Senior-apprentice Brother. Senior-apprentice Brother, please return first.” Mu Qianyu’s voice was neither cold nor hot, and her words held a strange hint of tempered unfamiliarity.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qingshu laughed twice, and then shook his head saying, “Cousin Qianyu wants to bathe in rain? Haha, well as martial artists, staying under the rain is no problem. Then, I shall accompany Cousin Qianyu in showering under this rain. This can be considered an act of elegance.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qianyu was somewhat taken aback. Since he had already said this, she had nothing left to say. She silently stood there.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Cousin Qianyu, are you worrying about the South Sea war?” After a period of heavy silence, Mu Qingshu tried to raise a topic of conversation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“No, I am just in a poor mood.” Mu Qianyu shook her head, unwilling to say more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This…” Mu Qingshu reluctantly smiled, but the corners of his lips still twitched several times. He wasn’t an idiot, and he clearly knew why Mu Qianyu’s mood was so poor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEver since the Third Elder had spoken of marriage matters to Mu Qingshu, Mu Qingshu had already started to regard Mu Qianyu as his fiancé. And what man could tolerate his own fiancé thinking of another man, even if that person was already dead?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe heavy rain came. But, Mu Qianyu had no interest in soaking under the rain. Every raindrop that touched her would instantly be evaporated by fire-attribute true essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Senior-apprentice Brother may stay here, I shall return first.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Mu Qianyu finished speaking, she deeply looked at the shadow of rain over the endlessly vast waters. She sighed in her heart, and then turned around and walked away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qingshu also had no more interest in following her. He stood in the heavy rain alone, his complexion ugly. His originally handsome appearance was also twisted into nothing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He’s already dead, but he can still have you worry so much?” Mu Qingshu didn’t feel happy. “You have no choice in your future marriage. Sooner or later, the one you marry will be me. If you can love me wholeheartedly and take care of me well, then I will also be good to you and do the same. But if your heart is filled with other men even after our great wedding, then do not blame me for being heartless in the future.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTime passed day by day.

But, news of his death still slowly spread. The Seven Profound Valleys was an ally of Divine Phoenix Island, and was also participating in the war with the South Sea Demon Region. To the Seven Profound Valleys’ geniuses, this was also a good opportunity to hone their strength. Their disciples contacted the disciples of Divine Phoenix Island, and they thus learned that Lin Ming had died.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the start they had assumed this was a rumor.

Most of them had bore witness to the complete process of when Lin Ming had become champion of the Total Faction Martial Meeting. This Lin Ming who was overflowing with talent, actually fell from the heavens?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was simply unbelievable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Unimaginable, really unimaginable!” On a small island in the South Sea, a blue-clothed swordsman held a jug of wine as he sat on the beach, his sword stabbed into the ground in front of him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis blue-clothed swordsman was the top talent who had grandly lost to Lin Ming during the Total Faction Martial Meeting, Jiang Baoyun. At that time, Jiang Baoyun’s strength was not much worse than Lin Ming’s. Thus, ever since then, Jiang Baoyun always felt a familiar and friendly feeling towards Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I had wanted to take you as my goal in life, hoping to chase after your shadow. I did not think that even the heavens would be so jealous of someone with your ability, that you actually fell within the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm! That I have lost all chances to fight you in the future, that is my life’s great regret!” Jiang Baoyun heaved a deep sigh, and poured the jug of wine onto the beach.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“My sword is your monument and the sand is your mound.

Ouyang Boyan’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the early Xiantian realm, and was close to reaching the middle Xiantian realm. As one of the senior Elders of the Seven Profound Valleys, there were many complicated forces supporting him from behind. Lin Ming had no proof that Ouyang Boyan had tried to kill him, but even if he did, it would be very difficult to bring him down.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming could only avoid Ouyang Boyan.
