It would be a marvel if your body was even found.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother finger. He caught my gaze with his, and held it. ‘Thirdly, look at me. Look into my eyes and then tell me again I would not dare to get rid of you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, at least I now knew one thing. He was no industrialist who had made his fortune by producing tin cans or porcelain figurines. He was something else entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where,’ he asked in a voice so low I almost didn’t catch it, ‘is the file. Last chance, Mr Linton.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I… I…’ Dammit, what was happening to me? I could feel my whole body beginning to shake, and my eyes felt strange. They felt as if they were… wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no! No, no, no and no again! I was not going to cry like some little girl! Not in front of him. Not now. I was going to be brave and prove to him that I was just as good as any man and… and…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admit it, all right? I started to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I… I don\u0027t know,’ I sniffled, lowering my head and searching desperately for a handkerchief. But these were my uncle’s trousers, and he never went out, so there were no handkerchiefs in his pockets. Hurriedly, I tried to wipe away the tears with my sleeve before he could see them. ‘I didn’t take your file! I didn’t! I…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked up at him, breathing heavily. What was he going to do now? Call his henchmen and have me killed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise I saw him not where he had been a moment ago. He had retreated a few steps. The ice had gone out of his eyes, and he was standing in a slightly awkward position, his hands tugged into the pockets of his waistcoat as if he didn’t know what to do with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Um… here,’ he muttered. Pulling one of his hands out of the pocket, he handed me a clean white linen handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You just threatened to kill me and now you’re offering me a handkerchief?’ I asked, tearfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, and the awkwardness vanished as he fixed me with his eyes again. ‘I can hardly question you further while you are… leaking like this. It is noisy and messy. Put an end to it. Now!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking the handkerchief, I blew my nose in a noisy and not very ladylike manner. Then I held it out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You don\u0027t want it back?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you mad?’ he demanded. ‘Of course I do! That thing cost three shillings and tuppence! I would simply be very obliged if you washed it before giving it back, though.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh… err… of course I will.’ I paused. ‘If you don\u0027t kill me, that is,’ I added, as an afterthought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, that.’ He shifted uncomfortably for a moment. Mr Ambrose, uncomfortable? What was this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he waved deprecatingly. ‘I have thought of a better way. A way I can determine whether you are guilty or innocent.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, I’m very glad to hear it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I imagine so.’ Straightening into his usual erect pose again, Mr Ambrose clapped his hand. ‘Karim!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t even called very loudly, and there was a locked door in the way. There was no way the big bearded fellow could have heard him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You called, Sahib?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a yelp, I sprang back and whirled to see the Mohammedan standing right behind me, towering in the safe’s doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a curt wave, Mr Ambrose directed him back into my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Search the room. File S39XX300.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, Mr Ambrose was as economical with his words as with his money and facial expressions. Karim didn’t need any more explanation. He went back into my office. Soon after, I heard the noise of drawers being opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So what is it?’ I asked. ‘This better method that does not require me to learn to swim with my lungs full of water?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas my voice steady? I thought it was. I probably should have been more scared, but somehow this felt unreal. I was discussing with a practical stranger his reasons for not wanting to kill me. Was this really happening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, you did not have the keys for the safe until today,’ Mr Ambrose reasoned, his gaze wandering up and down my body in a strange manner. ‘I do not believe you are capable of cracking a safe. Ergo, if you took the file, you must have done it today. And if it is not in your office, you must still have it on you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And?’ I asked. ‘What do you intend to do now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze went up and down my body again. ‘As I said,’ he repeated, his dark, sea-coloured eyes intent. ‘You must have it on you.’ He took a step towards me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly I understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands shot up to shield me. ‘Oh no. No, nononono, Mister! Don’t even think about it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI Defend my Honour, More’s the Pity\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No! Definitely no! Despite what you have been trying to tell yourself, I am still a girl and I am most definitely not going to let you rummage around in my knickers!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You would rather end up face-down in the Thames?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I would rather that you trusted me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Trust…’ The word came slowly over his sculpted lips as if he hadn’t used them in a very long time. ‘Mister Linton… in Russia they have a saying about that. Do you know it, Mr Linton?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How the heck should I? I’m not Russian!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The saying is: “trust, but verify”.’ He took a step closer again. ‘I do not subscribe to that saying. I never trust. But I always verify.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are not getting me out of my dress so you can rummage around in my underwear!’ I declared, maybe a bit too forcefully. That was largely due to the fact that a part of my mind was occupied with how it would feel to have him rummage around in my underwear. And another part of my mind was busy being furious at the aforementioned part of my mind for having such thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are not wearing a dress, but trousers,’ he pointed out in his usual cold, curt manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Whatever! Are you a gentleman, Sir, or a cur?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-48.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:33 PM"}
