How woven for Siegfried was the Net of Betrayal","content":"\u0026nbsp;To the gates of the royal city men saw on the fourth day’s morn \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Come two-and-thirty riders. Straightway was their message borne\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto Gunther, to wit, a defiance unto war from a far-off foe.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —That lie unto wives and mothers was a fathomless wellspring of woe.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto these was licence given to appear before the King.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then said they to him: “We be liegemen of Lüdeger’s following,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The King overcome in battle, time was, by Siegfried’s hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And by him led thence as a hostage into King Gunther’s land.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Gunther greeted the heralds, and bade them sit at the meat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But spake of them one, and answered: “Lord King, let us stand on our feet\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till we tell out all the tidings wherewith we be sent unto thee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of many children of women be ye holden in enmity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n King Lüdegast bids thee defiance, and with him King Lüdeger,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Because at thine hands aforetime despitefully used they were.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They will ride now into thy kingdom with a host for battle arrayed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Great semblance of indignation at their message Gunther made.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 120}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then lodged they those feigned heralds, as who would take counsel awhile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How might it be that Siegfried should beware of such deep guile—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He, yea, or any other, when the snare for his feet was cast?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ha, in the net they had hidden were their own feet taken at last!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To and fro the King with his kinsmen whispering ever went:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ever Hagen of Troneg was pricking the sides of his intent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In sooth, of Gunther’s liegemen was many a man for peace,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But never from dark devising of murder would Hagen cease.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thus as they whispered, Siegfried found these thanes on a day;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the Hero of Netherland marvelled, and questioning thus ’gan say:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why goeth the King with his liegemen in heaviness of heart?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In avenging your wrongs am I ever ready to bear my part.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered and spake King Gunther: “Good cause for trouble have I.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Me do the Dane and the Saxon again unto battle defy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With their war-hosts now be they minded to ride into Burgundy-land.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered the aweless Hero: “Their onset shall Siegfried’s hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As best befitteth your honour, meet in the battle’s strain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That I did to the kings aforetime, shall now be done yet again:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will ravage their land and their strongholds beneath the spoiler’s tread\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Or ever from war I refrain me: hereon will I stake mine head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As for thee, do thou and thy liegemen here in the homeland stay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let me ride forth against them with mine own war-array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That I render you service gladly, shall ye and all men see.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Be ye sure, full evil entreated at mine hand shall your enemies be.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now welcome to me is thy saying,” the King said joyful-voiced,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As though in the proffered helping indeed and in truth he rejoiced.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In his falseness lowly he bowed him, that King of the traitor-heart!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet again spake Siegfried the noble, “Let all your fears depart.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Plotters and vassals prepared them, as it were for the war-march, then;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But all was done for a semblance unto Siegfried and his men.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the hero bade his warriors of Netherland arm for the fray;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And straightway the knights of Siegfried sought out their war-array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 121}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To his sire spake Siegfried the mighty: “Here in the land remain,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Siegmund my father: returning soon shalt thou see us again,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So God but grant good fortune to us, to the land of the Rhine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While thou with the King abidest fair days and glad shall be thine.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now all were at point of departing: banners to staves they bound.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Many of Gunther’s liegemen the while were standing round:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But that all was hollow semblance no man of these was ware.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sooth, mighty was the war-host arrayed round Siegfried there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The hauberks and the helmets on the horses laded they:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Knights many stalwart and fearless would forth of the land straightway.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then stole thence Hagen of Troneg: to the presence of Kriemhild he came,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As who, ere they marched unto battle, would take his leave of the dame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now happy am I,” said Kriemhild, “to have won to myself such a lord\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who unto my friends belovèd is so mighty a battle-ward\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As Siegfried is to my brethren when he aideth them in fight;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for this am I heart-uplifted,” said the Queen, “with abiding delight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hagen, friend well-belovèd, I pray thee, of this take thought—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I have joyed to do thee service, nor borne thee malice in aught:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let this be requited in kindness to my belovèd lord.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let him suffer not for my speaking to Brunhild a hasty word.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thereof,” said the noble lady, “constrained have I been to repent:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He hath visited on my body in sorest chastisement\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My folly of speech in stirring the Queen unto angry mood:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He hath verily well avenged her, that noble knight and good.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yet a little while, and atonement shall she accept of thee,”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said, “dear Lady Kriemhild: now I pray thee, tell unto me\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In what wise I may do thee service through Siegfried thy lord and thy knight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n None living would I, O lady, for thy kindness so gladly requite.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For him were I wholly dreadless,” made answer Siegfried’s wife,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Lest any in storm of battle should imperil mine hero’s life,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 122}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Were it not for his reckless defying of danger in battle’s van;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Else would he aye go scatheless, that good and valiant man.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “O Lady, if this thou fearest,” in his subtlety Hagen replied,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Lest in battle he haply be wounded, then unto me confide\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How best I may devise it, such peril to withstand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then for his warding ever will I ride full near at hand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She answered, “Thou art my kinsman, and of blood am I near unto thee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I commit my lord, my belovèd, to thy faith and thy fealty,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That for my sake o’er my belovèd the shield of protection thou hold.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then to Hagen revealed she a story that had better been left untold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For she said, “My lord is fearless, and the strongest man of men;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he slew on a day mid the mountains the Dragon of the Fen;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then bathed the hero his body in the blood of the monster worm,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherefore availeth to wound him no weapon that man may form.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet ever mine heart is fearful when in forefront of battle he stands,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And many a flying javelin is sped from warriors’ hands,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lest I peradventure may lose him, mine hero of all loved best:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah me, with what fears for Siegfried tosses mine heart in unrest!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O friend, dear friend and kinsman, on thy faithful love I lean\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That thou wilt guard thy troth-plight given herein to a queen,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When I tell to thee where my belovèd may be wounded of the steel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now shalt thou hear: the secret to thine honour and love I reveal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When from the wounds of the Dragon flowed the hot-reeking blood,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And when in the red pool bathed him that fearless knight and good,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There fell on him ’twixt the shoulders one broad lime-tree leaf\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On that spot may he be wounded; and this is my sorrow and grief.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered her Hagen of Troneg: “Thou then with thine own hand sew\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On his vesture a little token that to me that spot may show\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The which, when we stand in the war-storm, with heed evermore must I shield.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She thought from peril to save him; but so unto death was he sealed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She said, “I will sew on his garment with a silken thread spun fine\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A faintly-visible crosslet: there that strong hand of thine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 123}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hero, shall guard mine husband, as he presseth aye to the front,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And standeth begirt with foemen in the battle’s sternest brunt.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Even this will I do, dear Lady,” false Hagen made reply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She thought in her wifely yearning to redeem him from death thereby:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah me, thereby did Kriemhild her lord unto death betray!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Most courteous leave took Hagen, and with glad heart hasted away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Then asked of him King Gunther: “What secret hath Hagen learned?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “King, we will ride forth hunting when back is the war-march turned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now have I gotten the knowledge whereby he shall surely die.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thou, wilt thou appoint this hunting?” Said the King, “Yea, that will I!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now are the kinsmen of Gunther blithe, and their hearts are light!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never, I ween, thereafter to the end of time shall knight\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Devise such black betrayal as by these contrived hath been\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the trust in knighthood’s honour placed by a wife and a Queen!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the morrow’s morning early Siegfried the knight rode forth\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With a thousand men blithe-hearted, their faces set to the north.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He weened he should take a vengeance for his friends’ wrong fierce and fell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So nigh unto him rode Hagen that he marked his surcoat well.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then, when he spied the token, he sent all secretly\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To be bearers of other tidings two men of his company\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Which should say, “Let the great King’s country in peace unmarred abide,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For to make submission to Gunther hath Lüdeger bidden us ride.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How passing loth was Siegfried to turn him back from the fight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From avenging friends and kinsmen on these that had done them despite!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Scarce could the liegemen of Gunther persuade him to sheathe the sword.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Back rode he at last to the traitor, and the King his thanks outpoured:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “God guerdon thee, friend Siegfried, for thy good heart unto mine aid,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That thou offeredst thee so freely what time for thine help I prayed!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For this will I aye be beholden to thee, as well may I be.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Beyond all friends and kinsmen do I put chief trust in thee!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But seeing that now for a season war unto peace giveth place,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Go to, let us hunt the wild-boar and hold the bear in chase\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 124}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the Odenwald, as ofttimes in days overpast have I done.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —By Hagen was all this plotted, the utter-treacherous one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Each guest of mine by my message shall straightway be certified\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That tomorn we go forth hunting: whoso with me will ride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let him hold him early ready: if any will bide here still\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fleeting careless hours with the ladies, that doth he with my good will.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With knightly courtesy Siegfried made answer thereunto:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If ye ride forth a-hunting, I will gladly go with you.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So ye will but lend me a huntsman who shall rouse the quarry for me,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And therewithal some sleuth-hounds, to the forest will I with thee.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “One huntsman wilt thou only?” King Gunther straightway replied.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will lend thee four, an it please thee, which know from side to side\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The forest and all the wood-ways, and every wild thing’s lair,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lest thou err from the path unknowing when campward at even we fare.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then rode the hero to Kriemhild, and told to her everything,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The while that the tale of Hagen was told in the ears of the King,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even all his deadly devising against that noble thane:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n God grant such treachery never may be wrought by man again!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) So when these royal hunters had woven the dark death-snare,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then told they the plot to their fellows.
