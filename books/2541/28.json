Rundown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I remembered complaining, in life, about the roof; that it needed re-shingling. I remembered Ann\u0027s being disturbed about the outside of the house which needed repainting. The bushes around the house usually needed pruning, the garage straightening up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, compared to what I saw before me now, that house had been perfection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese shingles were cracked and dirty, many of them missing. The paint on the outside walls and on the doors and window frames and shutters was faded and smudged, parts of the walls defaced by long, meandering cracks. The bushes, like those on the hill, were brown and dry, the garage a dismal sight, its oil-stained floor covered with blown in dirt and leaves. All the trash barrels were overflowing, two of them turned over, a gaunt cat eating garbage from one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching sight of me, it jerked around in fright and raced out through the rear doorway of the garage which had no door now. Through the opening, I saw the elm tree standing dead, the cracked fence sagging toward the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn\u0027s Honda was parked in front of the house. At first, I felt surprised to see only her car and looked around for the others, especially the camper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came to me then that this was her particular limbo and could only possess what she expected to see in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked to her car and examined it. The sight made me queasy. She\u0027d always been so proud of it, kept it so immaculate. Now it looked old, its chrome pitted with rust, its paint faded, windows streaked with dirt, one side dented, one tire flat. Is this what everything is like here? I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to think about it but turned toward the front doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked old too, stained, their knobs corroded. The glass cover on the porch light was broken, shards of glass lying across the porch. A section of the slate floor was missing, the rest chipped and dirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, that sense of bleak depression. I fought it off. And I haven\u0027t even gone inside, I thought, the idea chilling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBracing myself, I knocked on the left door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt grotesque to knock on the door of my own home-- well, it looked like my home albeit a distorted form of it-- but I knew how abrupt appearances alarmed Ann. Often, coming home at an unexpected time, I\u0027d walked into our bedroom, meeting her as she emerged from the dressing room. She\u0027d gasped in shock and, literally, recoiled, saying, \"Oh! I didn\u0027t hear you come in!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I knocked. It was better than frightening her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one answered. I stood on the porch for what seemed, to me, a very long time. Then, giving up, I turned the knob and started to open the door. Its bottom scraped on the floor as I pushed it; the hinges must be loose, I thought. I stepped inside. The slate floor in the hallway looked as bad as the one on the porch. I shuddered as I closed the door. It actually felt colder in the house than it had outside, a clammy chill hovering in the air. I clenched my teeth and walked into the living room. No matter what I saw, I vowed, I wouldn\u0027t let it dissuade me from my reason for being there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d always loved our living room, Robert: the rich, oak paneling, the built-in bookcases, the heavy, earth-tone furniture, the enormous sliding door and window overlooking the back deck and swimming pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1 couldn\u0027t love this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts paneling and bookcases were cracked and luster-less, its furniture worn and faded. The carpeting, which I recalled as being forest green, was, now, some drab shade in between dull green and black. There was a huge, ocherous stain near the coffee table and the table itself was scratched and splintered, its oak tone completely flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d had that table handmade, always loved it. Walking over to it, I looked down at the chessboard and men Ann had had made for me one Christmas. It had been a stunning piece of craftsmanship, the board made of oak with inlaid silver filigree, the men hand- cast in pewter with bases of turned oak, all impossible to duplicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the board was cracked and dingy and five of the pieces were missing, two sagging, almost broken. I turned away from the table, telling myself that this was not the chess set I had lived with. It was hard to keep that in mind though because everything looked so familiar. The bookcases were as I remembered them--except that these were only half filled with dusty, aging books. The shutters were as I recalled--except that one of these was broken off and lying on the duty, sun-bleached cushion of the window seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed out toward the deck and saw the fruitless mulberry tree. No, this wasn\u0027t the same one, this was dying. The deck was littered with dry leaves and the pool looked stagnant, a slime-like growth on its motionless surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning back--there was a crack in the sliding door I noticed as I did--I stepped over to the baby grand. Its case, once a glossy brown, was now drab. I touched the keys. The sound they evoked was tinny. The piano was completely out of tune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI averted my eyes from the dreary room and called Ann\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called repeatedly, then, when the silence was unbroken, walked through the bar room to the family room, remembering the day--it seemed a century ago--I\u0027d walked this same way in our earth house, the day of my funeral, before I\u0027d realized what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe family room was as bad as the others--frayed and dusty furniture, faded paneling and drapes, tile floor grimy. In its fireplace, a small fire burned. I would never have believed, until that moment, that a fire could be anything but cheerful. This one was, so small and mean looking--a few, pale, licking tongues of flame around some scraps of wood-- that it seemed to give no heat at all and certainly no comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo music, I realized then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur home had always been filled with music, often a conflux of it from two to three sources at once. This house-- this dour, unpleasant version of our house--was weighty with silence, cold with silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look at the photographs on the walls. I knew I couldn\u0027t bear to see the children\u0027s faces. Instead, I moved into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirty dishes, pots and cutlery in the sink, the windows streaked with grime, the floors spotted. The oven door was open and I saw, inside, a baking pan half filled with hard, white grease, a few small scraps of dried-up meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the refrigerator door and looked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight repelled me. Wilted lettuce, dry, white cheese, stale bread, yellow-edged mayonnaise, an almost empty bottle of dark red wine. A fetid smell of rot came from the barely cool interior and I closed the door. Turning from it, trying not to let the look and feel of the house get past my mental guard, I moved across the family room and down the hallway toward the back of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children\u0027s rooms were empty. I stood in each of mem. They were not as cold and gloomy as the rest of the house but certainly not pleasant either. Only Ian\u0027s room looked used, its bed unmade, papers lying on his desk as though he\u0027d just been doing homework. I wondered why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn was sitting on the grass outside our bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood by the glass door, looking at her, tears in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore a heavy, dark blue sweater over her blouse, a pair of wrinkled slacks, old shoes. Her skin, what I could see of it, looked pale and chapped. Her hair was lank as though she hadn\u0027t washed it in a long time. To my distressed surprise, I noticed Ginger lying by her side. I didn\u0027t know it then but, after Ann was gone, Ginger had stopped eating and mourned herself to death in a month. Now she was here, so filled with love that she\u0027d chosen this bleak environment rather than leave Ann alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn was slumped, immobile, holding something in her cupped hands. I\u0027d never seen her in a posture which bespoke such abject misery and, moving to see what she held, I saw that it was a tiny, gray bird stiffened in death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered, suddenly, that this had happened before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d found a bird in the street, struck down, unnoticed, by some motorist. She\u0027d brought it home and sat down on the back lawn with it, cupping its small, pulsing body in the warmth of her palms. I remembered what she\u0027d said. That she knew the bird was dying and wanted it to hear, in its final moments, the sounds it knew in life--wind rustling in the trees and songs of other birds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burst of sudden fury hit me unexpectedly. This was not a person who deserved to live in such squalor! What kind of stupid justice was that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to struggle with the feeling. I could feel the anger, like a magnet, pulling me toward something I didn\u0027t want to reach. If I hadn\u0027t sensed, at the same time, that it was, also, pulling me away from Ann, I might have succumbed at the outset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it was, I remembered Albert\u0027s warning once again and was able to repress the anger. This wasn\u0027t judgment, I told myself. Or, if it was, it was self-inflicted. She was here because her actions had put her here. It wasn\u0027t punishment but law. My resentment of it was a waste of energy. All I could do was try to help her understand. That was why I was there. And now it was time to start. I\u0027d reached her body. Now I had to reach her soul. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-dreams-may-come/page-28.html","bookId":2541,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM"}
