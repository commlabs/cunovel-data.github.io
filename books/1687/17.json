I fly down the steps to Command, mind racing a mile a minute, and burst right into a war meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, I\u0027m not going to the Capitol? I have to go! I\u0027m the Mockingjay!\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoin barely looks up from her screen. \"And as the Mockingjay, your primary goal of unifying the districts against the Capitol has been achieved. Don\u0027t worry - if it goes well, we\u0027ll fly you in for the surrender.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surrender?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll be too late! I\u0027ll miss all the fighting. You need me - I\u0027m the best shot you\u0027ve got!\" I shout. I don\u0027t usually brag about this, but it\u0027s got to be at least close to true. \"Gale\u0027s going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gale has shown up for training every day unless occupied with other approved duties. We feel confident he can manage himself in the field,\" says Coin. \"How many training sessions do you estimate you\u0027ve attended?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone. That\u0027s how many. \"Well, sometimes I was hunting. And...I trained with Beetee down in Special Weaponry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the same, Katniss,\" says Boggs. \"We all know you\u0027re smart and brave and a good shot. But we need soldiers in the field. You don\u0027t know the first thing about executing orders, and you\u0027re not exactly at your physical peak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That didn\u0027t bother you when I was in Eight. Or Two, for that matter,\" I counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t originally authorized for combat in either case,\" says Plutarch, shooting me a look that signals I\u0027m about to reveal too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, the bomber battle in 8 and my intervention in 2 were spontaneous, rash, and definitely unauthorized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And both resulted in your injury,\" Boggs reminds me. Suddenly, I see myself through his eyes. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmallish seventeen-year-old girl who can\u0027t quite catch her breath since her ribs haven\u0027t fully healed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisheveled. Undisciplined. Recuperating. Not a soldier, but someone who needs to be looked after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I have to go,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" asks Coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t very well say it\u0027s so I can carry out my own personal vendetta against Snow. Or that the idea of remaining here in 13 with the latest version of Peeta while Gale goes off to fight is unbearable. But I have no shortage of reasons to want to fight in the Capitol. \"Because of Twelve. Because they destroyed my district.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe president thinks about this a moment. Considers me. \"Well, you have three weeks. It\u0027s not long, but you can begin training. If the Assignment Board deems you fit, possibly your case will be reviewed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it. That\u0027s the most I can hope for. I guess it\u0027s my own fault. I did blow off my schedule every single day unless something suited me. It didn\u0027t seem like much of a priority, jogging around a field with a gun with so many other things going on. And now I\u0027m paying for my negligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the hospital, I find Johanna in the same circumstance and spitting mad. I tell her about what Coin said. \"Maybe you can train, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027ll train. But I\u0027m going to the stinking Capitol if I have to kill a crew and fly there myself,\" says Johanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably best not to bring that up in training,\" I say. \"But it\u0027s nice to know I\u0027ll have a ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna grins, and I feel a slight but significant shift in our relationship. I don\u0027t know that we\u0027re actually friends, but possibly the wordallies would be accurate. That\u0027s good. I\u0027m going to need an ally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, when we report for training at 7:30, reality slaps me in the face. We\u0027ve been funneled into a class of relative beginners, fourteen- or fifteen-year-olds, which seems a little insulting until it\u0027s obvious that they\u0027re in far better condition than we are. Gale and the other people already chosen to go to the Capitol are in a different, accelerated phase of training. After we stretch - which hurts - there\u0027s a couple of hours of strengthening exercises - which hurt - and a five-mile run - which kills. Even with Johanna\u0027s motivational insults driving me on, I have to drop out after a mile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my ribs,\" I explain to the trainer, a no-nonsense middle-aged woman we\u0027re supposed to address as Soldier York. \"They\u0027re still bruised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll tell you, Soldier Everdeen, those are going to take at least another month to heal up on their own,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"I don\u0027t have a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks me up and down. \"The doctors haven\u0027t offered you any treatment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a treatment?\" I ask. \"They said they had to mend naturally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what they say. But they could speed up the process if I recommend it. I warn you, though, it isn\u0027t any fun,\" she tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please. I\u0027ve got to get to the Capitol,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoldier York doesn\u0027t question this. She scribbles something on a pad and sends me directly back to the hospital. I hesitate. I don\u0027t want to miss any more training. \"I\u0027ll be back for the afternoon session,\" I promise. She just purses her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-four needle jabs to my rib cage later, I\u0027m flattened out on my hospital bed, gritting my teeth to keep from begging them to bring back my morphling drip. It\u0027s been by my bed so I can take a hit as needed. I haven\u0027t used it lately, but I kept it for Johanna\u0027s sake. Today they tested my blood to make sure it was clean of the painkiller, as the mixture of the two drugs - the morphling and whatever\u0027s set my ribs on fire - has dangerous side effects. They made it clear I would have a difficult couple of days. But I told them to go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a bad night in our room. Sleep\u0027s out of the question. I think I can actually smell the ring of flesh around my chest burning, and Johanna\u0027s fighting off withdrawal symptoms. Early on, when I apologize about cutting off her morphling supply, she waves it off, saying it had to happen anyway. But by three in the morning, I\u0027m the target of every colorful bit of profanity District 7 has to offer. At dawn, she drags me out of bed, determined to get to training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I can do it,\" I confess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do it. We both can. We\u0027re victors, remember? We\u0027re the ones who can survive anything they throw at us,\" she snarls at me. She\u0027s a sick greenish color, shaking like a leaf. I get dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe must be victors to make it through the morning. I think I\u0027m going to lose Johanna when we realize it\u0027s pouring outside. Her face turns ashen and she seems to have ceased breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just water. It won\u0027t kill us,\" I say. She clenches her jaw and stomps out into the mud. Rain drenches us as we work our bodies and then slog around the running course. I bail after a mile again, and I have to resist the temptation to take off my shirt so the cold water can sizzle off my ribs. I force down my field lunch of soggy fish and beet stew. Johanna gets halfway through her bowl before it comes back up. In the afternoon, we learn to assemble our guns. I manage it, but Johanna can\u0027t hold her hands steady enough to fit the parts together. When York\u0027s back is turned, I help her out. Even though the rain continues, the afternoon\u0027s an improvement because we\u0027re on the shooting range. At last, something I\u0027m good at. It takes some adjusting from a bow to a gun, but by the end of the day, I\u0027ve got the best score in my class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re just inside the hospital doors when Johanna declares, \"This has to stop. Us living in the hospital. Everyone views us as patients.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not a problem for me. I can move into our family compartment, but Johanna\u0027s never been assigned one. When she tries to get discharged from the hospital, they won\u0027t agree to let her live alone, even if she comes in for daily talks with the head doctor. I think they may have put two and two together about the morphling and this only adds to their view that she\u0027s unstable. \"She won\u0027t be alone. I\u0027m going to room with her,\" I announce. There\u0027s some dissent, but Haymitch takes our part, and by bedtime, we have a compartment across from Prim and my mother, who agrees to keep an eye on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I take a shower, and Johanna sort of wipes herself down with a damp cloth, she makes a cursory inspection of the place. When she opens the drawer that holds my few possessions, she shuts it quickly. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think how there\u0027s nothing in Johanna\u0027s drawer but her government-issued clothes. That she doesn\u0027t have one thing in the world to call her own. \"It\u0027s okay. You can look at my stuff if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna unlatches my locket, studying the pictures of Gale, Prim, and my mother. She opens the silver parachute and pulls out the spile and slips it onto her pinkie. \"Makes me thirsty just looking at it.\" Then she finds the pearl Peeta gave me. \"Is this - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say. \"Made it through somehow.\" I don\u0027t want to talk about Peeta. One of the best things about training is, it keeps me from thinking of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haymitch says he\u0027s getting better,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But he\u0027s changed,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So have you. So have I. And Finnick and Haymitch and Beetee. Don\u0027t get me started on Annie Cresta. The arena messed us all up pretty good, don\u0027t you think? Or do you still feel like the girl who volunteered for your sister?\" she asks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the one thing I think my head doctor might be right about. There\u0027s no going back. So we might as well get on with things.\" She neatly returns my keepsakes to the drawer and climbs into the bed across from me just as the lights go out. \"You\u0027re not afraid I\u0027ll kill you tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I couldn\u0027t take you,\" I answer. Then we laugh, since both our bodies are so wrecked, it will be a miracle if we can get up the next day. But we do. Each morning, we do. And by the end of the week, my ribs feel almost like new, and Johanna can assemble her rifle without help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoldier York gives the pair of us an approving nod as we knock off for the day. \"Fine job, Soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we move out of hearing, Johanna mutters, \"I think winning the Games was easier.\" But the look on her face says she\u0027s pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, we\u0027re almost in good spirits when we go to the dining hall, where Gale\u0027s waiting to eat with me. Receiving a giant serving of beef stew doesn\u0027t hurt my mood either. \"First shipments of food arrived this morning,\" Greasy Sae tells me. \"That\u0027s real beef, from District Ten. Not any of your wild dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t remember you turning it down,\" Gale tosses back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe join a group that includes Delly, Annie, and Finnick. It\u0027s something to see Finnick\u0027s transformation since his marriage. His earlier incarnations - the decadent Capitol heartthrob I met before the Quell, the enigmatic ally in the arena, the broken young man who tried to help me hold it together - these have been replaced by someone who radiates life. Finnick\u0027s real charms of self-effacing humor and an easygoing nature are on display for the first time. He never lets go of Annie\u0027s hand. Not when they walk, not when they eat. I doubt he ever plans to. She\u0027s lost in some daze of happiness. There are still moments when you can tell something slips in her brain and another world blinds her to us. But a few words from Finnick call her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelly, who I\u0027ve known since I was little but never gave much thought to, has grown in my estimation. She was told what Peeta said to me that night after the wedding, but she\u0027s not a gossip. Haymitch says she\u0027s the best defender I have when Peeta goes off on some kind of tear about me. Always taking my side, blaming his negative perceptions on the Capitol\u0027s torture. She has more influence on him than any of the others do, because he really does know her. Anyway, even if she\u0027s sugarcoating my good points, I appreciate it. Frankly, I could use a little sugarcoating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m starving and the stew is so delicious - beef, potatoes, turnips, and onions in a thick gravy - that I have to force myself to slow down. All around the dining hall, you can feel the rejuvenating effect that a good meal can bring on. The way it can make people kinder, funnier, more optimistic, and remind them it\u0027s not a mistake to go on living. It\u0027s better than any medicine. So I try to make it last and join in the conversation. Sop up the gravy on my bread and nibble on it as I listen to Finnick telling some ridiculous story about a sea turtle swimming off with his hat. Laugh before I realize he\u0027s standing there. Directly across the table, behind the empty seat next to Johanna. Watching me. I choke momentarily as the gravy bread sticks in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peeta!\" says Delly. \"It\u0027s so nice to see you out...and about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo large guards stand behind him. He holds his tray awkwardly, balanced on his fingertips since his wrists are shackled with a short chain between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with the fancy bracelets?\" asks Johanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not quite trustworthy yet,\" says Peeta. \"I can\u0027t even sit here without your permission.\" He indicates the guards with his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure he can sit here. We\u0027re old friends,\" says Johanna, patting the space beside her. The guards nod and Peeta takes a seat. \"Peeta and I had adjoining cells in the Capitol. We\u0027re very familiar with each other\u0027s screams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie, who\u0027s on Johanna\u0027s other side, does that thing where she covers her ears and exits reality. Finnick shoots Johanna an angry look as his arm encircles Annie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? My head doctor says I\u0027m not supposed to censor my thoughts. It\u0027s part of my therapy,\" replies Johanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe life has gone out of our little party. Finnick murmurs things to Annie until she slowly removes her hands. Then there\u0027s a long silence while people pretend to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annie,\" says Delly brightly, \"did you know it was Peeta who decorated your wedding cake? Back home, his family ran the bakery and he did all the icing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie cautiously looks across Johanna. \"Thank you, Peeta. It was beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My pleasure, Annie,\" says Peeta, and I hear that old note of gentleness in his voice that I thought was gone forever. Not that it\u0027s directed at me. But still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we\u0027re going to fit in that walk, we better go,\" Finnick tells her. He arranges both of their trays so he can carry them in one hand while holding tightly to her with the other. \"Good seeing you, Peeta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You be nice to her, Finnick. Or I might try and take her away from you.\" It could be a joke, if the tone wasn\u0027t so cold. Everything it conveys is wrong. The open distrust of Finnick, the implication that Peeta has his eye on Annie, that Annie could desert Finnick, that I do not even exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Peeta,\" says Finnick lightly. \"Don\u0027t make me sorry I restarted your heart.\" He leads Annie away after giving me a concerned glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they\u0027re gone, Delly says in a reproachful voice, \"He did save your life, Peeta. More than once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For her.\" He gives me a brief nod. \"For the rebellion. Not for me. I don\u0027t owe him anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn\u0027t rise to the bait, but I do. \"Maybe not. But Mags is dead and you\u0027re still here. That should count for something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, a lot of things should count for something that don\u0027t seem to, Katniss. I\u0027ve got some memories I can\u0027t make sense of, and I don\u0027t think the Capitol touched them. A lot of nights on the train, for instance,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the implications. That more happened on the train than did. That what did happen - those nights I only kept my sanity because his arms were around me - no longer matters. Everything a lie, everything a way of misusing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeeta makes a little gesture with his spoon, connecting Gale and me. \"So, are you two officially a couple now, or are they still dragging out the star-crossed lover thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still dragging,\" says Johanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpasms cause Peeta\u0027s hands to tighten into fists, then splay out in a bizarre fashion. Is it all he can do to keep them from my neck? I can feel the tension in Gale\u0027s muscles next to me, fear an altercation. But Gale simply says, \"I wouldn\u0027t have believed it if I hadn\u0027t seen it myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" asks Peeta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" Gale answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to be a little more specific,\" says Peeta. \"What about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That they\u0027ve replaced you with the evil-mutt version of yourself,\" says Johanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale finishes his milk. \"You done?\" he asks me. I rise and we cross to drop off our trays. At the door, an old man stops me because I\u0027m still clutching the rest of my gravy bread in my hand. Something in my expression, or maybe the fact that I\u0027ve made no attempt to conceal it, makes him go easy on me. He lets me stuff the bread in my mouth and move on. Gale and I are almost to my compartment when he speaks again. \"I didn\u0027t expect that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you he hated me,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the way he hates you. It\u0027s so...familiar. I used to feel like that,\" he admits. \"When I\u0027d watch you kissing him on the screen. Only I knew I wasn\u0027t being entirely fair. He can\u0027t see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reach my door. \"Maybe he just sees me as I really am. I have to get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale catches my arm before I can disappear. \"So that\u0027s what you\u0027re thinking now?\" I shrug. \"Katniss, as your oldest friend, believe me when I say he\u0027s not seeing you as you really are.\" He kisses my cheek and goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on my bed, trying to stuff information from my Military Tactics books into my head while memories of my nights with Peeta on the train distract me. After about twenty minutes, Johanna comes in and throws herself across the foot of my bed. \"You missed the best part. Delly lost her temper at Peeta over how he treated you. She got very squeaky. It was like someone stabbing a mouse with a fork repeatedly. The whole dining hall was riveted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d Peeta do?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He started arguing with himself like he was two people. The guards had to take him away. On the good side, no one seemed to notice I finished his stew.\" Johanna rubs her hand over her protruding belly. I look at the layer of grime under her fingernails.
