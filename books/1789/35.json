He stripped his wife out of her garments and put her under the covers. She really was exhausted, for she slept like a baby now and didn\u0027t even open her eyes when he lifted her up so he could pull the blankets back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to spend the full night with her. If she became ill he wanted to be close by in case she needed his help. And, Lord, he was suddenly feeling exhausted, too. He stripped out of his own clothes and got into bed beside her. She instinctively rolled into his arms. Colin kissed her forehead, wrapped his arms around her, and closed his eyes. He, too, was asleep less than a minute later. He awakened a little before dawn when his wife rubbed her backside against him. She was still asleep. Colin was barely awake enough to think about what he was doing. He made love to her, and when they\u0027d both found fulfillment, he fell asleep again still joined to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra was feeling as fit as ever the next day. Catherine arrived on her doorstep at two that afternoon to personally return the necklace. She was full of news, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was having a grand time with her season and wanted to tell Alesandra all about the offers for her hand in marriage her father had already received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine linked her arm through Alesandra\u0027s and pulled her along into the salon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is my brother on this fine Sunday afternoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s working,\" Alesandra answered. \"He should be home by dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine sat down in the chair adjacent to the settee. Flannaghan stood near the entrance, waiting to find out if he was needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can barely keep all the gentlemen straight in my mind,\" Catherine exaggerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must make a list of the gentlemen you\u0027re interested in,\" Alesandra advised. \"Then you wouldn\u0027t be confused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine thought that was a sound plan of action. Alesandra immediately asked Flannaghan to fetch her paper and pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already asked father to decline several gentlemen and he\u0027s been very accommodating. He isn\u0027t in any hurry to get me settled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should probably start a list of your rejections, too,\" Alesandra suggested. \"With your reasons by each name, of course, in the event you change your mind or forget why you discarded them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s a wonderful idea,\" Catherine claimed. \"It\u0027s so thoughtful of you to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra was thrilled to be of assistance. \"Organization is the key, Catherine,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The key to what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra opened her mouth to answer, then realized she wasn\u0027t exactly sure. \"To a well-structured, happy life,\" she decided aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan returned with the items she\u0027d requested. Alesandra thanked him and then turned back to Catherine. \"Shall we begin with the rejections?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Catherine agreed. \"Put Neil Perry at the top of the list. He offered for me yesterday. I don\u0027t like him at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra titled the list, then put Perry\u0027s name down. \"I don\u0027t particularly like him either,\" she announced. \"You\u0027ve shown sound judgment in rejecting him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Catherine replied. \"What specific reason should I put next to his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disgusting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra laughed. \"He is that,\" she remarked. \"He\u0027s the complete opposite of his sister. Victoria\u0027s a dear lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine didn\u0027t know Victoria and therefore couldn\u0027t agree or disagree. She continued with the names of men she found unacceptable. She hurried through the task since she was anxious to concentrate on the appealing candidates. She also had additional news she was dying to share with Alesandra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then, let\u0027s begin with the second list.\" Catherine gave her four names. The last was Morgan. \"He hasn\u0027t offered for me, of course, and I only just met him last night, but, Alesandra, he\u0027s so handsome and charming. When he smiles, I declare, my heart feels like it\u0027s going to stop beating. I doubt I\u0027ll stand a chance with him, though. He\u0027s extremely popular with the ladies. Still, he did mention he was going to ask father if he could call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve met Morgan,\" Alesandra replied. \"And I do agree he\u0027s charming. I believe Colin likes him, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He would be a fine catch,\" Catherine decided. \"Still… there is one other I would like to consider as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is his name and I\u0027ll add him to your list.\" Catherine started blushing. \"It\u0027s the most romantic thing,\" she whispered. \"But Father wouldn\u0027t think so. You must promise not to tell anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just promise me first, then I\u0027ll explain. Put your hand over your heart. That makes your promise more binding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra didn\u0027t dare laugh. Catherine sounded so sincere. She didn\u0027t want to hurt her feelings. She did as she was instructed and placed her hand over her heart while she gave her pledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now will you explain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 don\u0027t know the gentleman\u0027s name yet,\" Catherine said. \"He was at the ball last night. I\u0027m certain of it. I\u0027m certain he\u0027s wonderful, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you know he\u0027s wonderful if you\u0027ve never met him? Or did you meet him? That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it? You just don\u0027t know his name. Tell me what he looks like. Perhaps I\u0027ve met the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I haven\u0027t seen him yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re confusing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine laughed. \"He has a name we can put on the list for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra dipped her pen into the inkwell. Catherine waited until she\u0027d completed that task, then whispered, \"My Secret Admirer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a long happy sigh after whispering the name. Alesandra gasped at the very same time. She dropped her pen into her lap. Ink blotted her pink dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good heavens, look what you\u0027ve done,\" Catherine cried out. \"Your dress…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra shook her head. \"Forget the dress,\" she countered. Her voice shook with worry. \"I want to hear about this secret admirer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine frowned. \"I haven\u0027t done anything wrong, Alesandra. Why are you so upset with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not upset… at least not with you,\" Alesandra said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouted at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to shout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the tears in Catherine\u0027s eyes then. Her sister-in-law was high-strung, and her feelings were easily hurt. She was still more child than woman, Alesandra realized, and she made up her mind then and there not to tell her about her worries. She would talk to Colin first. He would know what to do about the secret admirer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I upset you. Please forgive me.\" She forced a mild tone of voice when she added, \"I\u0027m very interested in hearing all about this secret admirer. Will you explain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine blinked away her tears. \"There isn\u0027t much to explain,\" she said. \"I received a lovely posey this morning with a notecard attached. There wasn\u0027t a message—just the signature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Secret Admirer. I thought it was very romantic. I don\u0027t understand why you\u0027re acting so strange.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God.\" Alesandra whispered those words and collapsed against the back of the settee. Her mind raced with her fears. Colin would have to listen to her, she decided, even if she had to tie the man up while he slept to get her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re shivering, Alesandra,\" Catherine said. \"I\u0027m just a little chilled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother told Jade she thinks you\u0027re carrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t meant to shout, of course, but Catherine\u0027s blurted-out remark did surprise a near scream out of her. \"They think you might be carrying Colin\u0027s baby,\" Catherine explained. \"Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. It isn\u0027t possible. It\u0027s too soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been married over three months now,\" Catherine reminded her. \"Mother told Jade your nausea could be a symptom. She\u0027s going to be disappointed if you\u0027re not carrying. Are you sure, Alesandra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t telling Catherine the truth. She really wasn\u0027t sure at all. Good Lord, she could be pregnant. It had been quite a long time since her last monthly—over three months ago. She counted back just to be certain. Yes, that was right. She had had cramps two weeks before she got married… and none since. Was it possible the stomach upset wasn\u0027t due to exhaustion? She\u0027d never napped before, she thought to herself, but now she could barely get through a day without an afternoon rest. Of course, she and Colin had bad to go out every night, and she really believed the late hours they were keeping made the afternoon naps necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand dropped to her stomach in a protective gesture. \"I would like to have Colin\u0027s children,\" she said. \"But he has an important schedule and I promised not to interfere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does a schedule have to do with babies?\" Alesandra tried to pull herself together. She felt as though she were in a daze. She couldn\u0027t seem to organize her thoughts. Why hadn\u0027t she realized… the possibility… the only logical answer… Oh, yes, she was pregnant. \"Alesandra, do explain,\" Catherine demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a five-year schedule,\" Alesandra blurted out. \"I\u0027ll have children then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine thought she was jesting with her. She burst into laughter. Alesandra was able to maintain her composure until her sister-in-law took her leave a few minutes later. Then she hurried up to her bedroom, shut the door behind her, and promptly burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was filled with the most conflicting emotions. She was thrilled she was carrying Colin\u0027s son or daughter. A precious life growing inside her seemed a true miracle to her and she was fairly overwhelmed with her joy—and her guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin might not be happy about the baby at all. Alesandra didn\u0027t have any concerns about his ability to be a good father, but wouldn\u0027t a child now be an added burden? Oh, God, she wished he loved her. She wished he wasn\u0027t so stubborn about her inheritance, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to feel guilty, and how in heaven\u0027s name could she feel so euphoric and frightened at the same time? Flannaghan came upstairs with a cup of hot tea for his mistress. He was about to knock on her door when he heard her crying. He stood there, uncertain what to do. He wanted to find out what was wrong, of course, so that he could try to help, but she had closed the door, indicating she wanted privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the front door open and immediately turned back to the steps. He\u0027d reached the landing when Colin walked inside. He wasn\u0027t alone. His partner, Nathan, followed behind him. The man was so tall, he had to duck his head under the arch of the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan knew better than to blurt out his worry about his mistress in front of company. He hurried down the steps, bowed to his employer, and then turned to greet his partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll go into the salon,\" Colin said. \"Caine and his wife are going to be joining us shortly. Where\u0027s Alesandra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your princess is above the stairs resting,\" Flannaghan answered. He was trying to act like a dignified man of the house. He had met Nathan before, of course, yet was still a bit intimidated by the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her rest until my brother gets here.\" He turned to his partner and said, \"We\u0027ve had to go out every damn night. Alesandra is exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she like going out every night?\" Nathan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin smiled. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded at the door just as Colin and his partner walked into the salon. Flannaghan assumed the callers were Colin\u0027s family. He hurried to open the door and was in the process of bowing low when he realized it was just a messenger boy standing on the stoop. The messenger held a white gift box tied with a red ribbon. He thrust the package at Flannaghan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been given a coin to see Princess Alesandra gets this,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan took the box, nodded, and then shut the door. He turned to go up the stairs, smiling now, for he had a good reason to interrupt his princess and hopefully, once he was inside her room, he could nag out of her the reason why she was so upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door knocker sounded again. Flannaghan put the box down on the side table and went back to the front door. Less than a minute had passed and he thought the messenger had returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin\u0027s brother and his wife waited entrance. Lady Jade gave Flannaghan a nice smile. Caine was barely paying attention to the butler, however. He was diligently frowning down at his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon,\" Flannaghan announced as he pulled the door wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade hurried inside. She greeted the butler. Caine gave him a nod. He seemed preoccupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are not finished with this discussion,\" he told his wife in a hard, no-nonsense tone of voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we are finished,\" she countered. \"You\u0027re being extremely unreasonable, husband. Flannaghan, where are Colin and Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re waiting for you in the salon, milady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get to the bottom of this, Jade,\" Caine muttered. \"I don\u0027t care how long it takes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re being unreasonably jealous, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made that emphatic statement of fact in a loud voice as he followed his wife into the salon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Nathan and Colin immediately stood up when Jade entered the salon. Nathan took his sister into his arms and hugged her tight. He glared at Caine because he had raised his voice to his sister, then added a rebuke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A husband shouldn\u0027t raise his voice to his wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine laughed. Colin joined in. \"You\u0027ve done a complete turnaround,\" Caine remarked. \"I seem to remember you were always shouting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a changed man,\" Nathan replied in a calm, matter-of-fact voice. \"I\u0027m content.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wager your Sara\u0027s probably doing all the yelling now,\" Colin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan grinned. \"The little woman does have a temper,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade sat down in the chair next to Nathan\u0027s. Her brother resumed his seat and turned his attention back to Caine. \"Are you two having a difference of opinion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jade replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Caine answered at the very same moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t wish to speak about this now,\" Jade announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe deliberately turned the topic. \"I\u0027m dying to see the baby, Nathan. Does she look like you or Sara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s got my eyes and Sara\u0027s feet, thank God,\" Nathan replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they now?\" Colin asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-35.html","bookId":1789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM"}
