His left eye that was barely opened had already became red from blood congestion. Everything he saw seemed to be soaked within a sea of blood. Glaring handprints could be seen on his neck, and it was still turning more red. The air he breathed in got stuck at his throat. His neck was already completely rigid; if he even moved his neck bones slightly, it would bring back stinging pain. Su knew that his own neck bones were already covered in cracks, and that the slightest movement would cause them to fracture into pieces. However, right now, he wasn’t thinking about how to deal with these injuries at all.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEven though he couldn’t see everything clearly already, there were still a few figures that hadn’t fallen in Su’s field of view.

Why are there… so many… still alive!...” A low, rolling roar sounded from Su’s throat like that of a wild beast’s. His left eye that was already completely bloodshot released a frightening dark red radiance, and then he began to drag his body that was as heavy as a mountain towards that old man!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, things did not turn out as he wished. After taking a single step, Su’s entire body went still and he fell onto the ground. Under the disorderly, bloodstained hair whose original color couldn’t even be seen anymore, blood was currently crawling out like earthworms.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe small church entered a momentary state of silence.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOnly after a bit of time had passed did the elder release a breath of air, breaking this suffocating silence. He looked around, and with a smile, he said, “You’re not wrong, the number of people that should be alive really is still a bit too high!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen the elder spoke the final syllable, as if in response to his words, most of the arbitration officials on the ground twitched a bit, and then a strand of blood flowed out from their mouths and noses. The four curse masters who were still sitting by the blood pond’s edges were horrified as they watched the blood pond surge. Four streaks of blood that were even thicker than their arms fiercely poured over! In that instant, the sea of blood poured into the curse masters’ stomachs, turning them into spheres!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe blood in the blood pond quickly decreased, and soon after, the bottom could be seen, revealing the steel-cast dragon coffin immersed within. The four curse masters collapsed onto their backs one after another, the expressions revealed from their eyes completely that of fear and suffering. From their separated pupils, one could even see a bloody redness that was currently spreading! Their bodies swelled up like balls, and the skin was swollen to a bursting point. One could see the veins and arteries underneath. It was quite the miracle that they didn’t burst yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMeanwhile, the fetters and handcuffs binding Peperus’ limbs were covered in a thin layer of frost, and then they disappeared. However, the alloy steel shackles that were covered by it quickly turned an ash gray, and then they crumbled apart into ashes like charcoal, dissolving just like that. Peperus was thrown onto the ground, the long period of torment making it extremely difficult for her to even climb to her feet. Peperus clenched her teeth and supported herself. With a half kneeling posture, she said, “Peperus has seen great one before!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I guess you haven’t disappointed me too greatly.” The old man indifferently said. Without even giving her a look, he directly walked over to Su’s side. He looked at the piece of cloth that had a bit of scorched traces on it, and then he squatted down, wiping away a bit of blood from Su’s temple region before carefully folding up the cloth and placing it back into his clothes pocket.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Great one, is he dead?” Peperus asked.

Then, he walked to the already dried blood pond. With a wave of his hand, the extremely heavy steel cast dragon coffin slowly rose from the ground and landed in the old man’s right hand. Carrying this enormous heavy coffin seemed like carrying a thin porcelain plate for this old man.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You should bring this little fella back to Dragon City. Perhaps they might have some way to rescue him. The little fella isn’t bad, his last moments were barely acceptable. It would be a bit of a pity if he died just like that. You should return after completing this task.” After speaking, the elder carried this enormous steel coffin and walked out of the church’s entrance, quickly disappearing into the boundless darkness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e---\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe seemed to have somehow returned to the green sea, hearing the noises and watching those blurry figures come and go. Countless faces appeared in front of him, but none of them remained in his memory. They were trying to say something, and they would even ask him a few questions. The language they used was clearly one he could understand, but for some reason, he couldn’t understand exactly what was being said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eInside of that green sea, time, space, and sensations interweaved together into countless illogical pieces, attacking at him in fast and overwhelming amounts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was a suffocating world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDuring that unbearable moment, he was just like a fish that was washed up ashore, risking everything he had to jump a final time. At the end of his jump, he finally broke through the ocean surface and reached a brand new world. This world was much more realistic. In addition, once he emerged from the water surface, he saw a face. Unlike the world within the green sea, this was a face he recognized, one that he had a deep impression of. Only, at that moment, no matter how he tried to think about it, he couldn’t think of who it was. Before he was able to think things through, he sank into that green sea again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBefore long, an abrupt icy cold feeling woke him up from this slumber!

There was a similar amount of fine catheters that were connected to various vessels in his body, sending all types of medicinal liquid slowly into his body. At first glance, Su looked like a strange monster that was formed from data lines and catheters.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWithout any reaction from his body, just by seeing this scene alone, Su already had some understanding of his own injuries. However, from his sluggish memory, another matter surfaced that made Su’s expression change greatly. “Helen, could it be that we have to use the medicine from last time again?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Of course not.” Helen’s reply made Su feel slightly at ease, and he also felt a bit better about the state of his injuries. The recovery medications last time made Persephone take on a huge debt and also take risks out of desperation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen gently lowered Su’s head and coldly said, “It’s too early to be happy. This time, the reason we didn’t use those medicine is because Phoney couldn’t afford it. In addition, with her current financial situation, no one would lend her any money unless she used her body as collateral.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s pupils rapidly shrunk.

However, Su’s sharp perception told him that Helen’s attitude towards him was a bit more moderate, not like the coldness and gloominess at the very beginning. Su’s tense body slowly relaxed. Right now, he couldn’t do anything for Persephone, and the most important thing was to recover from his injuries first. However, the feeling he received from every part of his body cast a shadow over his mind.
