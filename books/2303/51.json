Lifting her into his arms, he cradled her against his chest. She was dying, her heartbeat slow and irregular, so faint he could scarcely hear it. Her skin was cool beneath his fingertips. \"Daisy. Dammit, don\u0027t do this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik?\" Her eyelids fluttered open. \"Erik, are you there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you holding me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As close as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" she murmured. \"I never stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me bring you across before it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to be a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to leave Erik, but she couldn\u0027t endure the pain that burned through her any longer. With each labored breath she took, the world around her grew darker. In the distance, a faint light grew bright, brighter, beckoning her. Indistinct shadows moved beyond the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, one of them took on shape and substance until it resembled her grandfather. Smiling, he held out his hand. \"Come along, Daisy, it\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandpa O\u0027Donnell,\" she murmured, \"is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, poppet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for his hand and as she did so, the pain disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy!\" Erik\u0027s arm tightened around her. \"Don\u0027t leave me! Dammit, don\u0027t leave me here in the dark without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words, so filled with love and sorrow, pulled her back. How could she leave him when he needed her so? Was this what Grandmother O\u0027Donnell had meant when she said Daisy\u0027s compass might guide her in paths she had never thought to follow? Erik\u0027s arms tightened around Daisy. He could feel her slipping away. \"Daisy, hang on.\" Perhaps a doctor could help her, yet even as the thought crossed his mind, he knew she was beyond medical help. \"Daisy.\" He hadn\u0027t wept in centuries, but now, at the thought of losing her, tears scalded his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy blinked as his tears dripped like red rain onto her cheeks. \"Erik...\" With a sigh of resignation, she closed her eyes. Hadn\u0027t she always known, deep down, that it would come to this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it,\" she murmured, and went limp in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik choked back a sob. Had he waited too long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePraying it wasn\u0027t too late, he bent his head to her neck and drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 38\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was drifting, floating. The beautiful bright light had enveloped her grandfather, then faded and disappeared, leaving her frightened and alone in a world of darkness and pain. Had she lost her chance at heaven? Was she in hell? Was that why her blood seemed to be on fire, why everything seemed bathed in crimson? She tried to fight her way out of the darkness but her body felt heavy, lethargic. She willed her toes and fingers to move, felt a sharp stab of fear when nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this death, this horrible sense of loss?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf nothingness...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik sat at Daisy\u0027s side all through that long, seemingly endless night. Earlier, he had removed her bloody clothing, washed the blood from her neck, then slipped a nightgown over her head. When that was done, he had brought her to his place and put her in his bed. Since then, his mind had been filled with doubts. Had she known what she was asking for? Would she regret her decision when she regained consciousness and realized the full extent of what he had done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned low in his throat. Had he done the right thing? She would be alienated from her family and friends now. Damn. He could only imagine what Alex would say. Nothing good, that was for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, he caressed Daisy\u0027s cheek. Her skin was cool, her face pale, her breathing so shallow, he could scarcely hear it even with his vampiric senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBending down, he kissed her brow. \"Fight, Daisy,\" he murmured. \"I\u0027ve done all I can. Now, it\u0027s up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the coming of dawn, he carried her down to his lair. Tucking her close to his side, he stared into the darkness. Tomorrow night would tell the tale. If she awoke at the setting of the sun, she would be his forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice penetrated the thick darkness, a voice speaking her name. \"Erik?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy fought her way through the smothering darkness and when she opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was Erik sitting beside her on the bed, his brow creased with worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him. He looked the same, yet different somehow. \"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No. How do you feel?\" Because he hadn\u0027t wanted her to be frightened by waking in his lair, he had brought her upstairs to the bedroom before she regained consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I feel...I don\u0027t know. Why does everything look so bright?\" she asked, squinting, and then she covered her ears with her hands. \"What\u0027s that noise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a truck going by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds like a tank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded. \"Just take it easy. What do you remember from last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night? There was a young man...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a vampire!\" She lifted a hand to her neck. \"He bit me! It hurt more than anything...not like when you bite me...\" She frowned. \"And then you were there, and...\" Her eyes widened as her memory returned. \"What have you done? Oh, Lord, what have you done!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy...it\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! How could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked me to, don\u0027t you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No...no, I wouldn\u0027t. I never wanted...\" She paused, her gaze sliding away from his as another memory surfaced. Erik\u0027s voice, pleading with her. Don\u0027t leave me! Dammit, don\u0027t leave me here in the dark without you. The anguish in his voice had pierced her heart and she had asked him to bring her across, to make her what he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel Erik watching her, his gaze wary as he waited for her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting up, she ran her hands over her arms, her face. She was a vampire now, and there was no going back. She should be furious with him, with herself, yet she couldn\u0027t seem to work up any anger, couldn\u0027t even decide how she felt about what had happened. She wasn\u0027t happy to be a vampire, but she was glad to be alive. Or Undead. She wasn\u0027t crazy about the idea of existing on blood, either, she thought, and then she looked at Erik and grinned in spite of herself. At least she wouldn\u0027t have to drink alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik frowned at her. \"Is something funny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you grinning at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking how happy I am that I don\u0027t have to drink alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, bemused, and then he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy laughed with him. She laughed until her sides ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she wept for all she had lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a loss as to what to do, Erik could only sit there. He had never turned anyone before; he had no idea what to expect or how she would react. The main thing he remembered from his first night as a vampire was a horrible thirst, but Daisy didn\u0027t seem to be plagued by that, perhaps because, in desperation, he had given her as much of his blood as she could hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore softly. He yearned to take her in his arms, but wondered if his touch would be welcome. Listening to her cry was the worst pain he had ever known--worse than the touch of the sun, worse than the agony he had suffered in Costain\u0027s dungeon. Worse, because he had caused it. Had he done what he\u0027d known to be right, he never would have let things go this far. Instead, he had selfishly sought her out, thinking more of easing his own loneliness than worrying about where their relationship would lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a last sniff, Daisy wiped her eyes and face with a corner of the sheet. \"I\u0027m sorry, I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t apologize. What the hell do you have to be sorry for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at him. \"Are you mad at me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He stared at her, completely baffled. \"Why would I be mad at you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy, I...\" He raked his hand through his hair. \"I\u0027m the one who should be asking your forgiveness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what? You didn\u0027t do anything wrong. I...I asked you to bring me across.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He blew out a breath, remembering how he had begged her not to leave him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew what I was doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" She tilted her head to the side. \"Are you sorry you brought me over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" His gaze moved over her face. She had always been beautiful; she was even more so now. Though subtle, changes in her appearance assured that when she called, no man would be able to resist her. \"Are you sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said quickly. How could she be sorry when it meant spending an eternity with the man she loved? \"Unless you don\u0027t want me anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not want you? Are you out of your mind?\" He had never been less than confident around women before, but this new Daisy put him off his stride. He had expected her to be angry, to berate him for what he had done; instead, she seemed to be waiting for something, though he had no idea what it might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to kiss me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that what she had been waiting for? He blinked at her, and then he smiled. \"As you wish,\" he said. \"But I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be able to stop at just a kiss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes twinkling with merriment, she smiled a seductive smile. \"Who asked you to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurmuring her name, he wrapped her in his arms. She was his now, he thought as he claimed her lips with his, always and forever his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy shook her head as they neared her parents\u0027 home. \"I don\u0027t think I can do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can,\" Erik said patiently. \"There\u0027s nothing to be afraid of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hah! That\u0027s easy for you to say.\" Daisy glared at him. Becoming a vampire hadn\u0027t been nearly as awful as she had expected. With Erik to guide her, she had learned to use her preternatural powers until they were almost second nature. Sometimes, she wondered how she had ever existed without them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik had taught her to dissolve into mist, to scurry up the side of a building as easily as a spider, to leap tall buildings, move faster than the human eye could follow. Most importantly, he had taught her the intricacies of hunting, how to attract her prey and call it to her, how to take what she needed without taking too much or doing any lasting harm to her victim. She had resisted the urge to feed as long as she could, certain that she would never be able to do it. Convinced that existing on human blood would be revolting, she had been shocked to find it immensely pleasant and not the least bit repulsive. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-51.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
