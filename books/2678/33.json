And then I see it\u0027s him himself, right enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely the three men must have presented a bizarre picture: Burgess, the guard, neat and tidy in his blue railway uniform; Agar, dressed splendidly in a formal suit, his face and hands a cadaverous bloated green; and Pierce, sagged to his hands and knees, his clothing shredded and sooty black from head to foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they all recovered quickly, and worked with swift efficiency. Agar had completed the switch; the safes were locked up again, with their new treasure of lead shot; the five leather satchels stood by the van door in a neat row, each laden with gold bullion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce got to his feet and took his watch from his waistcoat, an incongruously clean gold object at the end of a soot black chain. He snapped it open: it was 8:37.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five minutes,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgar nodded. In five minutes, they would pass the most deserted stretch of track, where Pierce had arranged for Barlow to wait and pick up the flung satchels. Pierce sat down and stared through the open van door at the countryside rushing past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you well, then?\" Agar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well enough,\" Pierce said. \"But I don\u0027t cherish going back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, it\u0027s frazzled you proper,\" Agar said. \"You\u0027re a sight and no mistake. Will you change when you\u0027re snug in the compartment again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce, breathing heavily, was slow to comprehend the meaning of the words. \"Change?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, your dunnage.\" Agar grinned. \"You step off at Folkestone as you stand now and you\u0027ll cause no end of stir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce watched the green, rolling hills flash past, and listened to the rumble of the carriage on the roadbed. Here was a problem he had never considered and had made no plans for. But Agar was right: he couldn\u0027t step out at Folkestone looking like a ragged chimney sweep, especially as Fowler was almost certain to seek him out to say goodbye. \"I have no change,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What say?\" Agar said, for the noise of the wind through the open van door was loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no change of clothing,\" Pierce said. \"I never expected...\" His voice trailed off; he frowned. \"I brought no other clothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgar laughed heartily. \"Then you\u0027ll play the proper ragamuffin, as you\u0027ve made me play the stiff.\" Agar slapped his knee. \"There\u0027s a daffy of justice, I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing funny,\" Pierce snapped. \"I have acquaintances on the train who will surely see me and mark the change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgar\u0027s merriment was quashed instantly. He scratched his head with a green hand. \"And these same of your acquaintances, they\u0027ll miss you if you\u0027re not there at the station?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the devil\u0027s own trap, then,\" Agar said. He looked around the van, at the various trunks and pieces of luggage. \"Give me your ring of tickles, and I\u0027ll break a pit or two, and we\u0027ll find some square-rigged duns to fit you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out his hand to Pierce for the ring of picklocks, but Pierce was looking at his watch. It was now two minutes to the drop-off point. Thirteen minutes after that, the train would stop in Ashford, and by then Pierce had to be out of the luggage van and back in his own compartment. \"There\u0027s no time,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only chance--- \" Agar began, but broke off. Pierce was looking him up and down in a thoughtful way. \"No,\" Agar said. \"Damn you, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re about the same size,\" Pierce said. \"Now be quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away and the screwsman undressed, muttering oaths of all sorts. Pierce watched the countryside. They were close now: he bent to position the satchels at the lip of the open van door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he saw a tree by the roadside, one of the landmarks he\u0027d long since set for himself. Soon there would be the stone fence.... There it was... and then the old abandoned rusty cart. He saw the cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, he saw the crest of a hill and Barlow in profile beside the coach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now!\" he said and, with a grunt, flung one satchel after another out of the moving train. He watched them bounce on the ground, one by one. He saw Barlow hastening down the hill toward them. Then the train went around a curve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at Agar, who had stripped to his underclothes, and held his fine duds out for Pierce. \"Here you are, and damn your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce took the clothes, rolled them into as tight a ball as he could manage, wrapped the parcel with Agar\u0027s belt, and, without another word, swung out the open door and into the wind. Burgess closed the van door, and a few moments later the guard and Agar heard a clink as the bolt was thrown, and another clink as the padlock was locked once more. They heard the scratching of Pierces feet as he scrambled up to the roof; and then they saw the rope, which had been taut across the roof from slapper to slapper, suddenly go slack. The rope was pulled out. They heard Pierces footsteps on the roof a moment longer, and then nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn me, I\u0027m cold,\" Agar said. \"You\u0027d best lock me back up,\" and he crawled into his coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce had not progressed far on his return journey before he realized he had made still another error in his planning: he had assumed it would take the same amount of time to go from the van to his compartment as it took to go from his compartment to the van. But almost immediately he recognized his mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe return trip, against the blast of the wind, was much slower. And he was further burdened by the parcel of Agar\u0027s clothing, which he clutched to his chest, leaving only one hand free to grip the roofing as he crawled forward along the length of the train. His progress was agonizingly slow. Within minutes he realized that he was going to miss his intended schedule, and badly. He would still be crawling along the rooftops when the train reached Ashford Station; and then he would be spotted, and the jig would be up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce had a moment of profound rage that this final step in the plan should be, in the end, the only thing to go irretrievably wrong. The fact that the error was entirely his own doing merely increased his fury. He gripped the pitching, swaying carnage roof and swore into the wind, but the blast of air was so loud he did not hear his own voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew, of course, what he must do, but he did not think about it. He continued forward as best he could. He was midway along the fourth of the seven second-class carriages when he felt the train begin to slow beneath him. The whistle screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquinting ahead, he saw Ashford Station, a tiny red rectangle with a gray roof in the far distance. He could not make out any details, but he knew that in less than a minute the train would be near enough that passengers on the platform could see him on the roof. For a brief moment, he wondered what they would think if they did see him, and then he got up and ran, sprinting forward, leaping from one car to the next without hesitation, half blinded by the smoke that poured from the engine funnel back toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow he made it safely to the first-class coach, swung down, opened the door, dropped into his compartment, and immediately pulled the blinds. The train was now chugging very slowly, and as Pierce collapsed into his seat he heard the hiss of the brakes and the porter\u0027s cry: \"Ashford Station... Ashford... Ashford...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 45 The End of the Line\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-seven minutes later, the train arrived at Folkestone, the end of the South Eastern Railway line, and all the passengers disembarked. Pierce emerged from his compartment, appearing, he said, \"far better than I deserved, but far from sartorial correctness, to put it lightly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he had hastily employed handkerchief and spittle to clean his face and hands, he had discovered the soot and grime on his flesh to be most recalcitrant. As he had no mirror, he could only guess at the condition of his face, but his hands were no cleaner than a kind of pale gray. Furthermore, he suspected that his sandy-colored hair was now a good deal darker than previously, and he was grateful that most of it would be covered by his top hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut except for the top hat, all his clothing fitted poorly. Even in an age when most people\u0027s clothing fitted poorly, Pierce felt himself especially noticeable. The trousers were almost two inches short of an acceptable length, and the cut of the coat, although elegant enough, was of the extreme and showy fashion that true gentlemen of breeding avoided as indecently nouveau riche. And, of course, he reeked of dead cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus Pierce stepped out onto the crowded Folkestone platform with an inner dread. He knew that most observers would put down his appearance as a sham: it was common enough for men who aspired to be gentlemen to obtain secondhand goods, which they wore proudly, oblivious to the ill fit of the garments. But Pierce was all too aware that Henry Fowler, whose entire conscious being was attuned to the nuances of social standing, would spot the peculiarity of Pierce\u0027s appearance in an instant, and would wonder what was amiss. He would almost certainly realize that Pierce had changed clothing for some reason during the ride, and he would wonder about that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce\u0027s only hope lay in keeping his distance from Fowler. He planned, if he could, to make off with a distant wave of goodbye, and an air of pressing business that precluded social amenities. Fowler would certainly understand a man who looked after business first. And , from a distance, with the intervening throng of people, Pierce\u0027s bizarre dress might possibly escape his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it happened, Fowler came charging through the crowd before Pierce could spot him. Fowler had the woman beside him, and he did not look happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Edward,\" Fowler began crisply, \"I should be forever in your debt if you would---\" He broke off, and his mouth fell open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, Pierce thought. It\u0027s finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward,\" Fowler said, staring at his friend in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce\u0027s mind was working fast, trying to anticipate questions, trying to come up with answers; he felt himself break into a sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, my dear fellow, you look terrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Pierce began, \"you see---\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look ghastly near to death itself. Why, you are positively gray as a corpse. When you told me you suffered from trains, I hardly imagined... Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe so,\" Pierce said, with a heartfelt sigh. \"I expect I shall be much improved after I dine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dine? Yes, of course, you must dine at once, and take a draught of brandy, too. Your circulation is sluggish, from the look of you. I should join you myself, but--- ah, I see they are now unloading the gold which is my deep responsibility. Edward, can you excuse me? Are you truly well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate your concern,\" Pierce began, \"and---\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I can help him,\" the girl said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, capital idea,\" Fowler said. \"Most splendid. Splendid. She\u0027s a charmer, Edward, and I leave her to you.\" Fowler gave him a queer look at this last comment, and then he hurried off down the platform toward the luggage van, turning back once to call, \"Remember, a good strong draught of brandy\u0027s the thing.\" And then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce gave an enormous sigh, and turned to the girl \"How could he miss my clothes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should see your countenance,\" she said. \"You look horrible.\" She glanced at his clothes. \"And I see you\u0027ve a dead man\u0027s dunnage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine were torn by the wind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you have done the pull?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce only grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce left the station shortly before noon. The girl, Brigid Lawson, remained behind to supervise the loading of her brother\u0027s coffin onto a cab. Much to the irritation of the porters, she turned down several waiting cabs at the station, claiming she had made arrangements in advance for a particular one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cab did not arrive until after one o\u0027clock. The driver, an ugly massive brute with a scar across his forehead, helped with the loading, then whipped up the horses and galloped away. No one noticed when, at the end of the street, the cab halted to pick up another passenger, an ashen-colored gentleman in ill-fitting clothes. Then the cab rattled off, and disappeared from sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy noon, the strongboxes of the Huddleston \u0026amp; Bradford Bank had been transferred, under armed guard, from the Folkestone railway station to the Channel steamer, which made the crossing to Ostend in four hours. Allowing for the Continental time change, it was 5 pm. when French customs officials signed the requisite forms and took possession of the strongboxes. These were then transported, under armed guard, to the Ostend railway terminus for shipment to Paris by train the following morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the morning of May 23rd, French representatives of the bank of Louis Bonnard et Fils arrived at Ostend to open the strongboxes and verify their contents, prior to placing them aboard the nine o\u0027clock train to Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, at about 8:15 a.m. on May 23rd, it was discovered that the strongboxes contained a large quantity of lead shot, sewn into individual cloth packets, and no gold at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis astounding development was immediately reported to London by telegraph, and the message reached Huddleston \u0026amp; Bradford\u0027s Westminster offices shortly after 10 a.m. Immediately, it provoked the most profound consternation in that firm\u0027s brief but respectable history, and the furor did not abate for months to come. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-33.html","bookId":2678,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:35 AM"}
