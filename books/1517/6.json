In drow society, this was not so much a nurturing time as an indoctrinating time. The child had to learn basic motor and language skills, as did children of all the intelligent races, but a drow elf also had to be grilled on the precepts that bound the chaotic society together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of a male child such as Drizzt, Vierna spent hour after endless hour reminding him that he was inferior to the drow females. Since almost all of this portion of Drizzt\u0027s life was spent in the family chapel, he encountered no males except during times of communal worship. Even when all in the house gathered for the unholy ceremonies, Drizzt remained silent at Vierna\u0027s side, with his gaze obedi-ently on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Drizzt was old enough to follow commands, Vierna\u0027s workload lessened. Still, she spent many hours teaching her younger brother-presently they were work-ing on the intricate facial, hand, and body movements of the silent code. Often, though, she just set Drizzt about the endless task of cleaning the domed chapel. The room was barely a fifth the size of the great hall in House Baenre, but it could hold all the dark elves of House Do\u0027Urden with a hundred seats to spare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a wean-mother was not so bad now, Vierna thought, but still she wished that she could devote more of her time to her studies. If Matron Malice had appointed Maya to the task of rearing the child, Vierna might already have been ordained as a high priestess. Vierna still had an-other five years in her duties with Drizzt; Maya might attain high priestesshood before her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna dismissed that possibility. She could not afford to worry about such problems.She would finish her tenure as wean-mother in just a few short years. On or around his tenth birthday, Drizzt would be appointed page prince of the family and would serve all the household equally. If her work with Drizzt did not disappoint Matron Malice, Vierna knew that she would get her due.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go up the wall.\" Vierna instructed. \"Tend to that statue.\" She pointed to a sculpture of a naked drow female about twenty feet from the floor. Young Drizzt looked up at it, con-fused. He couldn\u0027t possibly climb up to the sculpture and wipe it clean while holding any secure perch. Drizzt knew the high price of disobedience, though-even of hesitation-and he reached up, searching for his first hand-hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not like that!\" Vierna scolded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Drizzt dared to ask, for he had no idea of what his sister was hinting at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will yourself up to the gargoyle\" Vierna explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s small face crinkled in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a noble of House Do\u0027Urden!\" Vierna shouted at him. \"Or at least you will one day earn that distinction. In your neck-purse you possess the emblem of the house, an item of considerable magic\" Vierna still wasn\u0027t certain if Drizzt was ready for such a task; levitation was a high mani-festation of innate drow magic, certainly more difficult that limning objects in faerie fire or summoning globes of dark-ness. The Do\u0027Urden emblem heightened these innate powers of drow elves, magic that usually emerged as a drow matured. Whereas most drow nobles could summon the magical energy to levitate once every day or so, the no-bles of House Do\u0027Urden, with their insignia tool, could do so repeatedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, Vierna would never have tried this on a male child younger than ten, but Drizzt had shown her so much potential in the last couple of years that she saw no harm in the attempt. \"Just put yourself in line with the statue\" she explained, \"and will yourself to rise\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt looked up at the female carving, then lined his feet just out in front of the thing\u0027s angled and delicate face. He put a hand to his collar, trying to attune himself to the em-blem. He had sensed before that the magic coin possessed some type of power, but it was only a raw sensation, a child\u0027s intuition. Now that Drizzt had some focus and confir-mation to his suspicions, he clearly felt the vibrations of magical energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA series of deep breaths cleared distracting thoughts from the young drow\u0027s mind. He blocked out the other sights of the room; all he saw was the statue, the destina-tion. He felt himself grow lighter, his heels went up, and then he was on one toe, though he felt no weight upon it. Drizzt looked over at Vierna, his smile wide in amazement . . . then he tumbled to a heap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Foolish male!\" Vierna scolded. \"1ry again! 1ry a thousand times if you must!\" She reached for the snake-headed whip on her belt. \"If you fail, . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt looked away from her, cursing himself. His own elation had caused the spell to falter. He knew that he could do it now, though, and he was not afraid of being beaten. He concentrated again on the sculpture and let the magical en-ergy gather within his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna, too, knew that Drizzt would eventually succeed. His mind was keen, as sharp as any Vierna had ever known, including those of the other females of House Do\u0027Urden. The child was stubborn, too; Drizzt would not let the magic defeat him. She knew he would stand under the sculpture until he fainted from hunger if need be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna watched him go through a series of small suc-cesses and failures, the last one dropping Drizzt from a height of nearly ten feet. Vierna flinched, wondering if he was seriously hurt. Drizzt, whatever his wounds, did not even cry out but moved back into position and started con-centrating allover again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is young for that\" came a comment from behind Vierna. She turned in her seat to see Briza standing over Iher, a customary scowl on the older sister\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps\" Vierna replied, \"but I\u0027ll not know until I let him try\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whip him when he fails\" Briza suggested, pulling her cruel six-headed instrument from her belt. She gave the whip a loving look-as if it were some sort of pet-and let a snake\u0027s head writhe about her neck and face. \"Inspiration\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put it away\" Vierna retorted. \"Drizzt is mine to rear, and I need no help from you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should watch how you speak to a high priestess,\" Briza warned, and all of the snake heads, extensions of her thoughts, turned menacingly toward Vierna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" As Matron Malice will watch how you interfere with my tasks\" Vierna was quick to reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriza put her whip away at the mention of Matron Malice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your tasks\" she echoed scornfully. \"You are too yielding for such a chore. Male children must be disciplined; they must ? be taught their place\" Realizing that Vierna\u0027s threat held dir consequences, the older sister turned and left. Vlerna let BrlZa have the last word. The wean-mother looked back to Drizzt, still trying to get up to the statue. \"Enough!\" she ordered, recognizing that the child was tir-ing; he could barely get his feet off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will do it!\" Drizzt snapped back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna liked his determination, but not the tone of his re-ply. Perhaps there was some truth to Briza\u0027s words. Vierna snapped the snake-headed whip from her belt. A little inspi-ration might go a long way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna sat in the chapel the next day, watching Drizzt hard at work polishing the s1atue of the naked female. He had levitated the full twenty feet in his first attempt this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna could not help but be disappointed when Drizzt did not look back to her and smile at the success. She saw him now, hovering up in the air, his hands a blur as they worked the brushes. Most vividly of all, though, Vierna saw the scars on her brother\u0027s naked back, the legacy of their \"inspirational\" discussion. In the infrared spectrum, the whip lines showed clearly, trails of warmth where the insu-lating layers of skin had been stripped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna understood the gain in beating a child, particularly a male child. Few drow males ever raised a weapon against a female, unless under the order of some other female. \"How much do we lose?\" Vierna wondered aloud. \"What more could one such as Drizzt become?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she heard the words spoken aloud, Vierna quickly brushed the blasphemous thoughts from her mind. She as-pired to become a high priestess of the Spider Queen, Lloth the Merciless. Such thoughts were not in accord with the rules of her station. She cast an angry glare on her little brother, transferring her guilt, and again took out her in-strument of punishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have to whip Drizzt again this day, for the sac-rilegious thoughts he had inspired within her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the relationship continued for another five years, with Drizzt learning the basic lessons of life in drow society while endlessly cleaning the chapel of House Do\u0027Urden. Be-yond the supremacy of female drow (a lesson always accen-tuated by the wicked snake-headed whip), the most compelling lessons were those concerning the surface elves, the faeries. Evil empires often bound themselves in webs of hate toward fabricated enemies, and none in the history of the world were better at it than the drow. From the first day they were able to understand the spoken word, drow children were taught that whatever was wrong in their lives could be blamed on the surface elves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever the fangs of Vierna\u0027s whip sliced into Drizzt\u0027s back, he cried out for the death of a faerie. Conditioned ha. tred was rarely a rational emotion. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-elf-trilogy-homeland-the-dark-elf-trilogy-1/page-6.html","bookId":1517,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:40:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:40:17 AM"}
