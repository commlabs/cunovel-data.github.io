He, too, looked worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCneajna moved toward me, but Ferenc grabbed her arm and tugged her way. Venomous anger burned in her eyes and she bared her fangs at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If she allows it, you may speak to her. But you will not be allowed to kill her. Understood?” Gavril shifted his gaze to me. “Do you agree to speak with him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew immediately I truly had no choice. Gavril had sworn that Vlad would not kill me and I could not refuse. Otherwise, it would seem I did not trust the regent. But, also, I recognized the desire within me to speak with Vlad. Much was left unsaid between us and now was the time to set the past to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded my head. “Yes, I agree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may speak in the hall through those doors,” Ilinca said, waving her hand to the far end of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasting one last look at Ignatius and Laura, I gave them a swift smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad held out his arm, and I took it. Together, we strode from the ballroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 34\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gilded door shut behind us with a soft click that echoed in the spacious hallway. To my left, enormous windows overlooked the moonlight drenched gardens below. Tall pillars rose like sentinels to the arched and elaborately painted ceiling above. A few chairs and tables were tucked along the wall under enormous paintings depicting the lush life of gods and goddesses. At the far end of the hall a set of gilded double doors were closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad stood beside me, tall and imposing. His silence did not settle my already frayed nerves. I felt the tension between us coiled tight, like a viper ready to strike. I was shredded with emotion. He had saved my life and I was grateful. I had betrayed him, gravely wounded him, stolen his power, and entombed him. Yet, I knew that was not the worst of my sins in his eyes. My worst sin was my refusal to be at his side, to love him, and to be his true wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands trembling at my sides, I took a step further into the hallway, my eyes averted from his stoic face. His hand lashed out and captured my wrist. Hesitating, I stood in silence, waiting. He had been warned he could not kill me, but I knew he would do as he pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How,” he began in a low, cold voice, “could you be such a fool?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Release me,” I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted my wrist, tugging me about to face him. Red fires burned in his glittering green eyes. Drawing me up against him, he gazed into my face, a cruel twist to his mouth. “Do you not realize what you have done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have banished you from my life,” I answered vehemently. “Which is all I ever truly wanted since you cursed me to this existence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have become their pawn!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better theirs than yours!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an exclamation of anger, he threw me away from him. I fell to the shining marble floor and caught myself on my hands. He was on me in an instant, his cloak flaring out to engulf my fallen form. Hovering over me, his sharp teeth gnashed as he spoke. “You would rather serve them than be with me, is that so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes! I would rather serve them then be enslaved by you!” With force that shocked him, I threw him off. I glided to my feet and stood defiantly before him. “I refuse to bow to your wishes any longer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am your Master!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will not serve you!” My rage consumed me, making my eyes burn and my teeth descend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence filled the hall as he stood pondering my words. He made a dismissive gesture with one hand, as though discarding the entire conversation. “Enough of this. Come, wife. We shall go, not to the castle, but to London. Come. Come! We’ll go to your brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I answered. “I will not depart with you. Do not dare to use my brother against me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are being foolish and unreasonable,” Vlad chided. His green eyes flashed with fury and he took a step closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Return to your castle with Cneajna and leave me be,” I said in a hushed voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave you with my duplicitous brother? The man you have bedded in my absence and to whom you declared your love before the House of Gavril!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stomped my foot. “I love him! I love him with all my heart! He is my joy and my life! Do not dare to come against us. I will kill you. I will not leave you in limbo, but strike off your head!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back, regarding me. “He is a pawn of our Mistress sent to spy upon us and report back to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yet, you love him and will be with him.” Vlad scoffed at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He did not murder my family,” I retorted. Tears threatened to spill down my cheeks and I fought them back. I would not be weak before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did what was necessary. What is my nature. What is my right,” he answered firmly. “Surely you realize that truth now. You are a Master now. You have a fledgling. You know how deeply a Master feels for the creation of their blood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words were true. I did know. I would do anything for Laura. I loved her completely. The thought of her not at my side brought a piercing pain and sadness to my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad drew closer, realizing he had found a weakness in my armor against him. His hand lingered near my cheek, his power brushing over my skin like a feather. “Now you know. What I would do to have you near me. Blood of my blood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him, yet I could not help but believe him. Was this our bond renewing despite the cursed ring? His presence empowered, yet angered me. “You murdered my family and forced yourself upon me. Beat me, hurt me, threatened me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I thought you were a mere pawn, yes, but as your power grew and our bond strengthened...” He let his words trail off as he stepped closer to me, his lips suddenly close to mine. “I loved you, my countess. I loved you and knew I could not bear to lose what I had created. That is why I came here to stand for you despite your betrayal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my eyes to gaze into his. “I do not doubt that you love me, but I have seen with my own eyes what you do to those you love!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwiftly, I stepped away from him, but once more he caught my arm. This time he slid his hand down to grasp mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They were not you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your manipulations will not work on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember our last night together,” he whispered, his body pressing against my back. He lowered his face to whisper in my ear. “You came to me willingly and we were joined as man and wife. We were powerful and we were at peace. Come to me once more and that is how it shall be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a night of lies. I needed to be consoled. Ignatius was not with me and you were a convenient replacement.” I bit off my words tersely as I tried to maintain my fury against him. I did remember that night. I had used my wiles to find solace in my loneliness. At times I regretted my actions, yet at others I did not. After all he had done, he owed me a moment of peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coldness of his hands chilled me as he gripped my shoulders firmly, but gently. His lips against my temple, he said, “You did not think of him that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords of truth that struck me to the core. I wrested away from him. “Enough of this. I will not return with you. Say your piece and I shall say mine, and we shall be done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith eagle swiftness, he caught me up in his arms. His lips covered my lips, my cheeks, my neck. I gripped his arms with my hands to thrust him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Release me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah ha!” he exclaimed as his hand closed over my ring. With triumph, he snatched the cursed ring off my finger and flung it away. The curse removed, my blood responded to his call and his power flared through me. The kiss he inflicted on my lips consumed me and for a mere moment I was lost. The darkness within me called to him. His cold power washed over me. I was caught up in a vision of me standing at his side, both of us drenched in blood, our enemies at our feet. I could feel the triumph, the hate, and the cruelty emanating from us. I gasped, pulling away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not what you are!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers tangling in my hair, he forcibly drew me close. “We are one, you and I. We desire our freedom and fight against our enemies. Join me and one day this world can be ours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not like you!” I pressed at him with my hands, my fear making me weak. I would not be a brutal, sadistic monster like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving me back against a pillar, he slid his hands up under my gown. I could feel him hard against my belly and I was horribly afraid. I forgot myself, everything that I had accomplished, everything I had gained, and all I felt was the horrible fear that I was lost forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad’s teeth ripped into my neck, shoving his body against mine as I floundered against him. Rage filled me as I felt my body respond to his. It was vile to feel my flesh yearning for pleasure. This was the curse inflicted upon me by his blood. Bound to him with chains of evil that threatened what little I had left of my soul. I teetered on the edge of the abyss, darkness rushing up to wash over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, release me!” I cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exquisite pleasure of his bite made it difficult to fight him. I felt his power wrapping around me, seeking to join with me once more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-71.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
