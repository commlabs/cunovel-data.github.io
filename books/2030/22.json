Miranda did what he said because his hands were shaking so much she was afraid he\u0027d shoot her by accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you? What are you doing here?\" he demanded in a voice that shook almost as much as his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to get a glimpse of Her,\" she said, hoping she made it sound right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his eyes. \"How did you know She was here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Gardener told me, but I didn\u0027t know where She was being kept so I climbed up that tree to look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which affiliate are you with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew this would end in tears. What now, smarty pants?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda raised an eyebrow and said, \"Which affiliate are you with?\" Adding for good measure, \"I mean, I would remember a guy like you if I\u0027d seen you before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked! She saw him swallow hard, his Adam\u0027s apple bobbing up and down. She would never doubt How to Get-And Kiss-Your Guy again! He said, \"I\u0027d remember you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hit him with a dose of Winsome Smile and saw the Adam\u0027s apple do some more moving. She said, \"If I give you my hand to shake, will you shoot me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chortled and put down the gun. \"No,\" still chortling. Holding out his hand now. \"I\u0027m Craig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Craig, I\u0027m Miranda,\" she said, taking it. Then flipped him onto his back and knocked him out cold in a single silent move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her hand for a second in shock. She\u0027d definitely never done that before. That had been very cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027re going to be an idiot and risk everything, you might as well do what you came for. You know, instead of just staring at the guy you knocked out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bent to whisper, \"Sorry. Take three aspirin for your head when you wake up and you\u0027ll feel better,\" in his ear, and moved around the edge of the safe house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must have been an open window because she could hear voices here, the man who had been outside before now saying to someone, \"Are you comfortable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Sibby answering, \"No. I don\u0027t like this couch. I can\u0027t believe this is the nicest room in the house. It looks like a place for a grandma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda followed the sound of Sibby\u0027s voice and found herself standing in front of one of the street-facing plate-glass windows, looking through a gap in dark blue drapes into a living room. There was a spindly-looking couch, chair, and coffee table. Sibby was in the chair, her profile to Miranda, with a plate of Oreos in front of her. She looked fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was perched on the couch, smiling at Sibby, saying, \"So, where are we supposed to drop you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby took the top cookie off the Oreo and ate it. \"I\u0027ll tell you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man kept smiling. \"I\u0027d like to know so I can plan the route. We can\u0027t be too careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my gods, there\u0027s like hours before we go. I want to watch some TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda heard the man\u0027s heart speed up and saw his hand flex but he kept his tone light when he said, \"Of course.\" Then added, \"As soon as you tell me where we\u0027re taking you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby frowned at him. \"Are you deaf or something? I said I\u0027d tell you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s in your best interest to talk to me. Otherwise I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to bring in someone else. Someone a bit more... forceful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. But while I\u0027m waiting, can I please watch TV? Tell me you get cable. Oh gods, if you don\u0027t have MTV, I\u0027m going to be really pissed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stood up with an expression on his face like he wanted to break something, then abruptly turned to face the door. Miranda heard footsteps coming toward the room from the hallway, and with them a familiar cha-cha heartbeat. Two seconds later Deputy Sergeant Caleb Reynolds burst through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee? Sibby\u0027s in no danger. The police are here. Scram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputy Reynolds said to the man, \"What\u0027s taking so long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll change her mind.\" His heartbeat picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby glanced at him. \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb said, \"I\u0027m the Gardener.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was extremely not good, Miranda decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t very impressed with the front lawn,\" Sibby told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not that kind of Gardener. It\u0027s a nickname. They call me that because-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I\u0027m not even vaguely interested. I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re planning, Plant Boy-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gardener,\" he corrected, going a touch red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but if you need to know where I\u0027m supposed to be picked up by the Overseer, then you have to keep me alive, right? So you can\u0027t exactly threaten me with death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not death, no. But pain.\" He addressed the man. \"Go get me my tools, Byron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the man left the room, Sibby said, \"I\u0027m not going to tell you anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputy Reynolds circled around so he was leaning over her chair, his back to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me-\" he said, his heartbeat slowing down suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda did a round-off, smashing through the window feet first, then knocked him unconscious with a side kick to the neck before he could turn around. She bent to whisper, \"Sorry,\" in his ear, decided as punishment not to tell him about the aspirins, grabbed Sibby, sprinted to the car, and stepped on the gas. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-22.html","bookId":2030,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM"}
