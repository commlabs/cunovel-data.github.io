The phylactery stone embedded in his palm was the last bit of energy he could draw from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was enough: phylactery stones stored enough to satiate Paragons!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bookworm glowered bad-temperedly as he watched the simulation unfold. But he was confident this eighth mecha would prove to be the young man’s undoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a flash, Lan Jue’s silvery opponent vanished. Then, bolts of a strange black power bloomed to life all around him. Powerful vacuums pulled at him every which way, causing his suit to lose balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInter-spacial Discipline! Tears in the fabric of space!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue was stunned. He finally understood why his opponent had seemed so familiar – it was the Wine Master’s aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver challenger appeared once more in the sky above him. As he looked up, he was met with a silvery beam crashing down from on high. An orb of silvery light, containing with an unstable inter-spacial core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of explosive power, the inter-spacial disciplines weren’t quite a match for thunder. However, if you were to consider them by the metric of pure destructiveness the two were quite evenly matched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe electric power surrounding Lan Jue’s suite fluctuated violently. The outer layer prepared itself from the oppressive strike of the orb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust before impact, the manifestation of Lan Jue’s power changed, adopting a brilliant golden hue. The majestic, battered mecha he commanded was suddenly surrounded by an overpowering golden aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Skies, defend!” A commanding voice filled the arena. Everything stopped. It was as though the world had frozen, and now everything in their surroundings was painted gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire simulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Moron, what are you doing!? Stop it!” The Bookworm quickly lept to his feet and sent a wave of light careening towards the sim pod. The errant power lay over the pod like a membrane, blanketing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the simulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engineered world around him vanished. The Bookworm’s irritated face appeared in the darkness before Lan Jue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ehm…” Lan Jue sheepishly avoided the old man’s irritated expression. He immediately allowed his Discipline to disperse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eScreeeetch.\u003c/em\u003e The sim pod’s hatch creaked open allowing a plume of dark smoke to billow free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiuxiu and Lin Guoguo had raced over. They rustled to see inside and spotted Lan Jue’s sweat-soaked form. He looked fine, though, so the women visibly relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bookworm, who looked to be mostly dead most days, moved with a speed that was simply staggering. He effortlessly yanked Lan Jue from the simulator. His voice was furious. “Look at what you did! What the hell were you thinking?! Who told you to use proto powers? [1. Lazy translating. I believe earlier I translated the ability to fundamentally alter the rules of nature/physics as ‘protogenic’. If you guys have nothing better to do you could help me confirm :P I can’t find the chapter I first referenced this in.] Did I not tell you this machine can’t sustain Paragon level abilities?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003cem\u003eHack, cough!”\u003c/em\u003e Lan Jue coughed, giving the Bookworm an awkward and apologetic glance. “I’m very sorry, sir. It wasn’t intentional. I was caught up in the fight… I forgot it wasn’t real. You really made something incredible here. A damn miracle, almost. Ever since attaining God-rank, I felt like DreamNet had nothing more to offer me. Now, it has the capabilities to employ Discipline. It’s a game changer. Elder, you’re amazing. I’m sure your name will go down in history as one of the Three Alliances’ greatest scientists.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bookworm’s face softened under the deluge of praise. He let go of Lan Jue’s shirt. “Change your clothes, you stink. This little… monster!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue chortled and trotted off. It had been two hours of joyful, carefree practice. Excitement still filled him with energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had also been his first time tapping in to the phylactery stone. Every day during his meditations he’d inject some of his energy in to the stone, but he had yet to fill it entirely. One could only imagine the staggering amount of power it could contain. Just then it had taken him only a dozen seconds to have his power returned to just under half. It was a point he had to remember – It could heavily influence his combat time. Previously he had to be careful not to overtax himself, and be economical. Now, not so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lan Jue made his exit, the Bookworm stared forlornly at his ruined invention. He busied himself will diagnosing the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis original hope had been to watch Lan Jue suffer a vicious beating in the simulation. But who’d have thought he’d actually break the damn thing. Though it was, after all, only a semi-finished product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: center\"\u003eζ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeus-1 steadily made its descent into the Skyfire public airship hangar. The Accountant was still in a coma as they touched down. Lan Jue had to sling him over his shoulder before disembarking. There were too many people to handle on his own, so Lan Jue had to hire another verti-car to fit them all. Thus they all made their way to the Avenue together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car stopped just outside of the Avenue. As they approached, Lan Jue used his Councilman’s batch to get Su He and the Bookworm temporary blue badges for entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elder, will you be visiting the Keeper right away?” Lan Jue asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bookworm’s face was strange. His expression was almost sentimental. There was something there, but whether it was regret or pure madness was difficult to discern. Eventually, he nodded his affirmation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go. I want to see if that wrinkled toad really is dying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue and Su He exchanged a look. Lan Jue pondered for a moment, then spoke again. “I’ll accompany you. Xiuxiu, Guoguo, you guys head back. I’ll take the Tear now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes boss,” Xiuxiu responded. She immediately fished the Tear from her luggage and handed it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe Bookworm’s eyes flashed as he watched the exchange. “You bought it, eh? From the auction?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue smiled. “I have a use for it, elder. You’ll see later, I suspect. Shall we? This way, please.” As he spoke, Lan Jue urged him on with a welcoming motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bookworm slapped his hand away. “I know this place better than you do,” the crotchety old man rumbled. He stomped off down the Avenue with big strides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue and Su He fanned out behind the old man. The Accountant bounced along on Lan Jue’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, a permeating sense of peace and calm surrounded the library. Anyone who came here to actually read the books understood that there were a number of strict stipulations. For instance, damaging a book required the culprit to offer another of equal value, or otherwise you paid with your life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs one can imagine, the result was very few visitors. The books were all in pristine condition, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon entering the Library, the Bookworm ignored all that and stomped directly to the stairwell. Still his nose twitched incessantly as his did, taking in the particular aroma of an old book shop. He bore an expression of regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturned at last. But why, he pondered, did he not feel any joy over it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved through the place without even having to look around. He was as familiar with it as he was his replica back on Lir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he got to the Keeper’s office, he didn’t even knock. He simply pulled open the door and walked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the door opened, the large swivel chair behind the enormous office desk swung around. An old, craggy face came in to view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just wondering who would be so uncivilized as to just barge in, then I remembered you were coming,” the Keeper’s frail voice called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bookworm spat out his response. “Who are you calling uncivilized?! \u003cem\u003eYou’re\u003c/em\u003e the uncivilized one! And a soon to be dead swine as well. Hurry up and die, piss off, give my library back to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue pushed his way in, the Accountant still slung over his back. He eventually maneuvered him on to a nearby chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do to my grandson,” the Keeper grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I poisoned him,” the Bookworm replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Keeper sighed. “You’re a senior citizen. Can’t you act like a normal human person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bullshit,” the old man said crassly. “What’s not normal about me? I’m a hell of a lot more normal than you! You shit Paragon, mister \u003cem\u003eArcane Magus\u003c/em\u003e, you can’t even extend your own life. What right have you got to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was lying,” the Keeper said in that same quiet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003cem\u003eLied?\u003c/em\u003e Pfft-“ The Bookworm’s response was automatic, but after a second the words sunk in and his pupils narrowed. When he spoke again his voice was monstrously enraged. “W-what?! You lied? You’re not dying?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Keeper chuckled, unfazed. “Mmhm! By the time you’re dust I’ll still be stomping around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue suddenly had the sense he should leave the two alone, and escape while he still could. It was getting more dangerous by the second!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stooped down to pick up the Accountant once again when he heard a voice from behind him. “It’s fine, leave him there,” the Keeper said. “Give me that Tear of Neptune.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh?” Lan Jue straightened and faced the old man. “How did you know I was bringing you the Tear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Keeper chuckled, this time bearing a note of polite disdain. “We think alike. I heard that this s-ranked gem had been sold, then remembered you were in Lir. Then since I was already looking, I checked through the Tear’s information. By coincidence, I tapped in to the auction feed just in time to see you purchase it. Not bad, it holds promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue was speechless. Coincidence? He was expected to believe that? People could just willy-nilly tap in to auction house video feeds?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll kill you \u003cem\u003emyself\u003c/em\u003e, then, you rotten bastard!” A figure raced wildly at the Keeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait!” The Keeper shot out a hand, and the Bookworm skidded to a halt. “Let me show you something, then you can continue with your murderous rampage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Keeper produced a box as he spoke. Within lay the energy core they’d ripped from the Tai Hua monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt immediately drew the old exile’s eye. The anger, however, remained. “I’ll tear you apart in a little while.” With a flick of his wrist, an instrument of some sort appeared in the Bookworm’s hand. He swept it over the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the crazy old men occupied, Lan Jue felt it safe enough to approach and hand over the Tear, safely nestled in its crystal box. The Keeper smiled in thanks, then wordlessly motioned for him to depart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue smiled in return, proud at completing his mission. Indeed, it seemed the Bookworm’s ‘anger’ wouldn’t result in any misfortune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue soundlessly made his exit, pulling Su He along behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis former classmate looked worried. “You think the two of them will be ok?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue smirked. “They’ll be fine. If your teacher was really as angry as he let on, they wouldn’t be pouring over research material together. I also believe, now that the Keeper has convinced the Bookworm to show up, he’ll find a way to convince him. Let’s let the two old friends work it out on their own. Let’s go, I’ll show you where you’re staying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-214\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-216\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-215","bookId":1509,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:07 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:07 AM"}
