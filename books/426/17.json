Then, if he\u0027d any sense, he\u0027d lead that man a bit of a dance, and eventually double on him. No!—I should say Baseverie\u0027s back here in town! That\u0027s about it, Mr. Hetherwick.

He\u0027s a very cautious sort of man, I think; he examined the facsimiles a long time, saying nothing. Then he said he supposed I was a policeman, and so on, and of course I had to tell him a bit—only a bit. Then he said, all of a sudden, \u0027Look here, my friend,\u0027 he said, \u0027you\u0027d better tell me, straight out—has this to do with that Hannaford poisoning case?\u0027 So, of course, I said that, between ourselves, it had. \u0027Isn\u0027t Matherfield in charge of that?\u0027 he said.

I discovered a medicine bottle and a glass at his bedside. There\u0027d been whisky in both, but according to the medical experts there had also been poison—the traces, they say, were indisputable. Now, on that medicine bottle were two torn labels—on the upper one, as you see from the facsimile photograph, there\u0027s been a name written—all that\u0027s left is the initial C. and the first letter of a surname, A. All the rest\u0027s gone. And what I want to know is—are you the chemist that made up the medicine or the tonic, or whatever it was, that was in that bottle, and, if so, who is the customer for whom you made it, and whose Christian name begins with C. and surname with A.? Do you comprehend me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Aye, aye, Mr. Matherfield!\" answered the chemist eagerly. \"I\u0027m appreciating every word you\u0027re saying, and very lucid it all is.

Now, you\u0027ll be aware, Mr. Matherfield, if you\u0027ve seen the newspapers of this last day or two, that there\u0027s a firm of solicitors in Lincoln\u0027s Inn Fields that\u0027s offering a reward of five thousand pounds——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m well enough aware of it, Mr. Macpherson,\" interrupted Matherfield with a laugh and a sly glance at Hetherwick. \"Mr. Hetherwick and myself have just come straight from their office, and what you want to know is—if you give me information will it be the same thing as giving it to them?
