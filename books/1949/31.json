Twins she could’ve dealt with—once she got used to the idea—but triplets? Bobby was already a local celebrity and here she was, pregnant with triplets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You weren’t using fertility drugs, were you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good heavens, no.” That was one of the reasons the ultrasound had attracted so much attention. Natural triplets were exceedingly rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is why you’ve been feeling so drained and tired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince this was her first pregnancy, Teri hadn’t known what to expect. “I’ve been really emotional, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, no wonder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Originally, the doctor said I might’ve been farther along than we assumed. I never keep track of my periods, so I didn’t think anything of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That extra weight!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I made Dr. Joyce apologize about that. I told him I’d been eating properly and that I didn’t deserve to gain so much weight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel grinned. “I can imagine you’re pretty shaken, but Teri, this is wonderful news. You’ve told Bobby, haven’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the problem. “I haven’t said a word and I’m not sure I want to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t keep this from your husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But maybe I should. He’s worried about me giving birth to one baby and now you want me to casually announce I’m having three? Three babies. Rachel! I’m scared out of my wits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer friend dismissed her concerns a little too easily. “You’re going to be a terrific mother. And don’t worry, Bobby will take it in stride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thinking one baby,” Teri moaned, “and now I learn I’m practically going to have my own hockey team.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give yourself a chance to adjust first, and then tell Bobby,” Rachel advised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri was lost in her thoughts. She didn’t have much of a role model when it came to mothering. She’d already read six books on parenting. None of them had truly reassured her. Some of the information conflicted with other information. One theory clashed with the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three babies,” Rachel said. “You’ll do great—and you can afford to hire help if you need it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A nanny?” That hadn’t occurred to Teri. A nanny could come in part-time and help her feed and bathe the babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I see the picture again?” Rachel asked. “I was so surprised when I looked at it that I didn’t notice if they’re boys or girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of each and the third’s turned in such a way that it’s impossible to tell,” Teri told her friend. She buried her head in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have news of my own,” Rachel whispered. She checked over her shoulder as if she wanted to make sure no one else could hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bruce and I are getting married.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not news. I’ve had Valentine’s Day circled on my calendar for weeks.” It was such a romantic date. Rachel wanted a nice, formal wedding and even though Teri would be almost six months pregnant, Rachel had asked her to serve as matron of honor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The reception’s taking place in February,” Rachel confided. “But…are you doing anything December twentieth?” she asked, keeping her head lowered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri stared at her. “You’re getting married early?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel nodded. “What’s the point of waiting another two months? We both know what we want and the wait’s driving us crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Move in with him now,” Teri suggested. “People do it all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but there’s Jolene to consider. We’re trying to do everything properly for her sake. But Bruce is getting impatient and frankly, so am I. I’m so much in love with him, I don’t want to wait a minute longer than I have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri understood. Her own wedding had been a rushed affair. Bobby had insisted on marrying her rather than just living together. As Bobby had somehow known—and as Teri had discovered—it wasn’t the same. Marriage was a promise. A promise that was often broken, but a promise nonetheless—of enduring love, of enjoying the good and coping with the bad together. A marriage was more than a living arrangement, according to Bobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a girl who’d been around the block more times than the mailman, this told her everything she needed to know about Bobby. The memory of their wedding night brought quick tears to her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel noticed right away. “Teri, are you still worrying about the babies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…I was just thinking about Bobby and how much I love him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell him soon,” Rachel urged. “He’s going to be thrilled. Yes, he’ll be concerned. Who could blame him? He probably won’t let you out of his sight until May.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, April. The doctor wants to schedule a C-section for the last week of April. He’s afraid of complications, so the babies are now due April twenty-seventh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Teri, this is so exciting!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It certainly explains why I feel like Elsie the Cow at three and a half months,” she said wryly. “Can you picture me at eight?” Teri didn’t even want to think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“While I’ve got you here,” Rachel murmured. “Give me an update on what’s happening with your sister and James.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri knew the abrupt change of subject was Rachel’s way of distracting her from her worries. Teri had been keeping her friend updated on the romance, such as it was, between Bobby’s driver and her younger sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did I leave off?” Teri asked, leaning closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last I heard, you and Bobby had invited them both to dinner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that totally backfired. James refused to come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel rolled her eyes. “Men are so stubborn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My thought exactly,” Teri said. “Something must’ve happened afterward, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure. The next morning, my sister’s car was still in the driveway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Christie didn’t leave? Do you mean to tell me she spent the night with James?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri shrugged. “Well, she wasn’t with us, so I assumed the same thing as you. But…I assumed wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, where was she if she wasn’t with him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At home.” Teri had been discouraged by the news. “Apparently her car wouldn’t start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Rachel sounded disappointed, too. “So James gave her a ride home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It appears that way. When I asked him about it, he was pretty closemouthed. I only know she was having car problems because James was out tinkering with her car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He fixed it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess so. The next time I looked out, the car was gone and so was James.” She sighed. “Unfortunately he wasn’t away for long, which tells me he probably dropped off the car without saying a word to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it with that man?” Rachel asked, groaning theatrically. Ever since the kidnapping incident, she’d taken great interest in the health and happiness of James Wilbur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The thing is, I know my sister. She’s falling for James, but she’s fighting it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“James would certainly be an improvement over her ex,” Rachel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A serial killer would be an improvement over her ex,” Teri joked. “Well, not really, but you know what I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel glanced out at the shop. Her client was waiting at her station; someone, most likely Jane, had already put a plastic cape around her shoulders and given her the current Vogue. “I need to get back to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks for listening, Rach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood and hugged. “Keep December twentieth hush-hush, okay?” Rachel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We haven’t told anyone else yet, not even Jolene. Pastor Flemming offered to marry us in the church that afternoon. It’ll be a private ceremony.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m invited, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course! I can’t get married without my matron of honor, can I? Not to mention her husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri gently squeezed her friend’s arm. “Bobby and I will be there,” she promised. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, thank you,” Rachel said. “Anyway, I should go. Some of us still work for a living.” Her good-natured laugh told Teri there was no jealousy in her words. Rachel was merely teasing, exercising her privilege as best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be afraid to tell Bobby about the babies,” Rachel said as they left the break room. “And call me tonight. He’s going to be thrilled,” she insisted again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri wished she felt as confident as Rachel. She was the one who’d wanted to get pregnant. Bobby had been afraid for her physical safety and thought they should wait. The news that they were having a multiple birth was bound to send him into a panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Teri left the mall, James brought the limousine toward her. Before she could open the door, he was out of the car and opening it for her. Once she was tucked inside, he took his position behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is everything all right, Miss Teri?” he asked with a look of concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I think so. Why do you ask?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames started the engine. “Your doctor’s appointment was exceptionally lengthy and you seemed upset. Then you asked me to take you directly to the salon—to Miss Rachel, I presume.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rachel’s my closest friend. She’s—Oh, sorry.” Her cell phone interrupted her. She took it from her purse and saw at a glance that it was her sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Christie,” she said, flipping it open. She watched as James’s shoulders tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” Christie returned. “I called the house and Bobby said you weren’t home from your appointment yet. Are you doing anything this afternoon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah…not really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you mind giving me a haircut?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Can you come around four?” That should leave ample time to tell Bobby her news, with a few hours built in to let him adjust. She hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be there at four.” Her sister hesitated. “Do you think James will be around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri squelched a smile. “I imagine so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He fixed my car,” Christie said, speaking quickly. “So I bought him a little gift as a thank-you. Could you give it to him for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should do it yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…don’t know about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Play it by ear, then,” Teri said. “Let’s see how things go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hung up soon after that and Teri stuck her cell phone back inside her purse. “My sister’s stopping by later this afternoon,” she said blandly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there still a problem with her vehicle?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If there is, she didn’t mention it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her car isn’t going to last much longer, I’m afraid.” James shook his head. “She needs new tires, too.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/8-sandpiper-way-cedar-cove-8/page-31.html","bookId":1949,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:08 AM"}
