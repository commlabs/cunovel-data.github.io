It\u0027s a job Jeffrey takes VERY seriously. Six feet four inches, 220 fatless lbs., black hair, and blue eyes;weapon of choice: the 9 mm Beretta. In a pinch? His fists. IQ: 157. (Yes, crossword puzzle, in ink, just after taking out the guy behind you. No thanks necessary.) No one ever sees Jeffrey Rodinov coming, and no one--not even a mouthy, illegitimate princess--is going to keep him from playing bodyguard when his king decrees it. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eRight. But no Rodinov ever had to protect Princess Nicole Krenski. Her credentials? Hunting guide in the Alaskan wilderness. Smart. Stubborn bordering on exasperating. Five-seven. Blue eyes. Very kissable mouth. Very kissable neck, back, legs, wrists, earlobes. The lady says she doesn\u0027t need a bodyguard, but that\u0027s where she\u0027s wrong. Someone needs to watch her and show her the royal ropes (and cuffs. . .and scarves. . .). Someone who can make her feel like a queen--in and out of bed. And that\u0027s a job Jeffrey Rodinov takes very seriously as well. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-mess-alaskan-royal-family-3.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-mess-alaskan-royal-family-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:42 PM"}
