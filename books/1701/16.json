If you apply for children, then who will be their parents-of-the-parents? Who will be their grandparents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother and father, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where will they be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas thought. \"Oh,\" he said slowly. \"When I finish my training and become a full adult, I\u0027ll be given my own dwelling. And then when Lily does, a few years later, she\u0027ll get her own dwelling, and maybe a spouse, and children if she applies for them, and then Mother and Father—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as they\u0027re still working and contributing to the community, they\u0027ll go and live with the other Childless Adults. And they won\u0027t be part of my life anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after that, when the time comes, they\u0027ll go to the House of the Old,\" Jonas went on. He was thinking aloud. \"And they\u0027ll be well cared for, and respected, and when they\u0027re released, there will be a celebration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which you won\u0027t attend,\" The Giver pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not, because I won\u0027t even know about it. By then I\u0027ll be so busy with my own life. And Lily will, too. So our children, if we have them, won\u0027t know who their parents-of-parents are, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems to work pretty well that way, doesn\u0027t it? The way we do it in our community?\" Jonas asked. \"I just didn\u0027t realize there was any other way, until I received that memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It works,\" The Giver agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas hesitated. \"I certainly liked the memory, though. I can see why it\u0027s your favorite. I couldn\u0027t quite get the word for the whole feeling of it, the feeling that was so strong in the room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love,\" The Giver told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas repeated it. \"Love.\" It was a word and concept new to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both silent for a minute. Then Jonas said, \"Giver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel very foolish saying this. Very, very foolish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need. Nothing is foolish here. Trust the memories and how they make you feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Jonas said, looking at the floor, \"I know you don\u0027t have the memory anymore, because you gave it to me, so maybe you won\u0027t understand this—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. I am left with a vague wisp of that one; and I have many other memories of families, and holidays, and happiness. Of love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas blurted out what he was feeling. \"I was thinking that ... well, I can see that it wasn\u0027t a very practical way to live, with the Old right there in the same place, where maybe they wouldn\u0027t be well taken care of, the way they are now, and that we have a better-arranged way of doing things. But anyway, I was thinking, I mean feeling, actually, that it was kind of nice, then. And that I wish we could be that way, and that you could be my grandparent. The family in the memory seemed a little more—\" He faltered, not able to find the word he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little more complete,\" The Giver suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas nodded. \"I liked the feeling of love,\" he confessed. He glanced nervously at the speaker on the wall, reassuring himself that no one was listening. \"I wish we still had that,\" he whispered. \"Of course,\" he added quickly, \"I do understand that it wouldn\u0027t work very well. And that it\u0027s much better to be organized the way we are now. I can see that it was a dangerous way to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas hesitated. He wasn\u0027t certain, really, what he had meant. He could feel that there was risk involved, though he wasn\u0027t sure how. \"Well,\" he said finally, grasping for an explanation, \"they had fire right there in that room. There was a fire burning in the fireplace. And there were candles on a table. I can certainly see why those things were outlawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still,\" he said slowly, almost to himself, \"I did like the light they made. And the warmth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father? Mother?\" Jonas asked tentatively after the evening meal. \"I have a question I want to ask you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Jonas?\" his father asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made himself say the words, though he felt flushed with embarrassment. He had rehearsed them in his mind all the way home from the Annex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an awkward silence for a moment. Then Father gave a little chuckle. \"Jonas. You, of all people. Precision of language, please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Jonas asked. Amusement was not at all what he had anticipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father means that you used a very generalized word, so meaningless that it\u0027s become almost obsolete,\" his mother explained carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas stared at them. Meaningless? He had never before felt anything as meaningful as the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And of course our community can\u0027t function smoothly if people don\u0027t use precise language. You could ask, \u0027Do you enjoy me?\u0027 The answer is \u0027Yes,\u0027\" his mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or,\" his father suggested, \"\u0027Do you take pride in my accomplishments?\u0027 And the answer is wholeheartedly \u0027Yes.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you understand why it\u0027s inappropriate to use a word like \u0027love\u0027?\" Mother asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas nodded. \"Yes, thank you, I do,\" he replied slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his first lie to his parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel?\" Jonas whispered that night to the newchild. The crib was in his room again. After Gabe had slept soundly in Jonas\u0027s room for four nights, his parents had pronounced the experiment a success and Jonas a hero. Gabriel was growing rapidly, now crawling and giggling across the room and pulling himself up to stand. He could be upgraded in the Nurturing Center, Father said happily, now that he slept; he could be officially named and given to his family in December, which was only two months away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when he was taken away, he stopped sleeping again, and cried in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he was back in Jonas\u0027s sleepingroom. They would give it a little more time, they decided. Since Gabe seemed to like it in Jonas\u0027s room, he would sleep there at night a little longer, until the habit of sound sleep was fully formed. The Nurturers were very optimistic about Gabriel\u0027s future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer to Jonas\u0027s whisper. Gabriel was sound asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things could change, Gabe,\" Jonas went on. \"Things could be different. I don\u0027t know how, but there must be some way for things to be different. There could be colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And grandparents,\" he added, staring through the dimness toward the ceiling of his sleepingroom. \"And everybody would have the memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know about memories,\" he whispered, turning toward the crib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel\u0027s breathing was even and deep. Jonas liked having him there, though he felt guilty about the secret. Each night he gave memories to Gabriel: memories of boat rides and picnics in the sun; memories of soft rainfall against windowpanes; memories of dancing barefoot on a damp lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newchild stirred slightly in his sleep. Jonas looked over at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There could be love,\" Jonas whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, for the first time, Jonas did not take his pill. Something within him, something that had grown there through the memories, told him to throw the pill away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTODAY IS DECLARED AN UNSCHEDULED HOLIDAY. Jonas, his parents, and Lily all turned in surprise and looked at the wall speaker from which the announcement had come. It happened so rarely, and was such a treat for the entire community when it did. Adults were exempted from the day\u0027s work, children from school and training and volunteer hours. The substitute Laborers, who would be given a different holiday, took over all the necessary tasks: nurturing, food delivery, and care of the Old; and the community was free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas cheered, and put his homework folder down. He had been about to leave for school. School was less important to him now; and before much more time passed, his formal schooling would end. But still, for Twelves, though they had begun their adult training, there were the endless lists of rules to be memorized and the newest technology to be mastered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wished his parents, sister, and Gabe a happy day, and rode down the bicycle path, looking for Asher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had not taken the pills, now, for four weeks. The Stirrings had returned, and he felt a little guilty and embarrassed about the pleasurable dreams that came to him as he slept. But he knew he couldn\u0027t go back to the world of no feelings that he had lived in so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his new, heightened feelings permeated a greater realm than simply his sleep. Though he knew that his failure to take the pills accounted for some of it, he thought that the feelings came also from the memories. Now he could see all of the colors; and he could keep them, too, so that the trees and grass and bushes stayed green in his vision. Gabriel\u0027s rosy cheeks stayed pink, even when he slept. And apples were always, always red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, through the memories, he had seen oceans and mountain lakes and streams that gurgled through woods; and now he saw the familiar wide river beside the path differently. He saw all of the light and color and history it contained and carried in its slow-moving water; and he knew that there was an Elsewhere from which it came, and an Elsewhere to which it was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this unexpected, casual holiday he felt happy, as he always had on holidays; but with a deeper happiness than ever before. Thinking, as he always did, about precision of language, Jonas realized that it was a new depth of feelings that he was experiencing. Somehow they were not at all the same as the feelings that every evening, in every dwelling, every citizen analyzed with endless talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt angry because someone broke the play area rules,\" Lily had said once, making a fist with her small hand to indicate her fury. Her family—Jonas among them—had talked about the possible reasons for rule-breaking, and the need for understanding and patience, until Lily\u0027s fist had relaxed and her anger was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Lily had not felt anger, Jonas realized now. Shallow impatience and exasperation, that was all Lily had felt. He knew that with certainty because now he knew what anger was. Now he had, in the memories, experienced injustice and cruelty, and he had reacted with rage that welled up so passionately inside him that the thought of discussing it calmly at the evening meal was unthinkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt sad today,\" he had heard his mother say, and they had comforted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now Jonas had experienced real sadness. He had felt grief. He knew that there was no quick comfort for emotions like those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were deeper and they did not need to be told. They were felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, he felt happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asher!\" He spied his friend\u0027s bicycle leaning against a tree at the edge of the playing field. Nearby, other bikes were strewn about on the ground. On a holiday the usual rules of order could be disregarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe skidded to a stop and dropped his own bike beside the others. \"Hey, Ash!\" he shouted, looking around. There seemed to be no one in the play area. \"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Psssheeewwww!\" A child\u0027s voice, coming from behind a nearby bush, made the sound. \"Pow! Pow! Pow!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA female Eleven named Tanya staggered forward from where she had been hiding. Dramatically she clutched her stomach and stumbled about in a zig-zag pattern, groaning. \"You got me!\" she called, and fell to the ground, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blam!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas, standing on the side of the playing field, recognized Asher\u0027s voice. He saw his friend, aiming an imaginary weapon in his hand, dart from behind one tree to another. \"Blam! You\u0027re in my line of ambush, Jonas! Watch out!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-16.html","bookId":1701,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM"}
