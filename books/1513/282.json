Even high-grade meditation techniques weren’t anything special, and mere official Magi were able to obtain them as well! Many Magi discarded all prejudices they had towards factions and sects, learning and improving together. They even formed a huge alliance, conquering one world after another! That was the golden era of the Magi!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe repeated, eyes burning with fervent passion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But for some reason, the ancient Magi received some huge blow, and historians made a conjecture that there was a world that was especially strong, and our Magus World’s attack on them was thwarted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In order to prevent the war from spreading to our world, the ancient Magi made the painful decision to close the channel that connected them to this world, and sealed the other channels that were connected to other worlds. Even then, the ancient Magi who had suffered greatly lost their ability to pass on their abilities, and eventually declined.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader of the light Magi sighed ruefully and then narrated this history like it was some ancient poem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even if Magi were able to receive the inheritance from ancient Magi, they still lacked some of the required materials from other worlds, which made it impossible for them to progress!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hence, the Magi of today now use meditation techniques to progress, because this is the best route, and many could use the experiences of their seniors to advance. The ancient Magi who had acquired the inheritances were extremely pitiful. If they were lucky, they were able to find resources that were compatible with their bodies and improve, but most of them were stuck at rank 1 for their whole life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Leader said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ancient Steel Knights are said to be from a world close to us. It’s a specific profession unique to the Steel Lava world. After conquering that world, the ancient Magi altered our bodies with some methods, which resulted in the special state of evolution that the Steel Knights can achieve. Without an enormous amount of luck, their strength will stay at this point forever, so you don’t have to envy them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What should we do now? Should we proceed at a faster pace?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Magus with an inverted crimson cross in his eyes asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile travelling, the rank 2 Magi used their minds to continue their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the help of their solidified spiritual force, their thoughts were processed at a rate many times faster than that of a rank 1 Magus. With just a wave of spiritual force, large amounts of images and words could be contained within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! We’re going to slow down!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a cold glint in his eyes, the leader of the light Magi slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just let those Iron Crown Steel Knights charge at the frontlines!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A portion of the essence of the Wisdom Tree and that treasure should be enough to motivate them to go all out! We’ll follow behind them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader exclaimed coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was actually a ploy. The Steel Knights were well aware that the light Magi might take advantage of them by following them behind, but under the temptation of the treasures, they still chose to pursue their targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the contract with the light Magi? If they really managed to obtain treasure, the light Magi would pay a large amount for it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese Steel Knights were very confident in their abilities, they were sure that they would be able to end the battle before the light Magi arrived!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair and the dark Magi who were fleeing at the front also stopped at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of them, a figure suddenly appeared out of thin air and blocked their path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis man looked to be extremely plain, and if he were ever to be in a crowd, he would be difficult to be picked out. However, he had the unique energy waves that belonged to rank 2 Magi, causing the three’s faces to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hand over the essence of the Wisdom Tree and the treasure you possess!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle-aged man sounded extremely haughty, taking a large gulp from the flask at his side and looking unperturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You…” The two dark Magi behind Alistair became extremely annoyed. So what if this middle-aged man was a rank 2 Magus? They had three Magi who had reached rank 2!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awoo!” Alistair’s answer was extremely simple, howling at Leylin. His face, which had already turned into that of a half-wolf, produced an angry expression as he pounced towards Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Pu pu!* While running, he opened his mouth and two balls of giant wind-elemental energy particles flew towards Leylin like explosives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the werewolf seemed to transform into wind and hid in the intense draft, approaching Leylin like a hurricane, his sharp claws filled with an iciness and bloodlust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The second stage of beast transformation!” Leylin focused on the werewolf who was nearing him, blue lights occasionally flashing in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sweep of his right arm, red powder spread in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scorching Touch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo streaks that brought about intense heat penetrated the wind elemental energy balls and shot towards the werewolf!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awoo!” Alistair howled repeatedly, his body constantly changing directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the two lines of Scorching Touch seemed to have a navigation system and turned a circle in the air, blocking the werewolf’s path. Based on the drills from the simulations performed by the A.I. Chip, the way in which Leylin was using the Scorching Touch was similar in familiarity to one who had been analyzing it for decades. He had even researched and created a few tiny tricks that were uniquely his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Woo!” The werewolf tried his best to dodge the attack on his chest, but instead, his right arm was directly struck by the red ray of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlistair howled, a furry arm with a claw on it flying away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bind!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin stretched his arms forward, and slight shadows formed two black figures that twined around Alistair, who had now lost an arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come help!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!* Under the pester of the shadows, Alistair was forced to undo his werewolf transformation and roared, producing the voice of a human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two dark Magi with him exchanged gazes, and suddenly made their move!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bald Magus placed his hands on the ground, chanting a few mournful-sounding incantations that sounded like the howls of a spirit seeking vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Chi chi!* A black thorny bone spur forest suddenly emerged from the surface of the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether rocks or plants, they were all penetrated through by these black bone spurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thorny bone spur forest increased in area, its blackness approaching Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bo! Bo!* The two black figures were pierced by the bone spurs, but it did not hurt even a hair on Alistair’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe, Siley, you did well!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother dark Magus laughed, and the black rod in his arms extended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spirits laying silent in the Weeping Abyss, come back to life,!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA green fireball suddenly formed in front of the black rod and exploded, turning into starry specks that shot into the bone spur forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-cha! Ka-cha!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black bone spurs Siley had summoned forth levitated, forming thousands of large skeletal soldiers holding bone nail hammers and white giant hatchets, charging towards Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A combination spell!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin cried out involuntarily. Within rank 2 spells, if the spells displayed by two Magi were similar in terms of their effects, there could be a combo effect if they utilized secret methods that allowed them to combine attacks.This type of magic would then be called a combination spell, and its power far exceeded that of regular rank 2 spells!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there were few rank 2 Magi whose body and spiritual force were at a similar level. The conditions for releasing this type of magic were very harsh, and there was only a small number of Magi who fit the requirements. Leylin never imagined that he would get to see this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large white nail hammer slammed down, bringing with it the ear-piercing sounds of an explosion. The air nearby seemed to have its pressure sucked away by the strong wind, and Leylin momentarily felt suffocated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Estimated might of target’s purely physical attack: 90 degrees!] The A.I. Chip provided in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin dodged the hammer, and a red layer appeared on the surface of his body. “Purely physical attack? Does that mean there’s still a magical attack?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ga ga!” At this moment, a large skeletal soldier that saw Leylin escaping opened its mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMultiple white bone spurs flew powerfully like white raindrops, covering all the areas that Leylin was planning on retreating to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Rumble!* The white bone spurs slammed into the layer on Leylin’s body and then exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immense energy waves wreaked havoc on the red layer, and the rays flickered inconsistently, illustrating its difficulty in withstanding this attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ga ga!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind that skeletal soldier, large groups of soldiers began to shoot out spurs as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-cha! Ka-cha!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder their attacks, the red protective layer on the surface of Leylin’s skin shattered loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang! Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge amounts of black, densely-packed scales appeared as his body was thrown a long distance away by the undulations from the explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYellow rays flashed as the shape-shifting effects were destroyed, revealing Leylin’s true appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Latent Fireball!” “Scorching Touch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed and black flames extended, and the bone spurs that filled the skies were burnt to ashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Black flames? You- You’re Leylin!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bald Magus who produced the black bone spurs couldn’t help but exclaim, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Long time no see, Director Siley!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin grinned as he greeted Siley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Siley! Is this the student that betrayed your academy? He’s actually advanced to rank 2!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rank 2 Magus who cooperated with Siley gained interest as he looked Leylin up and down, “He’s quite talented!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-281\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-283\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-282","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
