I don’t want to kill the people in the house for it. They got there before us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake shakes his head, \"Em is right. We leave for the mansion tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah moans, \"My feet hurt and I don’t want to go all the way back. I don’t want to sleep outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s tired and whiny. Jake wraps an arm around her, \"Sarah, those people got their first, they don’t deserve to die for finding an empty farmhouse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah moans and sits on a log. I sit beside her and nudge her, \"I\u0027m tired too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dim light of the moon, I can see her pouting. It makes me smile. She wrinkles her nose at me and shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna opens a sack she brought and passes us all some dried meat and apples. We drink the last of our water in silence, wishing we were inside of that house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rip off some dried meat for Leo, but I don’t see him. I whistle softly but he\u0027s not there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be hunting or doing his circle,\" I mutter, but I don’t feel like that’s the case. I feel weird about him not being there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake sits next to me on the log, shifting where it sits suspended. He looks down, \"Wanna have a fire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Yeah. They can\u0027t get mad if we have a fire. We aren’t doing anything wrong being here. We aren’t too close to the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs and rubs his eyes, \"Come help me get wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost mock him, but I know he\u0027s been trying harder. He\u0027s trying to not be the grasshopper who played all summer. He gets up and grabs my hand in his. The touch tugs at my heart. He pulls me up and into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t jerk my hand free; I like the touch. It doesn’t mean the same thing to me that it does for him. Anna was right, being around them more has helped me be around them, and not be in love with every guy our age that I see. I\u0027m accustomed to them now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe crunch through the forest, looking for wood. He looks back, \"What do you think about Anna having a baby? Really think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s good. She has a piece of Bernie that\u0027s hers. He will be there forever in the form of that baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffs, \"She\u0027s seventeen. She\u0027s going to fall in love again. She probably wasn’t in love. She\u0027s too young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, she loved him. She isn’t a normal seventeen-year old. She\u0027s way older and she\u0027s seen way more. Bernie loved her too. He hated that she was so young and he hated that he loved her, but he did. I don’t think she\u0027ll ever love again. I think she\u0027ll be a good mom. Sometimes she\u0027s crazy, but she\u0027s going to be a good mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe breaks the branches as we walk past them, \"I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. He still does it, even though we can find our way back easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up a piece of wood but he takes it. \"Will you ever get over Will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I don’t know. Will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"No. I get why he became the mean asshole he did. I get the pain and sorrow he\u0027d seen made him who he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed the happy, sweet Jake has been gone. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes the wood from my hands that I grab, \"It\u0027s not your fault. Will chose saving you over himself. That’s the kind of person he was. Even before, that’s the kind of guy he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me something you remember from before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice breaks ever so slightly, \"My mom used to take us out to movies. She loved the air conditioning in the summer. She would drag us to the movie and make us watch whatever crap Anna could watch. Me and Will would complain and complain. So finally one day, we were in the city for the movie and Will convinces her we can go to a show by ourselves. Anna was like three and they were going to see the Smurfs. Will got her to let us go see the newest Paranormal Activity movie. She let us go; scared the heck out of me. I hate scary movies but Will loved it. I pretended to love it too, but he could tell I was scared. So when we got home, he let me crash in his room with him until I wasn’t scared anymore. He slept on the floor and let me sleep on the bed, but never told mom or anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms are full from the wood I\u0027ve stacked in them and we\u0027re far from Anna and Sarah, but I don’t want to stop listening to him talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns around and smiles, \"He let me pick next time. I chose the newest Batman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts walking back to Anna and Sarah, looking at his broken branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart stops when I hear screaming. Jake looks at me, \"What was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, listening better. The scream happens again. It\u0027s my name being screamed. I break into a run, leading Jake and me to the farmhouse. I know the way and that’s where the screaming is coming from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the firelight across the field, I can see movement but I can\u0027t make it out. Jake is keeping up with me, I can hear his footsteps landing hard. I run silently, as always. I slip against the barn, hearing the cries of Sarah and the high moan of Anna. What if they think she\u0027s infected. I pull my guns and sneak around the far side of the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Sarah and Anna\u0027s legs on the ground with a huge man\u0027s. Sarah is crying so hard I can barely make it out, but I do. She cries, \"WILL!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop to my knees, frozen. My guns clunk to the hard dry ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake launches himself at the heap of hugging and wrestling people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stunned and silent face doesn’t want to react, in case it\u0027s wrong. I don’t swallow or breathe or cry. I sit frozen as Will gets off of Anna and Sarah and turns to smile at Jake. Jake lifts him right off the ground, hugging him mid-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo is jumping up, licking and nipping at Will. I don’t think I\u0027ve ever seen him so excited, but I have no response. I don’t have excitement or passion. I think I\u0027m angry, maybe at myself or the trickery going on in front of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jakey! Jakey!\" Will\u0027s voice cracks. He doesn’t sound normal but he says Jakey like before. I hate that name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts Will down and slaps him hard on the arm, \"How, man? How the hell did you get here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head; he can\u0027t speak. He coughs and turns to face me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes meet, and for a second I believe it\u0027s him, but I know I touched his dead hand. I shake my head; it must be a trick of my father\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill walks to me, silencing the others except for the sniffles and tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill drops to his knees in front of me. He runs a hand across my cheek. I close my eyes and shake my head, \"It can\u0027t be you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans in, smelling exactly like him and presses his lips against my forehead, \"It\u0027s me, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears stream my cheeks, \"I felt you. You were dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I was awake when you and Bernie came in the room. Whatever he gave me, woke me up. I felt you holding my arm and Bernie sticking me with a huge needle. When they realized I was awake, they sounded the alarms to catch Bernie. They figured he was bad. Some guy with a bullet wound to the chest was brought in on a stretcher, and I was taken to a different area so they could try to work on him. They brought me down a couple floors. I was left with the guards until the lights went out. They left us there, but the medical staff got us out when the fire got bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mutter blankly, \"The fire. The lady with the torch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks confused, \"I don’t know who that was, but there was a fire and the whole city is burning now. I got away in the chaos. I couldn’t find my way to Bernie\u0027s, so I came here. I knew eventually, you would come here.\" He kisses the side of my face, \"You always come back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my hands up and drag them over his face. \"It\u0027s you?\" The man on the stretcher wasn’t Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and kisses my palm. I collapse into him, wrapping around him completely. \"I left you, I\u0027m so sorry I left you. I thought he was you. I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe coughs funny when I squeeze him and laughs, \"Easy, Em. My lung is still weak.\" He pulls back my head and shakes his, \"You made it out of the city. That’s what matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head but Jake slaps him on the back, \"I told you, nothing can kill this cantankerous old bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill laughs and hugs me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, we are surrounded by arms and breath. Anna is wheeze talking so fast none of us can catch it, but we can feel the joy in her shaking body. I close my eyes and hold on. I don’t know if we\u0027ll stay this way. I don’t even care. He\u0027s alive right now. My heart is angry for believing him dead, for leaving him to die in that building, for kissing the hand of a stranger goodbye and giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t changed so much. I am still the girl who turns her back on the dying to save her own skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe and Leo take the first watch in the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have the rifle and my bow from the bunker, and the handguns from the gun storage at Bernie\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one of the windows of the farmhouse, I see Anna walk across the kitchen. It\u0027s dark inside and out; nothing moves except her and the wheat blowing in the field. She slips across the gravel driveway, almost completely silent. I hear the familiar creak of the boards on the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe creeps across the hay and sits next to me. I don’t look at her. I keep my eye on the fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it possible Bernie made it too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and recall the way he slumped over the keyboard as he gave out his last breath. I had to expect she would ask it though. I would have asked it. I would have gone back. I never would have taken her word that he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must hate me for lying about Will and doubt me about Bernie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Anna, if he\u0027s alive then my father performed a miracle, because minutes after he was shot twice at point blank, the power went out. About an hour later, a lady lit the building he was in on fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe starts to cry quietly, \"I can\u0027t do it without him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lip creeps out as tears slip down my cheeks. I have nothing to offer her. I ran up the stairs and turned my back on him after he saved us all. My cowardice is shameful. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-25.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
