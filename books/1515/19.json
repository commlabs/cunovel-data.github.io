He did his best not to picture the tons of earth overhead and the narrow tube through which he was now traveling. He could hear Katherine breathing several yards ahead of him, but so far, she had not uttered a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s in shock. Langdon was not looking forward to telling her about her brother\u0027s severed hand. You have to, Robert. She needs to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katherine?\" Langdon finally said, without opening his eyes. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremulous, disembodied voice replied somewhere up ahead. \"Robert, the pyramid you\u0027re carrying. It\u0027s Peter\u0027s, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Langdon replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long silence followed. \"I think . . . that pyramid is why my mother was murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was well aware that Isabel Solomon had been murdered ten years ago, but he didn\u0027t know the details, and Peter had never mentioned anything about a pyramid. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine\u0027s voice filled with emotion as she recounted the harrowing events of that night, how the tattooed man had broken into their estate. \"It was a long time ago, but I\u0027ll never forget that he demanded a pyramid. He said he heard about the pyramid in prison, from my nephew, Zachary . . . right before he killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon listened in amazement. The tragedy within the Solomon family was almost beyond belief. Katherine continued, telling Langdon that she had always believed the intruder was killed that night . . . that is, until this same man had resurfaced today, posing as Peter\u0027s psychiatrist and luring Katherine to his home. \"He knew private things about my brother, my mother\u0027s death, and even my work,\" she said anxiously, \"things he could only have learned from my brother. And so I trusted him . . . and that\u0027s how he got inside the Smithsonian Museum Support Center.\" Katherine took a deep breath and told Langdon she was nearly certain the man had destroyed her lab tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon listened in utter shock. For several moments, the two of them lay together in silence on the moving conveyor. Langdon knew he had an obligation to share with Katherine the rest of tonight\u0027s terrible news. He began slowly, and as gently as he possibly could he told her how her brother had entrusted him with a small package years earlier, how Langdon had been tricked into bringing this package to Washington tonight, and finally, about her brother\u0027s hand having been found in the Rotunda of the Capitol Building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine\u0027s reaction was deafening silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon could tell she was reeling, and he wished he could reach out and comfort her, but lying end to end in the narrow blackness made it impossible. \"Peter\u0027s okay,\" he whispered. \"He\u0027s alive, and we\u0027ll get him back.\" Langdon tried to give her hope. \"Katherine, his captor promised me your brother would be returned alive . . . as long as I decipher the pyramid for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill Katherine said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon kept talking. He told her about the stone pyramid, its Masonic cipher, the sealed capstone, and, of course, about Bellamy\u0027s claims that this pyramid was in fact the Masonic Pyramid of legend . . . a map that revealed the hiding place of a long spiral staircase that led deep into the earth . . . down hundreds of feet to a mystical ancient treasure that had been buried in Washington long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine finally spoke, but her voice was flat and emotionless. \"Robert, open your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen my eyes? Langdon had no desire to have even the slightest glimpse of how cramped this space really was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert!\" Katherine demanded, urgently now. \"Open your eyes! We\u0027re here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s eyes flew open as his body emerged through an opening similar to the one it had entered at the other end. Katherine was already climbing off the conveyor belt. She lifted his daybag off the belt as Langdon swung his legs over the edge and jumped down onto the tile floor just in time, before the conveyor turned the corner and headed back the way it came. The space around them was a circulation room much like the one they had come from in the other building. A small sign read ADAMS BUILDING: CIRCULATION ROOM 3. Langdon felt like he had just emerged from some kind of subterranean birth canal. Born again. He turned immediately to Katherine. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were red, and she had obviously been crying, but she nodded with a resolute stoicism. She picked up Langdon\u0027s daybag and carried it across the room without a word, setting it on a cluttered desk. She lit the desk\u0027s halogen clamp lamp, unzipped the bag, folded down the sides, and peered inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe granite pyramid looked almost austere in the clean halogen light. Katherine ran her fingers over the engraved Masonic cipher, and Langdon sensed deep emotion churning within her. Slowly, she reached into the daybag and pulled out the cube-shaped package. She held it under the light, examining it closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you can see,\" Langdon quietly said, \"the wax seal is embossed with Peter\u0027s Masonic ring. He said this ring was used to seal the package more than a century ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When your brother entrusted the package to me,\" Langdon told her, \"he said it would give me the power to create order out of chaos. I\u0027m not entirely sure what that means, but I\u0027ve got to assume the capstone reveals something important, because Peter was insistent that it not fall into the wrong hands. Mr. Bellamy just told me the same thing, urging me to hide the pyramid and not let anyone open the package.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine turned now, looking angry. \"Bellamy told you not to open the package?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He was adamant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine looked incredulous. \"But you said this capstone is the only way we can decipher the pyramid, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine\u0027s voice was rising now. \"And you said deciphering the pyramid is what you were told to do. It\u0027s the only way we can get Peter back, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, Robert, why wouldn\u0027t we open the package and decipher this thing right now?!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon didn\u0027t know how to respond. \"Katherine, I had the same exact reaction, and yet Bellamy told me that keeping this pyramid\u0027s secret intact was more important than anything . . . including your brother\u0027s life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine\u0027s pretty features hardened, and she tucked a wisp of hair behind her ears. When she spoke, her voice was resolved. \"This stone pyramid, whatever it is, has cost me my entire family. First my nephew, Zachary, then my mother, and now my brother.And let\u0027s face it, Robert, if you hadn\u0027t called tonight to warn me . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon could feel himself trapped between Katherine\u0027s logic and Bellamy\u0027s steadfast urging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may be a scientist,\" she said, \"but I also come from a family of well-known Masons. Believe me, I\u0027ve heard all the stories about the Masonic Pyramid and its promise of some great treasure that will enlighten mankind. Honestly, I find it hard to imagine such a thing exists. However, if it does exist . . . perhaps it\u0027s time to unveil it.\" Katherine slid a finger beneath the old twine on the package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon jumped. \"Katherine, no! Wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused, but her finger remained beneath the string. \"Robert, I\u0027m not going to let my brother die for this. Whatever this capstone says . . . whatever lost treasures this engraving might reveal . . . those secrets end tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, Katherine yanked defiantly on the twine, and the brittle wax seal exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 63\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a quiet neighborhood just west of Embassy Row in Washington, there exists a medieval-style walled garden whose roses, it is said, spring from twelfth-century plants. The garden\u0027s Carderock gazebo--known as Shadow House--sits elegantly amid meandering pathways of stones dug from George Washington\u0027s private quarry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight the silence of the gardens was broken by a young man who rushed through the wooden gate, shouting as he came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" he called out, straining to see in the moonlight. \"Are you in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice that replied was frail, barely audible. \"In the gazebo . . . just taking some air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man found his withered superior seated on the stone bench beneath a blanket. The hunched old man was tiny, with elfin features. The years had bent him in two and stolen his eyesight, but his soul remained a force to be reckoned with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching his breath, the young man told him, \"I just . . . took a call . . . from your friend . . . Warren Bellamy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" The old man perked up. \"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t say, but he sounded like he was in a big hurry. He told me he left you a message on your voice mail, which you need to listen to right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all he said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite.\" The young man paused. \"He told me to ask you a question.\" A very strange question. \"He said he needed your response right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man leaned closer. \"What question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the young man spoke Mr. Bellamy\u0027s question, the pall that crossed the old man\u0027s face was visible even in the moonlight. Immediately, he threw off his blanket and began struggling to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please help me inside. Right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 64\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more secrets, thought Katherine Solomon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the table in front of her, the wax seal that had been intact for generations now lay in pieces. She finished removing the faded brown paper from her brother\u0027s precious package. Beside her, Langdon looked decidedly uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom within the paper, Katherine extracted a small box made of gray stone. Resembling a polished granite cube, the box had no hinges, no latch, and no apparent way inside. It reminded Katherine of a Chinese puzzle box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like a solid block,\" she said, running her fingers over the edges. \"Are you sure the X- ray showed it was hollow? With a capstone inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It did,\" Langdon said, moving next to Katherine and scrutinizing the mysterious box. He and Katherine peered at the box from different angles, attempting to find a way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it,\" Katherine said as her fingernail located the hidden slit along one of the box\u0027s top edges. She set the box down on the desk and then carefully pried open the lid, which rose smoothly, like the top of a fine jewelry box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the lid fell back, Langdon and Katherine both drew audible breaths. The interior of the box seemed to be glowing. The inside was shining with an almost supernatural effulgence. Katherine had never seen a piece of gold this large, and it took her an instant to realize that the precious metal was simply reflecting the radiance of the desk lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s spectacular,\" she whispered. Despite being sealed in a dark stone cube for over a century, the capstone had not faded or tarnished in any way. Gold resists the entropic laws of decay; that\u0027s one of the reasons the ancients considered it magical. Katherine felt her pulse quicken as she leaned forward, peering down over the small golden point. \"There\u0027s an inscription.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon moved closer, their shoulders now touching. His blue eyes flashed with curiosity. He had told Katherine about the ancient Greek practice of creating a symbolon--a code broken into parts--and how this capstone, long separated from the pyramid itself, would hold the key to deciphering the pyramid. Allegedly, this inscription, whatever it said, would bring order from this chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine held the little box up to the light and peered straight down over the capstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough small, the inscription was perfectly visible--a small bit of elegantly engraved text on the face of one side. Katherine read the six simple words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she read them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she declared. \"That can\u0027t be what it says!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the street, Director Sato hurried up the long walkway outside the Capitol Building toward her rendezvous point on First Street. The update from her field team had been unacceptable. No Langdon. No pyramid. No capstone. Bellamy was in custody, but he was not telling them the truth. At least not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll make him talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced back over her shoulder at one of Washington\u0027s newest vistas--the Capitol Dome framed above the new visitor center. The illuminated dome only accentuated the significance of what was truly at stake tonight. Dangerous times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato was relieved to hear her cell phone ring and see her analyst\u0027s ID on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nola,\" Sato answered. \"What have you got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNola Kaye gave her the bad news. The X-ray of the capstone\u0027s inscription was too faint to read, and the image-enhancing filters had not helped. Shit. Sato chewed at her lip. \"How about the sixteen-letter grid?\" \"I\u0027m still trying,\" Nola said, \"but so far I\u0027ve found no secondary encryption scheme that\u0027s applicable. I\u0027ve got a computer reshuffling the letters in the grid and looking for anything identifiable, but there are over twenty trillion possibilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay on it. Let me know.\" Sato hung up, scowling. Her hopes of deciphering the pyramid using only a photograph and X-ray were fading fast. I need that pyramid and capstone . . . and I\u0027m running out of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato arrived at First Street just as a black Escalade SUV with dark windows roared across the double yellow and skidded to a stop in front of her at their rendezvous point. A lone agent got out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any word yet on Langdon?\" Sato demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Confidence is high,\" the man said, emotionless. \"Backup just arrived. All library exits are surrounded. We even have air support coming in. We\u0027ll flush him with tear gas, and he\u0027ll have nowhere to run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Bellamy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tied up in the backseat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. Her shoulder was still smarting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agent handed Sato a plastic Ziploc bag containing cell phone, keys, and wallet. \"Bellamy\u0027s effects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am. The pyramid and package must still be with Langdon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Sato said. \"Bellamy knows plenty he\u0027s not telling. I\u0027d like to question him personally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am. To Langley, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato took a deep breath and paced a moment beside the SUV. Strict protocols governed the interrogation of U.S. civilians, and questioning Bellamy was highly illegal unless it was done at Langley on video with witnesses, attorneys, blah, blah, blah . . . \"Not Langley,\" she said, trying to think of somewhere closer. And more private.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agent said nothing, standing at attention beside the idling SUV, waiting for orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato lit a cigarette, took a long drag, and gazed down at the Ziploc bag of Bellamy\u0027s items. His key ring, she had noticed, included an electronic fob adorned with four letters--USBG. Sato knew, of course, which government building this fob accessed. The building was very close and, at this hour, very private. She smiled and pocketed the fob. Perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she told the agent where she wanted to take Bellamy, she expected the man to look surprised, but he simply nodded and opened the passenger door for her, his cold stare revealing nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato loved professionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stood in the basement of the Adams Building and stared in disbelief at the elegantly inscribed words on the face of the golden capstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s all it says?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, Katherine held the capstone under the light and shook her head. \"There\u0027s got to be more,\" she insisted, sounding cheated. \"This is what my brother has been protecting all these years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had to admit he was mystified. According to Peter and Bellamy, this capstone was supposed to help them decipher the stone pyramid. In light of those claims, Langdon had expected something illuminating and helpful. More like obvious and useless. Once again, he read the six words delicately inscribed on the face of the capstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esecret hides\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewithin The Order\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secret hides within The Order?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first glance, the inscription appeared to be stating the obvious--that the letters on the pyramid were out of \"order\" and that their secret lay in finding their proper sequence. This reading, however, in addition to being self-evident, seemed unlikely for another reason. \"The words the and order are capitalized,\" Langdon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine nodded blankly. \"I saw that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secret hides within The Order. Langdon could think of only one logical implication. \" `The Order\u0027 must be referencing the Masonic Order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" Katherine said, \"but it\u0027s still no help. It tells us nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had to concur. After all, the entire story of the Masonic Pyramid revolved around a secret hidden within the Masonic Order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert, didn\u0027t my brother tell you this capstone would give you power to see order where others saw only chaos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded in frustration. For the second time tonight, Robert Langdon was feeling unworthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 65\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Mal\u0027akh had finished dealing with his unexpected visitor--a female security guard from Preferred Security--he fixed the paint on the window through which she had glimpsed his sacred work space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, ascending out of the soft blue haze of the basement, he emerged through a hidden doorway into his living room. Inside, he paused, admiring his spectacular painting of the Three Graces and savoring the familiar smells and sounds of his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon I will be leaving forever. Mal\u0027akh knew that after tonight he would be unable to return to this place. After tonight, he thought, smiling, I will have no need for this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if Robert Langdon yet understood the true power of the pyramid . . . or the importance of the role for which fate had chosen him. Langdon has yet to call me, Mal\u0027akh thought, after double-checking for messages on his disposable phone. It was now 10:02 P.M. He has less than two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal\u0027akh went upstairs to his Italian-marble bathroom and turned on the steam shower to let it heat up. Methodically, he stripped off his clothes, eager to begin his cleansing ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drank two glasses of water to calm his starving stomach. Then he walked to the full-length mirror and studied his naked body. His two days of fasting had accentuated his musculature, and he could not help but admire that which he had become. By dawn, I will be so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 66\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should get out of here,\" Langdon said to Katherine. \"It\u0027s only a matter of time before they figure out where we are.\" He hoped Bellamy had managed to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine still seemed fixated on the gold capstone, looking incredulous that the inscription was so unhelpful. She had taken the capstone out of the box, examined every side, and was now carefully putting it back in the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secret hides within The Order, Langdon thought. Big help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon found himself wondering now if perhaps Peter had been misinformed about the contents of the box. This pyramid and capstone had been created long before Peter was born, and Peter was simply doing as his forefathers had told him, keeping a secret that was probably as much a mystery to him as it was to Langdon and Katherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did I expect? Langdon wondered. The more he learned tonight about the Legend of the Masonic Pyramid, the less plausible it all seemed. I\u0027m searching for a hidden spiral staircase covered by a huge stone? Something told Langdon he was chasing shadows. Nonetheless, deciphering this pyramid seemed his best chance at saving Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert, does the year 1514 mean anything to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen-fourteen? The question seemed apropos of nothing. Langdon shrugged. \"No. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine handed him the stone box. \"Look. The box is dated. Have a look under the light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon took a seat at the desk and studied the cube-shaped box beneath the light. Katherine put a soft hand on his shoulder, leaning in to point out the tiny text she had found carved on the exterior of the box, near the bottom corner of one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifteen-fourteen A.D.,\" she said, pointing into the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, the carving depicted the number 1514, followed by an unusual stylization of the letters A and D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This date,\" Katherine was saying, sounding suddenly hopeful, \"maybe it\u0027s the link we\u0027re missing? This dated cube looks a lot like a Masonic cornerstone, so maybe it\u0027s pointing to a real cornerstone? Maybe to a building built in 1514 A.D.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon barely heard her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen-fourteen A.D. is not a date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe symbol , as any scholar of medieval art would recognize, was a well-known symbature--a symbol used in place of a signature. Many of the early philosophers, artists, and authors signed their work with their own unique symbol or monogram rather than their name. This practice added a mysterious allure to their work and also protected them from persecution should their writings or artwork be deemed counterestablishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of this symbature, the letters A.D. did not stand for Anno Domini . . . they were German for something else entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon instantly saw all the pieces fall into place. Within seconds, he was certain he knew exactly how to decipher the pyramid. \"Katherine, you did it,\" he said, packing up. \"That\u0027s all we needed. Let\u0027s go. I\u0027ll explain on the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine looked amazed. \"The date 1514 A.D. actually means something to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon winked at her and headed for the door. \"A.D. isn\u0027t a date, Katherine. It\u0027s a person.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-symbol-robert-langdon-3/page-19.html","bookId":1515,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:38:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:38:41 AM"}
