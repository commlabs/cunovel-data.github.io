Someone was approaching them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up. Bogie was coming along the beach; he looked as if he was ready to film the sequel to The African Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny walked beside him, close, but as a daughter would be close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” Sean said, standing and dusting sand from his swim trunks. “I thought you hated to travel. This is a very long way. You’re welcome here, of course,” he added huskily. Madison knew that Sean believed Bogie had saved her life, far more than he had himself. And he was grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re ready to go,” Bogie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go?” Sean asked him, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny smiled, slipping an arm through Bogie’s. “I think Bogie’s right. We stay for a reason, a purpose. No matter how long it may take for that reason to come along, or what that reason may be. We’re almost sure we’ve fulfilled our purpose. So we came out to be with you until the sun sets, and then…well, there’s nothing like a Hawaiian sunset. We decided that might be the time to see if…if there’s another light.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Madison thought Bogie would argue. But he didn’t. They were spirits, visible to no one but them. Then again, they were alone on a beach, so what was real and what wasn’t didn’t seem important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean spread another blanket, and Bogie and Jenny joined them on the sand, and they spent the day talking about good things, Bogie laughing about incidents on set, Jenny enthralled by his tales of the past. Sean and Madison listened eagerly, as well; they’d never hear these stories again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the sun began to fall in the west. The sunset was striking and beautiful, shot through with what seemed like a hundred shades of gold and red and mauve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light seemed to burst brilliantly as the rest of the sky faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBogie turned back to Madison. “Here’s looking at you, kid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears sprang to her eyes as Bogie reached for Jenny’s hand, and they walked toward the light. Then they walked through it and were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean pulled Madison close and touched her cheek gently. “And now,” he said softly, “to life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To our lives,” she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked through the sand and the softening breeze of the night back to their cottage, and the time they could seize together before the journey that lay ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the journey and during it. Now and forever. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unholy-krewe-of-hunters-6/page-55.html","bookId":2280,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:02 PM"}
