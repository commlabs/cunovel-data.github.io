Zhou Weiqing’s hammers started sparkling - it was as though two stars had transformed into his hammers. A chill ran up his spine as a result of the surge of overwhelming and terrifying energy ripples. The black sword erupted at full force, transforming into a black tornado, attempting to block Zhou Weiqing’s attack.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eHowever, there was no way that Zhou Weiqing, a fellow Heavenly Emperor with the Nebula Saint Energy, would give him the opportunity to do that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThere weren’t any loud rumbling sounds this time, only a ‘ding’ sound. Something strange happened. The black distorted light surrounding the man in black had suddenly vanished. The black sword in his hand had also shattered into countless pieces, scattering all over the sky.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s movement did not seem fast. However, whenever he executed a simple movement, a ray of light in the sky would shine onto his body, boosting his Nebula Saint Energy in an instant. The nebula light at Zhou Weiqing’s chest became extremely strong; the original reddish golden light had started to become whitish gold in color.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eAfter a ‘bang’ sound, the black sword shattered into pieces. The man in black no longer had any weapon he could use to defend himself against Zhou Weiqing. Out of helplessness, he had to go all out, engaging his strongest skill against Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eHis body flew once again. This time, he was not escaping. At the same time, a dense aura erupted from his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eAt the Heavenly Emperor Stage, it was not as simple as the mere spurt of blood. Zhou Weiqing’s attack had directly jolted his body violently. Fine cracks had even started to appear on his Legendary Set. Of course, if it wasn’t for his Legendary Set acting as a shield, he would have suffered serious injuries from that attack.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003e“Stop!” shouted the man in black. The light in his hand flashed and a beautiful little girl appeared.

Wasn’t that the Sidhe Princess?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eAt this time, the Sidhe Queen had already rushed over. The moment she saw her daughter, she broke out in a cold sweat immediately.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe little girl was still unconscious. It was apparent that the man in black had locked her up in a storage of sorts. Of course, she was still alive, as the Sidhe Queen and Zhou Weiqing could sense her life aura.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe man in black gasped for air. He could not understand why Zhou Weiqing could become that strong in such a short period of time. What frightened him was that the powerful attribute that he had always relied on could no longer sense the presence of any other energy elements in the air.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eEven when he was within the Sidhe Queen’s Nature Celestial Territory, he could still sense Nature Attributes - it was only difficult for him to maneuver around. However, at this very moment, he could not sense any other attributes and at the same time, all his attributes were being suppressed, or else they would not be that passive. He could not even exhibit eighty percent of his cultivation at its peak. Without a doubt, everything was caused by the dazzling starry sky.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eHe could not comprehend what was going on at all, particularly the fact that he had used all of his power in his last few attacks! However, the end result was still as such. He simply could not accept what happened.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eZhou Weiqing stared coldly at him, “What do you have to say now? Hand the little girl over and I will consider sparing your life.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe man in black said ferociously, “Dream on. If I were to hand her over, you would not let me off. Stop talking and move out of the way. Get rid of whatever that is happening in the sky and let me go. Or else, I will shred this girl to pieces and take her to the grave with me.” He was very sure that he was unable to escape under the dazzling starry sky that Zhou Weiqing set up. However, he could vaguely guess that Zhou Weiqing had exhausted a massive amount of energy by using such an ability - he could not possibly maintain it for a long period of time. Hence, buying time was his most effective move at the moment. Furthermore, with the Sidhe Princess in his hands, he was able to prevent Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen from attacking him, as they would be afraid of endangering the princess. This was also the reason why he had maintained his composure earlier.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe Sidhe Queen clenched her fists tightly out of anger; her beautiful face went pale. Looking at her daughter in his hands, one could well imagine how furious she was. However, at this moment, she did not dare to act blindly without careful consideration. Even though she had full confidence in killing the enemy before her eyes, the opponent was after all a Heavenly Emperor - he could easily kill the Sidhe Princess in an instant, before she got to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe man in black was very cunning - he chose to reveal the Sidhe Princess before he suffered any significant damage. In doing so, he was able to flee for his life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003e“Did you guys hear what I just said? If you don’t listen to me, I will tear her arm apart.” As the man in black spoke, he lifted her lotus root-like arm.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe Sidhe Queen instinctively shouted, “Don’t!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s pupils contracted immediately. Tian’er had already been conceived with his child; he was about to become a father soon. Looking at his opponent’s despicable act, he was seething in anger.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eAfter taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing slowly put down both hammers and said in a low voice, “I can remove the starry sky, but you have to leave the child behind. Or else, I’d rather kill indiscriminately than let a bastard like you go.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe man in black laughed, “Brat, weren’t you very arrogant earlier? Do you think I will stay, just because you don’t want me to leave? Sidhe Queen, this is your child. Could it be that the both of you had committed adultery and conceived this child? If you want her to be alive, kill the fella next to you. Or else, hehe.” As he spoke, he had already straightened the Sidhe Princess’ arm - he only needed to exert a bit of strength to tear it apart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003e“He was right, you are indeed a scum and a beast.” The Sidhe Queen could no longer control her emotions. Her body was writhing in anger as she continuously released strong life aura from her body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eA light flashed.

He placed his hand on the Sidhe Queen’s shoulder, “Don’t be rash. For the sake of the child, we have to let him leave.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eAs he spoke, Zhou Weiqing lifted his hand and gestured it towards the dazzling starry sky. The stars in the sky slowly became dimmer, as though they were gradually disappearing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe man in black rejoiced in his heart. He could gradually start sensing the presence of the external elements that were previously blocked. Clearly, Zhou Weiqing had stopped using the Celestial Territory-like ability.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe starlight in the sky became dim and something strange happened after. All the starlight seemed to become more distant. The dazzling starry sky had also quickly vanished - the boundless night sky had gradually shrunk into a small ball. A light flashed, and it fell from the sky right into Zhou Weiqing’s palm. It was as though Zhou Weiqing had captured the starlight in the sky. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eEven though the Sidhe Queen was not emotionally stable, she was still stunned upon seeing that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eAt this time, Zhou Weiqing suddenly glared angrily at him and shouted, “Didn’t you say you wanted to kill her? Do it then. Let me help you.” As he spoke, he abruptly lifted his hand and struck towards the Sidhe Princess’ body. A strong whitish golden light penetrated his palm and headed directly for the Sidhe Princess.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe sudden change happened too fast. As Zhou Weiqing was speaking, he had already began gesturing; even the Sidhe Queen next to him could not stop him in time. Furthermore, the man in black was completely taken aback by his words. However, he would not try to dodge for fear that Zhou Weiqing’s attack might land on him instead.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003ePeople are selfish by nature. Naturally, the man in black would choose to use the Sidhe Princess as a shield. Additionally, a thought flashed across his mind: \u003cem\u003eSince this fella had the guts to strike the Sidhe Queen’s daughter, they would end up fighting each other. Even if the Sidhe Princess dies and my mission fails, at least I will be able to escape here alive.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003eThe whitish golden light accurately struck the Sidhe Princess’ body. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color:black;\"\u003e“Scoundrel, you……” The Sidhe Queen was completely shocked.
