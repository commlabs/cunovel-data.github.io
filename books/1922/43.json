{"id":63255,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have clothes and stuff...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All you need is the toothbrush in your purse. We can run by your place in the morning for the rest. I promise to get you to work on time.\" He pulled me into him and set his chin on the crown of my head. \"I\u0027d really like you to stay, Eva. I don\u0027t blame you for running, but it scared the hell out of me. I need to hang on to you for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to be held.\" I pushed my hands under the back of his T-shirt to caress the silken hardness of his bare back. \"I could also use a shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his nose in my hair, he inhaled deeply. \"I like you smelling like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he led me through the living room and down a hall to his bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" I breathed when he flicked on the light. A massive sleigh bed dominated the space, the wood dark - which he seemed to prefer - and the linens a soft cream. The rest of the furnishings matched the bed and the accents were brushed gold. It was a warm, masculine space with no art on the walls to detract from the serene night view of Central Park and the magnificent residential buildings on the other side. My side of Manhattan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bathroom\u0027s in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I took in the vanity, which appeared to have been made out of an antique claw-footed walnut cabinet, he pulled towels out of a companion armoire and set them out for me, moving with that confident sensual grace I admired so much. Seeing him in his home, dressed so casually, touched me. Knowing I was the only woman to have this experience with him affected me even more. I felt like I was seeing him more na**d now than I ever had. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me and seemed to understand that I was talking about more than the towels. His stare burned through me. \"It feels good to have you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea how I ended up like this, with you.\" But I really, really liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\" Gideon came to me, tilting my chin up to press a kiss to the tip of my nose. \"I\u0027ll lay out a T-shirt for you on the bed. Caviar and vodka sound good to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...that\u0027s quite a step up from pizza.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Petrossian\u0027s Ossetra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stand corrected.\" I smiled back. \"Several hundred steps up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showered and dressed in the oversized Cross Industries shirt he laid out for me; then I called Cary to tell him I\u0027d be out all night and give him a brief rundown about the hotel incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whistled. \"I\u0027m not even sure what to say about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA speechless Cary Taylor spoke volumes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined Gideon in the living room, and we sat on the floor at the coffee table to eat the prized caviar with mini toast and creme fraiche. We watched a rerun of a New York-set police procedural that just happened to include a scene filmed on the street in front of the Crossfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027d be cool to see a building I owned on TV like that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not bad, if they don\u0027t close off the street for hours to film.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bumped shoulders with him. \"Pessimist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe crawled into Gideon\u0027s bed at ten thirty and watched the last half of a show while curled up together. Sexual tension crackled in the air between us, but he didn\u0027t make any overtures so I didn\u0027t either. I suspected he was still trying to make amends for the hotel, trying to prove that he wanted to spend time with me not \"actively f**king.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked. As much as I desired his outrageously sexy body, it felt good just hanging out together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slept in the nude, which was fabulous for me to cuddle up against. I tossed one leg over his, wrapped an arm around his waist, and rested my cheek over his heart. I don\u0027t remember the ending of the show, so I suppose I fell asleep before it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I woke it was still dark in the room and I\u0027d rolled to the far side of my half of the bed. I sat up to see the digital clock face on Gideon\u0027s nightstand and found it was barely three in the morning. I usually slept straight through the night and thought maybe the strange surroundings were keeping me from sleeping deeply; then Gideon moaned and shifted restlessly and I realized what had disturbed me. The sound he made was pained, his subsequent hiss of breath tormented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch me,\" he whispered harshly. \"Get your f**king hands off of me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze, my heart racing. His words sliced through the dark, filled with fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sick bastard.\" He writhed, his legs kicking at the covers. His back arched on a groan that sounded perversely erotic. \"Don\u0027t. Ah, Christ...It hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strained, his body twisting. I couldn\u0027t bear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gideon.\" Because Cary had nightmares sometimes, I knew better than to touch a man in the throes of one. Instead, I knelt on my side of the bed and called his name. \"Gideon, wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilling abruptly, he fell to his back, tense and expectant. His chest heaved with panting breaths. His c**k was hard and lay heavily along his belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spoke firmly, although my heart was breaking. \"Gideon. You\u0027re dreaming. Come back to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe deflated into the mattress. \"Eva...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here.\" Shifting, I moved out of the way of the moonlight, but saw no luminous glitter that would tell me his eyes were open. \"Are you awake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breathing began to slow, but he didn\u0027t speak. His hands were fisted in the bottom sheet. I pulled the shirt I was wearing over my head and dropped it on the bed. I sidled closer, reaching out with a tentative hand to touch his arm. When he didn\u0027t move, I caressed him, my fingertips sliding gently over the hard muscle of his biceps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gideon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerked awake. \"What? What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back on my heels with my hands on my thighs. I saw him blink at me, and then shove both hands through his hair. I could feel the nightmare clinging to him, could sense it in the rigidness of his body. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-43.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
