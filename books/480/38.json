{"id":40790,"no":38,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII. GYPSY POETRY.","content":"Very little genuine Tzigane poetry has penetrated to the outer world, and many songs erroneously attributed to the gypsies (by Borrow among others) are proved to be adaptations of Spanish or Italian canzonets picked up in the course of their wanderings, while of those few which are undoubtedly their own productions hardly any exceed the length of six or eight lines.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We sing only when we are drunk,” was the answer given by an old gypsy to a collector of folk-songs, which pithy and concise definition of gypsy literature would seem to be a tolerably correct one—though, on the other hand, it might be urged with some show of reason that the gypsy, being often drunk, we might naturally expect his poetical effusions to be proportionately numerous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And perhaps they are in fact more numerous than is generally supposed, only that for lack of a recording pen to take note of them as they arise their momentary inspirations pass by unheeded, leaving no more mark behind than does the song of some wild forest-bird when it has ceased to wake the woodland echoes. The conditions of the gypsy’s life render all but impossible the task of a scribe, who has little chance of picking up anything of interest unless prepared for the time being to become almost a gypsy himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nor have there been wanting ardent folk-lorists (if I may coin a word) who have gone this length; so, for instance, Dr. Heinrich von Wlislocki, who, in the summer of 1883, spent several months as member of a wandering troop of tent gypsies in Transylvania and Southern Hungary, and has lately published a volume of gypsy fairy tales, the fruit of his laborious expedition. Yet on the whole the harvest is a meagre one, if we take account of the time and trouble spent on its realization; and even this energetic collector has declared that he would hardly have the courage a second time to face the deceptions and fatigues of such an undertaking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To his pen it is that we owe the first poem contained in this chapter; the second one, entitled, “The Black Voda,” interesting as being an almost solitary instance of a consecutive gypsy ballad, was communicated{274} to me by the courtesy of Professor Hugo von Meltzl, of Klausenburg, another Transylvanian authority in the matter of folk-lore, who, in his “Acta Comparationis Literarum Universum,” has given many interesting details bearing on these subjects.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other sixteen specimens of the Tzigane muse are so simple as to call for no explanation, though in one or two cases not wholly devoid of poetical merit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e GYPSY BALLAD.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e (From a German translation by Dr. H. von Wlislocki.)\n\u003cbr\u003e O’er the meadow, o’er the wold,\n\u003cbr\u003e Tracks a boy the wand’rer old,\n\u003cbr\u003e Who a scarf wears by his side—\n\u003cbr\u003e Follows him with stealthy stride.\n\u003cbr\u003e Bleeding fells the wand’rer prone\n\u003cbr\u003e In the forest dark and lone;\n\u003cbr\u003e And the boy has ta’en the life\n\u003cbr\u003e Of the man with murd’rous knife.\n\u003cbr\u003e Throws the corse all stained with blood\n\u003cbr\u003e In the river’s rushing flood;\n\u003cbr\u003e But, alas! not guessing he\n\u003cbr\u003e Who this ancient wand’rer be.\n\u003cbr\u003e Lightly running home then went,\n\u003cbr\u003e Till he reached his mother’s tent,\n\u003cbr\u003e Held the scarf before her eyes;\n\u003cbr\u003e She, long silent with surprise,\n\u003cbr\u003e Cried at last with passion wild,\n\u003cbr\u003e “Cursed be thou, my only child!\n\u003cbr\u003e May the slayer of his sire\n\u003cbr\u003e Branded be by Heaven’s ire;\n\u003cbr\u003e Hast thy father killed to-day,\n\u003cbr\u003e And his scarf hast stolen away!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e THE BLACK VODA.[66]\n\u003cbr\u003e “Rise, arise, my Velvet Georgie,[67]\n\u003cbr\u003e Waken, set you to the bellows;\n\u003cbr\u003e Forge and hammer nails of iron.”\n\u003cbr\u003e {275}\n\u003cbr\u003e Said the husband, “I am coming;\n\u003cbr\u003e Take the broom the dust out-sweeping.”\n\u003cbr\u003e And then Velvet Georgie rises,\n\u003cbr\u003e Straightway on his feet is standing.\n\u003cbr\u003e At the bellows quick down-sitting,\n\u003cbr\u003e Nails of iron he is forging.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then into the market going,\n\u003cbr\u003e Roast-meat fresh and juicy bought he,\n\u003cbr\u003e Roasted meat and white bread also.\n\u003cbr\u003e And he walked into the tavern,\n\u003cbr\u003e And he sat there eating, drinking,\n\u003cbr\u003e Never thinking of his consort,\n\u003cbr\u003e Nothing caring for her wishes—\n\u003cbr\u003e No new dress for her is buying.\n\u003cbr\u003e She to Voda ran complaining.\n\u003cbr\u003e Voda thus his love did answer,\n\u003cbr\u003e “To the merchant quickly hie thee,\n\u003cbr\u003e Ask him what a dress will cost thee.”\n\u003cbr\u003e To the town she ran off smiling,\n\u003cbr\u003e Chose a dress there for her wearing.\n\u003cbr\u003e Quoth the merchant, “Not on credit;\n\u003cbr\u003e Bring me cash before I sell it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Voda paid him down the money;\n\u003cbr\u003e Paid and went— But Velvet Georgie,\n\u003cbr\u003e From the tavern soon returning,\n\u003cbr\u003e Found his wife, and in his anger\n\u003cbr\u003e Threw her in the glowing furnace,\n\u003cbr\u003e Whence she, loud with cries of anguish,\n\u003cbr\u003e Called upon her absent lover:\n\u003cbr\u003e “Voda, Voda, O Black Voda,\n\u003cbr\u003e See how both my feet are burning!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Let them burn, O faithless lassie,\n\u003cbr\u003e Many pair of boots hast cost me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Voda, Voda, O Black Voda,\n\u003cbr\u003e See now how my waist is burning!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Let it burn, thou brazen hussy,\n\u003cbr\u003e Worn out hast thou many dresses.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Voda, Voda, O Black Voda,\n\u003cbr\u003e How my bosom burns and scorches!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Let it burn, O shameless harlot,\n\u003cbr\u003e Many hands have oft caressed it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Voda, Voda, O Black Voda,\n\u003cbr\u003e Both my hands are burning sorely!”\n\u003cbr\u003e {276}\n\u003cbr\u003e “Let them burn, O wanton lassie,\n\u003cbr\u003e Many pair of gloves they cost me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Voda, Voda, O Black Voda,\n\u003cbr\u003e Now my neck is burning also!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Let it burn, thou brazen hussy,\n\u003cbr\u003e Many beads hast worn around it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Voda, Voda, O Black Voda,\n\u003cbr\u003e Now my lips the fire is catching!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Let them burn, O shameless harlot,\n\u003cbr\u003e Many kisses hast thou given.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Voda, Voda, O Black Voda,\n\u003cbr\u003e Now my head itself is burning!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Let it burn, thou worthless baggage,\n\u003cbr\u003e Let the fire destroy thee wholly.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e GYPSY RHYMES.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e
