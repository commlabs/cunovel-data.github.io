But you\u0027ll have to hide her from Dad. You know how he feels about pets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but I\u0027m not bringing a lizard home this time. It\u0027s just a kitty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get that?\" my dad asked, coming down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander gave her to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if the president gave it to you. It has to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul, she is really cute,\" my mom commented, petting Nightmare\u0027s head. \"And Raven is certainly old enough to be responsible for a cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her age is not what I\u0027m concerned about,\" he warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, didn\u0027t I prove enough to you by working at Armstrong Travel? I\u0027m not a little girl anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused as I held my Nightmare up to his face. \"Fine. But she stays in your room. I don\u0027t want her running all around the kitchen countertops or scratching on my couch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Dad.\" I gave him a huge hug and kiss on his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I\u0027ll show you your new home,\" I said to Nightmare as I took her to my bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around my room. I didn\u0027t know where to put her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have an old box in the garage filled with clothes from college that would be a perfect bed for her,\" Mom said, peeking in. \"It\u0027s above the tools. Bring me the box and I\u0027ll repack the clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to close my bedroom door when Nightmare began to follow me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right back, sweetie,\" I said, putting her in the middle of the floor. \"I\u0027m going to make you a bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNightmare\u0027s ears perked up, and she looked at the window. She darted up onto my computer chair and then onto my desk. She stared out the window, hissing. I picked her up and placed her on my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right back. Sleep here for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reached my bedroom door, Nightmare was back at my feet, her lime green eyes squinting at me. She hissed at me and pawed at my boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked her up. \"Mommy will be right back.\" I kissed my new kitty on the nose, placed her back on the floor, and quickly closed the door. I could hear her scratching against the wood as I ran down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked to our garage at the end of our driveway. I stood on my dad\u0027s toolbox as I searched for the box. I could hear the crickets. There was a lot of rustling in the tree by my bedroom window. I froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore rustling. It could be a squirrel. Or having just seen Trevor last night, I thought he could be toilet papering my window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned off the garage light and tiptoed over to the tree. But now the leaves were still. Not a bird. Not a squirrel. Not a soccer snob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed back to the garage, and then I saw Jagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you went back to Romania,\" I said, stepping back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping you would come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander assured me that the feud was over and you were gone for good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is why you can\u0027t tell him,\" he said. \"Otherwise, not only will your safety and Sterling\u0027s be in jeopardy, but the whole town\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole town?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tempt me,\" he said, licking his lips. \"You wouldn\u0027t like to know what happens when a small town finds out a vampire is living among them and dating one of their daughters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze. I remembered how easily Dullsville was sucked into Trevor\u0027s rumor, resulting in gossip and graffiti. If the town had proof of Alexander\u0027s true identity, there was no predicting what people would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, I won\u0027t tell him. But you must leave now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger only stepped closer. \"I\u0027m not going back to the cemetery with you,\" I argued, backing up. \"I\u0027ll scream if I have to. My father is inside and he\u0027s a lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That won\u0027t be necessary. Why spend your life sitting in a mansion with a sensitive artist watching paint dry when we could see the world together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going anywhere with you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m sure you could persuade me to stay in town. In fact, I\u0027m beginning to like it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you! Your feud is over with Alexander. Go home already--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feud? I have other things on my mind now. Alexander might be able to deny who he is, but I can\u0027t deny who I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue and green eyes shot through me. I looked away, afraid he\u0027d make me dizzy again. He began to lean into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raven!\" Billy Boy called from the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother ran down the steps holding Nightmare. Jagger stepped back into the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy Boy! Go inside. Now!\" I exclaimed, running toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s taking you so long?\" Billy Boy asked. \"Nightmare is throwing a freak attack. I found her pawing against your bedroom door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blocked Billy Boy\u0027s step. Frantically, I turned around, shielding him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe backyard was empty. Jagger was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled Billy Boy inside and locked the door. \"I\u0027ve never been so happy to see you!\" I said, squeezing my little brother, Nightmare in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" he asked, cringing like I had cooties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just thought I saw the bogeyman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You watch too many scary movies,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sometimes feel like I\u0027m starring in them,\" I replied. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissing-coffins-vampire-kisses-2/page-16.html","bookId":1867,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:26 PM"}
