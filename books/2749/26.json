No one can help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard more sounds coming from behind her. People were coming. Her people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t beat us,\" I said. \"Kill me, take me, it doesn\u0027t matter. The Gallagher Academy will just make more girls like me. If one of lives, we all live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they will.\" She smiled. \"They made me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything - I swear I really didn\u0027t - but the look on my face must have spoken volumes, because in the next moment, the woman was laughing a terrible, joyless laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, didn\u0027t Zach ever mention that his mother was a Gallagher Girl?\" She cocked an eyebrow, then shrugged. \"I guess not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I shook my head. \"No. Gallagher Girls are -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are whatever we want to be, Cammie.\" She stepped closer. I cringed at the word we.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Anything we want to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about what Abby and the Baxters had said that night in the castle - that the Circle had a knack for recruiting agents very young . . . Joe Solomon had grown up and seen the light and spent his life trying to right his wrongs. But most people - I looked at Zach\u0027s mother, at the dark depths of her eyes - most never left the tombs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, see? We\u0027re sisters, Cammie. You really don\u0027t have to be afraid. What we need lives inside of you.\" She tapped her temple. \"We only want to borrow it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Solomon was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t go with you,\" I said, easing closer to the edge, remembering her promise and the fact that had haunted me for months: They wanted me alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Cammie, step away from that nasty cliff. Don\u0027t be foolish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not foolish,\" I said, more certain of anything than I\u0027d ever been in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the water was deafening. The back of my shirt was wet with mist. I wanted to wipe the water from my eyes, but I needed my hands in front of me. I needed to be ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to do this, Cammie. We really aren\u0027t going to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said, and I did. Sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just want to take you someplace - ask you some question. Help you . . . remember . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. some things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you do,\" I moved, and the rocks at my feet crumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Solomon was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer own son was dead, and still she was chasing me and whatever secret I carried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been studying Protection and Enforcement for five and a half years, but until that moment I\u0027d never seriously thought what it would feel like to kill someone - until then I\u0027d never wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked. \"What are you thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to decide whether or not I should kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"You can\u0027t kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I could. At that moment I was so full of fear and rage and grief that I could have done it. Easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed harder and stepped slowly closer, as if that wall of water and air were the worst possible fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Zach\u0027s mother leaned close, as it confiding, and said, \"It you kill me, then who will take you to your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lunged for me, but I was the one who no longer had anything to lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before her words had found a place in my mind - before the Circle Operatives who were rushing down the tunnel could reach us - I thought about the ravens, and I spread my wings to fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jump didn\u0027t kill me, in case you don\u0027t already know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember breaking through the falls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember fresh air and the cold wind and thinking I could fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was the crash and the freezing currents that fell over and over and over me like a blanket I was trapped inside as I fought to break free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was nothing. No more blankets. No fire. No heat and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for the first time in months I slept and did not dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cammie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard my name echo through the night, riding on the wind. My body ached. My clothes clung to me, heavy and wet. I could hear the river and the yells and something else, a voice inside of me telling me it wasn\u0027t safe. The Circle was still out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to move. I had to hide. I thought about the last thing Zach had ever asked of me: I had to keep running and I could never, ever look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot when I heard the helicopter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot when I saw the spotlight sweeping across the open ground along the river and then burning me, holding me steady in its glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot when I heard the deep voice yell, \"I have her! She\u0027s here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot when the strong arms wrapped around me, and someone said, \"Hold still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even when the black chopper landed on the ground in front of me and my mother flew from its open door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to keep running even then, but my feet no longer met the ground. I tried to fight, but the arms that held me were too strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rachel,\" Agent Townsend said, still gripping me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cammie, sweetheart, stop fighting,\" my mother said as my teacher carried me beneath the whirling blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was loud inside the helicopter. I tried to move, but the entire right side of my body was on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Solomon,\" I started, but the words were strangled in a cough, as if my lungs had carried the explosion with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart, your shoulder is dislocated. There\u0027s going to be a great deal of pain when the shock wears off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat shock? I wanted to say, but I reached for my mother\u0027s hand instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" I whispered. \"She was going to take me to Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s hallucinating, Rachel.\" Agent Townsend was talking above me. He and my mother were talking about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s alive!\" I bolted upright and a pain like I\u0027d never known shot through me. \"They\u0027re dead,\" I mumbled, but everything was swirling, fading into black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon admission to the Gallagher Academy infirmary, Operative Morgan was poked, prodded, shot, scanned, x-rayed, and bandaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not, however, questioned, interrogated, debriefed, or told what the heck was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom?\" My voice was so scratchy, I barely recognized it as my own. \"Is my mother here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Someone behind me spoke. I heard the door close, watched Agent Townsend walk to the foot of my metal bed. \"She isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to talk to my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t be here at the moment, Ms. Morgan. I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll have to start with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"But I can\u0027t. You see, I have a plane to catch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so maybe it was the drugs they had me on, but that almost sounded like good news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to sit upright, but my body didn\u0027t want to obey. My shoulder ached, and my right side was one continuous, massive bruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s broken,\" he said, as if it were a miracle, and I guess it really was. \"But you\u0027re going to be sore for a while. The fall dislocated your shoulder and you inhaled a lot of smoke, but you\u0027re going to be okay, young lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down in the metal chair at the foot of my bed. \"Now, tell me what happened in the tombs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him everything - I really did. From finding out the truth about Blackthorne to the sight of the Circle dragging Mr. Solomon back to the place that, in a way, had started it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told it in detail and in order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Solomon would have been extremely proud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I talked, Agent Townsend listened, but he didn\u0027t take a single note - he didn\u0027t say a single word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then I jumped,\" I told him finally. I looked down at my bruised body. \"I guess . . . I guess you know the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly. \"Yes. I suppose I might even know a bit more than you.\" He placed his elbows on his knees and leaned closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve pulled three bodies from the wreckage so far, and they are still digging. Your roommates are completely unharmed. Although probably more than a little irate that they\u0027re being kept from you,\" he added, as if the drama of teenage girls was seriously starting to weigh on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he leaned closer, his voice low as he added, \"And something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the door and came back with a wheelchair. A minute later Agent Townsend was pushing me into a dim room that was larger than my own. Machines beeped. Nurses and doctors moved with noiseless steps. And in the center of it all, a man lay on a bed, broken and burned, one eye swollen completely shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A young man brought him here late last night. He has no ID. No name.\" As Townsend pushed me closer, I felt myself stop breathing. The man on the bed was bandaged almost from head to toe, and yet when the wheelchair stopped, I saw a face I\u0027d first seen at the back of the Grand Hall a year and a half before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So perhaps we\u0027ll just call him . . . Mr. S.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to take his hand, but I didn\u0027t want to touch him and risk finding out it was a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me, Ms. Morgan,\" Townsend said. \"I\u0027m afraid I really must be leaving. MI6 has a lot of questions, as you might imagine, and I -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My job here was to find Joe Solomon, young lady.\" He looked at me for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Joe Solomon is dead. Witnesses saw him die in an explosion just last night.\" Tears swelled in my eyes, but I didn\u0027t try to stop him. I didn\u0027t say thank you or I\u0027m sorry or any of a dozen other things that Agent Townsend probably had no desire to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I watched him look at the man in the bed - the man who\u0027d come closer to destroying the Circle than anyone alive. I saw him nod at Mr. Solomon and heard him whisper, \"There\u0027s no need for anyone to chase him anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTownsend was halfway to the door when he stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes,\" he said, turning. \"You were clutching this last night.\" He pulled the small-bound notebook from his pocket and handed it to me. I almost didn\u0027t recognize it without its plastic wrapping. \"Interesting choice of books you have there, Ms. Morgan.\" He turned slowly around. \"Most interesting indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been chasing the Circle, Agent Townsend?\" I called suddenly, stopping, stopping him at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A long time,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think my father is with them? Do you think he\u0027s alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was flat as he said, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, kiddo,\" my mother said form behind me. But instead of turning, I stayed seated, staring at Mr. Solomon, wondering, not for the first time, if I was looking at a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he . . . Is he going to make it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too soon to say, sweetheart,\" Mom admitted. She moved closer. \"How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t answer. Instead, I turned and asked, \"Where\u0027s Zach? He\u0027s the one who brought Mr. Solomon back, isn\u0027t he? Is he here? Is he -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s fine, kiddo. A little burned. A little bruised. But he\u0027ll be fine. And yes, he\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inched closer. \"In fact, I\u0027ve been on the phone with the trustees all morning, getting their permission for him to finish the semester with us.\" She took a deep breath. \"There\u0027s no place safe for him to go.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/only-the-good-spy-young-gallagher-girls-4/page-26.html","bookId":2749,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM"}
