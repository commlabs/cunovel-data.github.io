{"id":19215,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"Paul had the best seat in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. He sat in the back of the room. It was the seat that was the farthest away from Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls was teaching the class about fractions. She drew a picture of a pie on the blackboard. She cut the pie into eight pieces. She explained that each piece was one-eighth of the pie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Paul never paid attention. He didn\u0027t see the picture of the pie. He didn\u0027t see anything.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, he did see one thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Actually, he saw two things.\n\u003cbr\u003e 39He saw Leslie\u0027s two pigtails.\n\u003cbr\u003e Leslie sat in front of Paul. She had two long, brown pigtails that reached all the way down to her waist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Paul saw those pigtails, and a terrible urge came over him. He wanted to pull a pigtail. He wanted to wrap his fist around it, feel the hair between his fingers, and just yank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He thought it would also be fun to tie the pigtails together, or better yet, tie them to her chair. But most of all, he just wanted to pull one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Slowly he reached for the one on the right. \"NO! What am I doing?\" he thought. \"I\u0027ll only get into trouble.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Paul had it made. He sat in the back of the room. He paid no attention to anyone, and nobody paid any attention to him. But if he pulled a pigtail, it would be all over. Leslie would tell on him, and he\u0027d become the center of attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sighed and slowly withdrew his arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Paul couldn\u0027t ignore those pigtails. There they were, dangling right in front of him, just begging to be pulled. He could close his eyes, but he couldn\u0027t make the pigtails disappear. He could still smell them. And hear them. He could almost taste them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe just a little tug,\" he thought. \"No, none.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There they hung, easily within his reach.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well let them just hang there!\" thought Paul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It would be foolish to pull one, no matter how tempting they were. None of the other children in the class pulled pigtails; why should he? Of course, none of the other children sat behind Leslie, either.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was just a simple matter of being able to thinkclearly.\n\u003cbr\u003e 40That was all. Paul thought it over and decided not to pull one. It was as simple as that.\n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly his arm shot forward. He grabbed Leslie\u0027s right pigtail and yanked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!\" screamed Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everybody looked at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Paul pulled my pigtail,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They all looked at Paul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I ... I couldn\u0027t help it,\" said Paul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027d better learn to help it,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She wrote Paul\u0027s name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. \"Tell Leslie you\u0027re sorry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry, Leslie,\" said Paul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hmmmph,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Paul felt horrible. Never again would he pull another pigtail! Except, there was one problem. He still wasn\u0027t satisfied. He had pulled the right one, but that wasn\u0027t enough. He wanted to pull the left one, too. It was as if he heard a little voice coming from the pigtail saying, \"Pull me, Paul. Pull me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can\u0027t,\" Paul answered. \"My name\u0027s already on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Big deal,\" said the pigtail. \"Pull me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No way,\" said Paul. \"Never again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aw, come on, Paul, just a little tug,\" urged the pigtail. \"What harm could it do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lots of harm,\" said Paul. \"Leslie will scream, and I\u0027ll get in trouble again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Boy, that\u0027s not fair,\" whined the pigtail. \"You pulled the right one. Now it\u0027s my turn.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know, but I can\u0027t,\" said Paul.\n\u003cbr\u003e 41\"Sure you can,\" said the pigtail. \"Just grab me and yank.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Paul. \"It\u0027s not right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure it is, Paul,\" said the pigtail. \"Pigtails are meant to be pulled. That\u0027s what we\u0027re here for.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell that to Leslie,\" said Paul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Leslie won\u0027t mind,\" said the pigtail. \"I promise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I bet,\" said Paul. \"Just like she didn\u0027t mind the last time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You just didn\u0027t pull hard enough,\" said the pigtail. \"Leslie likes us pulled real hard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Really?\" asked Paul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Cross my heart,\" said the pigtail, \"the harder, the better.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Okay,\" said Paul, \"but if you\u0027re lying. ...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I promise,\" said the pigtail.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Paul grabbed the left pigtail. It felt good in his hand. He pulled as hard as he could.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\" screamed Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls asked, \"Paul, did you pull Leslie\u0027s pigtail again?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Paul. \"I pulled the other one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the children laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you trying to be funny?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Paul. \"I was trying to be fair. I couldn\u0027t pull one and not the other.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The children laughed again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pigtails are meant to be pulled,\" Paul concluded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls put a check next to Paul\u0027s name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But at last Paul was satisfied.\n\u003cbr\u003e 42True, his name was on the blackboard with a check next to it, but that really didn\u0027t matter. All he had to do was stay out of trouble the rest of the day, and his name would be erased. It\u0027s easy to stay out of trouble when you have the best seat in the class.\n\u003cbr\u003e In fact, Paul could do this every day. He could pull Leslie\u0027s pigtails twice, and then stay out of trouble the rest of the day. There was nothing Leslie could do about it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly, out of nowhere, Leslie screamed, \"Yaaaahhhhhhhh!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls circled Paul\u0027s name and sent him home early on the kindergarten bus. Nobody would believe that he hadn\u0027t pulled Leslie\u0027s pigtail again.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56817.html","bookId":627,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM"}
