Racing across a glen and then huffing back up the next rise, she ignored her burning lungs and the razor-sharp stitch in her side. She was suddenly certain. She needed to get to MacColla, immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the top, she saw him at once. And shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” she screamed, racing along the ridge, trying to make sense of what she saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been captured. One held him, one more was behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MacColla!” The man at his back was lifting his musket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight glinted sharply off the metal. The whole scene was so muted, so faraway. “MacColla, watch out!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to make him hear her. Look, turn, watch out. Haley was stumbling downhill to him when she heard the shot crack, and she froze, watching in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla fell to his knees, and her heart tore from her body. Haley collapsed at the same moment, her pose mirroring his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to rise, go to him. But she was paralyzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up then, and a sob ripped from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he watching her? She cried his name. Did he see her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God, MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley hoped he saw her. But she hoped too that his last thought wouldn\u0027t be that she\u0027d failed him. Or worse, that he\u0027d failed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe teetered to standing. She needed to get to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinched, his lips moved. And Haley saw the puddle of crimson spread at his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MacColla!” she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man at his back looked up to her position, but Haley didn\u0027t care. She could think only of MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes held hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wavered. MacColla fell to his belly and was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley held her breath, and waited. She felt the slow pounding of each heartbeat. Heard it thundering, a whoosh and roar like the sea in her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited, but she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer MacColla was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ranted then, raving and shrieking his name as if she could call him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead. She\u0027d followed him, but she was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MacColla.” she shrieked again, trying to call him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSobs tore from her. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShuddering and wailing, her body gnarled in on itself. She clawed at her chest for air, but the sobs crushed the breath from her lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God, MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crumpled to the ground, her sobs slowly quieting into weeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d lost her one true love. She was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t saved him. And he was gone from her, forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she thought. Panic would do her no good. She had to fight. It wouldn\u0027t be over until she herself was cold and dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My condolences, love,” a man shouted to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking downhill, she spotted him. His killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man who\u0027d shot MacColla in the back was climbing up the slope to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down to the valley. The other man knelt over MacColla\u0027s body, paying no mind to what happened above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed her eyes and laughed. “Shot in the back like a coward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you!” Haley snarled, scrubbing the tears from her face. Anger was like acid in her veins, its poison curdling her sorrow into vengeance. “Fuck you,” she said again, more loudly, scrambling to her knees to pull the musket from her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” she muttered, fumbling to remove her flint and steel from a pouch at her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStruggling to hold the match and steel file in one hand, she struck the flint down, but the sparks were too weak to light the thin stretch of rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing at her, the man broke into an uphill jog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit dammit.” Her hands trembled. Errant memories came to her. She saw her brother\u0027s lighter in his hand, Gerry\u0027s nervous fingers flipping the silver lid of the old Zippo, open and shut. The image was too painful, too sharp to touch, and she pushed it from her mind. “Dammit,” she cried, hysteria sharpening her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struck harder, and sparks flew. They landed on her hand, danced bright white on her skin, seared her. And then winked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was approaching. She opened her senses, heard his boots scrambling up grass and rocks, felt his presence twenty feet away. She continued to struggle with the flint, but she was almost out of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley spared a quick glance. Ten feet away. Close to the top. Casually using his musket as a walking stick. The same musket that had killed MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage filled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crested the hill. Six feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tossed the flint and match down. The soldier sprinted at her, and Haley\u0027s hands wrapped tight around the base of her gun. So long and heavy in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought she\u0027d be easy prey. He was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley sprung to her feet, swinging the musket like a windmill before her. The sheer weight of it increasing its own momentum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt slammed into the man\u0027s arm. knocking his gun from his hand. It spiraled and slid downhill, out of reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held the musket like a bat in front of her, arms trembling from the awkward weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was going to show you mercy,” he said, rubbing his forearm. Fury was in his eyes. “But I think I\u0027ll have you beg for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung again, but the musket was too cumbersome and he stood too close. The man snatched the barrel and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled to pull it from his grasp, letting panic get the better of her. What am I doing? The man would win any contest against her. She knew that. She needed to remember what her father had taught her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman had two options. Fight dirty, or run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley let go and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him throw the musket. Heard him race after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pumped her arms, felt one of her leather slippers fly off. Hiking her skirts up, she raced faster, but it was a struggle along the uneven ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis panting breath came louder now. He was catching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFight dirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley stopped short, used her momentum as she spun, bringing the heel of her hand up hard. She aimed for his nose, but the man ducked at the last moment, and she simply grazed his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrenched her wrist with one hand and reached for his belt with the other. Knife. She spotted it hanging from his belt, tucked in an elaborate, brass-studded leather scabbard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t let him get to his knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCounterintuitive, she heard her father say. The most basic principles of street fighting were counterintuitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley leapt for him, twining her legs around his. He still had a death grip on her wrist, so she used her free hand to strike at his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou killed MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinched away, but her nails found flesh, and she clawed down hard, feeling the meat of his lower eyelid and cheek warm and wet under her nails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good Christ,” the man screeched, and the shock in his voice girded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled, squinting his eyes shut tight, wriggling his free hand between them to get at his blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll kill you. Like you killed him.” She hooked her thumb on the bone of his eye socket. Began to push in. “Kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Christ, bitch,” he hissed, struggling to dislodge her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demon. Hellcat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley reeled. Hellcat. Memories of MacColla cascaded rapid-fire into her mind. Of that fight so long ago when he\u0027d called her that same name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe faltered, and her opponent struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrenching his arm between them, he elbowed her in the belly just as he got a grip on his dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leapt off him, but he still held her wrist. Focus or die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand was growing numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreak his grip. She ducked, swinging her arm up and around, and his hand automatically released her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was close, though. Too close for her to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the blade in his hand. It was a preposterously elegant little thing, with a brass horse head for a pommel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefang the snake, she heard her father say. Go for the knife arm. Make your opponent lose his blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley quickly shook life into her hands, then attacked at once. A rapid scissor strike, smacking the inside of his wrist with her right and the back of his hand with her left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knife flew from his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was stunned, but it lasted just a moment. The man clearly hadn\u0027t expected a fight, and he was furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun. Haley turned and took off again, loping and sliding down the far side of the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him behind her. He was closing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla. She wanted MacColla. She wanted this all to be over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this was it. This man would kill her like he killed MacColla and it would all be over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a shot crack overhead and flinched. Did he have a pistol? Haley dove into a low tangle of shrubbery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she shot? Her heart felt like it would burst from her chest. Was that what it felt like to be shot? Is this what MacColla had felt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA part of her welcomed it. MacColla. If she were shot dead, would she see him once more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then her opponent shouted. Another shot was fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a familiar voice, and was relieved and heartbroken both. Not MacColla. Haley crawled from the gorse and looked up to see Rollo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm, he sat his horse at the top of the ridge as if they were a statue carved of granite. It took her mind a moment to understand what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come, Haley,” he said. “Fast now. They approach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind kicked back into gear, and using both hands and feet, she scampered uphill, where Rollo swung her behind him on the saddle, seating her sideways as he galloped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to see her lover one last time. Her MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying dead on the field below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry there\u0027s not true shelter to be had.” Rollo leaned forward to stoke the fire he\u0027d built at the mouth of the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d ridden hard and long, reaching a rocky bit of Irish shore. His legs were trembling by the end of it, looking like the solid and knotted branches of some tree. Haley didn\u0027t know where on earth they were, and she was too numb to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But there\u0027s nobody I trust,” he added, pounding life into his muscles. “I\u0027ll bring us back to Scotland ”-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where?” she interrupted, despondence giving an edge to her voice. “I\u0027ve got nowhere to go.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-42.html","bookId":1617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM"}
