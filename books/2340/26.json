Ten o\u0027clock in the morning, Thursday July third. The fax machine was rolling out a long reply to their inquiry. The face in the photograph had been identified immediately. The subject\u0027s service record had been pulled straight off the Pentagon computer and faxed along with the name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You recall this guy now?\" Brogan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reacher?\" Johnson repeated vaguely. \"I don\u0027t know. What did he do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebster and the General\u0027s aide were crowding the machine, reading the report as the paper spooled out. They twisted it right side up and walked slowly away to keep it up off the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he do?\" McGrath asked them urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Webster said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing?\" McGrath repeated. \"Why would they have a record on him if he didn\u0027t do anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was one of them,\" Webster said. \"Major Jack Reacher, military police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide was racing through the length of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silver Star,\" he said. \"Two Bronzes, Purple Heart. This is a hell of a record, sir. This guy was a hero, for God\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcGrath opened up his envelope and pulled out the original video pictures of the kidnap, black-and-white, un-enlarged, grainy. He selected the first picture of Reacher\u0027s involvement. The one catching him in the act of seizing Holly\u0027s crutch and pulling the dry cleaning from her grasp. He slid the photograph across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big hero,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson bent to study the picture. McGrath slid over the next. The one showing Reacher gripping Holly\u0027s arm, keeping her inside the tight crush of attackers. Johnson picked it up and stared at it. McGrath wasn\u0027t sure whether he was staring at Reacher, or at his daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s thirty-seven,\" the General\u0027s aide read aloud. \"Mustered out fourteen months ago. West Point, thirteen years\u0027 service, big heroics in Beirut right at the start. Sir, you pinned a Bronze on him, ten years ago. This is an absolutely outstanding record throughout. He\u0027s the only non-Marine in history to win the Wimbledon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebster looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tennis?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide smiled briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Wimbledon,\" he said. \"The Wimbledon. Marine Sniper School runs a competition, the Wimbledon Cup. For snipers. Open to anybody, but a Marine always wins it, except one year Reacher won it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why didn\u0027t he serve as a sniper?\" McGrath asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beats me,\" he said. \"Lots of puzzles in this record. Like why did he leave the service at all? Guy like this should have made it all the way to the top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson had a picture in each hand and he was staring closely at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why did he leave?\" Brogan asked. \"Any trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide shook his head. Scanned the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing in the record,\" he said. \"No reason given. We were shedding numbers at the time, but the idea was to cull the no-hopers. A guy like this shouldn\u0027t have been shaken out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson switched the photographs into the opposite hands, like he was looking for a fresh perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anybody know him real well?\" Milosevic asked. \"Anybody we can talk to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can dig up his old commander, I guess,\" the aide said. \"Might take us a day to get hold of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it,\" Webster said. \"We need information. Anything at all will help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson put the photographs down and slid them back to McGrath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must have turned bad,\" he said. \"Sometimes happens. Good men can turn bad. I\u0027ve seen it myself, time to time. It can be a hell of a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcGrath reversed the photographs on the shiny table and stared at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not kidding,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson looked back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I keep that picture?\" he said. \"The first one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcGrath shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"You want a picture, I\u0027ll take one myself. You and your daughter standing together in front of a headstone, this asshole\u0027s name on it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/die-trying-jack-reacher-2/page-26.html","bookId":2340,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:40 AM"}
