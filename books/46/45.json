{"id":1283,"no":45,"title":"WESTSIDER GEORGE LANG","content":"WESTSIDER GEORGE LANG\n\u003cbr\u003e Owner of the Cafe des Artistes\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 8-4-79\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e George Lang, artist and perfectionist, could have become a success in any of a hundred professions. In 1946, when he arrived in the U.S. from his native Hungary, he got a job as violinist with the Dallas Symphony. But Lang soon discovered that the orchestra pit was too confining for a man of his vision. He might have turned to composition or conducting; instead he decided to switch to a different field entirely — cooking. Today, at 54, he is the George Balanchine of the food world — a \"culinary choreographer\" with an international reputation for knowing virtually everything relevant that is to be known about food preparation and restaurants.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lang\u0027s imagination, Gourmet magazine once wrote, \"is as fertile as the Indus Valley.\" This imagination, combined with his keen intelligence, his concern for details, his natural versatility, and his seemingly endless capacity for work, have enabled him to rewrite the definition of the term \"restaurant consultant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As head of the George Lang Corporation, a loosely structured group of associates that he founded in 1971, he commands $2,500 a day plus expenses for jetting around the world, giving advice on restaurant and kitchen design, menu planning, and every other aspect of a restaurant from the lighting to the color of the napkins.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His large-scale projects in the past few years include food consulting and\n\u003cbr\u003e design for Marriot Motor Hotels, Holiday Inn, the Cunard Lines, and\n\u003cbr\u003e Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. He was the chief planner for The\n\u003cbr\u003e Market, a three-level, 20-shop marketplace in the East Side\u0027s Citicorp\n\u003cbr\u003e Center. In 1975, when he took over the West Side\u0027s famous Cafe des\n\u003cbr\u003e Artistes, the business quadrupled within weeks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A prolific author as well, Lang has written several books and hundreds of articles for leading publications, including the Encyclopedia Britannica. His column, \"Table for One,\" is a regular feature of Travel \u0026amp; Leisure magazine. He has bottled burgundy under his own label, arranged parties for the rich and famous, and served as consultant for Time-Life\u0027s series on international cookery.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His office has a miniature garden in the middle; the wall are lined with 5,000 catalogued cookbooks. He comes sailing into the room and takes a seat at his semicircular desk, which all but engulfs him. Short in stature, bald as a gourd, he moves with a darting energy that sees him through 20 hour workdays with as many as 30 food tastings. His softly accented speech is the only thing about him that is slow, because Lang chooses his words carefully, aiming for the same perfection in English as in everything else. Although modesty is not one of his characteristics, he gives full credit to his staff for being equal partners in his corporation\u0027s success. There is a feeling of camaraderie in the air, as if all are members of a single family.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Cafe des Artistes, he admits, was a moderately successful French restaurant for 60 years before he took it over. \"But it needed spiritual changes as well as physical changes. And — let me underline this and triple-space it — excellent food. You cannot chew scenery. We maintain a certain kind of formal informality, which simply means that anyone can come, dressed any way they want, as long as their behavior will justify their white tie or dungarees. I could raise the prices by 50 to 100 percent overnight, and I wouldn\u0027t lose a single customer. But feel an obligation to New York City and the restaurant industry to maintain what I call reasonable prices.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His corporation also owns the Hungaria Restaurant at Citicorp, which has a gypsy orchestra from Budapest, and Small Pleasures, a pastry shop in the same building. However, Lang stresses that \"98 percent of our business comes from consulting. I always think in terms of problems and solutions, because every restaurant must be designed to suit the needs of a particular market. At Alexander\u0027s, for example, we came up with a restaurant where you could have a reasonably pleasant luncheon for two to four dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Still an ardent music lover, George Lang plays the violin whenever time permits. He recently acquired a Stradivarius and says with a laugh, \"I\u0027m threatening to get back completely to shape and play a concert.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lang enjoys the European atmosphere of the West Side, where he has lived for the past 30 years. Among his favorite Westside restaurants: the Moon Palace on Broadway, Sakura Chaya on Columbus, and Le Poulailler on 65th Street.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His latest endeavor is a 4-to-6-minute TV spot titled Lang at Large, which is broadcast twice a month on the CBS network show Sunday Morning. \"It\u0027s part of my new career,\" he announces joyfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Asked about which aspect of his work gives him the most satisfaction, Lang ponders for a moment and concludes: \"It would be easiest for me to say that my biggest thrill is to see an idea of mine become a three dimensional reality, especially if it may be a $50 million project. But actually, an even bigger thrill for me is to go to an obscure place in the world, and see a bit of improvement in people\u0027s lives through the effort of someone who was my former disciple.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44936.html","bookId":46,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:58:43 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:58:43 AM"}
