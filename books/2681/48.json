A diversion, as it were, to draw your attention away from the real target?\" That infuriating possibility had already begun to dawn on Dieter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew from bitter experience that Flick Clairet was a master of deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad she fooled him again?
