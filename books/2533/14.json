The emotionally harrowing night was over, but then after such things always came a cold-light-of-day review. This morning, like no other in recent months, she was ready for the whole team. They were gonna squash the internal drama once and for all. She could feel a spirit of dissension wafting about the atmosphere around her like an unseen slurry of negativity that literally made the air thick. Damali patiently waited as Marlene sealed the room with prayer. Carlos went right for logistics, and she gave him a moment on the floor before jumping in. That allowed her a chance to watch body language, see how bad it was, where people\u0027s heads were at. Damali folded her arms, not liking what she saw at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Carlos said, clearly exhausted. \"The Covenant came in yesterday. Rabbi Zeitloff got \u0027em all situated at their safe house so they can summit. That gives us a day or two before we need to meet up and thoroughly debrief the clerics, and in my opinion, we need to get out of this hotel. I\u0027m feeling boxed in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali watched as no one agreed or disagreed. It was as though everyone\u0027s hackles were up for no reason at all. Carlos glanced at her, but pressed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, all right... Dan said we can pick up the keys any day - the place was for immediate availability and a full-cash-on-the-barrel-head wire transfer means we own the joint. We just gotta furnish it and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How we gonna furnish a joint that big that fast? Be serious. It\u0027ll be weeks, if not months before we can get settled,\" Berkfield complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos frowned. \"What are you talking about, man? We do like we always do. The Covenant seers have a blueprint from the images you all sent me. They go to their local donation warehouses and pull from that or dredge from estate sales that have been left in their charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly not understanding the bad vibe, Carlos looked around the team with his brows knit. \"What\u0027s new about this process? We wire transfer the money so they can refill their coffers and help folks that really need help. They bless every stick of furniture, linens, technology they\u0027ve purchased for us to spec, whatever comes through the door, so nothing slithers in there with it - and it comes to us by their vans to haul off and place, or we can do it the efficient way and let me drag it in by energy transport. Either way, it gets a white light blast and I\u0027ve got a visual on how you want the new joint set up, room by room. Isn\u0027t that why we did a full team walk-through?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, you better leave it to the vans to bring it, because right through here, man, you ain\u0027t looking like you can do all that,\" Mike said, folding his arms. \"Means me, Rider, and Shabazz will be muling furniture for about a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about a month, when the ladies keep changing their minds about where they want a damned couch set,\" Rider muttered, his gaze going out of the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold it!\" Damali was off the sofa and she immediately gave Carlos the eye to stand down as she walked into the center of the room. \"We sealed the room, which means that anything else that\u0027s in here with us that ain\u0027t right is blind and deaf to us.\" She allowed her gaze to land on each face for a moment. \"But I want you to all get real still and pray for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeace, clarity, and understanding ... and I\u0027ma watch the room. Tacticals - on the ready.\" Begrudging glances met hers, but as she drew her baby T is dagger and unsheathed it, slow awareness replaced the resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three minutes to breathe deeply and still yourselves,\" Damali murmured with her eyes closed but her second-sight wide open, scanning the room. \"Find that very mellow place within, the you that is a spirit of Light energy, positive, attract the good, compassionate, be willing to help, want the best for all, for the group, where laughter emanates, where love flourishes ... where you heal rifts and forgive and touch the Divine spark that creates all life and created you.\" She drew in a deep, steady, calm breath through her nose and released it through her mouth. \"Now each in your silent communion in your own way and in your own religion, bond with the One Above All and ask that the spirit of dissension be removed from your being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds Damali heard a high-pitched screech and her eyes snapped open. A greenish-yellow crablike creature the size of a football with small hooked claws, roachlike antennae, beady little red eyes, and jagged yellow teeth exited Rider\u0027s back. It scrabbled up his spine, ran through his hair like a giant louse, and jumped onto Tara, screeching, then leaped with flea-hopping buoyancy over to Berkfield and his wife. Guardians were hollering, chaos was rampant, Carlos had grabbed at the pest, knocking over furniture and leaving silver glare scorches everywhere. But the thing was too fast and once it got on someone, it hung on for dear life, every jagged hair and part of its crablike legs catching onto skin, fabric, and hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat, oily-bodied thing stank to high heaven, too, making it a revolting experience to have its touch make contact in any way. Its hooked claws were nearly impossi ble to dislodge once they grabbed on, and Juanita almost knocked herself out trying to run from it but colliding with a door frame. Krissy had gotten up on the dining room table and was doing a screaming wiggle dance as it found her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tacticals up!\" Damali shouted, jumping across furniture to get at the thing. \"Pen it in, blue charges!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMale Guardians were in the middle of the floor practically knocking themselves out trying to swing at the nasty little critter. Inez was doing a strip jig in the middle of the floor, screaming and thrashing wildly as it clung to her mi crobraids and then slid under her tank top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get it off me, get it off me!\" Inez shrieked hysterically. Damali turned just in time to see Jose draw and she roundhouse kicked the gun out of his hand. \"No convention als! You\u0027ll hit your own team and if you shoot it, the little sucker will divide. Everybody stop, let it crawl on you for a second, and we\u0027ll pen it in with blue charges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInez covered her face, her leg bouncing but trying to be still. \"Get it off me, y\u0027all - like right now,\" she whispered in a faraway voice that was reminiscent of a person quickly be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoming deranged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buzz her,\" Damali said, looking at the three closest Guardians near Inez - Dan, Shabazz, and J.L. \"Three united on three. One ... two ... now!\" The moment the tactical charge hit Inez, the defiant little creature bit Inez\u0027s thigh as it came out of her shorts, trying to burrow back under her skin and hold on like a tick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pray, girl!\" Damali said, her blade held tightly in her fist. \"I want all of the little bastard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInez was hiccup crying and it messed Mike up so bad he rushed over, but Damali held up her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mike, these little beasties are crabs in a barrel, hon. They move through a group real fast, mate, and multiply real fast, and I have to get the head out of her leg or the damned thing ain\u0027t dead. A new body will grow right out of her.\" Damali looked at Mike hard to get him to respond and spoke no nonsense in her tone. \"I don\u0027t wanna cut her leg - you\u0027ve gotta back up and trust me. Hold her hands and say psalm 91 with her or Something, but back up off me while I\u0027m working, hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, baby, give me your hands,\" Big Mike said, trying to c oax Inez\u0027s palms away from her face. \"No plague will come near my tent... a thousand will fall at my right side, ten thousand at my right hand, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Inez\u0027s mouth began to murmur with the same words Mike was saying, the creature pulled its head out of her thigh, threw its head back, and hissed. Damali got it in the forehead with the tip of her blade and then grabbed the smelly loose skin of its back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep the charge with me, fellas,\" Damali said as she sneered at the squirming creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hit me with some city-strength juice for this nasty bug, Carlos.\" Carlos squatted and looked at the demon, silver heat making its skin bubble and sizzle as it squealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the power of the Almighty, I banish the demon spirit of dissension from my team,\" Damali said, adding her charge to its body through her blade as it lost its grip on Inez\u0027s leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment it let go of Inez, Damali held it to the floor and Carlos put his Timberland on its back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crush it slowly,\" Damali said, pure fury in her eyes. \"I want a name of who sent this.\" Carlos began putting more pressure on the bug, making it twist and squeal louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody bring me some holy water,\" Damali mut tered, her gaze never wavering. \"It will talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene tossed a vial to Carlos and the moment he opened it the little beastie began to scream, \"Lorelei! Lorelei!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather and Jasmine covered their mouths and gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know her?\" Carlos asked, looking up with Damali. Heather nodded. \"She was second in command of the New Orleans covens ... after Gabrielle - but Gabrielle never approved her methods. There was a feud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She hid in Denver until we lost Gabrielle,\" Jasmine said her eyes frantic as she stared at Heather. \"She would do something like this, has the skill. Tries to seem like she doesn\u0027t and plays dumb, but is more vicious than she looks \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, ladies.\" Carlos nodded. \"I\u0027ma run this name by my boy, Yonnie, for more details. He needs to know what\u0027s operating in his territories, and definitely not get himself jacked in one of the brothels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Douse it.\" Damali rammed her blade all the way through the small creature\u0027s forehead and removed her hand quickly from its fat little body as Carlos doused the head and squashed the demon under his shoe. Green gook squirted out around its eight legs and anus, and then the whole body went pop. Smelly, sulfuric gook came out in a splat. The entire team made a face and muttered, \"Eeeiiw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, that was a brand-new pair of Tims, too!\" Carlos wiped his foot off on the carpet with a grimace at the stench. \"You know this is gonna be a helluva bill in here, between this and Mike\u0027s door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali held her hands out away from her body and headed toward the dining area sink, yelling over her shoul der to the group. \"Somebody open the windows!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit took a few minutes for the group to settle down, and everybody agreed without any dissension whatsoever that the meeting needed to resume in Shabazz and Marlene\u0027s room - any room but the one that had the dead demon stench. Carlos looked at Damali, and she looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanna school \u0027em, professor?\" Carlos said, still seeming pissed off about his ruined Tims. \"Or you want me to teach this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nan, I\u0027ll go,\" Damali said, hands on hips, but making a face at Carlos\u0027s boots. \"Baby, you gotta take that down the hall and put on some sneakers or something.\" Jose and Rider pounded fists while Tara and Juanita shielded their faces with their hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" Juanita gasped with tears in her eyes from the fumes. \"He\u0027s already tracked it onto the rugs - let\u0027s go to our room, and don\u0027t come in there \u0027til you change shoes, Carlos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos laughed. \"Meet y\u0027all back in five. I tell you, I ain\u0027t feeling no love. I help kill the bug and now it\u0027s, \u0027Oh, Carlos, could you wash your hands before you - \u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, stop givin\u0027 the group noses the blues,\" Damali said, laughing. \"Change your shoes. We\u0027re out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecarlos jogged down the hall, but wasn\u0027t offended. The Tims were going in the Dumpster; it smelled like he\u0027d stepped in a hot pile of fresh dog crap, and Juanita was right, the scent was following him everywhere as long as he had on those boots. But as he reentered the room, he watched the bug essence decompose in the sun. The claws and feet and mouth flared first, and then some of the green gook splattered. It burned the way vampire ash would. Much as he hated to, Carlos neared the bubbling ooze and sniffed, and then shut his eyes, grimacing. His old vampire capacity to know a blood tracer kicked in. Yeah, the damned thing had been feeding off Yonnie, then probably jumped to him, didn\u0027t get Damali because knowing his wife, she\u0027d said a prayer before she drifted off or while he was down in the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, backed away, staring at the mess on the floor and unlaced his shoes. Yeah, he needed to warn his boy. That shit he\u0027d picked up from Lorelei at a dark coven brothel was one helluva sexually transmitted demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"all right,\" Damali said, \"we just saw it with our own eyes, and how many times have we seen mess like this in one form or another?\" She waited, walking around the room with her hands on her hips. \"No shame in the game - we\u0027re human. We laugh, love, fight, argue, throw pity parties, whatever, ain\u0027t nobody in here perfect.\" She let her breath out hard. \"But that\u0027s why we have to have solidarity, one household, especially in the last days,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos nodded and sprawled out in his chair. \"D ain\u0027t lied. I go there, get down, start thinking about woulda coulda, shoulda - but like my wife said, all that does is leave you wide open for something to slither into your psyche that shouldn\u0027t be there... and it\u0027s easy to forget to give it a white light jolt of prayer to get it up outta you once you\u0027ve started to spiral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Word,\" Shabazz said, glancing at Carlos. \"And Jack Daniel\u0027s don\u0027t help.\" He leaned forward and pounded Car los\u0027s fist. \"Mighta come in through me, my head wasn\u0027t right.\" Marlene gave Shabazz a tender glance. \"It doesn\u0027t matter where it came in, baby. All that matters is that we got it out before it multiplied and hurt the team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, man - I\u0027m sorry I went there last night,\" Rider said, looking at Carlos. \"That\u0027s a whole scenario that pushes my buttons ... detonates \u0027em like nuclear warheads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel you,\" Carlos said, reaching over to pound Rider\u0027s fist across the coffee table. \"No harm no foul, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Damali said, letting her breath out in relief. \"Here\u0027s the thing we have to keep in front of us at all times. Family might get on our nerves, but they are not the enemy. That nasty bug we killed in there is. Stuff like that can have us at each other\u0027s throats. So, if we see a partner spiraling emo tionally, we have to support and spread the love - just like we would if somebody had a gunshot wound. I can\u0027t always do it ... shoot, I might be trippin\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat day myself, and have, upon occasion,\" she said with a slow smile, glad when everyone chuckled and began to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, y\u0027all, at this point we\u0027ve seen each other\u0027s dirty drawers. We\u0027ve been beat up, tore down, sick as dogs, mad as wet hens, done heard some stuff ... that uh, I know no body wants to speak on, riiight?\" Damali leaned over, bend ing at the hips to look at people, making a funny face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody laughed and waved her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh\" she said, bobbing her head and mocking the team but not excluding herself. \"Oh, baby - Arizona, was some tight quarters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girl, shut up,\" Inez said, falling over on the couch as several male Guardians hooted and slapped each other five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See...\" Damali said. \"After all of that, c\u0027mon, folks.\" she looked around, her smile going from ribald to gentle. \"I thought I would die when Carlos did,\" she said quietly. \"When Jose was so sick back in the old L.A. compound that he was in intensive care... Lord. Marlene and Shabazz,\" she said, tearing up, and then she put up her hand. \"No words.\" Damali drew in a shuddering breath as the team sobered and couples slowly slid closer and arms and hands threaded together. \"Yeah. Mike, how many times we sew your big, burly ass up, huh? That deck rail through the gut, though - I thought I was gonna lose you, man. If I did...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euh-uh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you too, baby-girl. \u0027Member them early days before you could take a nick, D?\" Big Mike looked at Rider, then Shabazz. \"We used to make bets while playing cards about who\u0027d put a nine to their skull first if you came home bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure did,\" Shabazz said, drawing Marlene closer. \"Was some tense times, but we made it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess I have lived long enough to see a few miracles,\" Rider said, glancing at Tara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been blessed, despite it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That night I got made - got brought to the team,\" Dan said, first looking at Carlos and then Damali. \"It was the most terrifying ordeal of my life, but also the most... I can\u0027t explain it. The whole thing was like walking through a doorway in the universe. I felt my old life and reality leave my body, and when Mike and Damali pulled me out of that car, alive, unnicked, when vamps had ripped the freakin\u0027 roof off... then we survived a firefight - I knew. I knew I was blessed, put here for something, some reason.\" Murmurs of agreement coated the room with warmth and love and bonding as each team member recalled their defining moment and who had helped them through it, who made a difference. Berkfield openly wept when he detailed for the group for the first time how he was abducted from his previ ously serene, staid suburban life into the clutches of a master vampire, and held captive like a POW in a coffin on a yacht. Emotional scars bled but also healed. Everyone listened everyone shared one small piece of their soul, and respect for each man and woman\u0027s journey was reestablished in full\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some healing ... angel,\" Carlos finally said, pulling Damali against him. \"I think we all needed that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes we have to look back just to see how far we\u0027ve come,\" Damali said quietly, kissing him gently and then looking at the group. \"I might have wings,\" she said with a self-deprecating chuckle. \"But I\u0027ve got a potty mouth, and ain\u0027t been no angel. She closed her eyes and laughed at herself. \"Oh, the many offenses I\u0027ll have to answer for on judgment day ... the many asses I\u0027ve kicked, whooo ha.\" Carlos laughed with her and the team. \"Me, sheeeit. I\u0027m jus\u0027 looking for a plea bargain. I know I\u0027ve gotta fall on my sword for my shit.\" The group erupted into rowdy cheers and high fives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s why, after they sent that nasty spell shit in here, I wanted to do this,\" Damali said. \"Get us back to center. They can\u0027t break us - right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mighta messed our heads up for a minute,\" Carlos said. \"Like Damali was saying, we\u0027re human. But we\u0027re family. We\u0027re one team, one love, we\u0027re strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she said, hopping up to pace. \"We\u0027re blessed. Don\u0027t ever forget that. How many times has this team cheated death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many,\" the team shouted in one voice that rang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many times we been to Hell and back, y\u0027all?\" Car los said, standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many purges have we done - nicks healed and sealed?\" Damali said with a wide grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many places we lived, roads we\u0027ve traveled, shit we overcame at the eleventh hour?\" Carlos folded his arms over his chest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali and Carlos looked at each other, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the next time a brother or sister Guardian gets on your nerves, you\u0027re gonna remember the many times they might not have been here - \u0027cause if it wasn\u0027t for Heavenly Grace, they ain\u0027t have to be,\" Damali said, her gaze roving the group. \"You\u0027re gonna imagine what life on this team could be like if their aggravating ass wasn\u0027t here. You\u0027re gonna do a self-check, put your bullshit on hold, and step back and get perspective, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epray that demon up outta you before it affects the team, your partner, or you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, baby!\" Marlene shouted, waving her hand from where she sat. \"Tell it like we used to do! That\u0027s right! We\u0027ve gone too far to turn back now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our jobs may be hard, not like the average person has -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but we\u0027ve been blessed beyond measure along with that, too... what\u0027d they tell me, when they snatched me up and out of the pit? To whom much is given, much is expected - I got a lot of shit in the transaction, so a brutha gotta work... that\u0027s how I see it.\" Carlos shrugged and opened his arms. \"Ain\u0027t no use in whining. Ya saw what happened to me when I wasn\u0027t grateful. Do as you like, but I\u0027ma tell ya, you don\u0027t wanna go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the stone, cold truth,\" Shabazz said, glancing at Rider. Rider slapped Shabazz five. \"My bad. My serious bad, brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Hey,\" J.L. said, looking around the room. \"Many are called, few are chosen, and even fewer step up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, lie - might be your choice, but that\u0027s a bad move,\" Jose said, shaking his head. \"Real bad move not to heed the call from up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow we gonna complain about anything, even this insane job description, when we\u0027ve got an embarrassment of riches?\" Berkfield asked, glancing around the group. Marjorie\u0027s head bobbed up and down. \"There are people who never did anything wrong, per se, who haven\u0027t been blessed with good health, or can\u0027t find that special someone to love... or are destitute due to no real fault of then-own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or are living hi war-torn lands in refugee camps,\" Jasmine said sadly. \"If they live long enough to make it there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or have family so crazy and mean-spirited,\" Heather said quietly, \"they never knew this... this oasis of love from people that they weren\u0027t even blood-related to.\" She glanced around the team and then at Dan. \"I d\u0027not know I was already fighting demons, didn\u0027t understand they were inside people, I mean really inside them. But I would have still signed up for this tour of duty to get you all as my gift.\" Dan pulled Heather into a hug. \"When I think of how it could be, I\u0027d take this any day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you,\" Inez said quietly and then looked at Mike. \"This is it, for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too,\" Tara agreed in a near whisper, her gentle gaze going to Rider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s easy, especially when things get tough,\" Bobby said, looking around the team, \"to start bitching and moaning about what isn\u0027t right, instead of looking at all the things that are. Guess we\u0027re all guilty of it... and having a demon jumping around the family like head lice definitely doesn\u0027t help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why you gotta guard your head,\" Carlos said, looking at everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I finally get it, what you always meant when you\u0027d tell us that, Carlos,\" Krissy said, looking at him straight in the eyes. \"During early training, I didn\u0027t get it. Not until I saw it today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better late than never, girlfriend. Ask me how I know -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and I\u0027ll definitely tell you all about it. Had me acting real crazy, I won\u0027t lie,\" Juanita said, her gaze catching Krissy\u0027s and opening to a new bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw\u0027ight, then,\" Carlos said, nodding as he scanned the group. \"You\u0027re gonna realize that if you can do Hell, loading furniture into a new house ain\u0027t shit,\" Carlos said, new energy making his fingertips tingle. \"You\u0027re gonna say, Thank you, God, that I have a house,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027cause some folks are homeless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, you ain\u0027t said a mumblin\u0027 word, brother,\" Mike said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Carlos said, patting down his body theatrically. \"You gonna say, Thank you, \u0027cause not only am I healthy, alive, able-bodied, and whole, but even got a few extra gifts that the average bear didn\u0027t get\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw\u0027 right, brother, preach,\" Shabazz said with a wide smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" Damali said, nodding as she walked. \"You\u0027re gonna say, Thank you, because not only do I have a really gorgeous roof under which to lay my head, and my health and strength and gifts ... but I got me a family, yo . . . a lover and spouse and Me partner and best friend all rolled into one, somebody who is my soul mate to go with me into any battle, got my back, watches my six, is my confidant, helps make this raggedyassed world whole\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;so when I go out there to do my danged job, and I come back all beat down and twisted around, I gots me a place of peace to lay my weary burden down. That\u0027s when you really say, Thank you, good God!\" Damali shouted, pointing up at the ceiling with her eyes closed. \" That\u0027s who\u0027s my daddy! Don\u0027t get it twisted. No disrespect -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust be clear\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that\u0027s where everything we got comes from!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lay it down, D!\" Jose hollered. \"That\u0027s concert track, sis! Get me some paper, somebody! She done crossed over to hip-hop gospel on us!\" Guardians were on their feet cheering and hollering. Hotel management was knocking on the suite door again, but who cared? They were out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen the team move that fast, in such lock-step coordination when we weren\u0027t in a firefight,\" Carlos said with a smile as he set the long, butter-toffee-hued, leather sectional sofa down hard on the Persian rug in the living room part of their bedroom suite, positioning it to face the flat-screen, wall-mounted HDTV and Bose stereo system. \"Where you want the bed?\" he asked, slightly winded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s \u0027cause you took \u0027em to church,\" she said with a smile, beginning to unpack suitcases. \"Ummm ... under the skylight,\" she said offhandedly. Carlos stared at the solid oak, king-sized, four-poster bed, and then glanced at Damali.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Two minutes, look at the room, get a good look and be sure, boo. For real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over there\u0027s cool,\" she said, not looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you said about the sofa, until you decided the feng shui alignment to the door was off. C\u0027mon, D. Help a brother out - I\u0027ve been moving stuff all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay, I\u0027m sorry.\" She looked around. \"I\u0027m sure. Under the skylight - but, oh, yeah, the cedar chest and armoire have to fit without blocking the energy vibe from the windows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos stopped struggling with the furniture for a moment and stood up, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his forearm. He was gonna remember today\u0027s sermon on being thankful. \"Energy vibe from the windows ... the wife wants the room politically, energy correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali chuckled. \"Of all things in the room, you want that piece of furniture placed well.... Hmmmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m remembering better now why it\u0027s important not to have a spirit of resistance.\" She laughed. \"I\u0027m sorry the pieces they sent from estates are so heavy. The good stuff always is.\" She looked at him, concerned. \"Can I help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m good. Inspired by the pep talk,\" he said, putting his shoulder against a post with a grunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You pulled the team together,\" she said, leaning on the long oak dresser behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the one who took the team to church, not me. That was really inspiring to watch, all joking around aside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw, D. You took \u0027em there. I just opened the door. Got a part of the conversation started. You were officiating.\" He stood and stretched his back once he got the bed in the exact position under the skylight, then looked up. \"I gotta double seal that breach point, girl,\" he said, muttering to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If something crashes through that glass while I\u0027m with you under the stars...man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped sorting clothes and looked at him. \"We were officiating ... as one, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The team meeting,\" she said. \"We rallied everybody together, me and you, for the first time, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped pacing the perimeter of the bed, trying to figure out how to securely reinforce the room and gave her his full attention. \"Feels kinda weird, doesn\u0027t it?\" She nodded. \"I\u0027m sorta used to Marlene and Shabazz always pulling the team together when we get attitudes or splinter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bound to happen sooner or later... you know, getting the baton passed. They told us, as Neterus, we\u0027d be heads of household, but I never really felt like I was until today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you mean,\" she said softly. \"It\u0027s kinda scary, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lotta responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think having kids feels like this?\" she asked, searching his face. Carlos rubbed the back of his neck. \"Yeah ... I guess. Never really put all that together, you know?\" He looked at the bedroom door. \"Dan must be wigging right now. Settling into a house, wife possibly pregnant... a lot to think about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Damali said, and then began sorting clothes again. She blew a stray lock up off her damp forehead. \"Soon as we get the bedrooms in shape, one more meeting about the concert basics, then maybe we should just let people fall back... chill, bring in some grub. It\u0027s been a lot to absorb. Inez got the kitchen done with Marlene, then Mar broke off that detail to work with \u0027Bazz, Heather, and Dan on tactical sensors, double prayer barriers, and the works. J.L. and Krissy have the tech centers pretty much up and running for a second level of security. Mike is on weapons with Berkfield, getting our war room righteous. Jose\u0027s work ing on the studio with Rider. Tara\u0027s good to go with Marj on the family room, living room, dining rooms; they got some cool stuff to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damali,\" Carlos said, drawing her attention with the gentle tone of his voice. \"We\u0027re gonna have to blow the groove sooner or later and tell \u0027em about the fawn.\" Damali briefly closed her eyes. \"When we have breakfast with the Covenant tomorrow morning, okay?\" The plea in her voice made him come over to hug her. \"Carlos, just one night in our new home, family all tucked in safe around us, breaking bread, laughing, making love, whatever, just peace, be still, man ... before we have to go back out to war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We gotta count our blessings, even if they do weigh a ton.\" He kissed her forehead and tried to get her to joke about the weight of things every woman had selected for the house, but she only gave him a sad smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali looked around their partially furnished bedroom suite, forlorn. \"I am truly thankful for everything, but I\u0027m also being real about what\u0027s ahead. I know we\u0027re gonna have to go to our councils on this. I may have to revive my oracle, even though she\u0027s not fully healed.... The Covenant will be in it, because it involved Nod banishment edicts, we\u0027ve gotta track down this Lorelei heifer... I feel like I should be saying, \u0027Hi, new house. Bye, new house,\u0027 because we\u0027re maybe gonna get a shower, change clothes, pick up weapons, and be out again - and I\u0027m praying to God this time when we come home, the house is standing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With no demon habitation.\" Carlos kissed the top of Damali\u0027s head. \"No argument.\" He pulled back and looked at her and smiled, pushing her locks over her shoulders. He dropped his voice and gave her a mock-serious expression that made her laugh. \"Hannibal would tell me, \u0027Brother, sometimes you must water your horses.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she said, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes,\" he said, kissing her nose, \"you have to let your warhorses rest. You have to stop, give them water, c hill heal, replenish. Even vamps regenerate. Then live to fight another night.\" He kissed her again. \"But you can run me into the ground, until I get this bedroom exactly the way you want it ... then you\u0027ve gotta water me, baby. Oh, yeah, I\u0027ll be your warhorse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged him hard and closed her eyes as she pressed her cheek against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"when did you do all this, \u0027Nez?\" Marlene asked in awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girl!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to have the first real sit-down meal when everybody was up in here be real down home, since who knows when we might have to hit the road again,\" Inez said, beaming as she brought another huge dish to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes every piece of furniture I moved,\" Mike said, closing his eyes and shaking his head, \"every time I had ta move it again,\" he added, making the group laugh, \"whooooo, worth it all, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInez hugged him from behind and whispered in his ear. \"Made you a peach cobbler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s talking dirty to me at the family table, about peach cobblers and such. Woman, stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey laughed, they ate, they communed. They said thank you a hundred times, blessed every corner of the huge house and every plate that got passed. They gave themselves the right to be human and partake in butter-dripping macaroni and cheese, greens, cornbread, corn on the cob, snap beans, limas and rice, fall-off-the-bone baked chicken, pan gravy, and Inez\u0027s audacious desserts. Those in the group who had sworn off meat and dairy were spoiled just as well by her vegetable lasagna, baby asparagus so sweet it would make you cry, and her tofu garlic teriyaki stir-fry, and dips, chips and fruit plates dripping with natural fructose nectars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInez put down love hard in the kitchen, the way Marlene put down her prayers... and J.L. put down security with authority, no less than Carlos and Shabazz put down weapons check, and went over security again. This was home; every. one contributed their best, their all, and invested heavily, mightily with their hopes. Damali looked across the table at Carlos, so glad he\u0027d agreed to hold the news about the fawn. They all needed one night to say thank you privately, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsently munching and just feeling the mellowness of the vibe that surrounded her, Damali picked up on a strand of conversation that she really hadn\u0027t been listening to. What was being said wasn\u0027t all that important, what was being felt at the moment between everyone was paramount. If things could just stay this way ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know,\" Dan said. \"International travel right now sucks for getting the band through all the security measures - even with our special connections. Like, they\u0027ve even gone so far as to ban books on flights at Heathrow, and we\u0027d been negotiating to do London as a major stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we\u0027re going about this all wrong,\" Carlos finally said, leaning back in his chair with a stretch. \"We wanted to do concerts in the twelve hot zones so our people could pick up our tracers, right?\" He waited until everyone nodded. \"But we\u0027ve got typhoons sweeping China, and we did Tibet already. Teams there know us. We\u0027ve done Sydney under deep cover circumstances, but we hit \u0027em hard there, so our ground forces are strong all the way to Melbourne. We got South America covered - got back in Brazil, even though we lost a squad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos fell silent for a moment, and leaned forward. \"It\u0027s gonna be hard to go into India, with the bombings picking up, just like we can probably get into Japan easier than North Korea right now, due to the nuclear standoff drama there. From Japan, though, we can go down through Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, but just like India and Pakistan, the political tensions are making it hard to move or gather people there...don\u0027t want to put innocents at risk for a Bali event happen at a concert.\" Damali watched her husband\u0027s logic hold the group in thrall and just the sound of his voice as he dissected the problem calmly, resolutely, without tension, just stating the facts, talking with his hands as though envisioning it in his mind in the air, then moving dishes around on the table so could see it in their minds, too, was melting her where she sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been to the Motherland,\" Carlos said, glancing at each face on the team, \"but Africa is so huge that we need to break it into like three or four zones to get the word out, and the Sudan is crazy-hot right now. The Canadian-Greenland and Mexican teams, as well as the Central American and Caribbean Guardians know us from Morales. We just came out of the South Pacific, while we were in Tahiti, and our U.S. teams all the way up through Alaska got us on lock from all the cross-country battling over the years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, where\u0027s that leave us?\" Shabazz asked, rubbing his belly and leaning back in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tokyo, Moscow, Delhi, London, Rome\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;just because of the Vatican, for a nice worldwide spread . . . Ireland for the standing-stones community,\" he added, looking at Heather, \"Gambia . . . But I see nobody mentioned the obvious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where, Antarctica?\" Rider said with a wide grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he got jokes,\" Mike said, laughing and unbuckling a notch on his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Dan said, running his fingers through his hair. \"You know that\u0027s why the Covenant is meeting. The Middle East is hot, we know the deal with Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the region ... so many troops from so many nations, pulling our Guardians to our signature there will be asking for a tragedy. One false move by any side of the equation and it\u0027ll pop off another whole wave of insanity. But now, with Israel and Hezbollah squaring off, trading missiles over Lebanon, Beirut, getting close to Tel Aviv . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. one hit to the three main religions\u0027 complex in Jerusalem, and it\u0027s on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Carlos said. \"That\u0027s why, after thinking about this hard and long, I\u0027m suggesting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea more conservative ap proach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMouths dropped open at the table and didn\u0027t close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious,\" Carlos said, glancing at everyone\u0027s expres sion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know,\" Mike said, leaning forward and glancing at Shabazz, then Inez. \"Baby, you ain\u0027t root the man, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw, that would have to be Damali,\" Inez said. \"Carlos, you feel all right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConservative?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You?\" Marlene said, fanning her face. \"Oh, now I know it\u0027s the end of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, y\u0027all, I\u0027m not that bad,\" Carlos said, laughing, but he glanced at Damali for support. He smiled wider when she could only shrug on his behalf. \"Okay, maybe conserva tive is the wrong word. Maybe I should have said smarter... hit \u0027em how they don\u0027t expect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, now that\u0027s my husband,\" Damali said, leaning forward with her elbows on the table and making the group laugh. \"Semantics. Let\u0027s go before he starts talking in Dananu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m crushed, girl,\" Carlos said, flinging a balled-up nap kin at her, that she caught. \"But we did this before in Sydney, sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali closed her eyes and laughed. \"And the man said conservative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I state my case, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" Damali said, waving her hand. \"At least this time we get to hear it before you make it up as we go along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos laughed. \"Yeah, well, I\u0027m mentally designing this on the fly, so think about it. J.L., I need your technology ex pertise on this.\" He looked around and J.L. leaned forward and nodded. \"Cool. I\u0027m thinking, since you know who owns the airwaves, and we have solid Guardian signature patterns in several locations already, we simulcast the concert, live, just like they do the international New Year\u0027s Eve count downs, into zones too hot to get our team in and out of quickly. This means teams don\u0027t have to necessarily gather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be honest,\" Dan said, \"I really wasn\u0027t feeling drag ging the team in and out of all these airports ... uh, right now, with things being as hot as they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We feel you, man,\" Shabazz said. \"We know the deal. But we\u0027ve still gotta work - just find a way to work smarter, not harder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where I\u0027m going,\" Carlos said, nodding to ac knowledge Dan\u0027s concern. \"We\u0027ve gotta use the technology like they do. Shabazz said it - work smarter. So, we get un\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ederground units of Guardians that we already know to send clips from the concert to each other on the Internet, bounce \u0027em through the Covenant, who can flip \u0027em to teams we haven\u0027t yet met. When they make the clips, they can edit the tactical energy wave pattern for me and Damali right into the clip like a subliminal message or code encased in mental silver - white light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s smooth, man,\" J.L. said, rubbing his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way our own can know what to hone in on.\" Carlos stopped for a moment and looked out toward the beach. \"Yeah, by doing it over the Net, we have a way to secure the data bursts with some type of prayer encryption code or password - so when the darkside hacks it to try to see what this special flurry of messages are that\u0027re spiking on the In ternet, it fries their brains, their tubes, their sight. It oughta backward protect the sender and receiver\u0027s machines, too, if they\u0027re our people - so if the wrong side gets it, bam... smoking black hole. They don\u0027t even know where it came from, no trace. In and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout, smooth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is nasty, man,\" J.L. said, reaching around several Guardians to slap Carlos five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like our teams caught be hind firefights in Lebanon, Tel Aviv, Beirut, Iraq, we could ask Rabbi, Imam, and Father Pat to give us some strong prayer ammo, word phrases, specific passages in the old texts that if the wrong side opens it - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Carlos murmured. \"Like a silver shot virus that keeps imploding throughout their network, and the only way to get at it is to shut down cells, cut it off, black out a part of their network before they can bring it back up again. We\u0027ve been going about this the conventional way. High body count on our side. We saw what one backfired spell did - -shut \u0027em down for twenty-four hours. We\u0027ve got to fight nasty, like them. Send them some bugs they can\u0027t shake in their house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali watched him take a slow swig of sweet tea and set the glass down with precision, and run his fingers down the glass\u0027s condensation absently as he spoke. Watching the general work, his mind on fire, was the sexiest shit...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me and \u0027Mali are always bait, this protects the team, second line of defense. Guardians need to be homing to us, not the team, especially in a firefight. Trapped teams in Malaysia, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, anywhere it\u0027s hot, they get Internet transmission from their nearest Covenant con nection, from downloads doctored by teams in strong loca tions that know how to capture our patterns through their tactical units.\" Carlos glanced around the team. \"Now, this way, when we do hit London, Rome, Tokyo, Moscow, et cetera, which we will, our teams will feel the energy signa ture the moment we hit their soil. Right now, the only ones that feel us like that are the wrong side - which is crazy. Our people gotta know, and not just by calls from the Covenant, when we\u0027re in their zone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Carlos, doing such a big concert, even if it\u0027s here in the U.S. and broadcasting around the world... won\u0027t that let them know who we are?\" Marjorie glanced around the table nervously. \"I\u0027m not trying to be negative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, and you\u0027re not being negative, Marj. Your point is valid. Here\u0027s the thing,\" Carlos said, talking with his hands. \"People, the darkside already knows who we are, so it\u0027s not like we\u0027re blowing our cover, they just can\u0027t pinpoint us at any given time. Our Guardian teams are in places we can\u0027t reach all over the world, and they aren\u0027t all sure who we are - bad position to be in. Once we do the concert, they\u0027ll know. They\u0027ll be able to feel our exact-match energy signature in a territory the way vamps know when one of theirs has left or entered a zone, or a zone has been breached.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you did learn something valuable while taking a walk on the wild side,\" Rider said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos play-boxed him across the table. \"Use every gift you\u0027ve got, brother.\" He dropped back to his seat, smiling. \"While we do the concert, just like any other firefight, we\u0027re open for a minimal time of exposure. However, the darkside will watch us ... they\u0027ll be curious, trying to see what our angle is. They\u0027ll be baited in, wondering, and then all of a sudden all these blogs and video packages, podcasts, and e-mails will start flying. Our inside man, Yonnie, can help with the hype, tellin\u0027 them he got word from me that we\u0027d be passing secret messages. That way I know they\u0027ll open up anything about us with an encryption seal on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or, we could tell them that he compromised me,\" Tara said, staring at Rider. \"To make it more credible.\" She reached for his hand and held it under the table as he conceded with a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enod. \"And we should let them open one or two of the first ones to draw them in to download it deep into their network... and let it be something they can\u0027t figure out readily, referencing the Holy Land or Nod to keep them hungry for more.\" Tara glanced around the table. \"I do remember how they think,\" she added quietly. \"Carlos is dead on. Let them put their best vampire and demon minds on it, and then when they open subsequent packages, they fry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girl...\" Juanita said, as Krissy tipped her glass of sweet tea against hers. \"Remind me to stay on your good side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Heather said, clearly impressed. \"Good lookin\u0027 out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like Tara said,\" Carlos pressed on, making his point with conviction. \"We don\u0027t have to find them, they\u0027ll find us. They\u0027ll grab everything that\u0027s gift wrapped, try to decode it to see what hidden subtext in the lyrics or battle logistics we might have been communicating, and ka-boom. Meanwhile, we\u0027re back home, chillin\u0027.\" He looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minimal team risk, maximum exposure. Dan can set us up to play L.A. with no stress instead of beating his head against a brick wall with uncooperative venues, and we could drive up, wouldn\u0027t even have to take a flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos opened his arms. \"Sometimes the universe is trying to put stumbling blocks in your way to make you change direction. Normally, we just grind through it, too damned stubborn to yield, back up, and punt. Gotta change that dynamic. New situations are happening, and we have to make course adjustments.\" He glanced at Heather. \"Might have to change the way we do business all the way around - our team is young. Got a lot at stake here. I heard everybody loud and clear.\" He briefly glanced at Damali and held her gaze for a moment. \"I\u0027m right there with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s deep,\" Shabazz said quietly. \"Damn, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to evolve this operation,\" Carlos said, leaning forward. \"We got teams trying to hold it down, so they need to be able to reach out to us and call us in as their Green Berets, ya know? Like, the way that thing went down ,in Morales, still ain\u0027t sitting right with me, man ... they came and helped us, and we lost a lot of good men and women. From this point forward, after the concert to get a beacon on the horizon, they should be calling us to say, \u0027Yo, we need backup.\u0027 Then as the hard-hitting Neteru squad, we go get our people some relief. In and out. Can\u0027t lose a whole team again like we lost Brazil.\" Carlos sat back in his chair hard and rubbed the tension out of his neck and then looked at Damali. \"I don\u0027t know - that\u0027s my two cents. It was off the cuff, on the fly. D ... what\u0027s your take? How you think we should play this? Concerts are your specialty; I\u0027m just mapping it out based on old power paradigms I knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took her a moment to make her vocal cords work so she could answer, and a few seconds more to keep from sliding out her seat. He\u0027d blown her mind with an ingenious plan, one that had the best odds of keeping the family safe, and he had yielded the floor, no macho bravado... and had moved furniture all day, too, and was sitting there actually waiting for her plan or endorsement, not just saying that... she could feel the strain in his voice when he\u0027d said it. He wanted her opinion, her view mattered. Talk about evolution -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher mind was singed at the edges from the straight silver charge he\u0027d shot into it. Her throat was dry, her mouth had gone dry, but she had to sit very still and keep her knees together because all the moisture from those sources had collected at the other end of her continuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t believe the words that were forming in her head. Her, a Leo - a Neteru, a Queen. Her breath came out in a rush, coating her reply. It wasn\u0027t supposed to, after all, she was co-leader, co-general, partner, but... dang! Could dinner just be over now, and dishes wait \u0027til the morning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything he said works for me,\" she said quietly, then stood up and walked into the kitchen with both of their plates. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cursed-vampire-huntress-legend-9/page-14.html","bookId":2533,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:45:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:45:40 PM"}
