He\u0027d wanted to be on the medical deck when Dr. Halsey had finished with Linda, be there when she woke up . . . or be there in case she never woke up. But he had to be here; this was his idea, and he was the closest thing they had to an expert on this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Systems check,\" Admiral Whitcomb ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson leaned over the ops console and flicked through several screens. \"Residual radiation fading,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navigation systems and scanners coming back online.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred stood at the Engineering station and reported, \"Reactors at sixty percent.

It might be a side effect of the artifact\u0027s radiation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One shot. . . \" the Admiral muttered. He tugged on the end of his mustache and sighed. \"Then we\u0027ll just have to make it count.\" He turned to the Master Chief. \"Lead the way, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief stared at the three large monitors that had replaced the bridge\u0027s observation windows. Eridanus blazed in the center of one display; stars shone with a steady brilliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move us one-point-five astronomical units relative to the sun,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe said. \"Heading zero-nine-zero by zero-four-five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Destination one-point-five AU,\" Haverson said. \"Heading confirmed. Coming about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plot an elliptical course parallel to the plane of the asteroid belt,\" the Master Chief added. \"Cortana, scan for asteroids approximately two kilometers in diameter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scanning,\" she said. \"This might take some time. There are more than a billion moving objects, some of them in deep shadow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me again about your old mission,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"You and the other Spartans were here before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" the Chief replied. \"Myself, Fred, Linda, Kelly, and Sam. It was the Spartans\u0027 first real mission: an infiltration into a rebel base. We captured their leader and got him to ONI for debriefing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t even know the Spartans were around in 2525,\" Lieutenant Haverson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" Fred answered. \"We just didn\u0027t have MJOLNIR armor or the advanced weaponry we have today. We looked like any other NavSpecWar team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I very much doubt that,\" Haverson said under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral raised one bushy eyebrow. \"You mean five peo- ple made a zero-gee vacuum infiltration onto this space station?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then exfiltrated with a prisoner who happened to be the guy in charge of the place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. That was the basic plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it went off without a hitch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief was silent for a moment as he remembered the dozens of dead people they had left behind on that base ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand he felt a pang of regret. At the time he hadn\u0027t thought twice about removing any obstacle that would have compromised his mission, human or otherwise. Now, after fighting for humanity for two decades, he wondered if he could shoot another human without a good reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" the Master Chief finally replied. \"There were enemy casualties. And we had to blow their cargo bay to escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" the Admiral said, tapping his fingers on the arm of the Captain\u0027s chair, \"they\u0027re not going to be happy to see a UNSC ship knocking on their front door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t expect so, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faint emissions on the D-band detected,\" Cortana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come about to new heading three-three-zero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Haverson said. \"Three-three-zero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone, now,\" she said, \"but I definitely heard something\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep on this course,\" Admiral Whitcomb ordered. \"We\u0027ll run it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s one thing I don\u0027t understand,\" Haverson said as he squinted at the forward displays. \"Why are these people even here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pirates and insurgents,\" the Admiral answered. \"They hijack UNSC ships, sell arms, and trade black market commodities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re probably too young to remember, Lieutenant, but before the Covenant War not everyone wanted to be part of an Earth-ruled government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rebels?\" Haverson said. \"I\u0027ve read about them. But why continue to stay separated from UNSC forces when the Covenant War started? Surely their chances of survival would be better with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral snorted a derisive laugh. \"Some people didn\u0027t want to fight, son. Some just wanted to hide. . . in this case, literally under a rock. Maybe they think the Covenant won\u0027t bother with \u0027em.\" A smile flickered across his face. \"Well, we\u0027re about to change all that for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator doors parted, and Dr. Halsey stepped onto the bridge. She removed her glasses and rubbed her eyes. She looked to the Master Chief as if she had just retimed from an in- tense fight—fatigued and shocked. He noticed a single drop of blood on the lapel of her wrinkled white lab coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine,\" Dr. Halsey whispered. \"Linda will make it. The flash-cloned organs took.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief exhaled the breath he had been uncon- sciously holding. He glanced over to Fred, who nodded to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded back. There were no words to express how he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his closest teammates, his friend, someone he had thought dead... was alive again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Doctor Halsey,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved her hand dismissively, and there was a strange look in her eyes—almost as if she had regretted the success of her operation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn good news,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"We could use another hand on deck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly,\" Dr. Halsey replied, suddenly looking much more alert. \"She\u0027ll need at least a week to recover—even with the bio-foam and steroid accelerants I have her on. Then she\u0027ll barely be able to get on her feet. She won\u0027t be combat-ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGettysburg-Ascendant Justice moved into the plane of the asteroid belt, and three rocks appeared on the screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This region is the source of the D-band signal,\" Cortana told them. \"There are three possible candidates based on the size parameters you gave me, Chief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one is it?\" the Admiral asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only one is rotating fast enough to generate a three-quarter-gravity internal environment,\" Cortana replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" the Master Chief replied and nodded toward the central display. The rock hadn\u0027t changed much in the last twenty years. Was it possible the place had been abandoned? The D-band transmission that Cortana detected could have been an automated signal, weak from years of drain on a single battery . . . or the lure for a trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admiral?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Chief,\" he said. \"They\u0027ve baited the hook and we\u0027re taking it. .. at least that\u0027s what it\u0027s supposed to look like.\" He chuckled. \"Cortana, power up every turret on our Covenant flagship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer holographic body flushed blue-green and she crossed her arms. \"Let me remind you, sir, that of the three working turrets, two are offline. I have no way to aim the plasma. The magnetic—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Cortana. But they\"—the Admiral stabbed a finger at the displays—\"don\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" she said. \"Heating them up now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Power dropping,\" Fred warned the Admiral as he peered at the Engineering screens. \"Down to forty-four percent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant Haverson,\" the Admiral barked, \"open a channel on the D-band. It\u0027s time we introduced ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, sir. Frequency matched and channel open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral stood. \"This is the UNSC frigate Gettysburg\" he barked, his voice full of authority and colored with his Texas accent. \"Respond.\" And then he reluctantly added, \"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic filled the COM. The Admiral waited patiently for ten seconds, and then his boot started to tap on the deck. \"No need to play possum, boys. We\u0027re not here for a fight. We want to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a sudden throat-slitting motion toward Haverson, and the Lieutenant snapped off the COM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny doors appeared in the two-kilometer-wide rock; from this distance they looked no larger than the pores on an orange. A fleet of ships launched, using the asteroid\u0027s rotational motion to give their velocities a boost. There were approximately fifty craft: Pelicans modified with extra armor and chainguns mounted on their hulls; sleek civilian pleasure craft carrying missiles as large as themselves; single-man engineering pods that sputtered with arc cutters; and one ship that was fifty meters long with oddly angled black stealth surfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a Chiroptera-class vessel,\" Haverson said, awed. \"It\u0027s an antique. ONI decommissioned them all forty years ago and sold them for scrap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it a threat?\" the Admiral asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Haverson\u0027s forehead wrinkled as he considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. They were decommissioned because they broke down every other mission. They had far too many sensitive components without a central controlling AI. The only reason I recall them at all is that they had the smallest operational Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine ever produced. No weapons systems, sir. Like I said, it\u0027s not a threat... it\u0027s a museum piece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it has Slipspace capability?\" Dr. Halsey asked. \"Maybe we can use it to get to Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unlikely,\" Haverson replied. \"All Chiroptera-class vessels were decommissioned by ONI—critical components removed and the ships\u0027 operating systems locked down so tight I doubt even Cortana could reactivate them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t bet on it,\" Cortana muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No weapons,\" the Admiral said and stared at the blocky geometry of the black ship. \"That\u0027s all I need to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their \u0027fleet,\u0027 \" Fred interjected, \"is deploying and taking up positions around us in a wide arc. Classic formation. They\u0027ll flank us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no real threat from these ships,\" the Admiral said to himself. \"They have to know we know that. So why bother with this show?\" He scowled at the displays, and his eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cortana, scan the nearby rocks for radioactive emissions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Receiving video feed,\" Fred announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image of a man flickered on forward screen three. He was clearly a civilian, with long black hair drawn back into a ponytail and a pointed beard extending a full ten centimeters from his chin. He smiled and made an elegant bow. The Chief, for some reason he could not understand, took an instant dislike to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain...,\" the man said in a smooth, resonant tenor voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Governor Jacob Jiles, leader of this port. What can we do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First,\" Admiral Whitcomb said, \"I am not a Captain; I am a Vice Admiral, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. Second, you will order your fleet to reverse course and get out of my gun-sights before I forget my manners. And third, we insist that you make ready to let us dock on that rock of yours for emergency repairs and refit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJiles considered these requests and then threw his head back and laughed. \"Admiral, my sincere apologies for the confusion in your rank.\" He said this with a mocking grin. \"As for your other requests, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t accommodate you today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I respectfully suggest you reconsider, Mister Jiles,\" the Admiral said in a deadpan tone. \"It would be unfortunate for all of us if I have to insist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in no position to insist on anything.\" Jiles nodded to someone offscreen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emissions detected!\" Cortana said. \"Neutron radiation spikes at seven by three o\u0027clock. One by three o\u0027clock. Picking up five more. They\u0027ve got nukes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hidden in the asteroid field,\" Admiral Whitcomb muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good. At least we\u0027re not dealing with fools.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed. We are not fools,\" Jiles replied. \"We have survived the long arm of Imperial Earth and Covenant intrusions.\" Some- one off camera handed Jiles a data pad with a radar silhouette of Gettysburg-Ascendant Justice; numbers and symbols crawled alongside the picture. He hesitated and crinkled his nose, ap- pearing confused at the odd configuration of mated craft. \"We are also not foolish enough to use overwhelming force when it isn\u0027t required. Your \u0027ship\u0027 is ready to fall apart on its own. I hardly think we need to waste one of our precious and expensive nuclear devices to stop you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitcomb set his hands on his hips. \"You need to rethink the tactical situation, Governor,\" he growled. \"Cortana, find me a target—a rock the same size as this \u0027gentleman\u0027s\u0027 base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burn it,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, sir!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lance of plasma appeared on the starboard side of Ascen- dant Justice, cut through space, and blasted the surface of a three-kilometer-long stone tumbling through the asteroid belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts surface heated to orange, yellow, and then white, sputtering blobs of molten iron and jets of vapor that caused the massive stone to spin faster. The plasma cut through the rock in a wide arc—punched through the opposite side. The uneven internal heat caused the rock to fracture and explode into fragments. The debris pinwheeled away, leaving helical trails of cooling iron and glittering metallic gas in its wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep number two and three turrets hot,\" the Admiral said, \"and target their base.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-34.html","bookId":1635,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM"}
