It is partly based on the legend of the Lambton Worm. The book was published in 1911 by Rider and Son in the UK, the year before Stoker\u0027s death, with color illustrations by Pamela Colman Smith. In 1925, it was republished in a highly abridged and rewritten form. Over a hundred pages were removed, the rewritten book having only twenty-eight chapters instead of the original forty. The final eleven chapters were cut down to only five, leading some critics to complain that the ending was abrupt and inconsistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-lair-of-the-white-worm.jpg","author":"Bram Stoker","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-lair-of-the-white-worm.html","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:31:34 AM"}
