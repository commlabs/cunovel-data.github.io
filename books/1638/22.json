They huddled together and stared down at their feet as they moved forward. Men in gray\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euniforms, rifles slung at the ready, moved about the edges, pushing the crew back into line toward the five checkpoints the rails led everyone toward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night had been docked with an asteroid. From the cargo bay they\u0027d all been herded out at gunpoint,\u0027 down a long corridor in the endcap of the habitat, and walked out into the interior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the tall rails, all enclosed in chicken wire with razor wire wrapped around that, effectively prevented them from walking out into the habitat until they\u0027d passed through five stations. Humorless-looking officials stood by small podiums in the stations with computer pads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay single file,\" a guard shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lines formed up, people jammed against each other, wondering what came next. They were face-to-face with the enemy: Insurrectionists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman in a black uniform with yellow trim walked up to a dais mounted over the gates. She brushed back a long lock of black hair, then folded her arms at the small of her back in a sort of parade rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she spoke her voice was amplified so that the entire crowd could hear her. \"Welcome to the habitat Asuncion,\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes leaned back and looked up at the far side of the asteroid\u0027s interior, far on the other side from where he stood. Patches of gardens and trees could be seen. It was odd, seeing something almost pastoral in a megastructure like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And welcome to the Rubble,\" the woman continued. \"My name is Maria Esquival. I am here to help orient you to your new situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes was surrounded by his remaining bridge crew. Lt. Dante Kirtley had folded his arms and was watching the woman, but Junior Grade Rai Li\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echecked out the crowded crew, looking worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Keyes loitered a handful of ODSTs, with Faison standing in their midst. He raised an eyebrow at Keyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria Esquival continued her speech. \"After the destruction of Madrigal, as we escaped into the asteroids and rocks here, we had some very tough decisions to make about who we would become: refugees struggling to exist, fighting over scraps? Or a civilization?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We chose civilization. We worked hard to build the Rubble. We worked hard because we knew we had something to build. A world like nothing the UNSC has ever known, with its strict hierarchies and militaristic command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes looked over at Dante, who rolled his eyes. \"More Insurrectionist bullshit,\" the comms specialist muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Free of the trappings of being a colony, we reinvented ourselves from the ground up. The Rubble is a technocracy. All of its municipal functions, all its laws, are voted on by our members. Some of us are Insurrectionist, some of us are refugees from Madrigal. Others are miners who were here from the beginning. Some are smugglers who made it here from the Inner Colonies. All are welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We mean that. All are welcome to have the right to vote. This includes you, crew of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsquival paused to let that sink in. In the crowd, Kirtley leaned back toward Keyes. \"They all vote on everything. Like even security? That\u0027d be insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we believe in freedom, the Rubble invites you to join our democracy. You have a choice in what happens next to you. You can choose to turn your back on the imperialist nature of the UNSC. Many of you may have come from Outer Colonies. Colonies that fell to the alien Covenant while the UNSC took their time to enact methods of dealing with the aliens. Colonies that you know were not as well protected as they could have been, because the UNSC\u0027s loyalties are to Earth first, the Inner Colonies next, and the Outer Colonies last. Here in the Rubble, you are equal among all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRai Li sniffed. \"How many crew you think are going to buy that crap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes looked out over the crowd of heads. How many crew were survivors of border colonies, or had family in the Outer Colonies?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of his sister for a second, a twinge of pain at the thought of her dying without UNSC protection, out there alone in the Outer Colonies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe, Keyes suddenly thought, maybe they\u0027d survived. Just like the Rubble had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea captured him for a second, and then Keyes shook himself. No, he had to remember what the Covenant was really about. The Rubble was some strange anomaly ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many.\" Keyes rubbed his jaw, thoughtfully. \"And can you blame them? We have no options. We\u0027re stuck out here. Behind the lines. They might as well start trying to find allies, figure out what the new game is. We\u0027re refugees, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes burned. He hadn\u0027t slept since they\u0027d been boarded, running from place to place to make sure things went smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was over. Everything was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d read about POWs in past wars, unlucky bastards who\u0027d been the first shot out of the air and stuck in a camp for the length of a war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he lived, he\u0027d be one of those footnotes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria Esquival cleared her throat. \"But, as you are UNSC, and have a checkered background, there are some concessions that have to be made when integrating you into the population of the Rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will have to swallow a motion tracker, in the form of a pill. This will let the Rubble\u0027s AI monitor and track your location. You will have to report for counseling and you will be assigned a case officer who will review the integration process. However these things are a small price to pay for your freedom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes wished he had his pipe to fiddle with. He had to leave it aboard the ship, along with any other personal effects or objects as they were moved to Asuncion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those of you who wish to become citizens, have only to ask when you reach Processing. You will be split off to a separate location. Those of you still loyal to the UNSC, who refuse the pill, we will, of course, be forced to jail you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, Esquival turned around and left her perch. The large lines staggered forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of them are asking for citizenship,\" Faison said from behind Keyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t blame them,\" Keyes said. \"One can understand what\u0027s going through their minds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to do anything about it?\" Faison asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re trapped. We have nothing. What do you want me to do? They\u0027re doing the rational thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaison grabbed Keyes by the shoulder. \"Either we\u0027re soldiers or we\u0027re not. Defeat or not, we should never forget that, Keyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive them a speech. Say something to counteract all that, because whatever this is you\u0027re doing right now, this isn\u0027t leadership. Where\u0027s the man who had us all jump out of that freighter?\" Say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes cleared his throat, then jumped up onto the railing. He wobbled for a second. \"Crew of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snaking line paused. And Keyes suddenly felt like a blank sheet of paper. Nothing came to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaison punched his shin, and Keyes sucked his breath in. \"Crew of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night, we have had a hard blow, I know. Some of you, after hearing all this, will have a hard choice to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just know this. No matter who we are, or why we give our service, we all joined to fight a common enemy. The people here, although they fled the destruction of their own world, think that the Covenant can be allies. The same creatures that destroyed their world. I think this is an illusion. So I hope that you will, if the time ever comes, stand by my side again if the need calls for it. With no hard feelings. I will not be joining their citizenry. I remain ready to fight the Covenant and protect humanity, as I swore to do when I joined the fight. As did you all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes got back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only silence. Rai Li finally shook her head. \"That was an awkward speech.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter,\" Faison said. \"What mattered was that he gave it.\" And Keyes knew he was right; he was stumbling toward being the leader they all wanted ... and needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes grabbed Faison by the shoulder. \"By the way, why are so many ODSTs at the front of the line? They look like they\u0027re going to be citizens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaison nodded and looked Keyes in the eye. \"Well, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know the Helljumpers: first in and all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave the last word in emphasis. Then he winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes got it. He could still trust Helljumpers to be Helljumpers. Faison was just making sure he got men out into the general populace in case they needed them out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got company,\" Lt. Kirtley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria Esquival and several black-clad men pushed through the crowd of crew toward Keyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant Jacob Keyes, I gather?\" Esquival said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes ma\u0027am,\" Keyes replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more speeches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes laughed. \"I thought we were all equals here.\" Esquival tilted her head. \"You just announced you gave up the right to citizenry, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the black-uniformed men punched Keyes in the stomach. Faison stepped forward, but Keyes waved him back as he coughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m pleased to report I\u0027m under no obligation to treat you as a citizen, Lieutenant Keyes.\" Esquival smiled. \"The problem is, you have a position of power over your men. Such speeches, while admirable, are given from that position of power. Many possible citizens might feel compelled to go to jail who wouldn\u0027t otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll all end,\" Keyes said. \"When the Covenant gets bored of whatever game it\u0027s playing here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsquival sighed. \"You\u0027re so sure of yourself. The war with the Covenant is something the UNSC somehow started back on Harvest, we\u0027re sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not our war, we just got caught up in it. It\u0027s your war. While you all fight to the last man with your brotherhood of arms, we\u0027ve built something here. I don\u0027t know if the UNSC has noticed, but the Covenant is comprised of a number of varying races. Many of these were allowed into the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovenant. We here in the Rubble are looking for ways humanity can join their ranks. As a junior race, perhaps. But we\u0027re adept. Lieutenant Keyes, we\u0027ll work our way up.\" ,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes shook his head. \"You conspire with the enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsquival sighed. \"Take him and his bridge crew to the jails. Get them out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey zip-tied his hands, and then led him off. Several junior officers started applauding, but it died out nervously after a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter THIRTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSOMEWHERE NEAR HABITAT CARIBO INNER RUBBLE, 23 LIBRAE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai eyeballed the Insurrectionist smuggler in the distance. They\u0027d been tagging along far behind it until it had docked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he flew in the weightless vacuum toward it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struck the surface, absorbing the impact with his knees. Even as he rebounded, he threw a magnetic grapple at the hull to stay attached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana hit the hull next to him. She grabbed his leg with one hand to stop him from bouncing back off. She had a large plastic case tucked underneath the other arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai looked at her helmet. \"What does Mike have for us today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Electromagnetic pulse bomb. Mostly harmless -- except to anything electronic aboard the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027ll wipe it all clean,\" Adriana said. She opened the case and pulled out a large, disc-shaped device that looked like a landmine. \"He\u0027s been saving this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a thud the EMP attached itself to the hull. Adriana leaned over it and tapped out a code. \"It talking to you, Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re live,\" Mike reported. \"Now get well clear of that thing. The EMP pulse is strong enough to fry a whole ship. Usually our armor can recover from those bursts pretty quickly, but it will still knock out your MJOLNIR briefly if you\u0027re too close. I want to wait until we\u0027re all back aboard and well clear before -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai spotted movement. \"We have company. They\u0027re coming from the airlock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo black space suits, hardened-looking affairs, coasted quickly at them. A burst of flame from their backs jetted them down the hull even faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hostile or curious?\" Mike asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuzzle flash answered that; the two suits had machine guns in either hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana bent down and leapt at them, pulling out her battle rifle and firing. Her rounds sparked and pinged off well-hardened material and the two suits curled up in a ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were expecting us,\" Jai said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been here a while, it\u0027s obvious something\u0027s happening,\" Mike replied. \"Not too surprising they\u0027ve rustled up a response of some sort. I\u0027m jockeying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetya in closer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Adriana said. \"Get ready to hit the EMP; we don\u0027t want to give these goons a chance with it. They\u0027ve probably raised the alarm. We also don\u0027t want to give them time to get the data off the ship somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grunted as she smacked into one of the suits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai leapt at the second one while paying out the rope on his grapple with one hand. He didn\u0027t bother shooting at the man until they collided. He ripped the rocket pack off the back of the combat space suit and threw it away, did the same with the man\u0027s two guns, then yanked himself back toward the smuggler with the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black suit hung still, unable to move anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana had smashed in the faceplate of their other opponent. The man\u0027s dying breath hung in the air between the two, a crystalline and fading cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw the suit away, the motion pushing her toward the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four more of them,\" she said. The glare of their packs marked them, flying right at them from the asteroid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all the strength available to them from the combination of their physique and the MJOLNIR powered armor, they crouched and leapt for the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetya, over a mile away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway across, Mike triggered the EMP bomb with a dramatic electric fireshow that crackled across the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel\u0027s hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also left their chasers immobile, their electronics burnt out by the invisible wave of electrical energy the bomb had released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai\u0027s headsrup display flickered slightly. \"Cutting it close, Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little,\" came the response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter THIRTY-TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE REDOUBT, METISETTE, 23 LIBRAE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first trio of Unggoy to turn the corridor walked right into Thel\u0027s line of fire.
