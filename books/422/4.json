How Siegfried rode to the City of Worms","content":"\u0026nbsp;Not often the heart of the hero had ache or sorrow known, \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till the tidings came of a fair-one on a wind of rumour blown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fair past all heart’s desiring was the Star of Burgundy—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She was doomed to be joy and anguish unto him in the days to be!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With the fame of her glorious beauty there flew forth far and wide\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The tale of the queenly spirit, of the heart of tameless pride;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the souls of princely champions were set on fire of the word,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That from lands afar to the guest-hall of Gunther the King they spurred.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But for all the love of the wooers, and their burning words thereof,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No whit were Kriemhild’s heart-strings once swept by the finger of love,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That she deigned to take of them any for the love of her life and her king.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In a strange land yet was her Falcon with the victory in his wing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When borne down love’s dream-river was the heart of Siegelind’s son,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As an idle wind was the wooing of all save him alone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Above all men was Siegfried worthy the chosen of women to wed:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now soon to the fair shall the fearless by the hand of love be led.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then his friends took thought for Siegfried, and the wise in council met,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When they knew the heart of the hero on the love of woman set.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 8}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Seek her for thy bride,” they counselled, “whose birth shall shame not thee.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered the prince: “None other than Kriemhild this shall be!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, she is a great king’s daughter, and the Star of Burgundia she is,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And she is the Queen of Beauty, and my heart knoweth certainly this—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never Kaiser nor King is so mighty, but, if he would choose him a bride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kriemhild, the glory of women, for him were a crown of pride.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then was told the tale of his purpose unto Siegmund the ancient King,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For his people brought him the tidings, and so was he ware of the thing\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whereunto was his son’s mind steadfast; and the King was sore afraid\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the peril of Siegfried’s wooing of the haughty-hearted maid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea also the selfsame rumour did the lady Siegelind hear;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And her heart was exceeding heavy with a burden of sorrow and fear;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For she wotted how grim was Gunther and the earls of his war-array:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they laboured to turn Prince Siegfried from the perilous quest away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then answered the aweless Siegfried: “Heart’s dearest, father mine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never to love of woman shall the soul of me incline,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Except I may woo untrammelled where love leads forth mine heart!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And never, for all their pleading, would he from the word depart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If thus thou abide unshaken,” the King made answer again,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Know thou, of thine high-wrought purpose my soul is exceeding fain;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with heart and hand will I aid thee to the uttermost of my might.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet mid King Gunther’s vassals is many a haughty knight:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, had he none other than Hagen the stalwart to stand at his side,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That champion is so uplifted with overweening pride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That I fear, I fear me sorely lest his malice bring us to bane\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If we woo that high-born maiden, the Lady of Disdain.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shall the pride of the haughty thwart us?” hot-hearted Siegfried cried.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If they mock at the speech of friendship, if I be with scorn denied,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then will I do my wooing with the strength of mine own right hand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, I will wrest from the proud ones their vassals and their land!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then answered and spake King Siegmund: “Woe’s me for this word of thine!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For if haply this thy defiance should be told by the waters of Rhine,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 9}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never couldst thou thereafter to the land of Gunther ride;—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Long time have I known them, Gunther and Gernot, the children of pride.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By violence may no man win her, that the maiden should stoop to his love,”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake Siegmund the King, “assurance most utter have I thereof.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet if thou with a host of warriors wouldst thitherward spur the steed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, all our battle-helpers shall with thee into Rhineland speed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now nay, it shall nowise please me,” the son of Siegmund said,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That a host of knights into Rhineland by my banner should be led\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Arrayed in the ranks of battle; for my sorrow should it be\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To constrain that daughter of princes to yield her love unto me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will woo her alone, unholpen of aught but mine own right hand:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With none save with twelve companions will I unto Gunther’s land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thus far and no further, my father, mine emprise shall ye aid,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That my knights be in bright-hued vesture and grey furs costly arrayed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto Siegelind his mother were the tidings borne anon,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the queen brake forth into weeping for her well-beloved son:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If he meet the hosts of Gunther, he is lost unto me!” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then wept that daughter of princes as women weep for the dead.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Siegfried the knight beheld her weeping, and came to her side\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With speech of loving comfort, and blithe of heart he cried:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nought hast thou to do with weeping, dear lady and queen, for my sake.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Though a host should arise against me, mine heart should in no wise quake.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nay, help me thou on my journey when to Burgundy I fare,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for me and my war-fellows fashion such goodly raiment to wear\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As shall be for the praise and the honour of knights so gallant as they;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And so shall mine heart go singing its thanks unto thee alway.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If in sooth thou abidest unshaken,” the lady Siegelind said,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then, O my child, my beloved, of me shall thy journey be sped;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the costliest raiment and fairest that ever good knight wore\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shall ye have, even thou and thy war-thanes, an exceeding plenteous store.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then lowly in thanks he bent him, Siegfried the fair and young;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake: “For my journeying-fellows shall I take no mighty throng,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 10}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But only twelve of my champions: make ready their raiment thou;—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am longing to learn, O mother, how fares it with Kriemhild now.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then nightlong, daylong toiling sat ladies lovely-eyed:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Was none that for rest or for pastime would lay her labour aside\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till the fingers of love had fashioned all Siegfried’s goodly gear:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For his heart was set on the journey, none other rede would he hear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And his father bade make ready for the prince his knightly array\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherein he should go forth riding from Siegmund’s land away;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the warriors’ glittering hauberks withal were ready dight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And their strong-knit helms and their war-shields broad and gleaming bright.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now by this was the hour of their faring unto Burgundy drawn full near;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the hearts of man and woman were heavy with boding fear\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lest never the cherished faces should be seen in the land again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they bade lade armour and raiment on the beasts of the sumpter-train.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Goodly to see were the horses in their trappings of ruddy gold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Long should ye search and vainly more gallant sight to behold\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Than Siegfried the knight and the warrior-henchmen ranged at his side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now for nought but the parting-blessing his feet for a space abide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the King and the Queen there mingled their blessing with many a tear;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But he spake to them words of comfort, and cried with loving cheer:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nought have ye to do with weeping for my peril in any strife:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Banish for aye foreboding as touching Siegfried’s life!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet the earls were heavy-hearted, the maidens’ tears ran free;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, the fear on their souls lay darkly that yet in the days to be\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the dear ones unreturning they should sorrow with hearts bowed low:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah me, for their lamentation at the last was there cause enow!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So it fell on the seventh morning that to Worms by the Rhine-river shore\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Those fearless knights came riding. What raiment soever they wore\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Was all with the red gold broidered, and the harness glinted and shone\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As their steeds went softly pacing as they followed Siegfried on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 11}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n New-wrought were the knights’ broad bucklers, bright without fleck or stain,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And their helms were a flashing splendour, as rode that gallant train\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After the aweless Siegfried through the heart of Burgundia-land;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never therein did heroes so goodly-apparelled stand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Low as the spurs all-golden their mighty sword-points hung;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sharp battle-spears those champions in their strong hands lightly swung.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of two full spans was the blue blade of the lance that Siegfried bare;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Keen were the long cold edges, and the lightning of death slept there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Starred reins all gold-embroidered swung light in the rider’s hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the steeds’ breast-bands were silken: so rode they through the land;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with parted lips of wonder around them all folk pressed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Gunther’s palace-marshals sped forth to meet the guest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They ran, the earls high-hearted; they hasted, henchman and knight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Toward these of the lordly presence, even as was meet and right;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they gave those guests fair greeting unto their liege-lord’s land;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they grasped the good steed’s bridle, and would take the shield from the hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they made as to lead the horses to the crib and the stall for their rest:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then stayed them the voice of Siegfried, that dauntless warrior-guest:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let be the steeds; for a season still harnessed shall they stand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For yet am I girt for the journey, and I ride full soon from your land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now if any man certainly knoweth, let him nowise hide the thing,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For this would I have one tell me, where may I light on your King,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even Gunther the treasure-wealthy, Burgundia’s mighty lord.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then one that thereof well wotted spake out the answering word:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If ye fain would behold that war-king, the wish may be lightly won.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the wide fair hall of his palace I marked him a little agone\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Begirt with his hero-vassals: thither to him go ye.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There many a noble warrior beside him shall ye see.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But by this within his palace had the tale to the King been told\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How there waited without by the gateway strange warriors aweless-bold\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All-armed in sunbright hauberks and in royal-rich array,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whose names and whose kindred no man in Burgundy might say.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 12}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thereat was the King astonied, and he marvelled whence they came,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n These lordly knights from whose raiment so shone the splendour-flame,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n These wielders of goodly bucklers, broad shields and stainless-fair:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, it misliked him that no man could say what folk they were.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then to the King made answer Ortwein, Metz’s lord—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stalwart he was, and a dauntless wielder of spear and sword:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Forasmuch as in no wise we know them, bid one bring hither to thee\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mine uncle, even Hagen: let him look on their company.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Known unto him are kingdoms and strange lands far and wide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of him, if he know yon chieftains, shall we surely be certified.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the King bade bring that baron and his knightly train therewithal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Full soon was his lordly presence beheld in Gunther’s hall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For what cause,” then spake Hagen, “am I hitherward called of the King?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Lo, yonder unknown heroes to mine halls come journeying;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And no man knoweth to name them. Hast thou haply far away\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In a strange land looked on their faces? I pray thee, Hagen, say.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That will I,” made answer Hagen. To the casement straight did he go,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And his glance like the swoop of an eagle flashed o’er those guests below.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With the warrior’s joy their war-gear and their goodly array he scanned;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Howbeit their faces he knew not: they were strangers in the land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake: “Whencesoever the warriors to Rhineflood hitherward fare,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Princes are they of a surety, or a message of princes they bear,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So goodly are their war-steeds, so royal is their array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sooth, whencesoe’er they have ridden, great-hearted heroes be they.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then a little pondered Hagen, and he spake: “It is sooth to say,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Upon Siegfried’s bodily presence have I looked not unto this day:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet indeed and in truth meseemeth, howsoever the thing may be,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the knight who yonder beareth so princely a port, is he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Great tales shall be told, if it be so, of his coming to this our land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The lion-hearted Niblungs were slain by the hero’s hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Schilbung and Nibelung, scions of the King of the Golden Hoard;—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Marvels he wrought against them when his strong arm swung the sword!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 13}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For it chanced, when the hero was riding alone with no helpers near,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That he found by a misty mountain, as the tale hath been told in mine ear,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Enringing the Hoard of King Niblung a throng of fierce-eyed men:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had seen not those strange faces till he lighted on them then.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There lay King Niblung’s Gold-hoard, haled forth from the dark abyss\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of the rifted heart of the mountain—a strange, wild tale is this\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How the Niblung men were wrangling o’er the treasure’s portioning!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So came Knight Siegfried upon them, and he marvelled at that strange thing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So nigh he drew unhindered that he saw each battle-lord,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And on him looked they: to his fellow a prince spake straightway the word:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “‘Lo, here cometh Siegfried the stalwart, the Low Land’s hero renowned!’—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Good sooth, a weird adventure mid the Niblung men he found!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Schilbung and Nibelung greeted the hero with courteous speech;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now do the high-born princes that stranger knight beseech\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That himself would consent between them that mighty treasure to share;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they hung so sore upon him that he yielded at last to their prayer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such wealth of precious gemstones he beheld, as telleth the tale,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That fivescore wains had sufficed not that treasure thence to hale:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were heaps yet huger of red gold, the wealth of the Niblung land:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And all that hoard must be portioned by the aweless Siegfried’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for hire did they give to the hero King Niblung’s dwarf-wrought sword—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But, ere all was done, for their guerdon they won them an evil reward;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, enforced was Siegfried to deal them therewith great slaughter and grim;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For his sharing might nowise content them, and they turned their fury on him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) So there in the midst that treasure yet all unportioned lay;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And fell on the hero the war-thanes of either king’s array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But he thrust and he hewed with Balmung, their sire’s enchanted sword,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nor stayed, till his might had wrested from the Niblung men the Hoard.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Twelve fearful battle-helpers ’gainst that lone warrior fought,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Strong men, and in stature giants; but their might availed them nought,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the hand of Siegfried smote them in his fury of battle-lust.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seven hundred knights of the Niblung land he laid in the dust\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 14}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With the Sword, the good sword Balmung of the world-renownèd name.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the heart of many a champion for terror as water became,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Quelled by the lightning-flasher and its lord’s undaunted mood.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, the Niblung land and her castles were under his might subdued.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, those two kings in the battle he met, and he smote them dead;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet himself through the might of Albrich the Dwarf was sorely bestead;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the vassal dwarf burned fiercely to avenge his liege-lords slain,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till quelled by the might of Siegfried his purpose he needs must refrain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That demon-dwarf all vainly strove with the hero’s might:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Like the grapple of raging lions round the mountain stormed their fight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till the Hood of Darkness was yielded by Albrich to this new lord,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Siegfried the Terrible master was left of the Niblung Hoard,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For all which had dared to withstand him on that stricken field lay slain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then bade he bear that treasure to the mountain-fastness again\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whence the Niblung vassals had haled it forth as the dead kings bade;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the warder of the treasure strong Alberich he made.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By an oath most mighty he bound him his thrall, to be faithful and true,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And ever in loyal service his uttermost bidding to do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So ended Hagen of Troneg—“All this hath the hero done:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through the world in battle-prowess peer unto him is there none.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Men tell of another emprise—as I heard it, I tell it to you—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A Worm, a winged fen-dragon, the hand of the hero slew:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then he bathed in the blood of the monster, and his skin became as horn,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That no weapon may wound him: witness thereof full many have borne.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now wisely and well do I rede you—receive him in courteous wise,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the fiery wrath of the hero by no deed of ours may arise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Since utterly aweless his heart is, let no man do him despite.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bethink you how many a marvel hath been wrought by his quenchless might.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the King of the land made answer: “Thy counsel is meet and right.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mark ye how proudly he standeth, as defying peril of fight!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dauntless they be, yon warrior and the vassals that follow him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We will fare down unto the gateway, and greet yon champion grim.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 15}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yea, greet him with worship and honour,” spake Hagen answering;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For he cometh of noble lineage, and is son of a mighty king;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And his port, meseemeth, is princely—yea, by Christ the Lord!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Great tales shall be told of the issues of his riding hitherward.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the lord of the land made answer: “Right welcome to us be he!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Valiant he is and noble, as well may mine own eyes see.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, Burgundy-land shall hold him for a guest of passing worth.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto where Prince Siegfried tarried then Gunther the King passed forth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the lord of the land and his earlfolk bade the hero welcome there\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With greeting exceeding gracious, with courtesy passing fair;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And before them the Knight all-peerless bowed him in courtly wise\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In thanks for their lovingkindness, and the worship in their eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake Gunther the king: “I marvel, and fain would be certified,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whence, O most noble Siegfried, unto this our land ye ride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And what thing come ye seeking at Worms by the waters of Rhine.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the guest to the King made answer: “I hide no purpose of mine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Afar in the land of my fathers the tidings have I heard\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How that here, O King, in thy palace—and fain would I prove the word—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Be the knights in the world most valiant—yea, oft have I hearkened their fame—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the best that king gat ever: and for this cause hither I came.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, and I hear men praise thee for the Star of Chivalry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Never was king so valiant unto this day seen,’ they cry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through all my land thy glory is blown upon rumour’s wind.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No rest may my spirit give me till the truth hereof I find.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, I withal am a warrior; a crown must I wear one day;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And fain am I that all men of me in that hour should say\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That I take the folk and the kingdom of right for mine heritage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, mine head and mine honour, I lay them in the lists for battle’s gage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thou then, if thou be so valiant as is sung by the lips of fame—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I ask no man of my challenge, if he joy or chafe at the same—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I challenge thee here, do battle for all thou accountest thine!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thy land and thy castles, I claim them for spoil of this sword of mine!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 16}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the King was exceeding astonied, amazed did the earl-folk stand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As they hearkened to that strange challenge, to the champion’s haughty demand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he claimed for his victory-guerdon the people and land of their lord;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And as flame burst forth their anger to hear that arrogant word.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nay, how should it be for mine honour,” answered the King thereto,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I staked the realm that my father ruled nobly his whole life through\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On a combat’s issue, to lose it or hold it by bodily might?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sooth, this were a sorry maintaining of the name and the fame of a knight!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nay, nought I abate of my challenge,” that aweless champion cried;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If the peace of thy land safe warded by the strength of thine arm abide,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now from thy grasp will I wrest it; and mine heritage withal,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If thou win it by battle-prowess, shall be held of thee in thrall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let thou and I stake straightway our land and throne and crown;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And whichsoever in combat shall strike the other down,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto him shall all be subject, the lands of twain and the folk.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then against it Hagen the mighty and Gernot the valiant spoke.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of a surety not so are we minded,” spake Gernot proudly and high,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That for winning of new possessions should any good knights die\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the strife of warring heroes: lo, fair our heritage is,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And of right is it ours; and no man
