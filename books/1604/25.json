It\u0027s a truck. It makes a grinding noise. A sharp scream of metal fills the parking lot we are in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emma.\" Sarah whispers. I can hear the panic in her whisper over the plastic crinkle of her moving bag. I look through the small hole that I\u0027ve been breathing through, to see Sarah\u0027s blue eyes watching my bag through the hole in hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the hole a little and smile, \"Stay calm. This is our ride out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes are full of worry. She nods. I can see the terror as the sound moves again and then moves closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound is what I imagine it would be like being in a factory before the fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grampy worked a toilet paper factory when I was really little. He took me on a tour when I was six. I only saw a small part of the factory but the sound of it is burned into my memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the metal bin start to vibrate. I know the truck is closer. My breaths are so short and rapid that I feel dizzy. I can\u0027t seem to pull a longer breath than the little ones I\u0027m getting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am vibrating along with the metal dumpster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud bang knocks against the front of the bin. It pushes me back. I feel my foot tear through the bag. I struggle to push it down so that it isn’t sticking out and looking like a nurse is in the bin. I forgot to take the scrubs off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vibration is so intense that I feel myself sinking into the pit of churning body bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear Sarah crying out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay calm.\" I try not to shout, but I have to over the noise of the machine lifting us into the air. I feel the bin tilt to the front. I hear screams. I know at least some of them are ripping from my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bag is tossed and turned, until it slides forward and is tossed into an abyss. My stomach lurches forward as I freefall for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI land against metal and bodies. Some are stiff but most are soft. I am lost in them. I don’t know which way is up or down. I can\u0027t feel gravity. I can feel the vibration again and the screech of the metal is everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn between the sounds of the metal and gears I hear sobs. I don’t think they are mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a final loud bang and then a jerk forward. I open the hole of my bag a little more. I can\u0027t see the light. I am under the bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I\u0027m struggling for air. I don’t think it\u0027s that there is no air. I think it\u0027s a panic attack. My palms are covered in sweat. I need Leo. I need to run my fingers in his fur. I imagine I am touching him. I slide a hand out of the bag and feel with my fingers. My arms are trapped. The sobs get stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see you, just a second. We\u0027ll be out of the gates in a minute. Just don’t freak out okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna speaks softly, \"Sarah we need to stay still until we get far enough away from here. Just try breathing through your mouth. See the hole is right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I had a hole leading somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember what my dad told me about avalanches. I spit and feel it go up in the air and land back on my forehead. I wipe it off with the arm I\u0027ve freed. I am on my back and have spit on my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to wiggle and push through the bag above me. I tear the bag and push a body off of my other arm. My chest is tightening. The air is harder to get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach my hand up until it feels the air of the moving truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel myself panicking. I want to claw myself free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my arm in and look at the light in the gaps of the bags above me. I see other things in the tears I have created in the bags, but I try not to see anything but the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the truck lurch forward and come to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear men talking. I hear them laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am lying in a sea of death and they\u0027re laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truck moves and I feel the bodies on top of me start to shift again. I count to ten and make myself wait an extra couple seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne Mississippi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Mississi… Fuck it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get them off of me. Get them off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the shifting and the moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay Emma. It\u0027s okay I can see you.\" My face is cleared suddenly and I can see the smiling face of Anna. She is about three bodies above me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach my hands up and start clawing at the bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna\u0027s face grimaces, \"No stop. You\u0027re opening the bags. Just give me a second to move them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am vibrating. I can\u0027t wait. I want out. I want out now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weight of them is crushing me. I never noticed but as they are lifted off, I feel relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy upper body is freed first. I sit up and use the two dead women next to me to push my legs free. I kick and scramble until I am out of the clutches of the black bags. I see the light of the bright sunny day and the brown of the borderlands. I have never been so grateful to see old hay and dead crops. The green of the forest off to the left side wakes my heart up. We are driving very quickly. We need to get out of this truck before it takes us to the body dump. The drop at the one I saw was huge. It was a canyon. Bodies were splayed along the canyon walls and ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna is breathing hard and sweating. Sarah is crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point to the back of the truck, \"We need to jump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah shakes her head. I grab her face and focus it on mine, \"You need to trust me. You need this. Think about the swimming hole. We will be there in three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sobs with her eyes closed. Her little face trembles. She feels like she did the first day I met her in the dark. Frightened and tiny against the massive world that wanted to destroy us. It feels like nothing will ever change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scramble over the bags of death. I don’t think about what I\u0027m touching or doing. I climb to the edge of the filthy truck. I try not to imagine the diseases that linger on this metal ledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don’t touch your face or anything until we can wash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah sobs. Anna nods and watches Sarah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on the ledge and feel the wind whip around me. If I close my eyes I am in the back of the truck and my dad is driving. We are on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere and he lets me ride in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip the ledge and look back, \"Climb on here with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey listen and move quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sit on the ledge together. Gripping the metal and waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you feel the next sharp corner we jump. Tuck your arms and legs and try to roll for the ditch. The truck will slow for the corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truck is moving fast. Not fast enough that we will die but fast enough we may be injured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the brakes hit hard and jerk us forward, as the truck veers and I shout, \"Now.\" My fingers try to grip but I force them to let go. I roll from the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the screams faintly in the background of the pain and ringing noise. My body bounces on the gravel. Dust is everywhere. Sharp pains cover me. I feel my body come to a stop but my head feels like it\u0027s still rolling. Hot liquid is seeping from above my eyes. When it covers my vision the world turns red for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the blood I see a dusty haze. Sarah is picking herself up and pulling at Anna\u0027s arms. Anna shakes her head to straighten her vision out. They hop down into the ditch. They\u0027re shouting at me. My vision is clouded for a second. I see their faces screaming. I look behind me and see another ball of dust coming our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s another truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and run into the ditch. I dive between the thick grass and pull it over me. The truck roars around the corner spitting rocks everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can barely hear it over the ringing in my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn on my belly and throw up. Blood mixes with my vomit. I\u0027m not going to die here. I force my trembling and twitching body to crawl out of the muddy ditch. I drag myself up the bank and climb over some dead fallen trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emma this way.\" Anna is waving an arm at me. I can hear her but she sounds like she is shouting in a can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and stumble to where they are sitting behind some trees and bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah has a cut on her face that looks like road rash. It\u0027s not deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you move everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna has no wounds I can see but she is favoring her right arm. It hangs funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks terrified, \"I think it\u0027s broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay we need to get going. They can fix it at the camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s going to take us days to get back to the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you walk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"I have to walk Emma. It\u0027s not if I can or not. I\u0027m not going back there. We need to bandage your head. It\u0027s bleeding bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and watch her tear at her scrubs. She ties a dirty white bandage to my forehead. It stings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I think it\u0027ll hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offer Sarah my hand. She takes it and we start the long trek back to the building we\u0027ve just left. I need to get my bearings and the trail back to the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around for a sign of them but find nothing. I knew they would leave me but I never imagined they would leave me empty handed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took my backpack even. I see the broken branches and can\u0027t help but smile a little. They may have left me but at least they make the walk back obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point at the hillside in front of us, \"It\u0027s this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah moans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her and try not to snap, \"We walk till dark. That’s the rule okay?\" My head hurts and it\u0027s making me a little mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slumps and starts walking. We are filthy in our white and pale blue clothes that are now stained and torn. Dirt cakes our faces mixed with the dried blood. The cut above my eye needs a stitch. It\u0027s not going to get it. I\u0027m going to have a deep scar there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s hard to care when I made it out alive. I never died there. I still block out the images of the torn bags and the things I saw in there. My little cut is nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet ache. The slippers are bad for hiking. I slip a few times. Anna is cautious. Her arm still looks funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes all of our second day to get back to the place where I camped with Will and Jake and we roasted the hare. I lick my lips and think about the hare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow remembering the hare makes me miss Meg. Her nattering took up the free air where my brain liked to roam while we walked. She stopped my thoughts and drove me insane in a different way than the hunger that is gnawing at my belly does. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-25.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
