In the wolf dream, what he felt became reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One\", Lanfear said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved Faile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved Faile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved Faile. The Compulsion vanished like smoke in the wind, thrown off like clothing changed in the blink of an eye. Before Lanfear could strike, Perrin reached out and took her by the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted once. Her neck popped in his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanfear crumpled, and Perrin caught her body. She was beautiful. As she died, she changed back to the other form she had been wearing before, her new body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin felt a horrible stab of loss. He hadn’t completely wiped what she’d done from his mind. He’d overcome it, perhaps overlaid it with something new, something right. Only the wolf dream and his ability to view himself as he should be had allowed him to accomplish that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, deep within, he still felt love for this woman. That sickened him. The love was nowhere near as strong as his love for Faile, but it was there. He found himself crying as he lowered her body, draped in sleek white and silver, to the stone floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m sorry\", he whispered. Killing a woman, particularly one who wasn’t threatening him personally . . . it was something he’d never have thought himself capable of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had needed to do it. This was one test, at least, that Rand would not need to face. It was one burden that Perrin could carry for his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up toward Rand. \"Go\", Perrin whispered. \"Do what you must do. As always, I will watch your back\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seals crumbled. The Dark One burst free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand held the Dark One tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilled with the Power, standing in a column of light, Rand pulled the Dark One into the Pattern. Only here was there time. Only here could the Shadow itself be killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe force in his hand, which was at once vast and yet tiny, trembled. Its screams were the sounds of planets grinding together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pitiful object. Suddenly, Rand felt as if he were holding not one of the primal forces of existence, but a squirming thing from the mud of the sheep pens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU REALLY ARE NOTHING, Rand said, knowing the Dark Ones secrets completely. YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN ME REST AS YOU PROMISED, FATHER OF LIES. YOU WOULD HAVE ENSLAVED ME AS YOU WOULD HAVE ENSLAVED THE OTHERS. YOU CANNOT GIVE OBLIVION. REST IS NOT YOURS. ONLY TORMENT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One trembled in his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU HORRIBLE, PITIFUL MITE, Rand said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand was dying. His lifeblood flowed from him, and beyond that, the amount of the Powers he held would soon burn him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the Dark One in his hand. He began to squeeze, then stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew all secrets. He could see what the Dark One had done. And Light, Rand understood. Much of what the Dark One had shown him was lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the vision Rand himself had created—the one without the Dark One—was truth. If he did as he wished, he would leave men no better than the Dark One himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a fool I have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand yelled, thrusting the Dark One back through the pit from where it had come. Rand pushed his arms to the side, grabbing twin pillars of saidar and saidin with his mind, coated with the True Power drawn through Moridin, who knelt on the floor, eyes open, so much power coursing through him he couldn’t even move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand hurled the Powers forward with his mind and braided them together. Saidin and saidar at once, the True Power surrounding them and forming a shield on the Bore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wove something majestic, a pattern of interlaced saidar and saidin in their pure forms. Not Fire, not Spirit, not Water, not Earth, not Air. Purity. Light itself. This didn’t repair, it didn’t patch, it forged anew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this new form of the Power, Rand pulled together the rent that had been made here long ago by foolish men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe understood, finally, that the Dark One was not the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt never had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoiraine grabbed Nynaeve beside her, moving only by touch, for that light was blinding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled Nynaeve to her feet. Together, they ran. Away from the burning light behind. Up the corridor, scrambling. Moiraine burst into open air without realizing it, and almost ran off the edge of the path, which would have sent her stumbling down the steep slope. Someone caught her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have you\", Thom’s voice said as she collapsed into his arms, completely drained. Nynaeve fell to the ground nearby, gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThom turned Moiraine away from the corridor, but she refused to look away. She opened her eyes, though she knew that the light was too intense, and she saw something. Rand and Moridin, standing in the light as it expanded outward to consume the entire mountain in its glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blackness in front of Rand hung like a hole, sucking in everything. Slowly, bit by bit, that hole shrank away until it was just a pinprick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEPILOGUE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo See the Answer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand slipped on his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t see. He carried something. Something heavy. A body. He stumbled up the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing, he thought. It’s closing The ceiling lowered like a shutting jaw, stone grinding against stone. With a gasp, Rand reached open air as the rocks slammed down behind him, locking together like clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand tripped. The body in his arms was so heavy. He slipped to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could . . . see, just faintly. A figure kneeling down beside him. \"Yes\", a woman whispered. He did not recognize the voice. \"Yes, that’s good. That is what you need to do\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, his vision fuzzy. Was that Aiel clothing? An old woman, with gray hair? Her form retreated, and Rand reached toward her, not wanting to be alone. Wanting to explain himself. \"I see the answer now\", he whispered. \"I asked the Aelfinn the wrong question. To choose is our fate. If you have no choice, then you aren’t a man at all. You’re a puppet . . \". Shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand felt heavy. He plunged into unconsciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat stood up as the mist of Mashadar burned away from him and vanished. The field was littered with the bodies of those eerie pockmarked Trollocs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked upward through the vanishing wisps and found the sun directly overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you’re a sight\", he said to it. \"You should come out more often. You have a pretty face\". He smiled, then looked down at the dead man by his feet. Padan Fain looked like a bundle of sticks and moss, the flesh slipping from his bones. The blackness of the dagger had spread across hi \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-304.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
