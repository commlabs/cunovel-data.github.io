It was being pushed at high speed up the main ramp to the Emergency Room entrance but to her it seemed to float unattended through boundless space, taking its time. The body on the stretcher was just a pile of blood-stained rags. She couldn\u0027t even see a face. But then the body reached out a hand to her. The skin was scorched and falling away in places. Thick clotted blood was smeared across the fingers. She couldn\u0027t even tell if it was a male or female hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill. She reached out, touched it. The fingers curled around hers but then the hand was ripped away from her, the stretcher flying up the ramp. Somebody shouted for plasma and she squinted and tried to clear her head. She\u0027d been sitting in the hallway for hours and hours with no stimulation except the constant parade of mutilated bodies that flew by. She shouldn\u0027t have been in the hallway at all-there was a waiting room for people like her, complete with six TV\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esets and a couple hundred pounds of straight women\u0027s magazines-but being a cop had its privileges. Most of the EMTs and nurses who passed by didn\u0027t even give her a second glance, they assumed she was just guarding the entrance. In fact it just let her be a couple hundred feet closer to Deanna. They wouldn\u0027t let her into the operating room or the recovery room. The hallway was as close as she was going to get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hand. It had been like something out of a dream but she knew it was real. It had touched her. She looked down and saw real blood on her fingers. Her hand smelled like gasoline and shit, a smell she knew all too well. The smell of a really bad car accident. The hand had been real and warm and alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike the half-dead she had tortured and executed on her bedroom floor. Unlike the vampires who were coming to destroy her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaxton sighed and crossed her arms and waited. She had tried reading a magazine but she was too distracted. Images and words jumped into her head unbidden. Not even things related to the investigation, not even memories of Deanna, just weird little scraps of thought. She kept wondering if the milk was sitting out on the kitchen counter, if it was going to go bad. The kitchen had to be as cold as the outside air since the window was completely gone. Pretty much anybody could climb in through the hole where the window had been-should she call someone, have them check the house, have them put cardboard, at least, over the window? If she did that should she ask them to go inside and put the milk back in the fridge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t shut her mind down. It didn\u0027t work that way. Only sleep could turn off the brain and she was a long way from sleep. The banal thoughts, the endless, cycling inanities had their purpose, as excruciating as they were. They kept her from thinking the big thoughts, the real thoughts. The things that scared her. Thoughts like, the fact that vampires wanted her dead. So badly they would send their minions to kill everyone in her house. Everyone. The half-deads would have killed her dogs, probably, just to be thorough about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThoughts like, Arkeley had turned his back on her. She couldn\u0027t even count on him to defend her against the dark things that wanted her life. He wasn\u0027t done with her, he had some purpose for her, but she wasn\u0027t going to be an active part of his investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThoughts like, is there really any difference between someone being hypnotized into breaking a window and impaling themselves on broken glass... and someone whose brain chemistry stops working one day, and they hang themselves in their bedroom? Her mother had had a good job and plenty of money. She had a perfectly good daughter to live for, a nice house, partners for bridge, church socials, potluck dinners. Holidays. Family. Vacations. Retirement. Her suicide had been a complete mystery to everyone who knew her. It had been a mistake, really, it had to have been. Deanna had nothing to keep her living. No job, family who loathed her for what she was. A partner who cared and who tried but just didn\u0027t have the time to be there for her. No future. Art that nobody understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it still suicide, if you had an excuse? If you were driven to it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Officer,\" someone said, nearby. It was like the ghost that had called her in Urie Polder\u0027s barn, a directionless, bodiless voice. \"Officer,\" the voice said again. Caxton frowned and turned her head. A nurse stood there in blood-stained scrubs, a middle-aged woman with white hair up in a bun on top of her head. She wore heavy gloves, the kind you wear when you wash dishes. \"Officer, she\u0027s awake,\" the nurse said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaxton followed her through halls, around corners, up stairs. She could not have found her way back if she was called upon to do so. They came to a room, a semi-private room with two beds. One held a morbidly obese woman whose entire lower body and thighs were wrapped up in plaster. A surgical gown had been draped over her breasts. The other bed held something that had been stitched together out of spare parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, Caxton realized, it was Deanna. \"You look like Frankenstein\u0027s monster,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaxton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna tried to smile but the stitches in her jaw line kept her from moving her mouth too much. \"Pumpkin... you left me,\" she mumbled. Caxton took off her hat and leaned down to kiss Deanna\u0027s puffy lips. The obese woman in the other bed let out a half-gasp, half-cluck of disdain but Caxton had learned to ignore that sound a long time before. She stood back up and took a better look at Deanna. The view didn\u0027t improve the second time around. Glinting staples held the side of Deanna\u0027s face together. The sharp ends of stitches, black and coarse like horsehair, stuck up out of the flesh of her chest and shoulders while bandages wrapped her hands until she looked like she was wearing bloody mittens. \"You left me all alone,\" Deanna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk, Dee. Just rest.\" Caxton reached down and gently brushed the staples in Deanna\u0027s face. They were real, solid, and the flesh underneath was red and inflamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA doctor came into the room. Caxton didn\u0027t even look at him. She held Deanna\u0027s eyes with her own and refused to let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to bring in someone to talk with her. I know you probably don\u0027t want to hear that but I\u0027m not sure you have the right to stop me, either-do you have a civil union?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t. They\u0027d never bothered, since it wouldn\u0027t be legally recognized anyway. It didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t object,\" Caxton said. She started to reach for Deanna\u0027s hands but they were so badly damaged she didn\u0027t want to touch them. She held onto the railing on the side of the bed instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna started to protest but Caxton just moved her chin back and forth a little and said, \"Shh, it\u0027s just to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s pretty lucky, all things considered. She could easily have died. She lost a lot of blood and some of the fragments of glass went pretty deep. We\u0027ll wait and see if there\u0027s any nerve damage to her hands. The cut in her face is going to require reconstructive surgery and even then there will be scarring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaxton held onto the railing as if she would be swept away on a dark sea if she lost her grip. It didn\u0027t matter, she told herself. Deanna was going to live. At least, she would live until the next time someone tried to kill her. Maybe the next time Reyes would come for her himself. \"I\u0027m going to call in for a guard to stand watch outside this room, Doctor. This was an attempted murder.\" The words sounded ridiculous coming out of her mouth, like something she\u0027d made up. It was real, though, she needed to convince herself it was real. \"I\u0027ll stay with her until the first shift arrives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well.\" The doctor moved to check on the obese woman in the next bed over. \"It\u0027s almost two o\u0027clock now but I\u0027ll call down to the desk and have them set something up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two o\u0027clock?\" Caxton asked, surprised. She glanced down at her watch and saw he was correct. \"Shit. Dee, honey,\" she said, \"I have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whuh?\" Deanna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s some place I have to be.\" It was something she\u0027d figured out in those long hours in the hallway. It was her next move. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/13-bullets-laura-caxton-vampires-1/page-31.html","bookId":2605,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:42 PM"}
