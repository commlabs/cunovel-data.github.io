Thomas had no mercy. Everything must be done to his perfectionist demands. He was a fanatic. They had spent twenty-one hours going through the operational routine for the new sub. Thomas would not wait for the arrival of the poet, who was somewhere in the bowels of Processing. No. We will use what time we have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to take a deep breath. Pain yanked a knot behind her breastbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered how Thomas came to them. How could he be from Ship? Things he did not know, things that Shipmen took for granted, worried her. There was the incident with the Hooded Dasher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was calm, though, I\u0027ll give him that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat really surprised her was his ignorance of The Game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crowd had gathered behind the LTA hangar - off-shift crew, most of them drinking what Shipmen called Spinneret wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this about?\" Thomas pointed his clipboard at the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s The Game.\" She looked at him with a new amazement. \"You mean you don\u0027t know The Game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What Game? That\u0027s just a bunch of drunks having a good tim.... strange, there was nothing in my briefing about liquors of any kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There have always been lab alcohols,\" she said, \"and at one time there were wines and brandies. But officially we can\u0027t afford to give up any productive food for wine. Somehow, some do and the market is brisk. Those men,\" she nodded toward the group, \"have traded away some of their food chits for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, they trade food for wine that costs food to make - maybe less food. Isn\u0027t that their right?\" His eyes squinted at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but food\u0027s short. They\u0027re going hungry. In this place, going hungry means you slow down and here, Raja Thomas, if you slow down you die. And maybe someone else dies because of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you do it?\" he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" her skin glowed red, \"when I can afford the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed Thomas as he strolled toward the crew, pulled the sleeve of his singlesuit to stop him short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It requires an even number of players, men or women. Each one buys into The Game with a certain number of food chits. They pair off any way they wish, and each one draws a wihi stick from a basket. They compare, and the longest stick wins a round. The shorter stick of the pair is eliminated, so those drawing the longer sticks pair up. They draw again, and so on until there is only one couple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the food chits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The players up the ante every round, so if there are a lot of people, The Game gets pretty expensive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the last couple divide the chits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they draw again. The one who draws the longer stick wins the chits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That seems boring enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, then: \"The loser runs the perimeter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said it offhand, without as much as a blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean they run around the outsid.... ?\" his thumb hung in the air over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"They run it naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they can\u0027t possibl.... that\u0027s almost ten kilometers out in the ope....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why? Not for food, it\u0027s not that bad yet, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not for food. For favors, jobs, quarters, partners. For the thrill. For the chance to go out with a flash from a boring life. The long sticks are the losers. Food chits are a consolation prize. The winner gets to run the P.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas let out a long breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are the odds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By experience, they work out just like the rest of The Game - fifty-fifty. Half don\u0027t make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s legal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her turn to look at him quizzically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have the right to their own bodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to watch the people playing thi.... this game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crew had paired up, drawn, paired up, drawn, and was now down to the last pair. A man and a woman this time. The man had no nose, but wrinkled slits in his forehead pulsed with the moisture that Thomas took for breath. The woman looked vaguely like someone he had known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drew, and the woman matched longer. The crowd cheered and helped her gather her winnings. They tucked them in her collar and sleeves and belt. The last of the wine was passed around and the group began moving toward the west quarter exterior hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s really going out there?\" Thomas followed them with his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you notice his right eyebrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he looked up at her, \"it looked as though he had two eyebrows above it. And the nos....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those were tattoos, hash marks. You get one for running the P.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then this is his third?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. His odds are still fifty-fifty. But there is a groundside saying: \u0027You go once, you\u0027ve had your flirt with death. You go twice, you live twice. Go three times and go for me.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever play it, TaoLini?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed, and the glow faded out of her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get back to work,\" he said, and walked her slowly back to the hangar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaela remembered this exchange with the odd feeling that she had missed something in Thomas\u0027 responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas would not even pause for WorShip. He permitted a grudging rest, hardly a hesitation, only when fatigue had them dropping programs and forgetting coordinates. During one of these rests he had started an odd conversation with her and it kept her awake now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was he trying to say to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been seated in the globe of plaz which would shield them in the depths of the sea. Workmen continued their activity all around the outside. She and Thomas sat so close to each other that they had been required to learn a special rhythm to keep from bumping elbows. Waela had missed the right sequence of keys for the dive train three times running. \"Take a rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was accusation in his tone, but she sank back into the sheltered contours of her seat, thankful for any relief, thankful even for the crash-harness which supported her. Muscles did not have to do what the harness did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, Thomas\u0027 voice intruded on her consciousness. \"Once upon a time there was a fourteen-year-old girl. She lived on Earth, on a chicken farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lived on a chicken farm, Waela thought, then: He\u0027s talking about me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you\u0027ve pried into my records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fourteen-year-old girl on a chicken farm. His job! She thought about that girl she had been - child of emigrants, grubbers in the dirt. Technopeasants. Gaulish middle-class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke away from that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eN.... to be honest, she had to admit that she had run away. A sun going nova meant little to a fourteen-year-old girl, a girl whose body had become a woman\u0027s much earlier than her contemporaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran away to Ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had held such conversations with herself many times. Waela closed her eyes. It was as though two people occupied her consciousness. One of them she called \"Runaway,\" and the other, \"Honesty.\" Runaway had objected to Shipman life and railed against groundside dangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunaway asked, \"Why was I chosen for this damned risky life, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonesty replied, \"As I recall it, you volunteered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I must\u0027ve parked my brains somewhere. What in hell was I thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know about Hell?\" Honesty asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I have to know Hell before I can understand Paradise. Isn\u0027t that what the Ceepee says?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have it backwards, as usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know why I volunteered, dammit!\" The Runaway voice was edged with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yea - because he died. Ten years with him and then - poof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He died! That\u0027s all you have to say about it, \u0027He died.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else would there be to say?\" Honesty\u0027s voice was level, sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re as bad as the Ceepee, always answering with questions. What\u0027d Jim do to deserve that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He tested for limits and found them when he ran the P.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why doesn\u0027t Ship or the Ceepee ever talk about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About death?\" Honesty paused. \"What\u0027s there to talk about? Jim is dead and you\u0027re alive, and that\u0027s much more important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it? Sometimes I wonde.... I wonder what\u0027s going to happen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You live until you die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what\u0027s going to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonesty paused again, uncharacteristically, and said, \"You fight to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaela! Waela, wake up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Thomas\u0027 voice. She opened her eyes, tipped her head onto the seatback and looked at him. Light glittered from the plaza above him and there was the sound of workmen pounding metal out in the hangar. She noted that Thomas, too, looked tired but was fighting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was telling you a story about Earth,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s important to me. That fourteen-year-old girl had such dreams. Do you still have dreams about your life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer skin began a nervous glow. Does he read minds?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dreams?\" She closed her eyes and sighed. \"What do I need with dreams? I have my work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough?\" she laughed. \"That\u0027s not my worry. Ship is sending down my prince, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t blaspheme!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not blaspheming, you are.
