How mortifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to shout, curse, cry. Instead I ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first all I could think of was getting away, so I accelerated in the general direction of Cuba. However, when my skin began to heal the hole with the bullet still inside, I detoured to the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproaching from the rear, I sniffed the air and smelled nothing but trees, heard only the wind. Leaping onto the back porch, I imagined myself human and suddenly I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe talisman resided in the pocket of Jessie\u0027s pants back at the junkyard. Even though I didn\u0027t appear to need it anymore, I wanted the icon back. And I\u0027d get it, just as soon as I removed the irritating bullet from my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could get used to changing back and forth in the blink of an eye. The lack of pain and agony was a definite plus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking use of my suddenly opposable thumb, I turned the doorknob, slipped inside, then straight into the bathroom. The glare of the electric light made me flinch even before I saw myself in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirt streaked my face; my hair was full of leaves and twigs; fiery red scratches marred my arms. Twisting awkwardly, I tried to see my wound, but I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullet seemed to be scraping me from the inside out. What didn\u0027t kill me might just drive me mad. I was going to have to ask for help, and I hated that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the bathroom door, and yelped. Nic stood on the other side. One glance at my face and he cursed, then shoved his way into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snatched a towel off the rack and clutched it to my breasts. Stupid. He\u0027d already seen and touched everything already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell happened?\" Nic demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure where to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I woke up and you were gone. No note. Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic shoved his fingers through his hair, making it stand on end, reminding me of the coarse blond locks of our dream child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved the image out of my head. That child wasn\u0027t real, could never be real, and I had to remember that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic wore nothing but boxers. Too bad I didn\u0027t have time to admire his physique. Blood flowed down the back of my legs and dripped onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the - \"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic yanked the towel free and spun me around. I was so shocked, I let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who shot you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guy in the junkyard. The owner, or maybe the night watchman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it you were furry at the time,\" he murmured. \"Or he and I are going to have a discussion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over my shoulder and caught an expression of such violence cross his face I was shocked - and a little bit charmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could take care of myself - bullet in the butt notwithstanding - but it was kind of nice for once to have someone else want to look after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic saw me staring and schooled his face into the stoic mask I\u0027d come to loathe. \"You\u0027d better get in the bathtub. You\u0027re making a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea.\" I climbed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you doing at the junkyard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly I explained about the phone call, the Edsel, the watchman, and the ghostly wolves. When I was done, Nic stared at me without blinking. \"Ghost wolves. Are they something new?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never heard of them. But now I know why I saw wolf shadows at Lydia\u0027s and caught the scent of wolves when everyone else swears there aren\u0027t any. At least I\u0027m not nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just able to see, smell, and hear things no one else can,\" he said dryly. \"Do you think the disappearing bodies are related somehow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought for a minute, then shook my head. \"The ghost wolves didn\u0027t do much beyond bump against me and spread cold spots. I doubt they\u0027re killing people. Besides, Sheriff Stephenson was killed with a knife, then marked with a human bite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means we\u0027ve got two problems instead of one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the deal?\" He waved at my rear end. \"I thought werewolves could heal damn near anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can. Trouble is, I\u0027m healing faster than usual. You\u0027re going to have to dig that out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t argue. \"Got any medical instruments?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right. Compound go boom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning down, Nic peered at my left cheek. Funny how a little bullet and a lot of blood took care of any sexual interest in my nakedness. Or maybe discovering my true nature had already killed that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will left a few things,\" he said. \"Hold on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned a few minutes later with a small leather case. Inside were several lethal-looking blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Filleting knives.\" Nic began to root around in the medicine cabinet concealed behind the mirror over the sink. \"Will must like to fish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you searching for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alcohol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. \"As if I\u0027ll get an infection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humor me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemoving a clear bottle, he doused the smallest of the knives, then withdrew a tweezers from the cabinet and doused that, along with his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn around,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\" I didn\u0027t want to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic splashed my butt with alcohol, and I nearly jumped out of the tub. \"Hey! What did I say about infection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you promise I won\u0027t get furry if I accidentally cut myself with your blood all over me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you. The virus is only passed through saliva when I\u0027m in wolf form.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But things can change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. I had no idea what was happening to me. The virus could be mutating, and then everything I knew, or thought I knew, would be wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave it,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not lame. I won\u0027t cut myself. Besides, you\u0027ve got the handy-dandy antidote. If I get infected, you can cure me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I? I no longer had the formula, and it wasn\u0027t exactly simple enough to remember off the top of my head. None of them were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t heard from Edward since he\u0027d left town. I was starting to worry. If he were to disappear, along with everything I\u0027d invented, the world, as well as me, was in big-time trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic poked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold still or you\u0027ll have more holes than you already do.\" He punctuated his words with another jab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve almost got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the bathroom tile and waited for him to finish. Within three minutes, something pinged against the bathtub, then rolled toward the drain, coming to rest on top of the steel trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic picked up the bullet. \"Constantly amazes me that something this little can do so much damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his gaze and in his eyes I saw many things. Relief, anger, wariness, fear, and something else I couldn\u0027t quite place before he turned away, tossing the instruments into the sink and dousing them again with alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better take a shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was remote once more, and I had to wonder if I\u0027d seen or only imagined the softer emotions crossing his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned on the water. Even if Nic could get past my being a werewolf, there were so many other things about me he didn\u0027t know and never could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wound\u0027s already healed over,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t see the hole, and I didn\u0027t really want to. Yanking the shower curtain closed, I let the heated water wash the blood from my skin. If only it could wash the blood from my hands - or should I say paws?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mind if I stay while you explain what\u0027s going on?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suit yourself.\" I stuck my head under the spray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who called you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it was Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I wasn\u0027t so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he have your research?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not having it. That\u0027s bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea.\" I scrubbed soap into my hair, working the suds from my scalp all the way to the ends. \"Not only is the formula for the antidote gone, but so is the formula for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic yanked back the shower curtain. \"What happens, exactly, if you don\u0027t take your medicine? I thought you were different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\" I pulled on the plastic. \"You mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled but drew the curtain across the rod with a shriek of metal rings, and I began to rinse my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Werewolves can\u0027t help but change under the full moon,\" I explained. \"There\u0027s no resisting its pull. I\u0027ve tried to cure the transformation, but I\u0027ve never been able to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So if you have to change, how are you different?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was never possessed by evil - what we call the \u0027demon.\u0027 Killing people sickened me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic had never been dumb. He heard what I wasn\u0027t saying. \"You never liked to kill, but you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first time, the transformation is frightening, maddening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power is exhilarating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words whispered through my brain. Was that my thought or someone else\u0027s?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone else\u0027s ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have lost too much blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hunger,\" I whispered. \"I can\u0027t describe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agony in my belly, the pounding of my pulse, the shrieking in my head. Despite the steamy heat surrounding me, I shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll do anything to make the torment stop. Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence from the other side of the curtain spoke louder than words. Nic was wondering why I hadn\u0027t eaten a silver bullet rather than a person. I\u0027d wondered that myself. At least he didn\u0027t ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If a werewolf doesn\u0027t partake of human blood on the night of the full moon, what happens? He dies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No such luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it were that easy, Edward could just lock up all the werewolves and forget about the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only silver ends a lycanthrope\u0027s existence. Or being killed by another werewolf. However, that\u0027s rare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d found it bizarre that a lycanthrope would murder a human, yet balk at killing another werewolf, but no one ever said they were logical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is it rare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a fail-safe, for want of a better term. Maybe a taboo, I guess, against killing our own kind. My personal theory is that the fail-safe is part of the demon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which you don\u0027t have,\" Nic said slowly. \"And neither does Damien.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien\u0027s curse had taken away not only his demon but any lingering concern about the werewolf rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d also discovered that killing other werewolves took the edge off that pesky need for human sustenance. Convenient for him, since he hadn\u0027t had access to my serum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about that Weendigo you and Lydia were discussing? The Great Cannibal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve known one - Hector Menendez. He was demon personified, and he had no problem killing werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which screws up your personal theory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d thought a lot about Hector. Probably too much in the dark of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since Hector had no problem breaking human taboos - \" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eating people when he was still a people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he was a werewolf cannibal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With Hector we got a twofer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cannibal in both forms,\" Nic murmured, \"so all of his fail-safes were broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d always enjoyed talking with Nic. He was so quick and bright, he\u0027d often finish my thoughts before they came out of my mouth. That hadn\u0027t changed, even though almost everything else had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my theory,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Hector\u0027s a little too dead to ask about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With regular werewolves, those with the demon and no access to your serum, what happens under the full moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The madness takes over, if they don\u0027t shift voluntarily, they\u0027ll do so automatically.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and let the water beat down on my face, but nothing could make those memories go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic remained silent for several minutes. When he spoke again, I understood why. \"Mandenauer told me you experienced your first transformation at Stanford. But why then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell. Trust Edward to tell Nic just enough to make him curious and not enough to make him stop questioning me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut off the shower, then wrapped myself in a towel before opening the curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic leaned against the sink, arms crossed over his bare chest. His biceps bulged; his stomach was hard and flat, his legs long, muscled, and lightly covered with hair. I remembered what his hands felt like, what his skin tasted like. I forced myself to walk away, but Nic followed me into my bedroom and brought with him his questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it the moon? Your age? A spell?\" He made a disgusted sound. \"A spell. I never thought I\u0027d hear myself ask that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved to the window, pushed the curtain aside, and let the silver soothe me. Funny, the icy glow that beat down from the sky, to me as strong as the sun in the middle of July, used to upset me. Now I was drawn to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\" I asked. \"There\u0027s no going back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic came up behind me, and I caught the scent of his hair, felt the heat pulsing off him like steam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" he insisted. \"I deserve to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did, although I didn\u0027t want to be the one to tell him. Too bad I was the only one here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love,\" I said. \"Love changed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure what else to say, so I hesitated. He lost his patience, not that he had much to begin with, and grabbed me by the shoulders, spinning me around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" he ordered through gritted teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I spat, through teeth just as tight. \"Dopamine rushing through the brain, adrenaline making the heart pound, phenylethylamine creating the feeling of bliss, oxytocin bringing about sexual arousal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy tone was clinical.
