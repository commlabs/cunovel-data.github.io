EBENEZER GRAHAM\u0027S GRIEF.","content":"\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much have you lost by your son, Mr. Graham?” asked George Melville.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nearly two hundred and fifty dollars,” groaned Ebenezer, “counting what I paid in the city to his creditors, it is terrible, terrible!” and he wrung his hands in his bitterness of spirit.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am sorry for you,” said Melville, “and still more for him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why should you be sorry for him?” demanded Ebenezer, sharply. “He hasn\u0027t lost anything.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is it nothing to lose his consciousness of integrity, to leave his home knowing that he is a thief?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Little he\u0027ll care for that!” said Mr. Graham, shrugging his shoulders. “He\u0027s laughing in his sleeve, most likely, at the way he has duped and cheated me, his father.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How old is Eben, Mr. Graham?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He will be twenty in November,” answered Ebenezer, apparently puzzled by the question.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then, as he is so young, let us hope that he may see the error of his ways, and repent.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That won\u0027t bring me back my money,” objected Ebenezer, querulously. It was clear that he thought more of the money he had lost than of his son\u0027s lack of principle.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, it will not give you back your money, but it may give you back a son purified and prepared to take an honorable position in society.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, no; he\u0027s bad, bad!” said the stricken father. “What did he care for the labor and toil it took to save up that money?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope the loss of the money will not distress you, Mr. Graham.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, no, not exactly,” said Ebenezer, hesitating. “I shall have to take some money from the savings bank to make up what that graceless boy has stolen.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was clear that Ebenezer Graham would not have to go to the poorhouse in consequence of his losses.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can hardly offer you consolation,” said George Melville, “but I suspect that you will not be called upon to pay any more money for your son.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t mean to!” said Ebenezer, grimly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Going away as he has done, he will find it necessary to support himself, and will hardly have courage to send to you for assistance.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let him try it!” said Ebenezer, his eyes snapping.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He may, therefore, being thrown upon his own resources, be compelled to work hard, and that will probably be the best thing that can happen to him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope he will! I hope he will!” said the storekeeper. “He may find out after a while that he had an easy time at home, and was better paid than he will be among strangers. I won\u0027t pay any more of his debts. I\u0027ll publish a notice saying that I have given him his time, and won\u0027t pay any more debts of his contracting. He might run into debt enough to ruin me, between now and the time he becomes of age.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n George Melville considered that the storekeeper was justified in taking this step, and said so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While they were on the train, Ebenezer got measurably reconciled to his loss, and his busy brain began to calculate how much money he would save by ceasing to be responsible for Eben\u0027s expenses of living and prospective debts. Without this drawback, he knew he would grow richer every year. He knew also that notwithstanding the sum it had just cost him, he would be better off at the end of the year than the beginning, and to a man of his character this was perhaps the best form of consolation that he could have.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Suddenly it occurred to Mr. Graham that he should need a clerk in place of his son.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now that Eben has gone, Herbert,” he said, “I am ready to take you back.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was a surprise, for Herbert had not thought of the effect upon his own business prospects.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have got a place, thank you, Mr. Graham,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don\u0027t call trampin\u0027 round huntin\u0027 and fishin\u0027 work, do you?” said Ebenezer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is very agreeable work, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But it stands to reason that you can\u0027t earn much that way. I wouldn\u0027t give you twenty-five cents a week for such doings.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Are you willing to pay me more than Mr. Melville does?” asked Herbert, demurely, smiling to himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much does he pay you now?” asked Ebenezer, cautiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Six dollars a week.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Six dollars a week!” repeated the storekeeper, in incredulous amazement. “Sho! you\u0027re joking!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You can ask Mr. Melville, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ebenezer regarded George Melville with an inquiring look.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, I pay Herbert six dollars a week,” said he, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, I never!” ejaculated Ebenezer. “That\u0027s the strangest thing I ever heard. How in the name of conscience can a boy earn so much money trampin\u0027 round?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps it would not be worth as much to anyone else,” said Melville, “but Herbert suits me, and I need cheerful company.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to keep him long at that figger, be you, Mr. Melville?” asked Mr. Graham, bluntly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think we shall be together a considerable time, Mr. Graham. If, however, you should be willing to pay Herbert a larger salary, I might feel it only just to release him from his engagement to me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Me pay more\u0027n six dollars a week!” gasped Ebenezer. “I ain\u0027t quite crazy. Why, it would take about all I get from the post office.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You wouldn\u0027t expect me to take less than I can earn elsewhere, Mr. Graham,” said Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No-o!” answered the storekeeper, slowly. He was evidently nonplused by the absolute necessity of getting another clerk, and his inability to think of a suitable person.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If Tom Tripp was with me, I might work him into the business,” said Ebenezer, thoughtfully, “but he\u0027s bound out to a farmer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n An inspiration came to Herbert. He knew that his mother would be glad to earn something, and there was little else to do in Wayneboro.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think,” he said, “you might make an arrangement with my mother, to make up and sort the mail, for a time, at least.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, so I could; I didn\u0027t think of that,” answered Ebenezer, relieved. “Do you think she\u0027d come over to-morrow mornin\u0027?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If she can\u0027t, I will,” said Herbert. “I don\u0027t meet Mr. Melville till nine o\u0027clock.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So do! I\u0027ll expect you. I guess I\u0027ll come over and see your mother this evenin\u0027, and see if I can\u0027t come to some arrangement with her.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It may be added that Mr. Graham did as proposed, and Mrs. Carr agreed to render him the assistance he needed for three dollars a week. It required only her mornings, and a couple of hours at the close of the afternoon, and she was very glad to convert so much time into money.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It makes me feel more independent,” she said. “I don\u0027t want to feel that you do all the work, Herbert, and maintain the family single-handed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The same evening Herbert broached the plan of traveling with Mr. Melville. As might have been expected, his mother was at first startled, and disposed to object, but Herbert set before her the advantages, both to himself and the family, and touched upon the young man\u0027s need of a companion so skillfully and eloquently that she was at last brought to regard the proposal favorably. She felt that George Melville was one to whom she could safely trust her only boy. Moreover, her own time would be partly occupied, owing to the arrangement she had just made to assist in the post office, so that Herbert carried his point.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The tenth of October arrived, the date which George Melville had fixed upon for his departure. Mrs. Carr had put Herbert\u0027s wardrobe in order, and he had bought himself a capacious carpetbag and an umbrella, and looked forward with eagerness to the day on which their journey was to commence. He had long thought and dreamed of the West, its plains and cities, but had never supposed that it would be his privilege to make acquaintance with them, at any rate, until he should have become twice his present age. But the unexpected had happened, and on Monday he and George Melville were to start for Chicago.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2962/81523.html","bookId":427,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:03:27 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:03:27 AM"}
