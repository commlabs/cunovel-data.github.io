Lovely gee was transparent to hard gravity, and thus when the two acted upon matter together it was with the simple arithmetic of vector addition. Lovely gravity was superbly easy to control; a single source could be split by quasi-lensing generators into whirling rivulets of force that pulled and pushed their separate ways like stray eddies of air around a tornado. A carefully programmed lovely generator could make a seemingly strewn pack of playing cards \"fall\" together into a neat stack. A stronger burst could tear a human to pieces in a second as if some invisible demon had whirled through the room, but leave the organs arranged by increments of mass on a nearby table. Unfortunately, a few million megawatts of power were necessary for any such display. Lovely gee was costly gee. Only imperial pleasure craft, a few microscopic industrial applications, and the most exotic of military weapons used lovely generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zai sat speechless in the lovely black car, his heartbeat present in one temple, he was blind to the passing wonders of the capital. The car flew with an effortless grace between huge buildings, but he felt no inertia, no discomfort from the craft\u0027s banks or rolls. It was as if the world were turning below, and the marvelous car motionless. Zai tried to do some hasty calculations in his head, estimating the total mass of the car, himself, the corporal. It was staggering. The power consumed during this short ride would have been sufficient for the first fifty years of human industrialization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the medal, the promotion, or even the guarantee of immortality, Zai realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis moment was his true reward for his heroism: a ride on the heady surf of literal and absolute Imperial power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant-Commander Zai was somewhat dazed when he reached the palace. His car lifted silently above the snarl of arriving limos and jumped the high diamond walls with a flourish, rolling over so that its transparent canopy filled with a breathtaking view of the Emperor\u0027s grounds. Of course, Zai experienced only a hint of vertigo, his inner ear in the precise and featherlight grip of lovely gravitons. There was no down or up in their embrace; Zai felt as if some giant deity had grasped the fountains and pleasure gardens to twirl them overhead for his amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car descended, and he stepped from it filled with a regret suddenly remembered from childhood, the sad and foiled feeling that this carnival ride was over, that his feet were on solid, predictible ground again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lovely car,\" came the voice of Captain Marcus Fentu Masrui.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" Zai answered with a mumble, still overwhelmed, barely managing to salute his old commander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two watched silently as the vehicle was grasped by conventional transports, carried away to be cowled and caged like some exotic, captive bird of prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome to the palace, Lieutenant-Commander,\" Masrui said. With an outstretched arm, he gently pulled Zai\u0027s eyes away from the car and toward the diamond edifice before them. Its shape was familiar to any of the Emperor\u0027s subjects, especially one Vadan-born, but from this close it seemed monstrously distorted. Laurent Zai was used to seeing the palace rendered in the scale of votive paintings, with the sun playing on its shiny surfaces. Now it was black and looming, darker than the starless night that it threatened to crowd from the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Power has an extraordinary glare, doesn\u0027t it,\" Masrui observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain was looking up, but Zai still wondered whether he meant the palace or the gravity car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After my elevation,\" Masrui continued, \"I took that ride. And it finally dawned on me why I\u0027d spent all those years learning physics at academy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai smiled. Masrui was famous for his doggedness. He had failed the Academy\u0027s minimal physical science class for three years running, almost exhausting the dispensations that his genius in other areas had afforded him before finally obtaining a commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the better to command my ship, of course. A ship is men and women, after all; AIs have done the math for millennia. But I needed to understand physics, if for no other reason, then to understand fully that one Imperial gesture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai looked into his commanding officer\u0027s eyes. He wondered for a moment if the man, as usual, were being cynical. But the buoyant memory of riding in the craft convinced him that even Masrui might be sentimental about those minutes of flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked up the broad stairs together. The sounds of the party flowed out between columns and heroic statues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange, sir, to have looked down on worlds, and still be amazed by a ... mere flying machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes you realize, Zai, that you\u0027ve never properly flown. We\u0027ve been in aircraft and dropships, free fall and lifter belts, but the body always fights it at some level. Even the excitement comes from adrenaline, from some animal panic that things aren\u0027t right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s right in that car, sir. Isn\u0027t it?\" Zai said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Flight as effortless and natural as a bird\u0027s. Or a god\u0027s. Did we join the Navy for service and immortality, I wonder? Or for something more akin to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain trailed off. A group of officers was approaching. Zai felt the subject disappear between him and his old friend, the words pulled back from the air and hidden somewhere like the conspiracies of mutineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hero!\" one of the officers said too loudly. She was Captain Rencer Fowler IX, whom Zai, if the rumors were true, would soon displace as the youngest starship commander in the fleet. Zai saw Fowler\u0027s eyes sweep across his medaled chest, and felt briefly naked again in the covering of clever ants. The others looked comfortable in their dress uniforms, the particulate nature of the garments completely disguised. Zai knew his ants were no more obvious than theirs. He determined not to think of the uniform again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only a humble servant of Empire,\" Masrui answered for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai and Masrui shook hands with the men among the officers, and touched closed fists with the women. Zai\u0027s head began to spin a bit with the surfeit of ritual greetings and realized how convenient the usual salute was. But this was a dress occasion, forms had to be followed, and the pattern of bare wrists as gloved hands flexed and touched seemed to hold meaning, like animals flashing signals of bare-toothed dominance at each other. The glint of Zai\u0027s metal wrist caught starlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went into the palace hall together, and a crescendo of voices echoing from stone rose up around them like a sudden rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaces turned toward Zai as the group moved across the great black floor. The hero of Dhantu, or as the gutter media called him: the Broken Man. He realized that the group of officers, arrayed casually around him, had done him a kindness, forming a shield between him and the stares of the crowd. He wondered if Masrui had planned their meeting on the steps. They moved slowly, to nowhere in particular, his entourage hailing familiar faces and pulling them into the group, or fending off interlopers with a deflecting touch of greeting. One of them cadged a tray full of drinks and passed it round the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai drifted along like a child in his parents\u0027 tow. The great hall was crowded. The lucent dress uniforms of Navy personnel were mixed with the absolute black of the Political Apparatus. There were civilians dressed in formal bloodred or the white of the Senate, guildfolk in colored patterns he couldn\u0027t begin to read. The high, fluted columns that climbed to the vaulted ceiling channeled this mass of people into swirling eddies. After a few minutes of this promenade, Zai realized what would have been instantly obvious to an observer in the upper reaches of the hall: everyone was walking in circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler\u0027s voice came from his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s immortality, Lieutenant-Commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler, despite her meteoric early career, had not been elevated yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear it\u0027s not much different for the first hundred years,\" Zai answered. \"Certainly, the first week isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler laughed. \"Not missing the specter of death yet, are you? Well, I guess you saw enough of that on Dhantu.\" A chill crawled up Zai\u0027s spine at the word. Of course, the planet that had seen his art of heroism--if that\u0027s what it could be called--was implicit everywhere tonight. But only Fowler would be graceless enough to mention its name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough for a few centuries, I suppose,\" Zai answered. He felt movement on one flank. It was the ants, reorganizing themselves for some vital bit of tailoring. They would pick this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Zai realized their purpose: a trickle of sweat had appeared under his real arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFowler\u0027s face was close in the pressing crowd. \"Well, the Rix are playing rough again, my connections on the frontier are saying. We may need heroes on that side of the Empire soon. They say you\u0027ll be promoted soon. Maybe get your own ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai felt overheated. The sense of a nakedness had disappeared in the close air of the crowded room, as if the ants were linking ever more tightly, closing their ranks against Fowler\u0027s rudeness. Could they detect the woman\u0027s hostility and react to it as they did to light? Zai wondered. The little elements writhed in a column down and around Zai\u0027s side, carrying his suddenly prodigious sweat to the small of his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the specter of death always joins heroes at the front,\" Fowler added. \"Perhaps you\u0027ll become acquainted again.\" The woman\u0027s false camaraderie was growing thinner by the word. Zai looked around for Masrui. Was he among friends here, really?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught the eye of a young woman by the nearest column. She returned his glance with a smile and the slightest bow of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s quite pretty,\" Zai said, interrupting whatever Fowler was saying. That basic touchstone of desire had its desired effect, and Fowler immediately turned to follow the path of Zai\u0027s gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back with an undisguised sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you picked the wrong woman, Zai. She\u0027s as pink as they come. And perhaps a bit beyond your rank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai looked again and cursed his haste. Fowler was right. The sleeves of her white robe were hatched with the mark of a Senator-Elect. She seemed terribly young for that; even in an age of cosmetic surgery, a certain gravitas was expected of members of the Senate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai tried not to show his embarrassment. \"Pink, you said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anti-imperial,\" Fowler supplied, speaking slowly as though to a child. \"The opposite of gray. A brave defender of the living. That\u0027s Nara Oxham, the mad senator-elect from Vasthold. She\u0027s rejected elevation, for heaven\u0027s sake. By choice, she\u0027ll rot in the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mad Senator,\" Zai murmured. He\u0027d read that moniker in the same garbage media that had dubbed him the Broken Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman smiled again, and Zai realized he\u0027d been staring. He raised his glass to her and looked sheepishly away. Of course Zai knew what pink meant. But his native Vadan was as politically gray as any planet in the Empire. The dead were worshiped there, everyone claiming a risen ancestor as his or her personal intermediary with the Emperor. And of course the Navy was gray from admirals to marines. Lieutenant-Commander Zai wasn\u0027t sure if he\u0027d met a pink in his entire life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mind you, I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll accept the elevation when she\u0027s a bit closer to death,\" Fowler said. \"Just as long as she doesn\u0027t have an accident in the meantime. Wouldn\u0027t that be a pity, losing eternity for one\u0027s principles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or one\u0027s arrogance,\" Zai added, hoping Fowler would suspect whom he really meant. \"Perhaps she just needs a talking-to.\" He pushed past Fowler, feeling the woman\u0027s skin against his own as their ants briefly conjoined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For heaven\u0027s sake, Zai, she\u0027s a senator,\" Fowler hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai turned briefly toward his adversary and spoke calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And tonight I am a hero,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSENATOR-ELECT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNara Oxham\u0027s eyes widened as Lieutenant-Commander Laurent Zai pushed his way out and headed toward her. The purpose on his face was unmistakable. He gripped his champagne glass with all five fingers, as if it were a club, and his eyes locked hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of officers had surrounded him since his arrival, cutting him off from the rest of the party in a display of protectiveness, and perhaps pride that one of theirs had been elevated so young. The handlers in Nara Oxham\u0027s secondary audio listed names and academy years as she moved an eyemouse across their faces. All were older than Zai. Senator-Elect Oxham suspected that their claim on him was newly minted; the hero of Dhantu would make a fine addition to their clique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, though, Zai had moved to extract himself from their attentions. The young lieutenant-commander almost stumbled as he left them behind, as if pulling his feet from some invisible tangleweed on the marble floor. Nara Oxham fingered her apathy wristband ruefully. She would love to feel what was going on in Zai\u0027s mind, but the party was too crowded to dare a lower dosage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOxham\u0027s entourage parted slightly to admit the young officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the senator\u0027s empathic powers were currently suppressed, for most of her life she\u0027d been able to compare facial expressions with what her extra sense told her. Even with the wristband at full strength, she was extraordinarily perceptive. When Lieutenant-Commander Zai stood before her, she could see that he didn\u0027t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVadan greeting, she subvocalized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive appropriate salutations appeared in synesthesia, but in a flash of instinct, Nara ignored them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t look very happy, Lieutenant-Commander Zai.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over his shoulder at his friends. Turned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not used to crowds, ma\u0027am\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNara smiled at the honorific. He must be without a handler to have used ma\u0027am instead of excellency. How did the Navy ever win wars, she wondered, when they couldn\u0027t manage a cocktail party?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand here by the column,\" she said. She held her glass up to the light. \"There\u0027s a certain security in having one\u0027s back covered, don\u0027t you think, Lieutenant-Commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sound military thinking, Senator-Elect,\" he answered, finally smiling back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo at least he knew her rank. But her politics?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These columns are stronger than they look,\" she said. \"Each is a single diamond, grown in an orbital carbon whisketter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes arched up, no doubt considering their mass. Making huge diamonds was easy in orbit. But getting an object that big down the gravity well safely--now that was a feat of engineering. Oxham held her glass of champagne up to the light. \"Have you noticed, Lieutenant-Commander, that the shape of the glasses matches the column\u0027s fluting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at his own glass. \"No, Excellency, I hadn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcellency, now. The officer\u0027s etiquette training was kicking in. Did that mean she had made him comfortable enough to remember his manners? Or was he feeling her rank?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I suppose I personify the analogy,\" he continued. \"I had begun to feel rather like a bubble floating aimlessly. Thank you for offering a safe haven, Senator-Elect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of one eye, Oxham had watched the rest of the officers in Zai\u0027s group. With a glance here, a hand on a shoulder there, they were spreading the news of Zai\u0027s defection. Now, an older man of captain\u0027s rank was watching. Was he headed over to rescue the young lieutenant-commander from the Mad Senator?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Marcus Fentu Masrui, Elevated, Oxham\u0027s handlers informed her. Nonpolitical as far as we know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNara raised an eyebrow. Nothing human was nonpolitical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure how much of a haven you\u0027ve found, Lieutenant-Commander.\" She let her attention over Zai\u0027s shoulder become obvious. \"Your friends seem disturbed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai glanced down at one of his shoulders, as if arresting a turn of his head back toward the officers. Then his eyes met hers again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure about that, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They certainly look upset.\" Captain Masrui was still hovering nearby, unwilling to plunge in after Zai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, of that I\u0027m positive,\" Zai said. \"But whether they are my friends or not...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, but was not entirely joking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Success brings a certain amount of false friendship,\" Oxham said. \"At least, speaking from my own perspective, political success does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No doubt, Senator. And, in a way, I suppose my own celebrity does have a political aspect to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOxham narrowed her eyes. She knew very little about Laurent Zai, but her preparty briefing had stated that he was in no way a political officer. He had never enjoyed assignment to staff or a procurement committee, nor did he publish military scholarship. He came from a long line of illustrious Navy men, but had never used his name to escape field duty. The Zais had all been warriors, at least on the male side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey joined the Navy, fought for the crown, and died. Then they took their well-earned immortality and disappeared into the gray enclaves of Vada. What did the dead Zais do then? Oxham wondered. Painted those dire black Vadan paintings, probably, went on endless pilgrimages, and learned appropriately dead languages to read the ancient books of the war sages in the original. A grim, infinite life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurent Zai\u0027s doubts were interesting, though. Here he was, about to be honored by his living god, and he worried that his elevation had been tainted by politics. Perhaps he wondered whether surviving an awful captivity was enough to warrant a medal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the Emperor\u0027s commendation is justly deserved, Lieutenant-Commander Zai,\" she said. \"After what you\u0027ve been through--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one has any idea what I\u0027ve been through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOxham stopped short. Despite his rude words, the man\u0027s calm exterior hadn\u0027t changed in any way. He was simply stating a fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"However painful,\" the man continued, \"having simply suffered for the Emperor is not enough to warrant all this.\" A small sweep of his hand indicated the party, the palace, immortality. Oxham nodded. In a way, Laurent Zai was an accidental hero. He had been captured through no error of his own, and imprisoned without any hope of escape. Finally, he had been rescued by the application of overwhelming force. In one sense, he had done nothing himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still, to have survived Dhantu at all was extraordinary. The rest of the prisoners that the rescue had found were dead, beyond even the symbiant. Simply suffered, Zai had said. A ghastly understatement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant-Commander, I didn\u0027t mean to suggest that I could understand your experience,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve seen depths no one else has. But you did so in the Emperor\u0027s service. He has to do something. Certain things must be ... recognized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai smiled sadly at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was rather hoping to hear an argument from you, Senator. But perhaps you don\u0027t want to be impolitic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An argument? Because I\u0027m pink? Let me be impolitic, then. The Imperial presence on Dhantu is criminal. They\u0027ve suffered for generations, and I\u0027m not surprised that the most extreme Dhanti have become inhuman--which does not excuse torture. Nothing can. But some things are beyond being excused or explained, beyond logic or even blame. Things that start from simple power struggles--from politics, if you will--but ultimately dredge the depths of the human soul. Timeless, monstrous things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man blinked, and Nara took a drink to slow her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Armed occupation seldom pays dividends for anyone,\" she said. \"But the Empire rewards who it can. You survived, Zai. So you should accept the Emperor\u0027s medal, elevation, and the starship command they\u0027ll no doubt give you. It\u0027s something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZai seem surprised, but not offended. He nodded his head slightly, eyes narrowing as if thinking through her points. Was he mocking her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sarcasm didn\u0027t seem to be in the man. Perhaps these were simply new ideas for him. His entire life had been spent among the grayest of the gray. Oxham wondered if he\u0027d ever heard the \"Dhantu Liberation\" called an occupation before. Or ever heard anyone seriously question the will of the Risen Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis next question confirmed his naivet .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Senator, is it true you have rejected elevation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true. That\u0027s what Secularists do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard that they often rescind in the end, though. There\u0027s always the possibility of a deathbed conversion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOxham shook her head. The persistence of this piece of propaganda was amazing. It showed how easily the truth was manipulated. It showed how threatened grays were by the Vow of Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a story that the Political Apparatus likes to perpetuate,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But of almost five hundred Secularist senators elected over the last thousand years, only seventeen have accepted elevation in the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventeen broke their vows?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor moment, she nodded her head in triumph. Then she realized that Zai was not impressed. He seemed to think that few percent damningly high. For gray Laurent Zai, a vow was a vow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But to answer your question,\" she finished. \"Yes, I will die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out, placed one hand lightly on her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he asked with genuine concern. \"For politics?\" \"No. For progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head in incomprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNara Oxham sighed internally. She had debated this point in street encounters, in public houses and the Vasthold Diet floor, on live media feeds with planetary audiences. She had written slogans and speeches and essays on this issue. And before her was Laurent Zai, a man who had probably never experienced a real political debate in his entire life. It was too easy, in a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had asked for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you heard of the geocentric theory, Lieutenant-Commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Excellency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On Earth Prime, a few centuries before spaceflight, it was widely believed that the sun went around the planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must have thought Earth Prime to be very massive,\" Zai said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way, yes. They thought the entire universe went around their world. On a daily basis, mind you. They had severe scaling problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Observational data mounted against the geocentric theory for a long time. New models were created, sun-centered models that were far more elegant and logical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would think so. I can\u0027t imagine what the math for a planet-centric theory would have looked like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was hideously complex and convoluted. Looking at it now, it\u0027s obviously a retrofit to uphold the superstitions of an earlier era. But something rather odd happened when the sun-centered theory, with all its elegance and clarity, was devised.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-risen-empire-succession-1/page-4.html","bookId":1752,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:36 AM"}
