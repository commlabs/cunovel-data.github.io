{"id":63275,"no":63,"title":"Page 63","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Got a job?\" I asked after he\u0027d hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. A model showed up for a night shoot so trashed he\u0027s worthless.\" He studied me. \"You wanna come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched my legs out on the couch. \"Nope. I\u0027m good right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure you\u0027re okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I need is mindless entertainment. Just the thought of getting dressed again exhausts me.\" I\u0027d be happy wearing my flannel pajama bottoms and holey old tank top all weekend. As much as I hurt inside, total comfort outside seemed like a necessity. \"Don\u0027t worry about me. I know I\u0027ve been a mess lately, but I\u0027ll get it together. Go on and enjoy yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Cary rushed out, I paused the movie and went to the kitchen for some wine. I stopped by the breakfast bar, my fingertips gliding over the roses Gideon had sent me the previous weekend. Petals fell to the countertop like tears. I thought about cutting the stems and using the flower food packet that came with the bouquet, but it was pointless hanging on to them. I\u0027d throw the arrangement away tomorrow, the last reminder of my equally doomed relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d gotten farther with Gideon in one week than I had with other relationships that lasted two years. I would always love him for that. Maybe I\u0027d always love him, period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one day, that might not hurt so badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rise and shine, sleepyhead,\" Cary singsonged as he yanked the comforter off of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh. Go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got five minutes to get your ass up and in the shower, or the shower\u0027s coming to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening one eye, I peeked at him. He was shirtless and wearing baggy pants that barely clung to his hips. As far as wake-up calls went, he was prime. \"Why do I have to get up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because when you\u0027re flat on your back you\u0027re not on your feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. That was deep, Cary Taylor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed his arms and shot me an arch look. \"We need to go shopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI buried my face in the pillow. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I seem to remember you saying this was a \u0027Sunday garden party\u0027 and \u0027rock star gathering\u0027 in the same sentence. What the hell do I wear to something like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, well. Good point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you wearing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...I don\u0027t know. I was leaning toward the \u0027English tea with hat\u0027 look, but now I\u0027m not so sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a brisk nod. \"Right. Let\u0027s hit the shops and find something sexy, classy, and cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowling a token protest, I rolled out of bed and padded over to the bathroom. It was impossible to shower without thinking of Gideon, without picturing his perfect body and remembering the desperate sounds he made when he came in my mouth. Everywhere I looked, Gideon was there. I\u0027d even started hallucinating black Bentley SUVs all around town. I thought I spotted one damn near everywhere I went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary and I had lunch; then we bounced all over the city, hitting the best of the Upper East Side thrift stores and Madison Avenue boutiques before taking a taxi downtown to SoHo. Along the way, Cary had two teenage girls ask for his autograph, which tickled me more than him, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Told you,\" he crowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Told me what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They recognized me from an entertainment news blog. One of the posts about you and Cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. \"Glad my love life is working out for someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was due at another job around three and I went with him, spending a few hours in the studio of a loud and brash photographer. Remembering it was Saturday, I slipped into a far corner and made my weekly call to my dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still happy in New York?\" he asked me above the background noise of dispatch talking over the radio in his cruiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So far so good.\" A lie, but the truth helped no one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis partner said something I didn\u0027t catch. My dad snorted and said, \"Hey, Chris insists he saw you on television the other day. Some cable channel, celebrity gossip thing. The guys won\u0027t leave me alone about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Tell them watching those shows is bad for their brain cells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re not dating one of the richest men in America?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. What about your love life?\" I asked, quickly diverting. \"Are you seeing anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing serious. Hang on.\" He responded to a call on the radio, then said, \"Sorry, sweetheart. I have to run. I love you. Miss you like crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss you, too, Daddy. Be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always. Bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI killed the call and went back to my former spot to wait for Cary to wrap things up. In the lull, my mind tormented me. Where was Gideon now? What was he doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould Monday bring me an inbox full of photos of him with another woman?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunday afternoon I borrowed Clancy and one of Stanton\u0027s town cars for the drive out to the Vidal estate in Dutchess County. Leaning back in the seat, I looked out the window, absently admiring the serene vista of rolling meadows and green woodlands that stretched to the distant horizon. I realized I was working on Day 4 After Gideon. The pain I\u0027d felt the first few days had turned into a dull throbbing that felt almost like the flu. Every part of my body ached, as if I was going through some sort of physical withdrawal and my throat burned with unshed tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you nervous?\" Cary asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at him. \"Not really. Gideon won\u0027t be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be going if I thought otherwise. I do have some pride you know.\" I watched him drum his fingers on the armrest between our two seats. For all the shopping we\u0027d done yesterday, he\u0027d made only one purchase: a black leather tie. I\u0027d teased him mercilessly about it, he of the perfect fashion sense going with something like that. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-63.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
