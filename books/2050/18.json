The ruler of Gooville came sliding out of the pink wall as if it had given birth to him. He extended his arms to hug her, but instead of returning his embrace, Amy held up a beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought you a beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, you know I don\u0027t really eat anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you might like a beer, for old times\u0027 sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hadn\u0027t seen you since I got back from Maui. I thought you\u0027d want to debrief me or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve talked to Nathan Quinn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be cute, Amy. I know what\u0027s going on between you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t have any choice, Colonel, I am cute. It\u0027s the burden I have to bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t know what you are, does he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink your beer, it\u0027s getting warm. Why do you keep it so steamy in here anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Colonel accepted the beer from her and took a long pull. When he came up for air, he stared at the beer bottle with a look of surprise, as if it had just spoken to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My, that\u0027s good. That\u0027s really good. I\u0027d forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy toasted him with her own bottle and took a drink. \"Colonel, we\u0027ve known each other a long time. You\u0027ve been like a father to me, but you are out of touch. I\u0027m worried about you. I think you need to come out of here occasionally, like you used to. Walk around. Have some interaction with the people in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t try to get in the way of what I\u0027m doing, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about? I\u0027m just worried about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Colonel looked at the beer bottle in his hand again, as if it had just been teleported there, then he looked back to Amy with a little panic in his eyes. \"Nate didn\u0027t tell you, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what? Nate doesn\u0027t have anything to do with this. You have lost touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Colonel nodded, then leaned back into the wall of Goo behind him. It cradled him and formed a chaise longue, which he sat down on as he rubbed his temples. \"Amy, did you ever do anything for a purpose greater than your own ambition? Did you ever feel a duty to something beyond yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, like persuading people that I\u0027m something that I\u0027m not to gain their trust so they could be kidnapped or killed in order to preserve my community? Yes, I have some concept of the idea of serving the greater good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you do. I guess you do. Forgive me. Perhaps I do spend too much time alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you leave me now? I do have to think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you want to be alone now? That\u0027s what you\u0027re saying? This is how you\u0027re going to address the problem of spending too much time alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go, Amy, and please don\u0027t interfere with Nate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, \u0027not yet\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a deposit on that bottle. I\u0027m not leaving without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, Nate, he\u0027s not a problem? You\u0027re sure?\" Here the Colonel forced a smile that looked much more like something menacing than an actual smile. \"Because I will tell him about you if I must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The greater good,\" Amy said, returning the forced smile with a real one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" said the Colonel, draining the last of his beer. \"Come back. And bring me another of these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it,\" Amy said. Then she took the bottle from him and left the chamber. Thin line between genius and full-blown batshit, she thought. Very thin line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor two weeks the Colonel didn\u0027t send for Nate. Cielle Nu\u0026amp;ntilde;ez had stopped by the third morning that Amy was at Nate\u0027s apartment. \"Well, you don\u0027t need me anymore,\" Cielle had said. \"I\u0027d just as soon get back to my ship anyway, although it doesn\u0027t look like we\u0027re going anywhere soon.\" Nate was disappointed that she hadn\u0027t been jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s afraid of the cupboards, the fridge, and the garbage disposal,\" Cielle told Amy, as if she were talking to the dog sitter. \"And you\u0027ll need to take him to get his clothes cleaned. You know he\u0027s going to be terrified of the washing machines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m right here,\" Nate said. \"And I\u0027m not afraid of the appliances. I\u0027m just cautious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother will be thrilled for you two, Amy. Her ship should be back at base soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she\u0027s not due in for another six weeks,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore. The Colonel\u0027s called all the ships back to base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of them? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCielle shrugged. \"He\u0027s the Colonel. Ours is not to question why. Well, Nate, it\u0027s been a pleasure, really. I\u0027ll probably see you around. You\u0027re in good hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged Nate quickly and started out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cielle, wait. I want to ask you something. If you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned. \"Ask away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did your husband\u0027s yacht sink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCielle raised an inquisitive eyebrow at Amy. \"It\u0027s okay,\" Amy said. \"He knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nineteen twenty-seven, Nate. In retrospect it was a blessing of sorts. He died doing what he liked doing, and two years later he would have been wiped out when the stock market crashed. I\u0027m not sure he would have survived that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be. Cal and I have a really good life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cal? Cal from the ship? You didn\u0027t tell me that\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my husband? The Colonel thought you might be more comfortable with a single woman to orient you. Women down here have never taken their husband\u0027s surname, Nate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Females run the show in a whale society,\" Amy explained. \"You know, as it should be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCielle Nu\u0026amp;ntilde;ez looked from Amy to Nate and smiled. \"Oh, Nate, what have you gotten yourself into?\" And then she snickered like a whaley boy and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wanted you,\" Amy said. \"She hides it really well, but I could tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom then on they went out together every morning. Nate insisted that Amy take him far into the catacombs during the day. There they found Gooville\u0027s underground farms: tunnels where grains of wheat grew right on the walls\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;no stalks\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;others where you could pick tomatoes from two-inch stems that seemed to grow directly out of rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does any of this ripen without photosynthesis?\" Nate asked, handling an apricot that was growing not on a tree but on a broad stem like a mushroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know,\" Amy shrugged. \"Geothermal heat. The Colonel says the Goo extends deep under the continent, where it draws heat from the earth. I\u0027ll show you the kitchens where they prepare most of the food\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it\u0027s all geothermal. The old-timers say that at first there was only seafood to eat, but over the years the Goo has provided more and different foods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are these? Chicken nuggets?\" He plucked one from the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA whaley boy working nearby whistled and clicked harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says not to pick them, they\u0027re not ripe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate tossed the nugget to the floor of the cave, where a softball-size multilegged thing scurried out of a hatch, retrieved it, and scurried back into its trapdoor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen enough here,\" Nate said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the afternoon they did errands and shopping, but still no one asked Nate for any form of payment, and he\u0027d stopped offering. In the evening they usually had dinner in his apartment. After they had shared two meals out at Gooville caf��s, Amy had insisted that they eat in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re studying them,\" she said, meaning the whaley boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No I\u0027m not. I\u0027m just looking at them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you kidding? You have that look, that researcher look, that lost-in-your-theories look. You think I don\u0027t know that look? I worked with you, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate shrugged. \"It\u0027s what I do. I study whales.\" He\u0027d been trying to learn the whaley boys\u0027 whistle-and-click language. Emily 7 had come by his apartment a couple of afternoons when Amy was away, and while he thought she might have come for amorous reasons, he managed to channel her energies into lessons on whaleyspeak. They\u0027d become friends of sorts. He hadn\u0027t mentioned the lessons to Amy, afraid that she might tease him about Emily the way the whale-ship crew had. \"I observe. I collect data and try to find meaning in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy nodded, thinking about it, then said, \"So if rescuing manatees and dolphins got you into the field, why didn\u0027t you do something more active to help the animals? Veterinary medicine or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always wonder. I\u0027ve thought about the people at Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd, putting themselves in harm\u0027s way, ramming whaling ships, running Zodiacs in front of harpoon guns to try to protect the animals. I\u0027ve wondered if that was the way to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you thought you could do more as a scientist, studying them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I thought that being a scientist was something that I could do. There\u0027s a path to becoming a biologist\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;an educational process. There isn\u0027t for being a pirate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re wrong, there is a school for that. I saw it on a matchbook when I was in Maui. I\u0027m sure it said you could learn to be a pirate if you passed a simple test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s learn to draw a pirate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. So you compromised?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I? I think what we\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what I do has value.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I. I\u0027m not saying that. I\u0027m just wondering, you know, now that you\u0027re dead, do you feel your life was wasted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not dead, Amy. Jeez, that\u0027s an awful thing to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, effectively dead, I mean. Your life being over. Jeepers, does that make me a necrophiliac? When we get out of here, maybe I\u0027ll have to go to a meeting or something. Do they have those?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, I\u0027m wondering if maybe I don\u0027t want to get out of here.\" He\u0027d been thinking about it a lot. Life here really wasn\u0027t bad, and since he\u0027d been looking for a way out on their daily excursions (only to be reminded that he\u0027d have to go through the miles of pressure locks only to emerge six hundred feet below the sea), maybe he and Amy could make a future together. The whole Gooville ecosystem would certainly keep him interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, my name\u0027s Amy, and I hump the dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, if I can talk the Colonel out of his plan, I can stay here with you. You know, adapt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine that they\u0027d get up at a meeting and say, \u0027Hi, my name\u0027s so-and-so, and I like to bone the dead. It\u0027s sort of crude. Although strangely appropriate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not listening to me, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes I am. We\u0027re not staying here. I\u0027ll find a way out, but we can\u0027t stay. You have to convince the Colonel not to try to hurt the Goo, but then we\u0027re leaving. As soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate was a little shocked at how adamant she was. She seemed to be staring at nothing, concentrating, thinking about something she didn\u0027t want to share, and she didn\u0027t seem happy about. But then she brightened. \"Hey, you\u0027re going to get to meet my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week later it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you always said that the jazz of what you do was knowing something that no one else in the world knows,\" Amy said. \"You jazzed?\" She took his arm and draped it around her neck as they walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had just left the Gooville apartment of Amelia Earhart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She looks good, doesn\u0027t she?\" Amy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia was a beautiful, gracious woman, and after sixty-seven years in Gooville, the aviatrix didn\u0027t look a day over fifty. She\u0027d been just under forty when she disappeared in 1937. In her presence Nate had felt as if he were fifteen again, out on his first date, stuttering and stumbling and blushing\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;blushing, for Christ\u0027s sake\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;when Amy mentioned that she\u0027d been spending nights at his place. Amelia made Nate sit next to her on the couch and took his hand as she spoke to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan, I hope what I\u0027m about to say to you doesn\u0027t sound racist, because it\u0027s not, but I want to put your mind at ease. I have had a very long time to get used to the idea of my daughter\u0027s being a sexually active adult, and, frankly, if after all these years you are the one that she has chosen to fall in love with, which appears to be the case, I can only tell you how relieved I am that you are of the human species. So please relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate had shot a look to Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Every girl has her adventurous period.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Nate said to Amelia Earhart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, out on the street, to Amy he said, \"I shouldn\u0027t have asked how the flight was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s still a little sensitive about that. Even after all these years. My dad was her navigator. He didn\u0027t survive the crash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said you were born in 1940. How could that be if your father died in 1937?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robust sperms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three years? That\u0027s really robust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe punched his arm. \"I was rounding up. Give me a break, Nate, I\u0027m old. You never grilled the Old Broad for accuracy like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t sleeping with the Old Broad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you wanted to, didn\u0027t you? Admit it? You were hot to get into her muumuu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop.\" Nate glanced at some whaley-boy males who were hanging out in front of the bakery (they always seemed to be there) doing a synchronized display wave with their willies, and he was about to defend himself with a comment about Amy\u0027s past, but then he decided that there was just no need to watch that little brain movie, let alone use it as some kind of weapon against what was essentially just Amy-style teasing\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;one of the things he found he adored about her as soon as he\u0027d allowed himself to admit that he could adore someone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whaley boys snickered at him as they passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys are all just big, squeaky bath toys,\" Nate said under his breath, knowing they could hear him anyway. Nate had been insulting them every time he and Amy went by for a week or so, just to irritate them. Maybe Amy was rubbing off on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whaley boys blew a collective sputtering raspberry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sentient? You guys can\u0027t even spell sentient,\" Nate whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the reward. He loved watching creatures with four digits try to flip him the middle finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027m the immature one,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife is good, Nate thought. For the first time in as long as he could remember, he was happy. Kinda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning a brace of whaley boys came to take him to the Colonel. Amy wasn\u0027t even there to kiss him good-bye. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fluke-or-i-know-why-the-winged-whale-sings/page-18.html","bookId":2050,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:48 PM"}
