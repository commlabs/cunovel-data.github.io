I saw what was going to happen, and I screamed a warning, but it was too late. All three of them tumbled to the floor with a metallic crash that echoed through the chamber. A sizzle of power zapped from the machine, then fizzled into orange sparks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I shouted, heedless of the firearm pushing into my back. \"Evaline!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly a loud noise filled the space. A blaring, blasting, screeching noise the likes of which I\u0027d never heard before, but the sound of which was a relief. My plan was working! If only it weren\u0027t too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsiris whirled as the Ankh\u0027s other servants bolted into action, confused at the distractions from every direction. As they spun around in panic, the second element of my plan was executed: a low, rolling boom! erupted from the fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn seconds, the chamber filled with heavy black smoke. I heard the sounds of footsteps and shouts, followed by a disembodied voice-\"You\u0027re surrounded! Stand where you are!\"-and knew that Dylan had fulfilled the third and final element of the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, good gad, Evaline! Was I too late? What had she done? How could she think I\u0027d appear without a plan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ducked away from Osiris and dashed through the thick fog toward Miss Stoker and the Sekhmet statue, terrified everything had happened too late and she was dead-crushed under the heavy weight or electrocuted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI coughed and then remembered to pull up the mask I had around my neck, covering my nose and mouth as I crawled along the floor. How much easier it was to do so in trousers than a bundle of skirts! I touched the base of the Sekhmet statue first, then my frantic hands encountered something soft and warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt moved, and as I attempted to wave away the smoke, I felt the statue shuddering and shifting against my leg with someone\u0027s effort to move it. I heard the sound of metallic clinks and clanks nearby. More shouts filled my ears, smoke stung my eyes, and I heard the sound of glass shattering. A rush of fresh air burst into the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop her!\" cried a voice I recognized. Evaline! Evaline was alive! She was a heap on the floor, a mass of clinking chains and struggling limbs, but she was alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Ankh was getting away! I bolted to my feet in time to see the slim, dark-clad figure stumbling toward the broken window. I stumbled after her, but tripped over something and fell hard on the ground. My palms landed on something sharp and painful. \"Stop her! Dylan! She\u0027s getting away!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of pounding footsteps and shouts-real ones this time, not from Dylan\u0027s useful device-came from the floor and stairs below. \"Stop! Scotland Yard commands you to halt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lurched toward the Ankh again. I wasn\u0027t about to let her get away. \"Oh, no, you don\u0027t-\" Someone or something slammed into me from behind, and I thwumped to the floor once more. My cut palms screamed as I struggled to remove myself from beneath the hindrance of something heavy, I watched the shape at the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ankh\u0027s slender figure shone against the opening, now jagged with glass in the drassy moonbeams. She looked at me from across the dim, smoky chamber, and I fancied our eyes met in acknowledgment and understanding. Then, outlined by the silvery light, she gave a condescending lift of her chin in my direction. Infuriated, I started toward her again. I couldn\u0027t let her get away. I had to find out who she was!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door burst open behind me with a flood of light. I recognized Luckworth\u0027s voice shouting orders. \"Stop! Halt! Scotland Yard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the window, the Ankh froze, an arrogant yet surprised silhouette. . . . I shouted, finally erupting unencumbered to my feet, but it was too late. My nemesis gave a flippant wave-a clear farewell-then tipped backward, tumbling out into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I charged toward the jagged black window. My foot caught on something, and I hurtled through the air. Screaming, I clawed at where the window should have been. Just before I crashed through into midair, two hands grabbed me from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flew up and back, and landed on the floor in an ignominious heap of gangly trousered limbs and sagging hair. I saw Dylan\u0027s relieved expression, then looked up into the furious face of Inspector Grayling. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-clockwork-scarab-stoker-holmes-1/page-16.html","bookId":1674,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:39 AM"}
