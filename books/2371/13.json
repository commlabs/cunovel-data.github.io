I sat in a large commercial plane filled with passengers, wearing my Air Corps uniform with shiny wings and getting continually airsick while all the passengers stared at me. I\u0027m convinced that if I had been allowed to fly combat, the war would have been shorter. But we would have lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived in New York, at the land of the Brill Building and the RKO Jefferson and Max Rich, and the memories that flooded in seemed to belong to another world, another time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen Roberts was at the airport to greet me with a big hug. On the way to the hotel, Ben brought me up-to-date on his activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m stationed at Fort Dix,\" he said, \"writing war training films. You can\u0027t believe what they\u0027re like. In one film we spend ten minutes showing recruits how to raise the hood of a car. It\u0027s like writing for five-year-olds. How long are you going to be in New York?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"It could be an hour, it could be a week. I think it\u0027s going to be closer to an hour.\" I explained my situation to him. \"I\u0027m waiting for a call to report back to the Air Corps, and it could come at any minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the hotel where I had reservations, and I went to the desk. \"I\u0027m expecting a very important long-distance phone call,\" I told the clerk. \"Very important. Please make sure I get it immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen and I made a date for dinner the following night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, I telephoned my agent, Louis Schur, in California. I told him that I was in New York and had free time until the secondary flying school opened up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you go to the office,\" he suggested, \"and see my partner, Jules Zeigler? He might have something for you to do while you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJules Zeigler, head of the New York office, turned out to be a swarthy man in his forties, with a quick, nervous energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louie told me you\u0027d be coming,\" he said. \"Are you looking for a project to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something interesting. Have you ever heard of Jan Kiepura?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Is that some holiday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jan Kiepura is a big opera star in Europe. So is his wife, Marta Eggerth. They\u0027ve made a lot of movies over there. They want to do a show on Broadway, The Merry Widow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Merry Widow, a famous operetta by Franz Lehar, was the story of a prince from a small kingdom who courts a wealthy widow to keep her money in his country. It was always playing somewhere around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want someone to update the book. Are you interested in meeting them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the point? I was not going to be in New York long enough to write a letter, let alone a Broadway show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that I can - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, at least go meet with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Jan Kiepura and Marta Eggerth in their suite at the Astor Hotel. When Kiepura opened the door for me, he looked at my uniform and said, puzzled, \"Are you the writer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJan was a powerfully built man in his forties, with a heavy Hungarian accent. Marta was slim and attractive, with wavy shoulder-length hair, and a welcoming smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" Kiepura said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want to do The Merry Widow, but we want it to be modernized. Jules says you\u0027re a good writer. What have you written?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fly-By-Night, South of Panama . . .\" I named some of the B pictures that Ben and I had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at each other blankly. Jan Kiepura said, \"We will let you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s that. It\u0027s over. And it\u0027s just as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later, I was back in Jules Zeigler\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They just called,\" Zeigler said. \"They want you to write the show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black cloud descended over me. There was no way I could do it. Broadway was the Mecca every writer aspired to. What did I know about writing a Broadway show? Absolutely nothing. I would make a fool of myself and destroy the production. Anyway, I expected to receive the phone call to report back to the Air Corps at any second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJules Zeigler was watching me. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not have the courage to tell him I was not going to do the show. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want you to start right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to my hotel room. I would have to tell them that there was no way I could do it. But as I thought about it, I realized that there was a way. Ben Roberts. Ben could write the show with me. And when I got called back to the Air Corps in the middle of the project, Ben could finish it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called him at Fort Dix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s new?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s new. You and I are going to write a new book for The Merry Widow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. \"I didn\u0027t know you drank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious. I\u0027ve talked to the stars of the show. They want us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day, I went to the theater where The Merry Widow was going to open. The show was being produced by the New Opera Company, headed by Yolanda Mero-Irion, a short, buxom, middle-aged woman with a high, shrill voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a first-class production. The choreography was being done by the legendary George Balanchine, who was one of the century\u0027s foremost choreographers. Balanchine was of medium height with the well-developed body of a dancer. He had a friendly smile and a faint Russian accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director was the brilliant Felix Brentano, and the conductor was Robert Stolz, who was a wonderful composer in his own right. The prima ballerina was Milada Mladova, a stunning young European dancer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a meeting with Balanchine, Stolz, and Brentano, and we discussed the libretto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be as modern as possible,\" the director said, \"but we must not lose its period flavor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Entertaining and amusing,\" Balanchine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lighthearted,\" Robert Stolz commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Modern, but keeping the period flavor, entertaining and amusing, lighthearted. \"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen and I had figured out a way to collaborate. Since he was stationed at Fort Dix in New Jersey all day, working on training films, he would come into New York at night, where we would have dinner and work together until one or two in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fears about writing a Broadway play had evaporated. Working with Ben made everything seem easy. He was incredibly creative and he gave me a confidence I lacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we finished writing the first act, I took it to our producer, Yolanda Mero-Irion. I watched eagerly while she read the pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at me. \"This is terrible. Dreadful,\" she spat out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned. \"But we did everything that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve written a flop for me! A flop! You hear me?\" Her tone was vicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. Tell me what you don\u0027t like and Ben and I will rewrite it and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up, glared at me, and walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was back to my first opinion. What made me ever think I was capable of writing a Broadway show?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I sat there, contemplating the disaster that was about to happen, George Balanchine and Felix Brentano came into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you have a first act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded glumly. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s look at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was tempted not to show it to them. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started reading it and I wished I were somewhere else, anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a chuckle. It was Felix Brentano. And then a laugh. It was George Balanchine. They were both grinning as they read it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey liked it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they finished, Felix Brentano said to me, \"This is wonderful, Sidney. Exactly what we were hoping for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Balanchine said, \"If the second act is as good as this . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t wait to give the news to Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the hotel, I stayed close to the telephone, expecting the call from the Army Air Corps at any moment, and when I was out of the hotel, I always left instructions as to where I could be reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor singles, New York can be a lonely town. I had had some casual conversations with our prima ballerina, Milada Mladova, and we had gotten along well. One Sunday, when there was no rehearsal, I invited her to dinner and she accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to impress her, so I took her to Sardi\u0027s, the favorite restaurant of show people. I was still in uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring dinner, Milada and I discussed the show and she told me how excited she was to be in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally dinner was over. I asked for the check. It came to thirty-five dollars. Very reasonable. Except that I did not have thirty-five dollars. I stared at the check for a long time. Credit cards were not yet in existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is anything wrong?\" Milada asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, hastily. I made a decision. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and walked over to the entrance, where Vincent Sardi, the owner, was standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Sardi . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was going to be difficult. Vincent Sardi had not built up his business by catering to deadbeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about my check,\" I said nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was studying me. He knows a deadbeat when he sees one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there something wrong with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027s fine. I - I just don\u0027t have - I don\u0027t have - you know - the money.\" I wondered if Milada was watching. I quickly went on. \"Mr. Sardi, I wrote the play that\u0027s opening at the Majestic Theatre, across the street. But it hasn\u0027t opened yet. And at the moment, I - I don\u0027t have enough to - I wonder if you could trust me until the play opens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Of course. It\u0027s no problem. And I want you to know you are welcome to come here at any time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy spirits lifted. \"Thank you so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all.\" He shook my hand. There was a fifty-dollar bill in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur producer, Yolanda, hated everything that Ben and I wrote. I had the feeling she hated it even before she read it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The show\u0027s going to be a flop,\" she kept saying. \"It\u0027s going to be a flop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI desperately hoped that she was not psychic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Balanchine, on the other hand, along with Felix Brentano and Robert Stolz, loved what Ben and I were writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring rehearsals, Yolanda leaped around the stage like an overgrown grasshopper, barking orders at everyone. The professionals were too busy to be bothered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, during a break mid-rehearsal, Balanchine came to me and said, \"I would like to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. Is anything wrong, George?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. A friend of mine, Vinton Freedley, is producing a new play. He\u0027s looking for a writer. I told him about you and he would like to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said gratefully. \"I\u0027d love to meet him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalanchine looked at his watch. \"As a matter of fact, you have an appointment to see him at one o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Broadway plays on at the same time? Unbelievable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVinton Freedley was one of the most important producers on Broadway. Among his credits were Funny Face, Girl Crazy, and at least half a dozen more hits. Freedley was an efficient, down-to-business producer who got right to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George tells me you\u0027re good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing a show called Jackpot. It\u0027s about a girl who raffles herself off to raise money for the war effort and the winning ticket is won by three soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds like fun,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already have a writer, Guy Bolton, but he\u0027s English and I think he needs an American to work with him. Would you like the job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly would.\" Then I added, \"By the way, I have a collaborator, Ben Roberts. He would work with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreedley nodded. \"That\u0027s fine. The score is being written by Vernon Duke and Howard Dietz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo top Broadway names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How soon can you start?\" Vinton Freedley asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right away.\" I tried to sound confident, but at the back of my mind was the thought that the call could come in at any second and I would have to report back for advanced flight training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreedley was talking. \"We\u0027ve begun casting already. So far, we have Allan Jones and Nanette Fabray. Let me show you the set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised that the set had been built before the play was written. Freedley walked me over to the Alvin Theatre and we went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the stage was a huge white southern house with a picket fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Freedley, confused. \"You said this show was about American soldiers who win a girl in a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the set from my last show,\" Freedley explained. \"The show flopped, so we\u0027re going to use the set for this one. It will save a lot of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered how we were going to work a gothic southern mansion into a modern war story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go back to the office. I want you to meet Guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuy Bolton turned out to be a charming Englishman in his fifties who had written several plays with P. G. Wodehouse, the British icon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been afraid that he would resent another writer being brought in on his play, but he said, \"I\u0027m delighted that we\u0027re going to work together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I knew we would get along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I returned to my hotel, I asked the hotel clerk if there had been any messages, and I held my breath while he looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, Mr. Sheldon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. No advanced flying school has opened up yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried to my room and telephoned Ben at Fort Dix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and I are writing a musical for Vinton Freedley,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. \"They took us off The Merry Widow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027re doing The Merry Widow and the Freedley play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God. How did you arrange that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t. George Balanchine did.
