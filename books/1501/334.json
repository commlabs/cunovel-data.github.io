{"id":50031,"no":334,"title":"Book 12, Chapter 17 - I Will Never Hurt You","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Xia Emperor, Sovereign Hao, and the others all stared as Lu Dongbin slapped his table so hard, he sent the Immortal wine flying everywhere. They couldn’t help but feel speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLu Dongbin, you are one of the most awe-inspiringly famous figures of the Three Realms. Countless schools located throughout the three thousand major worlds and the trillion minor worlds all venerate you as ‘Patriarch Lu’. Is it really appropriate for you to get so excited over a bit of romance between a pair of young Wanxiang-level fellows? This is at most a spot of entertainment; why must you be so excited?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill… they all understood that this was precisely Lu Dongbin’s temperament. He loved to wander the mortal realms, and absolutely delighted in paying attention to the love stories of minor figures as well as playing the role of the Moon Elder as a matchmaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe imperial citadel plaza. The disciples of the Black-White College were staring at the massive Diagram in midair, feeling incomparably nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior apprentice-brother Ji Ning, quick, QUICK! YES! Kill them! KILL THEM ALL!” Mu Northson was incomparably agitated as he stared at the explosively savage Ji Ning within the Diagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quick, quick!” Immortal Fivecraze watched anxiously as well… and in the end, he finally let out a sigh of relief. “Fortunately, Xiamang Qi was only a Wanxiang Adept as well; although his Myriad Hibernating Venoms was powerful, by relying on some pills, its effects can be suppressed for a short while, at least.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whaaaaat?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorthson, Little Qing, the Whitewater Hound, Immortal Fivecraze, Adept Vastriver, Northmont Baiwei, and the others all suddenly stared with bulging eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJi Ning and Yu Wei were actually embracing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But but but…” Northson actually began to stammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master… and Miss Yu Wei…” Little Qing was completely flabbergasted as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorthmont Baiwei was the first to recover. Roaring with laughter, he slapped his thigh. “My brother Ji Ning truly is formidable. In the Conclave of Immortal Destiny’s trial within the Brightmoon Diagram of the Mountains and Rivers… he actually is going to be returning with a beauty in his arms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right!” Immortal Fivecraze shook his head a few times, feeling extremely delighted. “The Black-White College is going to be the talk of the world for some time now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinelotus watched this silently. She felt as though the entire world had turned still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He ended up with senior apprentice-sister after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s for the best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am myself. He is himself! Only… should I hope that the two will forever be together and forever be blissful… or should I hope that they will separate as well?” Ninelotus wanted to offer them her prayers, but while searching in her own heart… she found that deep inside her heart, for some reason she couldn’t explain, she still felt a strange sort of hope. Hope that Ning and Yu Wei would separate as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinelotus was an Immortal cultivator who understood her own heart; she immediately analyzed and realized what she was feeling. She quietly said to herself, “It is said that the trial of emotions is the most difficult trial to overcome… although I have already comprehended my own heart, whenever I see Ji Ning, waves always once more appear upon the lake of my heart. If I wish to be able to walk further on the path of Immortal cultivation, then I should never meet him again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will be better for him. It will be better for me as well.” Ninelotus made up her mind. After this Conclave of Immortal Destiny concluded, she would return to the Dongyan clan. Unless there was an absolutely pressing need, she would absolutely never meet Ning again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearby Dongyan Forefather glanced sideways at Ninelotus, seated by his side. He saw the look in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of determination!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dongyan Forefather shook his head gently. He had not desired for things between Ning and Ninelotus to end up like this. However… this was Ninelotus’ decision, born from her heart. He would not interfere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the Diagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei was tightly embracing Ning. She could feel the warmth from his body, and she could feel a sense of bliss that came with it. It had been a long, long time since she had felt this sort of bliss. Far too long. Even in her past life, as a child, she had known this bliss for just a brief period of time. Now, she once more felt this sense of bliss and contentment. This caused uncontrollable tears to streak down her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved slightly, clutching Ning even more tightly to her. In her mind, she couldn’t help but think back to that terrifying figure from her memories of her past life, that figure which caused her heart to remble with fear. Yu Wei bit her lips, bit them so hard that blood appeared. In her heart, she quietly said to herself, “I swear that even if it means that I, Yu Wei, will have my soul be shattered… I will never hurt you. Never!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter making up her decision, Yu Wei actually relaxed. Now that she was mentally prepared for her soul to be destroyed, the knot in her heart had been resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My man.” Yu Wei revealed a smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing held Yu Wei in his arms, smelling the fragrance that came from her body. The feathery down on her clothings around her neck rubbed against his face. Ning felt calmer than he ever had before. It had been a long time since he had felt so calm. He could feel that the heart of this woman before him was extremely close to his own. It was as though the two of them were one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From today onwards,” Ning whispered words gently into Yu Wei’s ears, words that sounded like a sort of promise, “Yu Wei, you shall be my woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’ll be mine as well,” Yu Wei replied softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two could both sense each other’s hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou are willing to die for me.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am willing to die for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the future, we shall walk the Immortal path together, never leaving or separating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yu Wei.” Ning released Yu Wei, looking at the deathly dark pallor to her face. He said with concern, “You’ve been badly poisoned?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The poisons of the Myriad Hibernating Venoms are very unique.” Yu Wei gently shook her head. “The pills I have on me only suffice to temporarily suppress them for two to four hours. To actually cure the poison, I would either need an incomparably precious Immortal pill that could resolve countless poisons, or a spirit-pill that was specially designed to dissolve the poisons of this divine ability. There’s no way I can do this from within the world of the Diagram. I have to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing gritted his teeth. He and Yu Wei had been on the verge of passing the trial, but she now had to depart. If the poison wasn’t cured, then once it was no longer suppressed, she would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough. Don’t be unhappy.” Yu Wei smiled as she looked at Ning, contentment in her eyes. “To ‘win’ you here is better than winning any other award in the Conclave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.” Although Ning wanted to continue to be together with Yu Wei, he immediately said, “Hurry up and cure your poison. It won’t be so easily cured, so don’t dawdle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the imperial capital of the Grand Xia, and there are countless experts gathered outside. It won’t be too hard.” Yu Wei nodded. “Take my talismans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoosh. Instantly, a large number of talismans appeared on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei looked at Ning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumble…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn invisible ripple of power descended, teleporting Yu Wei away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing collected the talismans. Actually, the number of talismans he had acquired after killing Xiamang Qi and Adept Snowfly was more than enough to allow himself and Yu Wei to pass the trial. But she had been poisoned by the Myriad Hibernating Venoms… she had to leave and have it cured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing took a single step forward, then disappeared as a streak of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the main hall of the Skylight Palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nine Pure Yang True Immortals were all staring at the Diagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This Yu Wei girl is coming out. Xiamang, have her be teleported over here,” Lu Dongbin immediately said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Xia Emperor, seated on his imperial throne, simply smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoosh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black-robed woman whose skin was as lustrous as white jade and who was roughly 1.7 meters tall by Earth measurements suddenly appeared within the main hall of the Skylight Palace, right next to the nine Pure Yang True Immortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh?!” Yu Wei stared at her surroundings, immediately poleaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Xia Emperor was seated on high atop his throne. The other Pure Yang True Immortals who were seated with him hadn’t suppressed their auras, and so naturally their auras rippled out… causing absolute terror in Yu Wei. She had seen Celestial Immortals in her past life, and not just one; these figures before her gave her the sense of tremendous power. They absolutely were not Celestial Immortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei looked backwards and saw nearly a thousand Celestial Immortals. Their auras were similarly shocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yu Wei, disciple of the Black-White College, prostrates before you, your Imperial Majesty.” Yu Wei immediately fell to her knees with tremendous respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quite clever.” The Xia Emperor laughed and praised her. “Arise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLu Dongbin was staring at Yu Wei with interest. Actually, the other eight Pure Yang True Immortals present rather looked down on Yu Wei; she was nothing more than a reincarnated female Immortal. The only one intrigued by her was Lu Dongbin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little girl.” Lu Dongbin tossed her a gourd of wine, sending it flying towards Yu Wei. Yu Wei immediately caught it, her eyes filled with puzzlement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drink it,” Lu Dongbin instructed. Yu Wei stared at the gourd of wine in her hands. Although she was restless and nervous, she knew that there was no way she could refuse. She immediately lifted up the gourd of wine and gulped it all down. The sight of her lifting up her neck and drinking the wine was extremely pretty; however, her neck and her face were a bit black. Slowly, however, the color of her neck and face began to change, beginning to turn pale. Moments later, Yu Wei had transformed from a gray-skinned girl to a white-skinned girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My poison…?” Yu Wei was extremely startled. The poison in her body was no ordinary poison… but just by drinking some wine, it had been dissolved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little girl, this Immortal nectar which you just drank was no ordinary wine. It came from the Xia Emperor’s private stash, and he rarely brings it out. Usually, not even Celestial Immortals will have a chance to drink it. This was specially prepared by the Xia Emperor for Lu Dongbin.” The Immortal Elder of the Northlands chortled as he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei immediately knelt down in gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No need. It was just a gourd of wine.” Lu Dongbin seemed quite indifferent. “Alright, you can go now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go?” Yu Wei stared at the vast Skylight Palace. Behind here were nearly a thousand Celestial Immortals who were split into two lines that stretched far off into the distance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei actually didn’t know where to go for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go sit down next to King Yan,” the Xia Emperor instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Only now did Yu Wei feel a bit relaxed. When she had scanned the room earlier, she saw Yuchi Xiyue seated behind King Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei, her thoughts in a confused jumble, walked before King Yan, then sat down behind him, close to Yuchi Xiyue. All of the Celestial Immortals present stared at the black-robed maiden. They had all personally witnessed Lu Dongbin bestow a gourd of wine upon her. All of the Celestial Immortals present knew of the legendary Lu Dongbin, but almost none of them had ever spoken with him before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is this little girl? She was actually able to chat with Patriarch Lu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No clue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She should be from the Black-White College; that Ji Ning is from the Black-White College.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Celestial Immortals were all chatting amongst themselves regarding this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei was now seated behind King Yan, next to Yuchi Xiyue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yu Wei, you are so amazing,” Xiyue sent an excited mental message to her. “You were actually able to chat with Patriarch Lu. Not even my grandfather has ever spoken to Patriarch Lu before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah…” Yu Wei was still in a dazed state. She had heard of Lu Dongbin even in her past life. He was one of the most famous experts of the Three Realms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. You and Ji Ning have chosen each other to be life partners?” Princess Xiyue’s eyes were shining brightly. As Ning’s cousin, she naturally paid tremendous attention to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYu Wei’s face instantly became slightly red and bashful, but she still nodded and sent back, “Right.” However, in her heart, Yu Wei felt a bit nervous. This was because the outside world had long buzzed with rumors that Princess Xiyue liked Ji Ning very much. It was said that it was Princess Xiyue who had led Ji Ning into King Yan’s Estate when he had just arrived at the imperial capital, and that it was because of her that King Yan treated him so kindly!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was nothing more than a genius. Think about who King Yan was! If it wasn’t for Princess Xiyue, how could he have sent his Golden Imperials out to protect Ji Ning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone believed that Princess Xiyue must have fallen for Ji Ning! Even many members of the Black-White College believed this, and this was Yu Wei’s guess as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has Princess Xiyue truly fallen for Ji Ning as well? Is she going to be angry at me?” Yu Wei was feeling worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“WONDERFUL!” Princess Xiyue was absolutely delighted and excited. “Yu Wei, you need to take good care of Ji Ning. Ideally, you would immediately have his babies!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-12-chapter-16\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-12-chapter-18\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/desolate-era/de-book-12-chapter-17","bookId":1501,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:12 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:12 AM"}
