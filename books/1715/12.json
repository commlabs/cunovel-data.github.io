Turns out to be pretty complete, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman went over to the box, flipped open the lid. There were neat compartments with medicines, syringes, bandages. Beth was right, it was quite complete - antibiotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, even surgical anesthetics. He didn\u0027t recognize all the names on the bottles, but the psychoactive drugs were strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could fight a war with the stuff in this kit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well.

Just leave it at this - we\u0027re in a very dangerous environment. Barnes didn\u0027t bother to give us all the gory details. You know why the Navy has that rule about pulling people out within seventy-two hours? Because after seventy-two hours, you increase your risk of something called \u0027aseptic bone necrosis.\u0027 Nobody knows why, but the pressurized environment causes bone destruction in the leg and hip. And you know why this habitat constantly adjusts as we walk through it? It\u0027s not because that\u0027s slick and hightech. It\u0027s because the helium atmosphere makes body-heat control very volatile. You can quickly become overheated, and just as quickly overchilled. Fatally so. It can happen so fast you don\u0027t realize it until it\u0027s too late and you drop dead. And \u0027high pressure nervous syndrome\u0027 - that turns out to be sudden convulsions, paralysis, and death if the carbondioxide content of the atmosphere drops too low. That\u0027s what the badges are for, to make sure we have enough CO2 in the air. That\u0027s the only reason we have the badges. Nice, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman flicked off the screen, sat back. \"Well, I keep coming back to the same point - there\u0027s not much we can do about it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what Barnes said.\" Beth started pushing equipment around on her counter top, nervously. Rearranging things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad we don\u0027t have a sample of those jellyfish,\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I\u0027m not sure how much good it would do, to tell the truth.\" She frowned, shifted papers on the counter again. \"Norman, I\u0027m not thinking very clearly down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After the, uh, accident, I came up here to look over my notes, review things.

I just missed all the midline structures. But they\u0027re there, all right; the shrimps are normal. And the squid? It turns out the one squid I dissected was a little anomalous. It had an atrophic gill, but it had one. And the other squid are perfectly normal. Just what you\u0027d expect. I was wrong, too hasty. It really bothers me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you took the Valium?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I hate to be sloppy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s criticizing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Harry or Ted reviewed my work and found that I\u0027d made these stupid mistakes ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with a mistake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can hear them now: Just like a woman, not careful enough, too eager to make a discovery, trying to prove herself, too quick to draw conclusions.

Finally she said, \"I can\u0027t.\" Something about the way she said it touched him. \"I understand,\" Norman said, and a memory came rushing back to him. \"You know, when I was a kid, I went to the beach with my younger brother. Tim. He\u0027s dead now, but Tim was about six at the time. He couldn\u0027t swim yet. My mother told me to watch him carefully, but when I got to the beach all my friends were there, body-surfing. I didn\u0027t want to be bothered with my brother. It was hard, because I wanted to be out in the big surf, and he had to stay close to shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, in the middle of the afternoon he comes out of the water screaming bloody murder, absolutely screaming. And tugging at his right side. It turned out he had been stung by some kind of a jellyfish. It was still attached to him, sticking to his side. Then he collapsed on the beach. One of the mothers ran over and took Timmy to the hospital, before I could even get out of the water. I didn\u0027t know where he had gone. I got to the hospital later. My mother was already there. Tim was in shock; I guess the poison was a heavy dose for his small body. Anyway, nobody blamed me. It wouldn\u0027t have mattered if I had been sitting right on the beach watching him like a hawk, he would still have been stung. But I hadn\u0027t been sitting there, and I blamed myself for years, long after he was fine. Every time I\u0027d see those scars on his side, I felt terrible guilt. But you get over it. You\u0027re not responsible for everything that happens in the world. You just aren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. Somewhere in the habitat he heard a soft rhythmic knocking, a sort of thumping. And the everpresent hum of the air handlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth was staring at him. \"Seeing Edmunds die must have been hard for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s funny,\" Norman said. \"I never made the connection, until right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blocked it, I guess. Want a Valium?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You looked as if you were about to cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m fine.\" He stood up, stretched. He went over to the medicine kit and closed the white lid, came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth said, \"What do you think about these messages we\u0027re getting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beats me,\" Norman said. He sat down again. \"Actually, I did have one crazy thought. Do you suppose the messages and these animals we\u0027re seeing are related?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never thought about it until we started to get spiral messages. Harry says it\u0027s because the thing - the famous it - believes we think in spirals. But it\u0027s just as likely that it thinks in spirals and so it assumes we do, too. The sphere is round, isn\u0027t it? And we\u0027ve been seeing all these radially symmetrical animals. Jellyfish, squid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice idea,\" Beth said, \"except for the fact that squid aren\u0027t radially symmetrical. An octopus is. And, like an octopus, squid have a round circle of tentacles, but squid\u0027re bilaterally symmetrical, with a matching left and right side, the way we have. And then there\u0027s the shrimps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, the shrimps.\" Norman had forgotten about the shrimps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see a connection between the sphere and the animals,\" Beth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard the thumping again, soft, rhythmic. Sitting in his chair, Norman realized that he could feel the thumping as well, as a slight impact. \"What is that, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Sounds like it\u0027s coming from outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had started toward the porthole when the intercom clicked and he heard Barnes say, \"Now hear this, all hands to communications. All hands to communications. Dr. Adams has broken the code.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry wouldn\u0027t tell them the message right away. Relishing his triumph, he insisted on going through the decoding process, step by step. First, he explained, he had thought that the messages might express some universal constant, or some physical law, stated as a way to open conversation. \"But,\" Harry said, \"it might also be a graphic representation of some kind - code for a picture - which presented immense problems. After all, what\u0027s a picture? We make pictures on a flat plane, like a piece of paper. We determine positions within a picture by what we call X and Y axes. Vertical and horizontal. But another intelligence might see images and organize them very differently. It might assume more than three dimensions. Or it might work from the center of the picture outward, for example. So the code might be very tough. I didn\u0027t make much progress at first.\" Later, when he got the same message with gaps between number sequences, Harry began to suspect that the code represented discrete chunks of information - suggesting words, not pictures. \"Now, word codes fall into several types, from simple to complex. There was no way to know immediately which method of encoding had been used. But then I had a sudden insight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited, impatiently, for his insight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why use a code at all?\" Harry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why use a code?\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. If you are trying to communicate with someone, you don\u0027t use a code. Codes are ways of hiding communication. So perhaps this intelligence thinks he is communicating directly, but is actually making some kind of logical mistake in talking to us. He is making a code without ever intending to do so. That suggested the unintentional code was probably a substitution code, with numbers for letters. When I got the word breaks, I began to try and match numbers to letters by frequency analysis. In frequency analysis you break down codes by using the fact that the most common letter in English is \u0027e,\u0027 and the second most common letter is \u0027t,\u0027 and so on. So I looked for the most common numbers. But I was impeded by the fact that even a short number sequence, such as two-three-two, might represent many code possibilities: two and three and two, twenty-three and two, two and thirtytwo, or two hundred and thirty-two. Longer code sequences had many more possibilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, he said, he was sitting in front of the computer thinking about the spiral messages, and he suddenly looked at the keyboard. \"I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard, those rows of symbols on a device made to be pressed. How confusing it must look to another kind of creature! Look here,\" he said. \"The letters on a regular keyboard go like this.\" He held up his pad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;2\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;3\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;4\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;5\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;6\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;7\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;8\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;9\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;0\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etab\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Q\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;W\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;E\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; R\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; T\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Y\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; U\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;O\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;P\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecaps\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; S\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; D\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;F\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; G\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; H\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;J\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;K\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; L\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; ;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshift\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Z\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; X\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; C\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; V\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; B\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; N\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;M\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then I imagined what the keyboard would look like as a spiral, since our creature seems to prefer spirals.
