Meng Li’s eyes were wide, and she trembled as she clutched Fang Xiufeng’s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You knew this was going to happen, didn’t you!?” she said, her eyes filled with anxiety at the sight of Meng Hao being in such danger. What she was worried about wasn’t the destruction of the Fang Clan, she was worried about her son’s safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Xiufeng looked at the images and slowly nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to trust me, and you have to trust Hao’er. Everything will be over shortly.” Fang Xiufeng said softly. His fatherly love was not the type that showed on the outside like Ke Yunhai’s. His love was kept buried deep in his heart. He was Meng Hao’s father, and would rather sustain injuries himself than allow his son to be hurt in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, everything that was happening... had to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Planet East Victory, Fang Wei\u0027s and Meng Hao’s gazes locked, and an intangible rumbling sound filled Meng Hao’s mind. It was as if everything in the world vanished, and the only things left behind were the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered with killing intent. There was no way he could have predicted that events would turn out this way. He could do nothing about the dramatic events playing out in the Fang Clan, and in fact, deep in his heart, he was somewhat at a loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sinister grin could be seen on Fang Wei’s face as he flew through the air like a shooting star, heading directly toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao took a deep breath, crushing the dazed feeling he felt in his heart. His battle with Fang Wei was not over. His Nirvana Fruits had not been returned. In that case... it was time to continue the battle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes flashing with killing intent, he flew into the air. The two of them pierced through the crowds like meteors, rapidly closing in on each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir speed was incredible, causing everything to shake. Even though all the other members of the Fang Clan were locked in battle, they all turned to look at Meng Hao and Fang Wei. The cultivators of the Ninth Mountain and Sea also stared at the two figures as they closed in on each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they slammed into each other in midair, a shocking boom echoed out in all directions, causing the air to shatter and wild colors to flash in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao attacked with the full explosive force of his 123 meridians. 33 Heavens rumbled, and numerous mountain chains appeared. One Blood Demon head after another roared, causing Heaven and Earth to shake, and wild winds to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Wei performed an incantation gesture, causing a divine ability to materialize. Statues appeared, formed of reincarnation, the Yellow Springs, and some other magical technique that Meng Hao was unfamiliar with. The statues circled around Meng Hao, unleashing ceaseless attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao frowned. The terrifying Ancient Realm ripples that had been emanating out of Fang Wei had vanished. However, Meng Hao could sense that Fang Wei was much more powerful than he had been earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, Meng Hao began to sense ripples inside of Fang Wei that filled him with a sense of danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s not Fang Wei!” he thought, his eyes flickering with a cold light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Wei was bursting with an energy far more powerful than before. The One Thought Yellow Springs Dao was unleashed once again, but it was different this time. Rumbling sounds could be heard as the Yellow Springs swept out, directly attacking Meng Hao in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge boom rattled out as over a hundred moves were exchanged in a very short time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all you can do?” asked Fang Wei, his voice coldly sinister. “This is the Immortal Realm Paragon!?” He performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing the Yellow Springs to turn into something like a dragon that lunged toward Meng Hao with gaping maw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s expression darkened, but he said nothing. His hand extended as a divine ability was unleashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Fang Wei’s 241 Immortal meridians appeared. However... apparently, he wasn’t finished! Suddenly... more Immortal meridians appeared!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e251. 261. 271....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassive rumbling filled the air as Fang Wei’s aura exploded up, to the astonishment of the observing cultivators of the Ninth Mountain and Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fang Wei... his Immortal meridians, they’re... still increasing!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unbelievable, this... what’s going on!?” The cultivators were dumbstruck, but the Dao Realm Patriarchs merely frowned; they were starting to piece together pictures of what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s possessed....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After he became Immortal, he was possessed, although not perfectly. It couldn’t be; after all, people who can reach the absolute pinnacle of Immortal meridians are not commonplace in the Nine Mountains and Seas. The only possibility is that someone placed a Dao seed in Fang Wei, as a sort of a gamble. That person would be betting that as Fang Wei grew up, he would have a chance at success.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s of secondary importance. The main requirement would be that they were of the same bloodline. Furthermore, they would both have to have cultivated the same technique. Even more important than that is that they would both have to have a drop of blood from the legendary Underworld Clan!” The Dao Realm Patriarchs maintained their silence as they looked at Fang Wei with looks of curiosity and shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on Planet East Victory, Fang Wei’s Immortal meridians continued to erupt!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e281. 291. 300!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassive rumbling sounds echoed out. Meng Hao’s eyes widened as Fang Wei’s Immortal meridians just continued to increase. Although he was shocked, it didn\u0027t cause him to hesitate at all. He waved his hand, transforming into a golden roc. At the same time, numerous mountain chains crushed down toward Fang Wei, whose laughter rang out as his energy continued to soar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilling intent flickered in Meng Hao’s eyes. A domineering air surged out, and his Immortal Realm Paragon cultivation base exploded with power. The starstone vanished from his left eye, transforming into starlight in his palm. It covered his body as the One Thought Stellar Transformation manifested, transforming him into an enormous planet that shot toward Fang Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiercing whistling sounds could be heard as the planet emitted shocking pressure over everything. Rocks shattered and then rose up into the air, and the nearby battling cultivators were pushed away by a powerful force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 3,000-meter planetary asteroid shot through the air, filled with incredible power. In the blink of an eye, it was upon Fang Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in that instant, Fang Wei’s eyes glittered with arrogance. Extending both of his hands, he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, his Immortal meridians burst with power as even more were added!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e310 meridians!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e320 meridians!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire Ninth Mountain and Sea rumbled. All of the members of the Fang Clan were shocked. All attention was focused on Fang Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e330 meridians!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShockingly, 330 Immortal meridians had appeared in Fang Wei, which was the complete pinnacle for an Immortal who had not corroborated the Dao on his own. When the 330 Immortal meridians appeared, 33 Immortal souls also descended behind Fang Wei. It was just the same as Meng Hao... 33 Heavens!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DIE!” he roared, extending both hands toward the incoming planet. As he pushed out, his 330 Immortal meridians transformed into 330 Yellow Springs, which then combined into one. In addition, his 33 Immortal souls were no longer Underworld Judges, but rather, Yama Kings! An indescribable pressure that was the ultimate pinnacle of the Immortal Realm radiated out from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassive rumbling shook all of Planet East Victory as two peak Immortals began to fight. When they slammed into each other, a huge boom rattled out. Cracking sounds could be heard as the planet began to fall to pieces, and the Yellow Springs disintegrated. Within a few breaths of time, an earsplitting crash rattled out as the planet exploded. Meng Hao appeared, face pale, expression extremely cold, like a sword. He coughed up a mouthful of blood as he staggered backward across the land, as if he were being shoved by some mighty force. And yet, he did not lose a bit of that sharp and blade-like quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The pinnacle of the Immortal Realm. 33 Heavens. Hm....” He wiped the blood from his mouth, and the coldness in his eyes ignited into a massive desire to fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp ahead, the Yellow Springs shattered, and the 33 Yama Kings collapsed. Fang Wei also coughed up blood. Furthermore, although his right eye seemed filled with madness, signs of struggle could be seen in his left eye. That was... Fang Wei’s soul, fighting back!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Fang Wei’s true voice rang out, filled with the truth of his own desires: “I am a member of the Fang Clan, and my dream is to lead the Fang Clan to glory. Father! Grandfather! Patriarch! If your desire is to overthrow the clan, then... I disagree!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, almost as soon as Fang Wei’s true voice could be heard, the Sixth Patriarch cried, “Get back down!” and rapidly suppressed him. The left eye returned to its normal state, and Fang Wei coughed up another mouthful of blood, then looked at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fang Hao!” Fang Wei wiped the blood from his mouth and took a step forward. 33 Heavens appeared once again, and boundless Immortal power exploded out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I want... is this feeling! I\u0027ve finally done it! Finally, I have this perfect body!! This is my doppelgänger! In the future, it will be my true self. Fang Wei, you are my descendant, which means that this is an honor for you!” Fang Wei’s right hand lifted up, and 33 Heavens shot murderously toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m going to help you kill this person, to achieve your desire!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered with intense killing intent. He looked coldly at Fang Wei for a moment, then began to advance. He raised his right hand, and his own 33 Heavens appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Paragon Bridge!” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the words left his mouth, rumbling sounds filled Heaven and Earth. Shockingly, Meng Hao’s 33 Heavens transformed into the image of the Paragon Bridge. 123 meridians manifested behind the bridge as it sped toward Fang Wei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who gives a crap about that thing? Hell World!” Fang Wei waved his right hand, instantly causing the Yellow Springs to appear. In addition, an illusory slice of the underworld manifested, rapidly turning corporeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two attacked each other, Fang Xiushan ignored any potential injuries he might receive and broke away from his fight with Meng Hao’s 19th Uncle. He then performed a minor teleportation, heading directly toward Meng Hao, eyes filled with killing intent. He waved his hand, causing his Ancient Realm cultivation base to explode with the destructive power of two extinguished Soul Lamps. A gigantic hand appeared which slashed toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DIE!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShockingly, he joined forces with Fang Wei to attempt to kill Meng Hao, to slaughter him in spirit and body!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this critical moment, Meng Hao waved his right hand, and the Paragon Bridge descended to block both Fang Wei and Fang Xiushan. Booms could be heard as the Paragon Bridge began to collapse. Meng Hao shot backward, and his expression lacked any sort of alarm. Instead, it was filled with seething killing intent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe extended his right hand, and there in his palm was a small fruit that was currently not visible to anyone but him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was... the first generation Patriarch’s Nirvana Fruit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Nirvana Fruit in hand, his towering killing intent influenced the entire area, making everything grow cold. Fang Wei and Fang Xiushan looked at Meng Hao’s eyes, and for some unknown reason, they began to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-995\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-997\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-996","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
