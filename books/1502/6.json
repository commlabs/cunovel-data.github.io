Morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin two hours of sunrise, every disciple of the Flowered Flag Sect had made contact with their street-level informants, and distributed a picture and instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture had been drawn by one of the most famous sketch artists in Jinan, drawn based on descriptions provided by the staff of “Big Zhao\u0027s” restaurant. It depicted two people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA middle-aged man named Wu Tao, sharp-faced with narrow eyes, a long nose and a wide mouth, dressed up like a traveling merchant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother, a young beggar called Ingot, round-faced with big eyes and a smile that produced two dimples. Completely adorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instructions had been dispatched with “Level 1 Flowered Flag” urgency: expend all effort possible to track down the whereabouts of these two people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin an hour, even the local bailiffs and constables attached to the Jinan local government had joined the search.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was because the three squads of the Jinan constabulary had received an anonymous tip that the businessman Wu Tao was very likely one of the four famous criminals wanted in all parts of China. In fact, he could well be the famous bandit who had three times broken into the Imperial Palace to make off with treasures, a person people in Jianghu viewed as second only to the “Bandit Chief” \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinyurl.com/q4lvmqk\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eChu Liuxiang\u003c/a\u003e [1].

He believed that if you ate a good breakfast, you would have plenty of energy to accomplish things throughout the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, he didn’t eat much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, he had something weighing on his mind, and felt somewhat emotional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Laughing General, surnamed Li,” he said. “He’s really got guts. And skills.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His name is Li… what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Nobody knows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” said Frogboy, “Well then, why do people call him the Laughing General?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone acknowledges that his skill and ability is only slightly lower than that of Chu Liuxiang, so they call him General.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the ‘Laughing’ part?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After every heist, he lets out three big laughs.” Old Master Tian sighed. “Back then, when people heard that laugh, some became so frightened that they actually pissed their pants.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then, gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gone?” said Frogboy, confused. “What does that mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gone means gone. By the time people heard that laugh, gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was gone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gold, pearls, jewelry, ancient jades and paintings. Anything and everything the General wanted to take, gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Master Tian sighed again. “Ten years ago, he himself was gone. Like a bowl of alcohol poured down your throat. Suddenly, just gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not gone,” said Frogboy. “When I pour a bowl of alcohol down my throat, it goes into my stomach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still gone. When the alcohol reaches your stomach, it turns into piss. The alcohol is gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t laugh, because what he said was no joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrogboy didn’t laugh either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe understood what his father meant. “The Laughing General who went missing for so many years turned into Wu Tao.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Master Tian suddenly turned and looked at Xiao Jun. “The Beggar Sect’s Torture Chamber was just founded. There should be countless affairs to handle. You shouldn’t be here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct.” When one word sufficed to express his intent, Xiao Jun wouldn’t use two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And yet here you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun thought for a moment. “Because of the Laughing General.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke the truth. Never before had he lied, so Old Master Tian found his answer satisfactory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you’re here for him,” said Old Master Tian. “And so must have Three Panthers Niu been here for him. I suspect many people in Jianghu now know he is in Jinan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrogboy still didn’t understand. “But, Wu Tao was not in Jinan before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In Jinan or not, it doesn’t matter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the person they should have come after wasn’t him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not him? Who, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sun Jicheng.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it was Sun Jicheng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Laughing General disappeared, he turned into Jinan’s multi-millionaire Sun Jicheng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t as if Frogboy hadn’t considered this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was no fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just liked to ask questions, questions of all sorts, even questions he already knew the answer to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If people should have been coming after Sun Jicheng because they suspected him of being the Laughing General, then why would they suddenly be interested in Wu Tao?” he asked. “Don’t tell me Wu Tao and Sun Jicheng have some kind of connection?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A big connection or a small connection?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A big one. A very big one. A deadly one.” He sighed. “Deadly for several people so far.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun, his eyes staring off into the distance, slowly, one word at a time, said, “Sun Jicheng is dead. His killer is also dead. Why have his subordinates instigated such a huge search in Jinan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the critical question, a question that had already been asked multiple times, but that no one had been able to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time, it was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of now, there was someone who could answer the question, and that person was none other than Old Master Tian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, the answer to the question is quite simple,” he said. “I can answer it in eight words.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eight words?” asked Frogboy. “Which eight words?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sun Jicheng actually isn’t even dead at all!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis shocking statement would certainly surprise most people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Frogboy and Xiao Jun were not most people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were a minority amongst a minority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they were not surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Frogboy had another question to ask: “He clearly died, and everyone clearly saw his corpse. How could he not be dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because Sun Jicheng didn’t die,” said Old Master Tian, “and that body was not his.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whose was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone who looked very much like him, no doubt specially selected and manufactured for the specific purpose of acting as his double in death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Specially selected, I understand,” said Frogboy. “But manufactured… What does that mean? What sort of manufacturing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He selected someone who looked a lot like him, and then, using some special technique, made some alterations to the face.” Old Master Tian continued his explanation: “According to the rumors in Jianghu, the Laughing General got along well with Hua Shiniang. Hua Shiniang’s appearance altering arts are the best under heaven. Surely he learned a thing or two from her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he hid the person away in his cellar, just waiting for the time when it was necessary to replace him in death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And by necessary, you mean when his secret was exposed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he strangled Liu Jin’niang, used Qiu Budao’s Divine Shaolin Palm to kill his body double, then forced Qiu Budao to drink poisoned wine. All to convince people that it was a crime of passion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So even if people suspected Sun Jicheng to be the Laughing General, after he died, no one would come after him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” said Old Master Tian. And then he said, “Wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrogboy laughed bitterly. “Is it right, or wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are right, he is wrong,” said Old Master Tian coldly. “He picked the wrong person to kill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think he was wrong at all,” said Frogboy. “Liu Jin’niang made his clothes so well that they fit like a second skin. She obviously knew his body structure quite well. She no doubt would have been able to see that the body double wasn’t him, because every person’s body structure is different. If I were him, I would definitely have picked Liu Jin’niang.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Master Tian suddenly got angry again. Slapping the table forcefully, he said, “But you’re not him! You’re just a little bastard who understands shit. In fact, you don’t even understand shit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrogboy said nothing in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see that his father truly was angry, and he didn’t know why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he dared not open his mouth. But Xiao Jun did. “There’s definitely a flaw in his plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d spoken seven words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, to express his full meaning would require probably thirteen or fourteen words, such as: “Sun Jicheng’s plan was thorough, but flawed; therefore, people realized he hadn’t died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’d spoken only seven words because he knew Old Master Tian would understand his meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Master Tian nodded. “Of course there was a flaw,” he said. “Only lunatics believe in the perfect crime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sun Jicheng himself could sense it, therefore, he couldn’t help but return to check things out for himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Master Tian laughed. “He probably thought it was safe, that no one would guess that he might come back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he came back,” said Xiao Jun. “And thus Wu Tao appeared in Jinan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the conclusion they reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Frogboy had another question. “If Wutao is Sun Jicheng and the Laughing General, then who is Ingot the beggar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Master Tian, his face calm, said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Jun likewise remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If Ingot has something to do with all of this, why is he with Wu Tao? Does he also know he is the Laughing General? How could he know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Master Tian yet again got angry. “Why don’t you go ask him yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrogboy sighed. “I want to, but I’m afraid finding him won’t be that easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I were Wu Tao, I would get rid of him after he witnessed me kill Old Mr. Wang.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at his father out of the corner of his eye, and then suddenly laughed. “Of course, I’m not Wu Tao. I’m just a little bastard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, Frogboy wasn’t a bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntelligent, quick-witted, courageous and insightful, with quick reflexes, he possessed extremely refined judgement. Because of his spotless track record of good judgements, not a disciple existed in the Flowered Flag Sect who didn’t admire him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this time, his judgement was once again seemed spot on. Neither Old Master Tian nor Xiao Jun could object to his conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet he was actually wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao didn’t kill Ingot to silence him, and in fact seemed to have no inclination whatsoever to ever kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they hadn’t fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still in Jinan. In a place where no one would find them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if Frogboy were ten times as intelligent, he would never come to the conclusion that they would go to this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could possibly imagine that they would hide there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJinan was an ancient and famous city, long since established as the seat of government, full of enriching places and sights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge and sprawling, the prefectural \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinyurl.com/q2ssvr8\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eyamen\u003c/a\u003e looked much more dignified and imposing than the average yamen.

It was pretty stinky.” He continued, “I heard a long time ago that when people are frightened into death, that is what happens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems you know a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that man was fated to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” asked Wu Tao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t actually know who you are, he just wanted to take you back to ask some questions. But, to do so, he planned to use a critical strike to break your four major joints. A person like that, willing to use such ferocious, ruthless and sinister methods… Well, he was fated to die eventually.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao looked at him for a while. At first his face was expressionless, but then after a while, a strange look appeared in his eye, a look impossible to describe with words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get out of here,” he said. “Quickly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not going anywhere. I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If people can track you down, then they definitely know that I am with you. If you leave and I don’t know where you went off to, then when they catch me, they’ll probably end up beating me to death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed Wu Tao’s sleeve. “So I’m going with you. We’re stuck together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao again stared at him for a while. “Do you know who I am?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not an ordinary businessman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’m not an ordinary beggar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you want to know who I am?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. But I don’t want you to know who I am. So if you don’t ask me, I won’t ask you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing good will come out of you following me,” said Wu Tao. “If I’m a person, then I’m not a good person. And If I’m a ghost, I’m definitely an evil ghost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice suddenly became very grim. “Originally, I just wanted to use you to help me pass the time. But I could also see that you have some kind unique background. Maybe when the need arises, I could use your family’s social standing to threaten people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. Of course I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you come with me, you’ll have to share all the sufferings and miseries and unfair hardships. I might even have to sell you out,” he said coldly. “If someone attacks me, as long as I have a chance to escape, I might use you to block the attack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t regret it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Going with you is my idea, why would I regret anything?” Ingot suddenly laughed. “Maybe I’ll use you too. If someone attacks us, who’s to say I won’t use you to block the attack? It’s hard to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao wasn’t laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, it seemed like he wanted to, but in the end he didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going to go?” asked Ingot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to sleep. Build up my energy. Whatever I end up doing, I need to build up some energy.” He laughed coldly. “People must think I’m as exhausted as a stray dog. I want to give them a little shock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sleeping is always good,” said Ingot. “But is there anywhere in Jinan where you can actually get a good rest?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a place they definitely won’t look for me. They would never think that I would go there.” He seemed completely confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A place no one would think of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, there is one.” Ingot winked. “At least one person could think of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tao stared at him. “You know the place I’m talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngot laughed, and his dimples appeared again. “Not only do I know which place you’re talking about, I also know that getting in is a lot easier than getting out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so Ingot followed Wu Tao into the Den of Immortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[1] Chu Liuxiang is the titular character of Gu Long’s Chu Liuxiang series. http://tinyurl.com/q4lvmqk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[2] A yamen was a type of local governmental complex in ancient China. http://tinyurl.com/q2ssvr8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/dragon-king-with-seven-stars/dkss-chapter-5\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/dragon-king-with-seven-stars/dkss-chapter-7\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/dragon-king-with-seven-stars/dkss-chapter-6","bookId":1502,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:46 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:46 AM"}
