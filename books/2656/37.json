Instead, he stood firmly, legs apart and arms crossed at his chest. He was a man who\u0027d brook no disagreement, and the vision of him made Marjorie swell with admiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stopped. Looking between Cormac and Marjorie, he shook his head ruefully. “\u0027Tis your coin.” He nodded to the front of the ship, at a structure standing one deck high, nesded in the bow. “We keep the young lads there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the crew\u0027s quarters?” Cormac looked suspicious, and it put Marjorie on alert. “Why not the hold?” Jack sighed dramatically. “There was two or three of the men what was beginning to pay the lads too much mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had to stow them in the foc\u0027sle instead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie shivered. If Davie had been touched or harmed in any way, she\u0027d come back and personally send each and every one of the men to find their fates on a foreign plantation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s eyes flicked to Marjorie, and for a second, some vile thing glimmered there. “Come on, then,” he said, strolling to the forecastle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Cormac stood firm. “We\u0027ll not go below.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack sneered. “Just you then, if the lady wife is too afeared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The lady wife doesn\u0027t leave my sight.” He stepped beside her. “You\u0027ll bring the boys above deck if you want to see your coin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt struck Marjorie that these foul men could simply take their coin, and there\u0027d be none to stop them. Cormac was right; there was no way she was going down into the crew\u0027s quarters. Who knew what awaited them there. She sidled even closer to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The boys are tied,” Jack protested. “You canna expect me to drag the whole line of squirming, wee pests on deck, like a drove of cattle to market.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s precisely what I expect.” Cormac rubbed the side of his coat, and seeing the bulge, Marjorie realized he had a pistol holstered there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s eyes went flat, and then, with a single resentful nod, he headed to the front of the ship and disappeared into the hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No worries, Ree.” He affected a smile that she suspected was purely for her benefit. “Neither of us will be going belowdecks. I can assure you, I\u0027ve had my fill of tight spaces for one lifetime.” The comment threw her for a moment, until she realized the episode with Aidan surely would have traumatized him in more ways than one. “Is it because of the chimney? Do you not like to be enclosed?” He only looked at her, but his gaze was distant, some faraway memory replaying in his mind. Finally, he said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could say I\u0027m not overly fond of confinement, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac tossed the reply off to her with the same nonchalance he\u0027d been feigning all morning. Though he\u0027d been pretending calm, he\u0027d been on alert since the moment he\u0027d shouted a summons to the hands on deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t wanted to alarm her. Though true, he hadn\u0027t exactly been comfortable in tight spaces since getting stuck as a boy, the real reason he didn\u0027t want to go belowdecks was far more pressing. The deckhands needed but one sharp hit to the back of Cormac\u0027s skull, and they could be off with Ree, away to do the devil knew what with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when they were done, he imagined she\u0027d fetch a pretty price in the middle of the Indies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the thought of it had his hand touching the weapon at his side, an old wheel-lock pistol that\u0027d belonged to a grandfather he\u0027d never known. God spare him, it was good to be wearing a pistol again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a hopeful thought flickered bright in the recesses of his mind. Might they truly be close to retrieving Davie? Subterfuge, idle threats, and a whole lot of confident posturing had gotten them this far. Could his godforsaken gifts for killing and spying actually be used for good?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps he was redeemable after all. The notion brought him closer to Ree\u0027s side. She looked up at him, and though she had a quizzical look on her face, she remained silent. He put his hand at her slender waist, giving her a gentle squeeze. She had her own sense for subterfuge, God love her, though the poor thing must be a bundle of nerves inside, despite her bravado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedemption. The thought made his heart clench. If such a thing were possible, he had Ree to thank for his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a ruckus, and he felt her stiffen at his side. “Steady, Ree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Settle yerselves!” The grizzled man with the missing teeth emerged from the forecastle, shouting orders down the ladder. “One by one, or you\u0027re all in for a flogging.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took in a sharp breath, and Cormac whispered, “Be calm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half dozen boys gradually spilled one at a time onto the deck, all filthy and squinting as though they hadn\u0027t seen the sun in days. The biggest of the lot couldn\u0027t have been older than ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac scanned the group, and Davie stood out at once. A little ginger-haired boy, just as she\u0027d described. He hoped the lad had sense and didn\u0027t give them away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRee gasped, and he was quick to steady her with a firm hand at her elbow. It would do them no good if she were the one who spoiled their disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the instant Davie spotted her; the boy\u0027s mouth gaped, and his freckled cheeks turned apple red. Cormac watched Ree in his peripheral vision as she silenced the lad with a sharp shake of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These are them.” Jack was back among them, watching Cormac and Marjorie very carefully. “And a sorry lot they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac\u0027s mind raced. He needed to improve upon what was a threadbare story. Jack was growing suspicious, and the last thing they needed was a suspicious smuggler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stared Marjorie up and down, as though he were trying to work something out. “If you decide you want older—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Cormac interrupted, choosing his strategy. “These lads are just what we had in mind. My wife… a bairn has yet to quicken… “ He mimicked hesitation. “She\u0027s been unable… you ken my meaning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” Jack said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye. That\u0027s why so young.” Cormac heaved a sigh of relief that wasn\u0027t entirely pretense. “Lady Brodie has a fancy for ginger-haired lads, so we\u0027ll be taking—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie stepped forward. “We\u0027ll take them all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac\u0027s eyes shot to Marjorie in disbelief. Had she really just said what he thought she\u0027d said? She stood, staring at the smuggler. He recognized the tilt of her chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Och, good Christ… “ he hissed under his breath. So much for allaying Jack\u0027s suspicions. “All” — he quickly counted — “six, love?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye.” She gave one resolute nod, avoiding his gaze. “My… sister has needs as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm-hm.” Cormac\u0027s eyes narrowed, focusing on Jack. They definitely didn\u0027t have coin enough for all the boys. But Marjorie had made a decision, and they were in it now. “The lady has spoken.” Jack had a strange, fixed look on his face, considering his next move. His arm angled up, hand poised over the sword on his hip. “I\u0027ll see the money, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, the money.” Taking Marjorie\u0027s hand, Cormac took a step back toward the ladder. How was he to get all the boys and her off the boat safely? “First, my lady wife takes the boys off the boat. Then we deal with the money.” Marjorie gasped. “But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac squeezed her hand, giving her a pointed look. “I\u0027ll not have you a party to our transaction.” He purposely stressed the last word, as though to imply the exchange of coin was a dirty thing unfit for feminine eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack wrapped his hand around the hilt of his sword, well past pretense now. “There best be gold in that wee pouch of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ll have your gold.” Cormac scanned the deck, tallying the number of deckhands posing a threat. Jack had a sword. The old man wore a rusted fish knife in a scabbard at his waist. And there was one sailor standing alongside Jack — likely his first mate — and though he bore no visible weapons, there\u0027d be at least a dirk tucked in the belt at his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other crew members were either too far away, in the rigging, or simply not paying them any mind. Even so, Cormac imagined the moment he made a move on their captain, they\u0027d become an issue soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to better his odds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ll get your payment belowdecks,” Cormac said, his voice steely. He shot Marjorie a meaningful look. “But first, you will get off the ship. You and the boys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look she gave him was terror and anger and regret. He had time for none of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now. “ Cormac swaggered over to the boys, mimicking contempt. “It seems I own you now.” Jack watched quietly, momentarily appeased by the prospect of money. Or maybe the smuggler was simply appeased by the thought of getting Cormac below, where he\u0027d knock him senseless and whisk him into indentured servitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac scowled. Either way, it was just one more concern he had no time for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis only care was for Marjorie… and the lads, he unwillingly admitted to himself. He glared at them with mock disdain. Cords bound their hands at their bellies, with each boy tethered to the next by a single stretch of rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsheathing the tiny sgian dubh from his leg, he began to saw at the first of the bonds. “I\u0027ll not know what my wife sees in you ugly lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first to be freed was a lad no older than ten. The picture of Aidan popped into Cormac\u0027s mind, and he shoved it away again. He kicked the boy toward the side of the ship. “If you don\u0027t hasten down that ladder, I vow I\u0027ll leave you behind, paid for or no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hated to be cruel — he\u0027d tried to be as gentle as possible — but they had a ruse to maintain. It was life or death now. He prayed they lived long enough for the boy to thank him later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loosened the next few, and they scuttled toward the side, limping in a way that made his heart crack. Cold single-mindedness mellowed into calm resolve. If he ended up dying to save these boys for Marjorie, so be it. He\u0027d known all along his life was forfeit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You,” he barked at the eldest. “You go down and hold the ladder for Lady Brodie.” Marjorie would just have to manage the rungs on her own. He had enough to contend with on board. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-37.html","bookId":2656,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM"}
