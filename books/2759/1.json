I know from experience that if I’m sleeping, it’ll still be there when I wake up. A pungent reminder of a night I’ll never get away from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a hell that I’ll never escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as I squirm, as I try to wake, a noise penetrates my consciousness, a noise that doesn’t belong in this dream. I know that because I’ve relived the same nightmare a hundred times. This new sound and sensation don’t belong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the unmistakable crunch of bone in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes snap open and I look around, registering several things at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am in a whorehouse in Kabul, the same one I always use. The girl’s black hair is grasped tightly in my fingers, wrapped around my left hand. With my right, I clutch her limp hand, her broken fingers splayed at unnatural angles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately release her fingers and she stares at me, pressing her other hand to her mouth to contain a scream. Tears flood her eyes and spill down her crushed cheek. The blood turns her tears red and I realize something. The smell of blood wasn’t coming from my dream. It was coming from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is blood everywhere, spewing from her nose and her eye, from the entire side of her shattered face, dripping onto her naked olive skin and staining the yellowed sheets of the bed. I gasp and instinctively back away from her in horror, my gut tightening in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the fuck?” I manage to choke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I move, she cradles her broken hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand that I broke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat forms immediately on my brow and my heart pounds wildly. I did this to her. I did this to her. What the fuck have I done? I’m panicked and shaken, but at the same time, my training kicks in and I pull myself together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I tell her quickly, gathering my wits and stepping toward her, reaching out to assess her injuries. She flinches away, fear apparent in her wild eyes as she turns her shoulders away from me, as if to absorb another blow. My gut sinks at her response, at the knowledge that she is terrified of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sick realization that she has a reason to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard, the thick taste of self-revulsion pooling in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” I tell her raggedly, holding my hand out. “Let me see. I won’t hurt you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prostitute, a slender girl named Niki, trembles but forces herself to remain still as I feel her arms and legs. She sucks in a breath when I get too close to her broken hand, but rigidly allows me to examine everything else. It’s almost odd. I’ve fucked this girl twenty different ways to Sunday, but right now she’s as distant as a stranger. Because she’s terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so sorry,” I tell her, glancing away from her stiff blood-spattered shoulders. “I won’t come here anymore. I was asleep. I didn’t know what I was doing. I won’t ever hurt you again, Niki. I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of her eyes is swollen shut, but the other one widens at my words and she grabs me with her good hand. Her fingers are cold and they shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she whispers. “If you stay away, they will beat me for being unpleasing to you. Please. Do not stay away, soldier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her, aghast. “I just beat you,” I tell her slowly. “I didn’t mean to, but that’s not an excuse. I just beat you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiki shakes her head, flinching as the movement causes her pain. Guilt floods through me. I hurt an innocent woman. Jesus Christ. I’m a monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were sleeping,” Niki says adamantly. “You have nightmares when you sleep. It wasn’t you. It was the bad thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bad thing?” I ask uncertainly, my eyes frozen on her bloody face. She nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It chases you,” she answers solemnly in her thick Afghan accent. “It is different for everyone, but it chases us all. The bad thing caught you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bad thing caught me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard, trying to dislodge the fucking lump that has formed in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Niki,” I tell her again. “Maybe the bad thing did catch me. I swear I’ll make it right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me curiously, her body tense with pain, but stays motionless as I wrap a sheet around her shoulders and quickly get dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m out the door and down the hall within a minute. I ignore the moans and shrieks and thumping noises coming from the other dark, tiny rooms as I make my way down the battered hallway to the office. I know the man in charge sits in there, because I pay him every time I visit Niki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at me in surprise when I walk in, but I don’t hesitate. I toss all the money that I have in my wallet onto his desk; all the strange-looking foreign money that is equivalent to hundreds and hundreds of US dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The girl has pleased me,” I tell him quietly. “I will be returning to the United States, but I’ll miss her. She should be rewarded. Also, she needs a doctor. She’s hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stares up at me, his dark gaze gleaming at the sight of the large pile of money. He nods curtly without speaking, clearly unworried about the bloody girl down the hall as he snakes out dark fingers to scrape the bills toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She needs a doctor,” I tell him firmly, gritting the words from between my teeth. “Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slam my fist down on his table, hard, right in the middle of the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at me and wordlessly picks up the phone. He mutters words into it that I can’t understand, then hangs up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is done,” he says shortly, returning his attention to the papers on his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word I slip out into the darkened streets of Kabul, making my way back to my camp outside of town. After I’m back in my tent, I mechanically begin folding things neatly into my knapsack. When my fingers brush against my satellite phone, I pick it up, then punch numbers into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Colonel?” I say when he answers. “You’re gonna need to send another XO out here. I’m coming in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colonel doesn’t ask why. He knows me well enough to trust my judgment calls. If I say I’m coming in from the field, he trusts that there’s a good reason. And of course there is. This is the only life I’ve ever wanted. Only something monumental would force me to walk away from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bad thing caught you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never retreated in my life. I’ve never backed away from a fight and I’ve never cowered in fear. Ever. That’s not who I am. But I’ve been in combat long enough to know that when something unbeatable chases you, you do the only thing you can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight Months Later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChicago\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music in this club is so loud that it literally thumps in my chest, rattling into my rib cage. What the hell do people see in places like this? I cough from the fog-maker’s smoke, then strain my neck as I try to find my friend Jacey among the hundreds of sweaty people crammed in this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last I saw, she’d disappeared into a dark corner with her loser boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you seen my friend? The blonde in the tight red shirt?” I yell to the random guy who has been intently watching me like a creeper for ten minutes. He smiles a piranha grin and inches toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he yells back. “But we don’t need her for what I have in mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not now, not ever,” I answer coldly, turning my back on him to search the crush of people on the dance floor. I seriously just want to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow I let Jacey talk me into coming into the city to celebrate her birthday is far, far beyond me right now. I’m supposed to finally meet her brother tonight, but Jacey disappeared with her boyfriend over an hour ago and I haven’t seen them since. My feet hurt, I’m exhausted from working sixty hours this week and I need something to eat before I stab someone’s eye out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing my limitations, I make my way through the bar and onto the sidewalk out front. I’ve got to get out of here. I’m the one who drove us, but I’m sure Jacey can get a ride home with Peter if she needs to. Her boyfriend can’t hold down a job, but at least he can drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my phone out. I’m leaving. Can you catch a ride home with Peter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I send the text, I realize that she’s not going to be able to hear it. So who knows when she’ll see it? With a sigh, I decide I have to hunt for her. At least for a few minutes. It wouldn’t be right to just leave her here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I wanted to have public sex with my boyfriend, where would I be?” I muse aloud, trying to think like Jacey as I walk around to the side of the club. Jacey is pathetically bad about PDA. She doesn’t give a flying eff what people think about her. It’s one thing that I both admire about her and get annoyed at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I get farther and farther away from the sidewalk and into the shadows, it seems more and more like someplace Jacey and Peter might be getting it on against the building. But at the same time, it also seems like the perfect place to get mugged. It makes me instantly nervous and I glance around quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m in an alley now, a narrow wet street that is littered with trash and graffiti. My heels click on the glistening asphalt and I take a deep breath, enjoying the fresh air as the inky darkness swallows me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God I’m out of that club. That’s my main thought as I walk farther into the darkness, but even still, I reach into my purse and grip my little can of pepper-spray. It doesn’t hurt to be prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s nobody here. That much is apparent as I take in the dirty building, the heaping trash bins and the empty shadows. Well, I’m hoping the shadows are empty, anyway. They seem to be. And I seem to be all alone. While that’s comforting on the one hand, it’s frustrating on the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jacey, where the fuck are you?” I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I’m getting ready to give up and head back into the club, I catch sight of something that snags my attention and I stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guy is leaning against the building a little ways from me, half in the darkness, half in the light. Normally that wouldn’t give me pause, especially since I’m in an alley alone. But something about his posture intrigues me, something that I can’t quite put my finger on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peer at him more closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis long legs are crossed gracefully in front of him as he leans against the building. And holy cow, he’s big. He’s got to be a few inches over six feet tall with a broad chest and wide shoulders that narrow into a slender waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s chilly outside, but he’s not wearing a jacket, only a snug black T-shirt and a pair of perfectly fitting jeans. There isn’t a trace of fat on him. He’s lean and muscled, with short darkish hair. From the side his features are chiseled and from what I can tell, he’s got just the barest hint of stubble along his strong jaw. That’s an instant turn-on for me. It seems so rugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this guy… he definitely seems rugged. Everything about him screams strength and power. That’s an instant turn-on for me too. I decide that this is what intrigues me. He’s like power personified. He holds himself with purpose. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-leave-beautifully-broken-2/page-1.html","bookId":2759,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM"}
