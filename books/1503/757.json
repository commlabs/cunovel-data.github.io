Not only had he completed his mission, his own cultivation had improved greatly, with his Saint Energy actually reaching the thirty eighth stage, one step closer to his Saint Core Nucleus. Zhou Weiqing could vaguely sense that if he really managed to consolidate the Saint Core Nucleus, his power would rise qualitatively again. Then, perhaps he could even take on Heavenly God Tier powerhouses without being too afraid, let alone Heavenly Emperors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe speed of the\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSea Emperor’s Shuttle was already extremely fast, and with Zhou Weiqing infusing as much Saint Energy as it could take, it sped along like a bolt of lightning cutting through the oceans.

Since Zhou Weiqing was using his Saint Energy to activate the Sea Emperor’s Shuttle, his senses had been extended out a great distance and with maximum sensitivity, as if the Sea Emperor’s Shuttle was part of his body. At this moment, the entire Sea Emperor’s Shuttle felt as if it had slammed into a giant, invisible net, the powerful constraints causing their speed to slow drastically.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen they looked out, everything seemed normal, the ocean waters still as clear and as beautiful as ever.

This fellow was just like a ghost haunting him, always appearing inexorably and seeking vengeance. He had already been pushing the Sea Emperor Shuttle at an extreme speed, yet he had still been intercepted by it. This luck, it was really…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf the situation had been similar to their journey to the Xuantian Continent, Zhou Weiqing would definitely not have overlooked this critical detail, possibly taking a long way around. However, this time he was accompanied by the two great Dragons, and thus he had not bothered trying to hide, just taking the most direct route. Who would have imagined that he would really meet this Terror Sea Dragon once more.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt had barely been a few days since they had last clashed, but it looked like this fellow had not only recovered fully, it had also become larger and stronger.

If he was not using the Sea Emperor Shuttle, in the vast oceans, no matter how powerful the Terror Sea Dragon was, how could it possibly discover them? However, the Sea Emperor Shuttle was after all created using the Heavenly Core of the Terror Sea Dragon’s father, and the aura it gave off was just too familiar to it. How could it possibly not be able to sense it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSuddenly sensing such a familiar presence, this Terror Sea Dragon had naturally rushed over to investigate. As for the reason why its cultivation had risen so suddenly, it was actually not that it had gained some inspiration or benefit in the big fight, but rather because after the fight, although its brother had self-detonated its Heavenly Core Nucleus, it had not fully succeeded. As such, a portion of its Heavenly Core had remained, sinking to the depths of the oceans. Since the ocean was its domain, how could this Terror Sea Dragon not be able to find it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was exactly because it could depend on the remnants of its brother’s Heavenly Core that it was able to recover in such a short period of time, and improve its cultivation level as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It looks like your luck is really not bad at all,” Zhou Weiqing said to Shangguan Bing’er beside him, totally ignoring the Terror Sea Dragon. The only thing he continued to do was soar higher with Bing’er, attempting to draw open the gap between themselves and the Terror Sea Dragon.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCurrently, Shangguan Bing’er was definitely very nervous. After all, the Terror Sea Dragon was a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, a hegemon over the oceans. Furthermore, its look was so savage and ferocious.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Is that the Terror Sea Dragon?” Shangguan Bing’er asked worriedly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Yes, but do not worry.

Its massive body actually sprang out of the waters. Although it did not have wings, with its powerful cultivation, flying in the air was naturally not a problem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the oceans, its senses and perception were extremely powerful. It had been looking out for Dongfang Hanyue, and it had long realised that this time she was not following Zhou Weiqing. As for the other human beside him, she was even weaker, and it dismissed her at once, not worried at all.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Terror Sea Dragon hated Zhou Weiqing to the core. If it was not able to torture him to death, it would not rest.

The Terror Sea Dragon was following behind them. Currently, the skies were an azure blue as the Water Attribute energies grew stronger all about them, beginning to exert a binding force upon them that grew stronger by the minute, causing their speeds to slow down as time went by.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was actually because the Terror Sea Dragon wanted them to slowly feel fear, bit by bit. After all, Zhou Weiqing was now ‘alone’, and though he had launched a surprisingly strong attack previously, what kind of existence was the Terror Sea Dragon? Naturally, it sensed a temporary eruption of power. This time, not only had it grown stronger, it was also fully prepared, ready to squash Zhou Weiqing like the little bug he was.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe terrifying energy reverberations flowed in the sky. At this moment, even Zhou Weiqing was feeling rather nervous. However, this nervousness was not regarding whether or not they could escape from the Terror Sea Dragon, but whether or not they could successfully kill the Terror Sea Dragon before it escaped.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Little brat, today you will not have any other chances.

Since it was just Zhou Weiqing, it naturally did not deem it necessary to immerse its body in the oceans.

If they took into account the dangers of the oceans, he would not choose such a straight-line fashion to travel back to the Boundless Mainland. However, he was currently so bold because he was now able to rely on others, and his confidence was far greater now, even compared to when he was in the Xuantian Palace. After all, at that time, he did not know if the summons would actually succeed, but now he had no such worries.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTwo balls of red light swelled out from Zhou Weiqing’s chest.

With the sudden appearance of a Heavenly God Tier, how could the two dragons not pay attention to it and attach great importance to the matter? Zhou Weiqing luring the Terror Sea Dragon into the skies was actually a suggestion from Hui Yao. He knew that if the Terror Sea Dragon was in the oceans, although they could still easily defeat it, it would still not be easy for them to stop it from escaping. After all, the geographical and attribute advantage was just too obvious. However, once they were all in the skies, the situation would be vastly different.
