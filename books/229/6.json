{"id":7055,"no":6,"title":"The Orientation","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs I turned the rental car onto Morrie\u0027s street in West Newton, a quiet suburb of Boston, I had a cup of coffee in one hand and a cellular phone between my ear and shoulder. I was talking to a TV producer about a piece we were doing. My eyes jumped from the digital clock-my return flight was in a few hours-to the mailbox numbers on the tree-lined suburban street. The car radio was on, the all-news station. This was how I operated, five things at once.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Roll back the tape,\" I said to the producer. \"Let me hear that part again.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said. \"It\u0027s gonna take a second.\" Suddenly, I was upon the house. I pushed the brakes, spilling coffee in my lap. As the car stopped, I caught a glimpse of a large Japanese maple tree and three figures sitting near it in the driveway, a young man and a middleaged woman flanking a small old man in a wheelchair. Morrie.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the sight of my old professor, I froze.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" the producer said in my ear. \"Did I lose you?... \"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI had not seen him in sixteen years. His hair was thinner, nearly white, and his face was gaunt. I suddenly felt unprepared for this reunion-for one thing, I was stuck on the phone-and I hoped that he hadn\u0027t noticed my arrival, so that I could drive around the block a few more times, finish my business, get mentally ready. But Morrie, this new, withered version of a man I had once known so well, was smiling at the car, hands folded in his lap, waiting for me to emerge.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey?\" the producer said again. \"Are you there?\" For all the time we\u0027d spent together, for all the kindness and patience Morrie had shown me when I was young, I should have dropped the phone and jumped from the car, run and held him and kissed him hello. Instead, I killed the engine and sunk down off the seat, as if I were looking for something.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, I\u0027m here,\" I whispered, and continued my conversation with the TV producer until we were finished.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI did what I had become best at doing: I tended to my work, even while my dying professor waited on his front lawn. I am not proud of this, but that is what I did.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e\"My old friend,\" he whispered, \"you\u0027ve come back at last.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe rocked against me, not letting go, his hands reaching up for my elbows as I bent over him. I was surprised at such affection after all these years, but then, in the stone walls I had built between my present and my past, I had forgotten how close we once were. I remembered graduation day, the briefcase, his tears at my departure, and I swallowed because I knew, deep down, that I was no longer the good, gift-bearing student he remembered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI only hoped that, for the next few hours, I could fool him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eInside the house, we sat at a walnut dining room table, near a window that looked out on the neighbor\u0027s house. Morrie fussed with his wheelchair, trying to get comfortable. As was his custom, he wanted to feed me, and I said all right. One of the helpers, a stout Italian woman named Connie, cut up bread and tomatoes and brought containers of chicken salad, hummus, and tabouli.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe also brought some pills. Morrie looked at them and sighed. His eyes were more sunken than I remembered them, and his cheekbones more pronounced. This gave him a harsher, older look-until he smiled, of course, and the sagging cheeks gathered up like curtains.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch,\" he said softly, \"you know that I\u0027m dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI knew.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then.\" Morrie swallowed the pills, put down the paper cup, inhaled deeply, then let it out. \"Shall I tell you what it\u0027s like?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat it\u0027s like? To die?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I was unaware of it, our last class had just begun.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eI finish that first course with him and enroll for another. He is an easy marker; he does not much care for grades. One year, they say, during the Vietnam War, Morrie gave all his male students A\u0027s to help them keep their student deferments.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI begin to call Morrie \"Coach,\" the way I used to address my high school track coach. Morrie likes the nickname.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Coach, \" he says. \"All right, I\u0027ll be your coach. And you can be my player. You can play all the lovely parts of life that I\u0027m too old for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSometimes we eat together in the cafeteria. Morrie, to my delight, is even more of a slob than I am. He talks instead of chewing, laughs with his mouth open, delivers a passionate thought through a mouthful of egg salad, the little yellow pieces spewing from his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt cracks me up. The whole time I know him, I have two overwhelming desires: to hug him and to give him a napkin.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/260/2457.html","bookId":229,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:24:00 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:24:00 AM"}
