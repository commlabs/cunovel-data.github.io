I was racked with pain and torment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what did Alexander have to say?\" my mom asked. \"Are they staying in town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be devastated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears began to roll down my already-soaked cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were so taken with his parents, too. We were hoping to spend more time with them. I\u0027m so sorry, honey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could barely speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought they liked it here, but I must say that I can imagine it would be difficult for them,\" my mom said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, because she wears a corset?And uses an umbrella to block the moonlight?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gripe about how conservative this town is,\" my mom said. \"They might be seeking someplace more cosmopolitan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are the chances-if Alexander does move that I could go with him?\" I asked my dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zero,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey,\" my mom said softly, \"I know he is your first love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my only love!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she continued, \"but you are only sixteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m almost seventeen. Juliet was married at that age!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And look what happened toher \" my dad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t funny! If Alexander moves, my life is over- pure and simple. I\u0027ll never wake up again.\" I burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom hugged me like I was a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t theSterlings like it here?\" I sobbed. \"Why do they have to go back toRomania ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they have family there,\" my mom said, brushing my hair away from my tearstained face. \"That is their home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is Alexander\u0027s home. If we buy it-then Alexander can live there. He\u0027s almost eighteen, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure we can afford two homes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But can\u0027t you try? Use my college money. I\u0027ll get a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you are thinking.\" My dad smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll do it.\" But then I calculated the wages I\u0027d made when I worked at Armstrong Travel. \"It would take me years working part-time to earn enough for \u0027Jill a house,\" I said, frustrated. \"By then I\u0027ll be buying into a retirement community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When your mother went back home at the beginning of college summer break/\u0027 my dad said, \"I was so lonely. I wrote her letters every day and called her. That was long before the Internet and cell phones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An e- mail is not going to replace Alexander,\" I said, and stormed off to my bedroom. \"Nothing will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was one time there was nothing my parents could say that would comfort me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the following day the news that theBensonHillMansion was for sale had swept through Dullsville like a tornado. However, the only damage it was causing was to my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\" Becky asked at my house the next morning as I was still lying in bed. \"Is Alexander moving, too? Where is he going to live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, get up. We\u0027re going to be late. I mean, later than usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want him to move. I\u0027d die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want him to move and he\u0027s not even my boy friend. He\u0027s so perfect for you. And I\u0027d hate to see you without your true love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is, like, the worst news ever!\" I cried out. It was true-there was no way around it. My world was crashing around me. \"I can\u0027t go to school today!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky tugged at my shirt. \"You have to go. I\u0027m not going to let you stay here and sulk. School will get your mind off of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter splashing cold water on my face and promising to help solve my problem, Becky was successful at dragging me to school. But when we arrived I was far from distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mansion\u0027s for sale and Alexander has to move back toRomania ,\" Becky said as soon as she saw Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents told me last night when I got home. That totally sucks, Raven. Word has it that they are selling it and are going to build a house next to the cemetery\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWord has it? It was just announced in the paper yesterday morning. \"Who did you hear that from-Trevor? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\" Matt asked, like I was clairvoyant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Trevor\u0027s scenario was better than the reality. At least Alexander would remain in Dullsville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was as miserably morbid as my black attire. I spent the day daydreaming about a life inRomania with theSterlings .The four of us as vampires, without any downside.A life of eternal love and beauty and moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore class I was at the vending machine buying a soda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally that horrible mansion is for sale,\" I overheard aPradabee say. \"Hopefully they\u0027ll burn it down and put up a shopping mall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you finally scared him away\" Trevor said at my locker before English class. \"I guess when his parents sawyou, they had to pack their coffins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you even start withme. Not today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when then? When will we start our essays?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have our list of questions and my answers are blank,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To match your brain?That\u0027s not my fault,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half the soccer team is almost finished with theirs and we haven\u0027t even started. I know you\u0027re a procrastinator, but I\u0027m not cramming this in the night before it\u0027s due. Unless we pull an all-nighter-then I\u0027m game.\" His suggestive gaze bore through me. \"I know how you like to sleep in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snarled and slammed my locker shut. \"I have a lot on my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor blocked my exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better do this assignment. You heard what Mrs.Naper said. If I fail this, it could affect my grades for college. I\u0027m not going to spend the rest of my life in prison with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll finish it in time. I\u0027ve just been preoccupied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing what? Polishing gravestones? Painting your nails with blacktop? Conjuring the dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was getting on my bad side. \"Then maybe I won\u0027t do it,\" I challenged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor paused. His face grew red with anger. \"I knew that was your plan all along. I\u0027m not going to let you ruin my chances for a soccer scholarship, Monster Girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bell rang, ending our hostile discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bother asking me to walk you to class,\" he said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere I was worried Trevor was planning to sabotage me when all along he was thinking I was going to do the same to him. My nemesis and I were more alike than I ever would care to admit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember, I know where you live,\" he said in his most threatening voice, \"and that monster family, too. And believeme, they will be here for a while. That house won\u0027t sell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor started off for English class in a huff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was taken aback by my nemesis\u0027 last statement. I raced after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean the Mansion won\u0027t sell?\" I asked, jumping in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do they think they can sell that bat trap to?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s an eyesore. And my dad says it\u0027s a major money pit. With all the new houses being built, who would buy a ghost- filled broken-down home when someone could buy a brand- new one?\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor\u0027s injurious comment was actually a blessing in disguise. If the Mansion didn\u0027t sell, then Alexander couldn\u0027t move. My boyfriend could remain in Dullsville forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could almost kiss you,\" I surprised myself by saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why don\u0027t you?\" he asked, his eyes piercing through mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then the second bell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not enough time!\" I said, and escaped into class. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-21.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
