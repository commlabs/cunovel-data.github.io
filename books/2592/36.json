Come in, come in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked away and blushed deeply, then shuffled into the office and carefully sat down in the chair across the desk from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m a big fan, Mr. Ellis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t there a law against formality at this place?” I said with an expression of mock distaste, hoping to relax him since he was sitting so rigidly in the chair. “Call me Bret.” I paused. “And have we met before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, I’m Clayton and I’m a freshman here and I don’t think so,” the boy said. “I just wanted to know if you could sign this for me.” His hands trembled slightly as he held up the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. I’d be happy to.” I studied him as he handed me the book, which was in pristine condition. I opened it to the copyright page and saw it was a first edition, which made the book I was holding an extremely rare and valuable copy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have class in a couple of minutes, so . . .” He gestured at himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, of course. I won’t keep you long.” I set the book down and searched my desk for a pen. “So, Clayton . . . I assume all your friends call you Clay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me and then—understanding what I was getting at—grinned and said, “Yeah.” He waved a hand at the book. “Like Clay in the novel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the connection I made,” I said, opening a drawer. “Is there another?” I found a pen and then looked up. He was staring at me questioningly. “That’s the right one. You were correct,” I assured him, but then I couldn’t help it: “You look very familiar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, what are you majoring in?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to be a writer.” It seemed hard for him to admit this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you apply to my writing course?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a freshman. It’s only open to juniors and seniors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I could have pulled a few strings,” I said delicately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Based on what?” he asked, a snap in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized that I was flirting with him and suddenly looked back at the book and the pen in my hand, embarrassed for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not really any good,” he offered, sitting up, noting the sudden, subtle shift in the room’s vibe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, neither are any of my other students so you’d fit right in.” I laughed dryly. He did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My parents . . .” Again, he hesitated. “Well, my dad, actually . . . he wanted me to go to business school and so . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah yes, the age-old dilemma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton purposefully checked his watch—another gesture that indicated he needed to go. “You can just sign my name—I mean, your name.” He stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you working on anything?” I asked gently as I signed my name with an uncharacteristic flourish on the title page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I have part of a novel done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed him back the book. “Well, if you’re interested in showing me anything . . .” I left the offer hanging there, waiting for him to accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point I realized where I’d seen Clayton before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was at the Halloween party last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dressed as Patrick Bateman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had seen him when I was looking out Sarah’s window as he disappeared into the darkness of Elsinore Lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed in, something caught in me and I shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was putting the book in his backpack when I asked, “So, you weren’t at the party my wife and I threw last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stiffened and said, “No. No, I wasn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was answered so genuinely that I couldn’t register if he was lying or not. Plus, if he’d crashed the party, why admit to it now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? I thought I saw you there.” I couldn’t help but keep pressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, no, wasn’t me.” He just stood in front of my desk, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized I needed to say something that would get him moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it was nice meeting you, Clayton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held out a hand. He abruptly shook it and looked away, mumbling his thanks as I heard footsteps coming down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton heard the footsteps too and, without saying anything else, turned to leave my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Aimee Light bumped into him in the doorway and they glanced at each other briefly before Clayton rushed away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-36.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
