They hadn’t had a moment alone all evening. His heart was crammed full with all the things he wanted to say to her, and couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never seen a handsomer groom,” she whispered back and when she looked at him, her eyes softened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase filled his plate. “I meant what I said.” He knew that sounded melodramatic and a little trite, but he couldn’t keep it to himself any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?” Lesley added a cherry tomato to her plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The vows. I wasn’t just repeating a bunch of meaningless phrases, I meant them, Lesley. I’m going to do everything in my power to be the right kind of husband to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t look at him, didn’t move, and he wondered, briefly, if he’d frightened her with his intensity, or perhaps shocked her. “Lesley?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” she whispered brokenly, staring down at the bowl of pasta salad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shouldn’t have told you that.” She was suffering from pangs of guilt, he reasoned. The ceremony obviously hadn’t affected her the way it had him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No… Oh, Chase, that was the most beautiful thing you could’ve said.” She raised her eyes to his and he saw she was struggling to hold back tears. “I meant it, too, every word. I’m eager to show you how good a wife I intend to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil the moment Lesley had walked into the hotel that afternoon, Chase wasn’t entirely convinced she’d show up for the wedding. All day he’d tried to brace himself in case she didn’t. Now she was his wife, and there was no turning back for either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going for your honeymoon?” Daisy asked, filling her plate on the opposite side of the buffet table. “I meant to ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Victoria,” Chase answered. He hadn’t said anything to Lesley, wanting to surprise her. That didn’t seem important now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Victoria,” she repeated. “Oh, Chase, what a wonderful idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t imagine you’re going to do much sight seeing, though,” Daisy added with a suggestive chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daisy!” Lesley said as she blushed becomingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir honeymoon. The words floated through his mind. Not knowing if Lesley would even be there for the wedding, he’d put off all thoughts as to what would follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d wanted to make love with Lesley almost from the moment they’d met. But he was determined not to enter into the physical side of their relationship until they were both prepared to deal with it. To accept the emotional repercussions of that aspect of their lives—of their life together. He didn’t know about Lesley, but he was more than ready. He only hoped she was, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir guests didn’t seem in any hurry to leave. The champagne flowed freely, but Chase drank only a small amount. He needed a clear head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left, under a spray of rice and birdseed. He placed Lesley’s suitcase in the back of his rental car and ran around to the front of the vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ready?” he asked, smiling over at his wife. His wife. The word still felt awkward in his mind. Awkward, but very right. He’d accomplished what he’d set out to do. He’d gotten himself a bride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one bride he’d wanted above all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The honeymoon suite,” Lesley whispered as the bellman carried in their suitcases. “You booked us the honeymoon suite?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase gave the bellman a generous tip and let him out the door. “Why are you so surprised? We’re on our honeymoon, aren’t we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but, oh, I don’t know…” She walked around the room and ran her hand over the plush bedspread on the king-size bed. “Oh, Chase, look,” she said after she’d walked into the bathroom. “The tub’s huge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Imagine wasting all that water,” he teased, enjoying her excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They left champagne and chocolates, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll file a complaint. How are any two people supposed to survive on that? A man needs real food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s always room service.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” he said, laughing. “I forgot about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Chase, this is so lovely.” She seemed shy about touching him, stopping just short of his arms. He was a bit embarrassed himself, although he didn’t understand why. Lesley was his wife and he was her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I think I’ll unpack,” she said, reaching for her suitcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good idea.” There was definitely something wrong with him. Lesley should be in his arms by now, begging him to make love to her. Instead, they were standing back to back emptying their suitcases, as though they had every intention of wearing all those clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you hungry?” he asked, just to make conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but if you want to order something, go ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine.” No, he wasn’t. His temperature was rising by the minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I’ll take a bath,” she said next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good idea.” He realized after he spoke that she might find his enthusiasm a bit insulting, but by the time he thought to say something she was in the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of running water filled the suite. He noted that she’d left the door ajar, but he wasn’t certain she’d done it on purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocusing his attention on unpacking, Chase opened and closed several drawers, but his mind wasn’t on putting his clothes in any order. It was on Lesley in the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley removing her clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley stepping naked into the big tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley sighing that soft, womanly sigh of hers as she slipped into the steaming water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image was so powerful that Chase sagged onto the edge of the bed. He didn’t know what was the matter with him. They were married, and he was acting like a choirboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like me to wash your back?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase’s spirits lifted. That sounded encouraging. He smoothed back his hair and rolled up his sleeves before advancing into the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley was exactly as he’d pictured her. She was lying in the tub, surrounded by frothy bubbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent of blooming roses wafted up to him, and her pink toes were perched against the far end. The welcome he saw in her eyes made his heart beat so furiously that for a moment he couldn’t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleared his throat. “How’s the water?” he asked, shoving his hands in his pants pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see you’ve added a bunch of women’s stuff to that water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Women’s stuff?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bubble bath or whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not in the least.” It was driving him slowly insane, but that didn’t bother him nearly as much as the view he had of her body. She raised one knee and the bubbles slid down her leg in a slow, tantalizing pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer leg was pink from the steamy water and for the life of him, he couldn’t stop staring at it. For the life of him he couldn’t stop thinking about that same leg wrapped around his waist.…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The, uh, water looks inviting.” His tongue nearly stuck to the roof of his mouth, he was so excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you care to join me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart was doing that crazy pounding again. “You sure? I mean…” Darned if he knew what he meant. “Should I bring the champagne and chocolates?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just the champagne. Let’s save the chocolates for later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nearly stumbled out of the room in his eagerness to get her what she wanted. He opened the bottle and the popping sound echoed like a small explosion. His hands trembled as he poured them each a flute of champagne. He carried them into the other room, then handed her the glass and sipped from his own, badly needing the temporary courage it offered. Then he realized Lesley hadn’t tasted hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll wait until you’re in the bath with me,” she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” That was when it occurred to him that he’d need to undress. He did his best not to be self-conscious, but didn’t know how well he succeeded. He wasn’t normally shy, but he’d lived alone for a lot of years and when he undressed there usually wasn’t someone watching his every move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped into the tub and she moved forward to make room for him. He eased himself into the hot water, positioning himself behind her. She was slippery in his embrace and he tucked his arms around her waist and brought her up against him. He brushed his mouth over her hair and relaxed, closing his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You feel good,” he whispered. That had to be the understatement of the century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley had gone still and so had he. It was as though they’d both lost the need to breathe. He cupped her breasts and she sighed as if this was what she’d been waiting for, as if she wondered what had taken him so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarned if he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, not with amusement, but with male pride and satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You feel like silk,” he whispered, rubbing his hand down her smooth abdomen. She turned her head toward him, inviting his kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase didn’t disappoint her. He bent forward and kissed her slowly, seducing her mouth with his own. Soon he didn’t know who was seducing whom. They were both breathless by the time he lifted his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kissed again, the urgency of their need centered on their mouths as she buckled beneath him, gasping and moaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase broke off the kiss. In one swift motion he stood, taking her with him. Water sloshed over the sides of the tub, but Chase hardly noticed. He carried Lesley to the bed and placed her on it, not caring if they were soaking wet or that they’d left a watery trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the loving was over, he rested his forehead against hers, his breath uneven. He could find no words to explain what had happened. No experience had ever been this intense. No woman had ever satisfied him so completely or brought him to the point of no return the way Lesley had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever was between them, be it commitment or love or something he couldn’t define, it was out of his control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything with Lesley was beyond his experience. Everything with her was going to be brand-new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButchart Gardens was breathtakingly beautiful. Chase and Lesley spent their first morning as husband and wife walking hand in hand along the meandering paths, over the footbridges and through the secret corners of the gardens. Lesley couldn’t remember ever seeing any place as beautiful, with a profusion of so many varieties of flowers that she soon lost count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time they stopped for lunch, Lesley was famished. Chase was, too, gauging by the amount of food he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got to build my strength up,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley didn’t know she was still capable of blushing, not after the wondrous night they’d spent. She hadn’t known it was possible for any two people to make love so fervently or so frequently. Just when she was convinced she’d never survive another burst of pleasure, he’d convince her that she could. And she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re blushing.” Chase sounded shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for calling attention to it,” she chided. “If one of us is blushing, it should be you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-49.html","bookId":1964,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM"}
