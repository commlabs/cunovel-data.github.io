I’m going to add something!” The man leaned even closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe didn’t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the fine teak deck of this superior sailing vessel? Seated there, her hair blowing in the wind, smiling at you, looking at you very affectionately—extremely affectionately—as you sail your craft, maybe leaning forward to offer you something . . . Let me think. An apple—she has just peeled a fine round apple and she will offer you a bite, she being, of course, someone you care about deeply, maybe that freckle-faced girl named . . . Deirdre?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want it?” Trademaster put his mouth to Gabe’s ear and breathed the question hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Gabe said. “I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrademaster laughed cruelly. “Of course you don’t,” he rasped. “You’re waiting for something more? Let’s do it, then! Still the boat. You can have the boat and the lake and the sunshine. And she’ll still be there, leaning forward, offering you food and sustenance and affection—but it’s not silly little Deirdre at all. Know who it is?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got a guess?” he hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe did. But he refused to say it. He tightened his hands on the smooth wood of the paddle. When he did, he felt the curved indentations, the places carved here and there with names: Tarik. Nathaniel. Simon. Stefan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Claire,” Trademaster murmured to him. “Sweet, young Claire with the long, curly hair. She could be there with you. You know who Claire is, don’t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want it? Want her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe felt the place where the name Jonas had been carved. The sweet cedar of the paddle was infused with all of them: the ones who cared about him, the ones who at this moment were sending strength to him. As his hand lingered on the wood, he suddenly felt something unfamiliar beneath his fingers. The paddle had been smooth in this spot. Now, to his surprise, it had been carved. He felt the rounded curve of a C. An L. And then the four letters that followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you dare to speak my mother’s name,” he said fiercely. “I don’t want your trade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrademaster stared at him with his hostile, gleaming eyes. Gabe remembered what he knew, what Jonas had told him, of Einar, who had refused an offered trade and been mutilated so hideously. He saw that Trademaster was glancing now at the weapons near them on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrantically he tried again to remember what Jonas had told him. Use your gift. That was it. Use your gift!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was very frightened, but looking directly at Trademaster, he concentrated and willed himself to veer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence came, lowering itself on him as if a curtain had been drawn. The rush of water behind him disappeared. The leaves on the surrounding trees still moved in the wind, but without sound. Gabe entered Trademaster. He found himself whirling through eons of time, destroying at random, screaming with rage and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe became Trademaster. He was sick with searing hatred, and in the endless vortex through which he whirled, there was no comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe understood Trademaster, and the deep malevolence that inhabited him. It was true, what he had earlier sensed, that Trademaster was inhuman. He was not a man but simply disguised as one. He was the force of evil, of all evil for all time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel floated and spun within the veer, being part of evil, feeling the anguish and loneliness of it, of having been cast out again and again throughout history. Of gathering strength once more. Gaining power. Weaponry. Treachery. Cruelty. The feelings were strong enough to destroy one human boy, but he fought through them, concentrating on the knowledge of himself and his task. There must be something within the gift of the veer that would help him now when he emerged to face Trademaster for the final time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas was startled out of his fitful doze by a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire was sitting up. The room was still quite dark, but he could see that she had pushed her coverlet aside. Her eyes were bright, and her shoulders, once frail and hunched, were now straight and firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m hungry,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, within the simmering wrath and agony of the veer, Gabe felt hunger. It startled him. Such a small and unimportant feeling—one he had felt himself often as he headed home to dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this, he realized, letting himself go deeper, to feel it completely, was not a yearning for a bowl of soup or piece of bread. Trademaster was starving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe remembered what Jonas had told him about this kind of evil—that it is fed by its victims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants to know how his tragedies play out, Jonas had said. He likes to see how things end. He gloats. It nourishes him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came to him quickly and was so simple. Those who aren’t nourished will die. Those who starve will die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing exactly what he must do, Gabriel shed the veer. Sound returned. Trademaster still stood before him, sneering, in his cloak. Nothing had changed except for Gabe’s understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up straight and said loudly, “Remember Mentor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrademaster curled his lip and laughed. “Blotchy face? Old, saggy skin? That miserable fool. Of course I remember him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was my teacher.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I ruined him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You ruined him for a while. But he’s himself again. He has his honor back. He’s happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn hearing Gabe’s words, Trademaster gasped slightly. He clutched his stomach as if a sharp pain had stabbed him. Or perhaps a gnawing ache? Hunger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember someone named Einar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe had recoiled in horror when Jonas had related Einar’s terrible history to him. Now he watched Trademaster’s face. “He’s the one who turned you down, remember? He said no to a trade!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrademaster spat on the ground. He laughed in contempt. “I destroyed him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t, actually,” Gabe told him calmly. “He made a good life for himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The life of a cripple?” Trademaster taunted, and briefly imitated Einar’s lurching walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. The life of a good man. He knows each lamb by name. He can make the sounds of every bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And a beautiful girl fell in love with him,” Gabe added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrademaster groaned. He sank onto one knee. His cloak flapped around him, too large suddenly, as if the man inside had shrunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You remember her, I know. Her name was Claire,” Gabe said. “She was looking for her little boy. And you know what? She found me, Trademaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was willing to give you everything she had. And you took it from her. You took her youth, and her beauty, and her energy and her health—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, thinking of his mother, Gabe couldn’t continue speaking. He fell silent and choked back tears. Then he took a deep breath and went on, “—and it didn’t matter. We found each other. None of it mattered but that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t ever know what that’s like, to love someone. In a way, I pity you. But I hope you starve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe found himself looking down on his enemy, who was hunched over on the ground, whimpering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice, which had earlier been low and sinuous, now gave a loud drawn-out howl, as if of grief. His eyes were closed, but he groped in the dark for the weapons that had been discarded on the ground. When he touched them, he howled again. At that moment, the moon once more emerged from dissipating clouds and the wind fell still. In the new light, Gabe could see that the weapons had changed. They were broken toys, bits of rusted tin, as if a careless child had left them out in the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your power is gone,” Gabe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only response was a moan. As Gabe watched, Trademaster shrank further. Soon he had become a formless, unidentifiable heap of something that smelled of rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe nudged with his toe at what was left. It had never been human—he knew that. Now it fell away when he touched it with his foot, and became nothing. He stared at it for a long time as the night lifted and dawn seeped into the sky. Then he found a sharp rock and dug into the earth until he had made a hole just the right size. He planted his paddle there and banked the damp earth around it so that it stood and marked the place where Evil had been vanquished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned and looked at the river and at the pale wisps of smoke coming from chimneys in the village beyond. It was, all of it, familiar and beckoning and safe. He lowered himself into the gently flowing water and swam easily across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunrise woke Jonas. He had fallen asleep in the chair after feeding Claire some of the soup that Kira had brought. She had murmured a thank-you. Then he had tucked the blanket around her and waited there beside the bed while she resumed her sleep. Her breathing was stronger. He realized that tonight would not be the night of her death after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas there a chance that somehow Gabe—? Jonas didn’t allow himself to finish the thought. For a moment he had simply watched Claire sleep, marveling at her resilience. Then he had returned to his chair and his worry about the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, waking, he was stiff and disoriented. He yawned, stretched, and looked around, confused, then remembered Claire and rushed to the bed. But it was empty, the covers thrown back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the cottage was open. She was standing there in her nightdress, breathing deeply of the daybreak air. She was tall and slender, with coppery hair that fell in curls around her shoulders. Hearing him, she turned to Jonas and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought he heard her say, “I see the sun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, the sky was pink with dawn light. Then Jonas looked past Claire and saw Gabe approaching on the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE END \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/son-the-giver-quartet-4/page-38.html","bookId":1704,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:04 AM"}
