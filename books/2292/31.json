We can be in it, yes, but it is very…fatiguing. Incómodo, no? Uncomfortable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it’s troubling, why didn’t we wait till later to leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his hood even lower, but his voice cut clearly through the wind. “Because if it’s troubling to me, it will be troubling to others.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah.” While I had him talking, I almost asked who the fishermen were, too, but when it came to human townsfolk, something told me that guarding my thoughts would be safest for everyone. I had to put the Isle of Night behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I passed the time taking in the scenery. There was water. And more water—in a flat, gray, monochromatic palette to match the white light blanching the sky overhead. We passed the occasional island, but each was bleak, and many were more like rocks than any sort of inhabitable terrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chugging and swaying of the trawler was making me dozy, and my chin bobbed down, then whipped back up again as I began to nod off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a low chuckle beside me. Alcántara was watching me, an unreadable expression on his face. “To be able to sleep once more,” he mused. “To close one’s eyes to the world and melt into dreamlessness. I would trade many things for such sweet bliss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, vampires didn’t sleep—another new fact under my belt. I met his eyes, waiting to see if he’d divulge more. I felt an errant pang of sympathy, because it would kind of suck never to rest again, for all eternity. “It must feel interminable sometimes,” I said carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In point of fact, querida, our lifespan is, by definition, interminable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless a stake gets in the way. But I definitely didn’t give voice to that bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded toward the companionway stairs. “Go sleep, little one. There are thousands of islands in the North Sea, and many hours ahead of us. You will need your rest for the work ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to go below, but disagreeing wasn’t exactly a thing someone did with Alcántara, so I just nodded and headed down the rickety stairs in search of a small bunk where I could nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt became instantly clear why Alcántara bore the discomfort of brightness on deck instead of sitting below deck. The stench down there was intense enough to make my eyes tear, and the rattling of the engine was so loud, it filled me, shoving all other thoughts from my brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was right. If I intended to be at the top of my game, I needed my sleep. I curled onto a thin mattress, preferring the chill to the lone musty blanket, and miraculously passed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrupt silence woke me. I sat up, realizing the fishermen had cut the power, leaving only the sound of waves slapping against the hull. It was a blessed relief to my ears, which still hummed from the engine’s lengthy assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went above to find the men approaching Alcántara. They didn’t meet his eyes. Their accents were beyond thick, and they spoke in gruff monosyllables unintelligible to me. “Aff ere, ay ya?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcántara nodded and stood, and I deduced they’d said something approximating Off here, yes huh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around, wondering where we were. It was gray nothingness, with only the hint of a darker gray shadow on the horizon—land, in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire read my mind. “We’ll row from here. We cannot risk being seen or heard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men lowered a ratty old dinghy into the water. I’d thought the water was calm, but the small craft bobbed and tossed wildly, and I gritted my teeth, inhaling through my nose. I’d never been seasick, and I hoped this wouldn’t be the moment for that to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come, Acari.” Alcántara’s tone was sharp, brooking no hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no choice but to follow him, clambering down a rope ladder into the boat. He took the oars, and I sat facing him. His hood hung low over his face, and, looking at him, I felt as if I were in a Greek myth, with Alcántara rowing me to Hades across the River Styx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we approached shore, I was glad we’d traveled when the sun was highest in the sky. I made out the silhouette of a creepy stone building on a hill. It was stark and stout, but smaller than I’d pictured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So that’s the monastery?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “We’d not dare to roam so close. The monastery is on the far side of the island. That is the charnel house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a blank look—it wasn’t often I encountered a word I didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where human remains are stored,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” I grimaced, studying it. And I’d thought our standing stones were creepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at Alcántara and caught him watching me. He was pulling the oars in a strong, steady rhythm, and it was the little things like that that reminded me of his power. He gave me a smile as if he knew my thoughts—though it didn’t take a mind reader. He’d had hundreds of years in which to realize how appealing he was as a male specimen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back up the hill. Clouds were blowing in from the east, casting dramatic, moving shadows over the stone building. “It was commonplace for monks to keep a charnel house,” he explained. “Such things were used to remind them of their mortality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or to remind them of their power,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcántara gave me a thoughtful look. “Perhaps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe landed on the island. Their island. And honestly, it wasn’t so different from our island. We pulled ashore on a tiny sliver of shoreline that I imagined wasn’t even exposed during high tide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to clamber out of the boat, but Alcántara was a surprising gentleman and stayed me with his hand, hopping from the boat and pulling it onto the sand so I wouldn’t get wet. He handed me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low cave was barely detectable along the rock face, and spotting it, I said, “Very Batman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcántara gave me a blank look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind.” I was nervous now, more than I wanted to admit. It didn’t escape my notice that he’d held on to my hand a little longer than necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t have to wait long before Alcántara’s inside man arrived. We dragged the boat into the cave, flipped it bottom up on a rock, turned around, and there he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alcántara told me he had a spy on the inside, I hadn’t expected this. This guy was young, not much older than a Trainee. He was loose and broad shouldered, as if he’d played pro ball and was now considering a career as a bartender. The guy’s real name didn’t suit him one bit, and in my head I’d instantly dubbed him Buddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two exchanged greetings, and I was surprised to hear his accent was American. Though why wouldn’t it be? So many of our Trainees were from the United States—they had to end up somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy gave me a once-over, his eyes lingering in a way that made me want to punch him. “This little thing is going to find him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled. It was such a Buddy thing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I answered before Alcántara had a chance to. “This little thing will do her job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed a goofy, chortling laugh, and it reaffirmed my instant dislike. I wondered what kind of dirt he had on Alcántara, or Alcántara on him, that kept him alive and stationed on an enemy island. Too bad I wouldn’t have time to ask that story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood hands on hips, looking more like he was in a locker room than on an island crawling with malevolent undead. “So, Master Al gave you the rundown?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Al? I nodded, mesmerized by his not having full-grown fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Servants keep their eyes down around here,” he continued. “So just play dumb, lie low, and listen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d grown up keeping my eyes down—lying low was second nature to me. “Check, check, and check.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Find out where Carden is,” Alcántara said, taking over the conversation. “That is all. Do not do anything yourself. Do not call attention to yourself. If they discover you, they will destroy McCloud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd slice and dice me into Drew-kabobs, but I seemed to be the only one concerned by that point. “I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mr. Football didn’t sound convinced. He slid a backpack from his shoulder and tossed it to me. “Here’s your uniform.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peeked inside. It was a dress. I frowned. “I guess I can holster my stars under this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy tsked. “No, chica. You’ve gotta nail this without your toys. These vamps may not be into electric lights or heat, but they sure do have metal detectors all over the damned place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can do my job without weapons,” I said with more bravado than real courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d better. You’re our only chance. We won’t get another shot like this any time soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not like being on the receiving end of Buddy’s attitude. “What about you? Why can’t you find McCloud? Seems like you have an in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcántara answered for him. “It’s impossible for those who are Vampire to roam through the monastery undetected. Like senses like. They would sniff him out, and once discovered, he’d only raise suspicion. Trainee Lee isn’t powerful enough to be a party to the Synod’s proceedings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrainee Lee. I bit my cheek not to snicker at the lame name. Buddy was much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway,” Buddy Lee said with a dopey shrug, “I’m only a Trainee. We’re like mushrooms, you know—kept in the dark and fed shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my brows, wondering where they’d found this one. “Classy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell by Alcántara’s pursed mouth he agreed with me. But I guess Buddy was too valuable to scold. I was dying to know that story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, instead, I went deeper into the cave, so deep I could barely see in the dark, to change into my disguise. Alcántara was old-fashioned, but still, there were two of them and one of me, and I felt vulnerable and exposed. Not to mention cold. It was freezing, with the wind gusting off the water. I stripped and dressed as quickly as I could, my hands trembling with cold and their clumsily rapid movements. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-s-kiss-the-watchers-2/page-31.html","bookId":2292,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:39 PM"}
