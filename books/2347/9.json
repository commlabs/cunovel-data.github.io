Senior military personnel spend a lot of time flying small aircraft, either fixed wing or rotary, and they don\u0027t like it. Outside of combat, more military personnel die in plane crashes than from any other single cause. Therefore, given a choice, a smart Brigadier General like Eileen Hutton wouldn\u0027t ride a puddle jumper down from Indianapolis. She would be happy enough with a big jet out of Washington National, but she wouldn\u0027t contemplate a twin-prop for the final leg of her journey. No way. She would rent a car instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Reacher walked south and east to the library. Asked the subdued woman at the desk where the Yellow Pages were stored. He went where she pointed and hauled the book out onto a table. Opened it to H for Hotels. Started looking. Almost certainly some JAG Corps office grunt had done the equivalent thing the previous day, but remotely, probably online. Hutton would have told him to book her a room. He would have been anxious to please, so he would have turned first to the street map and found the courthouse and the road in from the north. Then he would have chosen a decent place convenient for both. Somewhere with parking, for the rental car. Probably a chain, with an established government rate accessible by a code number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Marriott Suites, Reacher thought. That\u0027s where she\u0027ll be headed. Off the highway, south toward town, an obvious left turn east, and there it was, three blocks north of the courthouse, an easy walk, breakfast included. The office grunt had probably printed out driving directions from the internet and clipped them to her itinerary. Anxious to please. Hutton had that effect on people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe memorized the Marriott\u0027s number and put the book away. Then he walked out to the lobby and dialed the pay phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to confirm a reservation,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hutton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we\u0027ve got that. Tonight only, a suite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Reacher said, and put the phone down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would take an early flight out of D.C. After two decades in uniform she would be up at five, in a cab at six, boarding at seven. She would be in Indianapolis by nine, latest. Out of the Hertz lot by nine-thirty. It was a two-and-a-half-hour drive. She would arrive at noon. In about an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped out of the lobby and looped through the plaza and headed north and east through a thin crowd of people, past the far side of the recruiting office, past the back of the courthouse. He found the Marriott easily enough and took a corner table in its coffee shop and settled down to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen Rodin called Rosemary Barr at work. She wasn\u0027t there. The receptionist sounded a little embarrassed about it. So Helen tried Rosemary\u0027s home number, and got her after the second ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they let you go?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unpaid leave,\" Rosemary said. \"I volunteered for it. Everyone was acting awkward around me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s human nature. I need to make a plan. I might have to move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a list of your brother\u0027s friends,\" Helen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t have any. The true test of friendship is adversity, isn\u0027t it? And nobody\u0027s visited him. Nobody\u0027s even tried. Nobody\u0027s called me to ask how he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant before,\" Helen said. \"I need to know who he saw, who he hung out with, who knew him well. Especially anyone new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There wasn\u0027t anyone new,\" Rosemary said. \"Not that I\u0027m aware of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about old?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you got a big piece of paper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a whole yellow pad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you aren\u0027t going to need it. A matchbook cover would do it. James is a very self-sufficient person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must have buddies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple, I guess,\" Rosemary said. \"There\u0027s a guy called Mike from the neighborhood. They talk about lawns and baseball, you know, guy stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike, Helen wrote. Guy stuff. \"Anyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone called Charlie,\" Rosemary said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about Charlie,\" Helen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know much about him. I never really met him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long has James known him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Including the time you lived there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never came around when I was in. I only ever saw him once. He was leaving as I was coming in. I said, Who was that? James said, That was Charlie, like he was an old pal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s small. He\u0027s got weird hair. Like a black toilet brush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he local?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was their point of contact?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guns,\" Rosemary said. \"They shared an interest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie, Helen wrote. Guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonna Bianca spent some time on her cell phone and mapped out the flight schedules between D.C. and Indianapolis. She knew the onward connecting flights left on the hour and took thirty-five minutes. She figured a person with a courthouse appointment at four o\u0027clock wouldn\u0027t aim to arrive on anything later than the two thirty-five. Which meant leaving Indianapolis at two, which meant getting in there at about one-thirty, latest, to allow for the walk between gates. Which meant leaving Washington National at eleven-thirty or twelve, latest. Which wasn\u0027t possible. The last direct flight from National to Indianapolis was at nine-thirty. There was a morning cluster and an evening cluster. Nothing in between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll come in on the twelve thirty-five,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson checked his watch. Quarter to twelve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means Reacher will be here soon,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt ten to twelve a courier arrived at Helen Rodin\u0027s building with six large cardboard cartons containing the defense\u0027s copies of the prosecution\u0027s evidence. The discovery process, mandated by the rules of due process. By the Bill of Rights, as interpreted. The courier called from the lobby and Helen told him to come on up. He had to make two trips with his handcart. He stacked the boxes in the empty secretarial pen. Helen signed for them and he left. Then she opened them. There was a mass of paperwork and dozens of photographs. And eleven new VHS cassettes. They had labels with numbers neatly printed on them that referred to a notarized sheet that described them as faithful and complete copies of the parking garage\u0027s security tapes, made by an independent third-party contractor. Helen took them all out and stacked them separately. She would have to take them home and use her own VCR to look at them. She didn\u0027t have a VCR in the office. Or a television set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a television set in the Marriott\u0027s coffee shop. It was mounted high in the corner, on a black articulated bracket bolted to the wall. The sound was off. Reacher watched an advertisement that featured a young woman in a filmy summer dress romping through a field of wildflowers. He wasn\u0027t sure what product was being advertised. The dress, maybe, or makeup, or shampoo, or allergy medicine. Then a news banner popped up. Noon Report. Reacher checked his watch. Twelve exactly. He glanced toward the reception desk in the lobby. He had a clear view. No sign of Hutton. Not yet. So he glanced back at the television. Ann Yanni was on. She seemed to be live on location, downtown, out on the street. In front of the Metropole Palace Hotel. She talked silently but earnestly for a moment and then the picture cut to tape of dawn twilight. An alley. Police barriers. A shapeless form under a white sheet. Then the picture cut again. To a driver\u0027s license photograph. Pale skin. Green eyes. Red hair. Just under the chin a caption was superimposed: Alexandra Dupree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra. Sandy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they\u0027ve gone too far, Reacher thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWay too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the screen. Sandy\u0027s face was still there. Then the picture cut again, back to tape of the early hours, to a head-and-shoulders shot of Emerson. A recorded interview. Yanni had her microphone shoved up under Emerson\u0027s nose. He was talking. Yanni pulled the microphone back and asked a question. Emerson talked some more. His eyes were flat and empty and tired and hooded against the bright light on the camera. Even without the sound Reacher knew what he was saying. He was promising a full and complete investigation. We\u0027ll get this guy, he was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you from the desk,\" a voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it said, \"And I thought to myself, don\u0027t I know that guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher looked away from the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEileen Hutton was standing right there in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair was shorter. She had no tan. There were fine lines around her eyes. But otherwise she looked just the same as she had fourteen years ago. And just as good. Medium height, slim, poised. Groomed. Fragrant. Feminine as hell. She hadn\u0027t put on a pound. She was wearing civvies. Khaki chino pants, a white T, a blue oxford shirt open over it. Penny loafers, no socks, no makeup, no jewelry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wedding band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember me?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Hutton,\" he said. \"I remember you. Of course I do. And it\u0027s good to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a purse and a key card in her hand. A rolling carry-on with a long handle at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to see you again, too,\" she said. \"But please tell me it\u0027s a coincidence that you\u0027re here. Please tell me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeminine as hell, except she was still a woman in a man\u0027s world, and you could still see the steel if you knew where to look. Which was into her eyes. They ran like a stock ticker, warm, warm, welcome, welcome, with a periodic bright flash: Mess with me and I\u0027ll rip your lungs out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" Reacher said. \"Let\u0027s have lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what people do at lunch time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were expecting me. You\u0027ve been waiting for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. Glanced back up at the TV set. Sandy\u0027s driver\u0027s license picture was on the screen again. Hutton followed his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the dead girl?\" she asked. \"I heard it on the radio, driving down. Sounds like a person should get combat pay, coming here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did the radio say? There\u0027s no sound in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Homicide. Late last night. Local girl got her neck broken. A single blow to the right temple. In an alley outside a hotel. Not this one, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Reacher said. \"It wasn\u0027t this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brutal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEileen Hutton sat down at the table. Not across from him. In the chair next to him. Just like Sandy, at the sports bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look great,\" he said. \"You really do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to see you,\" he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likewise,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it, too. Believe me, if we were at some Beltway cocktail party I would be getting all misty and nostalgic with the best of them. I might still, as soon as I find out you\u0027re not here for the reason I think you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What reason would that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To keep your promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do. You talked about it all one night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re here because the Department of the Army got a subpoena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHutton nodded. \"From some idiot prosecutor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rodin,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My fault,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ,\" Hutton said. \"What did you tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Reacher said. \"I didn\u0027t tell him anything. But he told me something. He told me my name was on the defense\u0027s witness list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The defense list?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"That surprised me, obviously. So I was confused. So I asked him if my name had come from some old Pentagon file.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in this lifetime,\" Hutton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I found out,\" Reacher said. \"But still, I had said the magic words. I had mentioned the Pentagon. The type of guy he is, I knew he would go fishing. He\u0027s very insecure. He likes his cases armor-plated. So I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be. I get to spend two days in the back of beyond and I get to perjure myself from here to breakfast time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need to do that. You can claim national security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHutton shook her head. \"We talked about it, long and hard. We decided to stay away from anything that draws attention. That Palestinian thing was very thin. If that unravels, everything unravels. So I\u0027m here to swear blind that James Barr was GI Joe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You OK with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the army. None of us is a virgin anymore. It\u0027s about the mission, and the mission is to keep a lid on the KC thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did they delegate you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two birds with one stone. No good to them to send someone else and still have me out there knowing the truth. This way, I can\u0027t talk about it ever again, anywhere. Not without effectively confessing to perjury one time in Indiana. They\u0027re not dumb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised they still care. It\u0027s practically ancient history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And clearly you don\u0027t have a subscription to the Army Times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe you never knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never knew what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where it went back then, up the chain of command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Division, I supposed. But maybe not all the way to the top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It stopped on a certain colonel\u0027s desk. He was the one who nixed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name was Petersen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colonel Petersen is now Lieutenant General Petersen. Three stars. Congressional liaison. About to get his fourth star. About to be named Vice Chief of Staff of the Army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat could complicate things, Reacher thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Embarrassing,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet your ass embarrassing,\" Hutton said. \"So believe me, this is one lid that is going to stay on. You need to bear that in mind. Whatever you want to do about your promise, you can\u0027t talk about what happened. Any more than I can. They would find a way to get to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither of us needs to talk about it. It\u0027s a done deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very glad to hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask me how they really got my name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did they really get your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From James Barr himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t believe it, either. But I do now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should have lunch. We really need to talk. Because I think there\u0027s someone else out there who knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson and Bianca called it quits at twelve-fifty. Reacher never showed. The feeder flight came in on time. Nobody that could have been a female Brigadier General from the Pentagon got off. The two cops waited until the arrivals hall emptied out and went quiet. Then they got in their car and drove back to town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher and Hutton had lunch. A waitress came over, happy to get some business out of her corner table at last. The menu was coffee-shop-basic. Reacher ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and coffee. Hutton went with chicken Caesar and tea. They ate and talked. Reacher ran through the details of the case. Then he ran through his theory. The perverse choice of location, the presumed coercion. He told Hutton about Niebuhr\u0027s theory of the new and persuasive friend. Told her that Barr claimed he had no new friends, and very few old ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t be a new friend anyway,\" Hutton said. \"Because this is a multilayered setup. There\u0027s the contemporaneous evidence, and the historical parallels. Second story of a parking garage fourteen years ago in KC, second story of a parking garage here and now. Virtually the same rifle. Boat tail sniper ammunition. And the desert boots. I never saw them before Desert Shield. They\u0027re suggestive. Whoever scripted this for him knew all about his past. Which means it isn\u0027t a new friend. It can\u0027t be. It would take years and years before Barr would feel like sharing anything about KC.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"But obviously he did, eventually. Which is why I said there\u0027s someone else out there who knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to find that person,\" Hutton said. \"The mission is to keep the lid on this thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not my mission. I don\u0027t care if this Petersen guy gets his fourth star.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you do care that a quarter million veterans don\u0027t get their reputations trashed. The scandal would taint all of them. And they were good people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s easy enough,\" Hutton said. \"If James Barr doesn\u0027t have many friends, you don\u0027t have a very big pool to search through. One of them has to be the guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two birds with one stone,\" Hutton said. \"You get to the puppet master and the army gets to relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why doesn\u0027t the army do it for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t afford to draw attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got operational problems,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No jurisdiction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worse than that. I\u0027m about to get arrested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For killing that girl behind the hotel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The puppet master doesn\u0027t like me being here. He already tried something on Monday night, with that same girl as bait. So I went to see her yesterday, twice. And now they killed her and I\u0027m sure I\u0027m her last unexplained contact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you got an alibi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Depends on the exact timing, but probably not. I\u0027m sure the cops are already looking for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Problem,\" Hutton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only temporary,\" Reacher said. \"Science is on my side. If her neck was broken by a single blow to her right temple, then her head rotated a little, counterclockwise, which means the punch was thrown by a left-hander. And I\u0027m right-handed. If I had hit her in the right temple I would have knocked her out for sure, but I wouldn\u0027t have broken her neck. I would have had to do that separately, afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"I used to do this stuff for a living, remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But will they believe you?

But I\u0027m going to have to stay out of their way. Which will slow me down some. A lot, in fact. Which is why I said I\u0027ve got operational problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to see you, Hutton,\" he said. \"It really is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My guess is there\u0027ll be a cop called Emerson waiting for you after you\u0027re done with your deposition. He\u0027ll ask you about me. Just play dumb. Just say I never showed up, you didn\u0027t see me, you don\u0027t know where I am, all that kind of stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quiet for a spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re upset,\" she said. \"I can tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Rubbed his face, like he was washing without water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care much about James Barr,\" he said. \"If someone wanted to set him up so he took the punishment he should have taken fourteen years ago, that was OK with me. But this thing with the girl is different. It\u0027s way out of line. She was just a sweet dumb kid. She meant no harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHutton was quiet for a moment longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure about the threat to Barr\u0027s sister?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see any other leverage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there\u0027s no sign of a threat. As a prosecutor I couldn\u0027t see entering it as a separate charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why else would Barr have done what he did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHutton didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I see you later?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a room not far away,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless I\u0027m already in jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress came back and they ordered dessert. Reacher asked for more coffee and Hutton got more tea. They kept on talking. Random subjects, random questions. They had fourteen years to catch up on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen Rodin searched through the six cartons of evidence and found a crisp photocopy of a sheet of paper that had been found next to James Barr\u0027s telephone. It was as close as he had gotten to a personal phone book. It had three numbers on it, written in neat and careful handwriting. Two were for his sister Rosemary, one at her condo and the other at work. The third number was for Mike. The neighborhood guy. Nothing for anyone called Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen dialed Mike\u0027s number. It rang six times and cut to an answering machine. She left her office number and asked for a return call on a matter of great importance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson spent an hour with a sketch artist and came up with a pretty good likeness of Jack Reacher\u0027s face. The drawing was then scanned into a computer and colorized. Dirty-blond hair, ice-blue eyes, medium-to-dark tan. Emerson then typed the name, and estimated the height at six-five, the weight at two-fifty, the age between thirty-five and forty-five. He put the police department\u0027s phone number on the bottom line. Then he e-mailed it all over the place and set the printer to churn out two hundred color copies. He told every prowl car driver to take a sheaf and give one to every hotel clerk and barman in town. Then he added: every restaurant, diner, lunch counter, and sandwich shop, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Barr\u0027s friend Mike called Helen Rodin back at three o\u0027clock in the afternoon. She asked for his address and got him to agree to a face-to-face interview. He said he was home for the rest of the day. So she called a cab and headed out. Mike lived on James Barr\u0027s street, twenty minutes from downtown. Barr\u0027s house was visible from Mike\u0027s front yard. Both houses were similar. All the houses on the street were similar. They were 1950s ranches, long and low. Helen guessed they had all started out identical. But a half-century\u0027s worth of adding on and reroofing and re-siding and ongoing landscaping had made them diverge in appearance. Some looked upmarket and some still looked basic. Barr\u0027s place looked worn. Mike\u0027s place looked manicured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike himself was a tired fifty-something who worked the morning shift at a paint wholesaler. His wife arrived home while Helen was still introducing herself. She was also a tired fifty-something. Her name was Tammy, which didn\u0027t suit her. She was a part-time dental nurse. She worked two mornings a week for a downtown dentist. She ushered Helen and Mike into the living room and then went away to make coffee. Helen and Mike sat down and started out with an awkward initial silence that lasted minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what can I tell you?\" Mike asked eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were Mr. Barr\u0027s friend,\" Helen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike glanced at the living room door. It was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a neighbor,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His sister called you a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were neighborly. Some folks might call that friendly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you spend time together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would chat a little if he walked by with his dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what kind of thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our yards,\" Mike said. \"If he was decorating he would ask me about paint. I asked him who fixed his driveway. Things like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baseball?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike nodded. \"We would talk about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTammy came in with three cups of coffee on a tray. There was cream and sugar and a small plate of cookies with them, and three paper napkins. She put the tray on a low table and sat down next to her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help yourself,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Helen said. \"Thank you very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all served themselves and there was silence in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you ever in Mr. Barr\u0027s house?\" Helen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike glanced at his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once or twice,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t friends,\" Tammy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it a surprise?\" Helen asked. \"That he did what he did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Tammy said. \"It was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t need to feel bad about mixing with him before. It wasn\u0027t something that anyone could have predicted. These things are always a surprise. Neighbors never know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying to get him off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually I\u0027m not,\" Helen said. \"But there\u0027s a new theory that he didn\u0027t act alone. I\u0027m just trying to make sure that the other man gets punished, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t Mike,\" Tammy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it was,\" Helen said. \"Really. Not for a moment. Not now that I\u0027ve met him. But whoever the other man is, you or Mike might know him or have heard about him or even seen him coming and going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barr didn\u0027t really have friends,\" Mike said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that he spoke about to me. He lived with his sister until she moved out. I guess that was enough for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the name Charlie mean anything to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike just shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Mr. Barr do when he had a job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Mike said. \"He hasn\u0027t worked for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen a man over there,\" Tammy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now and then. Occasionally. He comes and goes. All times of the day and night, like a friend would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For how long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever since we moved here. I spend more time at home than Mike does. So I notice more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was the last time you saw this man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last week, I think. A couple of times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, earlier. Tuesday and Wednesday, maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s small. He\u0027s got funny hair. Black, like hog bristles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie, Helen thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEileen Hutton walked three fast blocks south from the Marriott and arrived at the courthouse at one minute to four exactly. Alex Rodin\u0027s secretary came down to escort her up to the third floor. Depositions were taken in a large conference room because most witnesses brought their own lawyers and court reporters with them. But Hutton was on her own. She sat down alone on one long side of a large table and smiled as a microphone was placed in front of her and a video camera was focused on her face. Then Rodin came in and introduced himself. He brought a small team with him. An assistant, his secretary, a court reporter with her machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you state your full name and title for the record?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHutton looked at the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eileen Ann Hutton,\" she said. \"Brigadier General, Judge Advocate General\u0027s Corps, United States Army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope this won\u0027t take long,\" Rodin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t,\" Hutton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it didn\u0027t. Rodin was trawling in a sea he hadn\u0027t charted. He was like a man in a darkened room. All he could do was dart around randomly and hope he bumped into something. After six questions he realized he was never going to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked, \"How would you characterize James Barr\u0027s military service?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exemplary without being exceptional,\" Hutton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked, \"Was he ever in trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to my knowledge,\" Hutton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked, \"Did he ever commit a crime?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to my knowledge,\" Hutton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked, \"Are you aware of recent events in this city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am,\" Hutton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked, \"Is there anything in James Barr\u0027s past that might shed light on the likelihood or otherwise of his having been involved in those events?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to my knowledge,\" Hutton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he asked, \"Is there any reason why the Pentagon might be more aware of James Barr than any other veteran?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to my knowledge,\" Hutton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo at that point Alex Rodin gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" he said. \"Thank you, General Hutton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen Rodin walked thirty yards and stood on the street for a moment outside James Barr\u0027s house. It had police tape across the entryway and a plywood sheet nailed over the broken front door. It looked forlorn and empty. There was nothing to see. So she used her cell phone to call a cab and had it take her to the county hospital. It was after four o\u0027clock in the afternoon when she arrived and the sun was in the west. It lit up the white concrete building with pale shades of orange and pink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rode up to the sixth floor and signed in with the Board of Corrections and found the tired thirty-year-old doctor and asked him about James Barr\u0027s condition. The doctor didn\u0027t really answer. He wasn\u0027t very interested in James Barr\u0027s condition. That was clear. So Helen just walked past him and opened Barr\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarr was awake. He was still handcuffed to the cot. His head was still clamped. His eyes were open and he was staring at the ceiling. His breathing was low and slow and the heart monitor was beeping less than once a second. His arms were trembling slightly and his handcuffs were rattling against the bed frame. Quiet, dull, metallic sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s there?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen stepped close and leaned into his field of view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they looking after you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no complaints,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about your friend Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did Mike come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think they allow visitors.
