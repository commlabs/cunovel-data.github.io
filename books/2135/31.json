Gone were the days where they would blindly accept Mommy\u0027s complaints of a tummy ache or of a rare skin disease or my even vaguer explanation that \"Mommy is just cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started and tried to predict the significance of Tammy also knowing that her mother was the freak of all freaks. I wondered if there was any hope that my kids might still might grow up to be normal...and that thought alone nearly overwhelmed me. I buried my face in my hands all over again. I sat like that until the tears stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I sat there, face in my hands, two things occurred to me: one, how deep my hate was for the angel, Ishmael; and, two, that my daughter was steadily growing more psychic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when, exactly, did that happen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know or had been too busy to notice. And where did these gifts come from? I didn\u0027t know that either. My son\u0027s own great strength was far easier to explain away. That his sister would also have abilities was beyond me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I contemplated this, drying my eyes, a sudden and severe pain blasted through me, doubling me over, wracking my body. I doubled over, and knew immediately the source of the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill doubled over in the driver\u0027s seat, hands gripping the steering wheel, I shielded my thoughts, throwing up a mental wall around me. Immediately, the pain subsided, and then passed completely. But I knew the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntimately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had gone through it myself seven years ago, after my own attack. Fang was going through what I now knew was the transformation from mortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I knew he was alone in his apartment, and scared shitless. I felt his fear, along with his pain. I took in a lot of air, drummed my fingers briefly on the steering wheel, and then headed out of the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Fang\u0027s apartment. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-31.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
