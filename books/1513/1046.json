Syre, the son of his first wife, had instead inherited his ability of endlessness, and thus was called Ouroboros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently Daniel seemed to be stronger, already a peak rank 6 Warlock because of the power of his mature bloodline. Yet, although Syre wasn’t as strong, his inheritance obscured his future, giving him an infinite potential!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the progenitor of his own bloodline, Leylin made a judgement the moment he saw his sons, ‘I need to adjust their bloodlines…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther Warlocks inherited negative side-effects from their bloodline, such as bloodline shackles and emotional instability. However, Leylin’s Targaryen family did not face this problem. As the progenitor of the bloodline and with the help of the A.I. Chip, Leylin could fix its flaws. Such an ability ensured that few of his descendants experienced paranoia and madness, causing the Targaryens to be highly regarded by others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Leylin’s own bloodline had been purified once more, his descendants stood a greater chance of improving themselves. Leylin spent some time at Ouroboros Castle, enjoying playing with his grandchildren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough such a thing was odd, Leylin even had great grandchildren now. He had to placate all the women he’d left behind when he holed himself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin adjusted the Jörmungandr and Ouroboros bloodlines, removing all negative effects in their genes and preventing his future descendants from facing defects at birth. At the same time, however, he began preparing to enter Dreamscape from the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The flow of time in the Magus World is different from that in the World of Gods…’ After a sumptuous banquet, Leylin entered his own laboratory once more, carrying a crystal ball with a strange expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d invited several of the Ouroboros Clan elders to the gathering, and even other rank 6 Magi from the central continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack when he hadn’t stepped completely into rank 7 yet, these people had all been like ants before him. Now, it was even more so; his sons being able to beat up all the Breaking Dawns on the continent, Leylin had lost all interest in proving his might. Only a slight hint at his desire for information on the flying city on his part had his descendants and subordinates frighten the Monarch of the Skies into handing over the information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, given his level Leylin did not wish to rob these pitiful people. It felt like he was bullying a child. Thus he opened his treasure vault up, allowing the Monarch’s subordinates to take a few items as compensation. This way, the Monarch would be satisfied in having struck a good deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The flying city in the Magus World should be the original form of those from the World of Gods…’ The A.I. Chip’s light flashed, and the information within the crystal ball was all copied as it compared Sky City with Thultanthar. In doing so it discovered many problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘City flight was indeed something devised by Magi, but the arcanists changed it. Adding secondary energy functions, they turned flying cities into a weapon that could threaten the divine kingdoms of gods…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everything from the ancient past was useful. The creativity of the arcanists had put the flying cities of the Magi to shame, even if it was likely that Distorted Shadow played an important role in establishing them in the World of Gods and developing their cities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet all that didn’t matter to Leylin. He wanted information about the original flying city so that he could better understand how to operate Thultanthar. He cared not for old and new, good and evil. Disregarding status, he would use what benefited him and toss away anything that would bring him harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Everything of value in the world is for me to use!’ This was the quintessence of ancient rulers’ philosophies, and the motto of all Magi who’d comprehended laws! They pursued the truth, extracting strength from what had value. Such was the basis of their operations..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Although the limited laws in this world stopped the Magi from harnessing its full potential, the theory behind the flying cities is similar…’ Leylin nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Beep! Technology behind Sky City has been sorted, storing into database. Filename Flying City, analysis 100%. Ability to transfer usage to Thultanthar: 9.85%] the A.I. Chip’s voice intoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is a prototype after all. An increase of 10% is already decent enough.’ The Netherese flying city he’d obtained in the Frostfall Valleys had always been one of Leylin’s trump cards. He would improve it with every chance he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn ancient times, Great Arcanists armed with flying cities were something even the gods had feared. In the end, the gods had destroyed them at all costs. However, Thultanthar had been hidden away, now found by Leylin to become a killing trump card. There would come a day when it resurfaced in the World of Gods again, opening its malevolent jaws towards the gods themselves…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A.I. Chip, transfer the data to the auxiliary chip in the World of Gods!’ Leylin ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Manderhawke Plate had stabilised his connection with the World of Gods. He believed his demigod clone on the other side would be able to make full use of this information. Done dealing with these trivial tasks, Leylin focused on the lab once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dreamscape…” Leylin muttered, the dark crimson dreamforce appearing around the place giving off a misty and heavy atmosphere. The red light revealed multiple runes on his body, as well as a vertical eye between his brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreamscape had stilled right now, dreamforce entering a period of weakness. It made it extremely difficult for any beings to survive in the place, and even the vile existences of Dreamscape had to seal themselves up. It was even harsher for the other creatures, the usage of dreamforce becoming more difficult greatly weakening them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this wasn’t a problem for Leylin. ‘So much dreamforce responded to a single though, and that’s when dreamforce is at its weakest…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was rather moved. ‘The Nightmare Absorbing Physique is indeed something else. It’s like the authority of a Lord of Baator… Nay, its power is even greater. After all, Baator is but one part of the World of Gods. As for Dreamscape, at its peak it can even rival the Magus World itself…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin was no stranger to dreamforce. He’d explored Dreamscape once back when he was still a rank 5 Warlock. With the bloodline origin he’d absorbed from the Snake Dowager also giving him a boost to his ability with dreamforce via the Alabaster Devilsnakes, Leylin’s control over Dreamscape had increased greatly. His affinity with Dreamscape itself was extremely high too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, all that paled in comparison to the Nightmare Absorbing Physique. No, it was incomparable! Leylin felt an intoxicating call from Dreamscape’s origin force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I used to think the Alabaster Devilsnake bloodline was extremely powerful due to its ability to enter and leave Dreamscape at will. However, compared to the Nightmare King’s bloodline it’s nothing at all…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Alabaster Devilsnake was of a commoner status in a kingdom, then the Nightmare Absorption Physique was a prince, even a king! Apart from Dreamscape’s World Will, Leylin didn’t have to bother about anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No wonder the Nightmare King could rise to such power and was unstoppable in his tracks, it’s like a hack…’ Just this one connection with Dreamscape left Leylin feeling extremely powerful. He would even dare challenge the Snake Dowager if they were in Dreamscape!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t have any mortal enemies, but if I did I would drag them all into Dreamscape and make them suffer, or even die…’ Leylin’s mind ran numerous calculations, combining the advantages of the A.I. Chip and Dreamscape itself. Even if it was the Snake Dowager or Nefarious Filthbird, he had a sixty percent chance of slaying them within it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But Magi who comprehend laws cannot act like that.’ Leylin sighed inwardly. Having become a rank 7 Warlock he now had a better understanding of the social game in the upper circles. Magi of laws were just too powerful, and it was extremely hard for them to die. Even if they did resurrection was an easy thing. This had caused many existences to join forces in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was extremely easy to isolate oneself by blatantly declaring war on such existences. More important was that he had a decent relationship with the Snake Dowager, and she had even requested his assistance. He had no enmity with the Nefarious Filthbird either, so there was no need to do such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, if those dignitaries of the Purgatory World still bore grudges and wanted to give him trouble, Leylin would not mind teaching them a lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, it was time to consider a joint effort. The cake in the World of Gods was too big. Leylin would definitely be ganged up by the gods if he were to start a war. Hence, seeking arrangements and help from other forces had to be considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-1045\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-1047\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-1046","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:22 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:22 AM"}
