It was awkward. I felt bad about that. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move to the bathroom. I try to brush my hair.

You know how this town works. You\u0027ve been through it before.\" And then his voice softens. \"I just didn\u0027t know how f**ked up you got over Meghan Reynolds until it was too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that but what I can\u0027t understand is that if you knew Rip was so crazy about Rain why did you ... \" I stand in front of Julian, my arms at my sides, but I can\u0027t look at him until I force myself to. \"Why did you put me in danger?\" I ask. \"You pushed her onto me even after you knew how Rip felt? You pushed her onto me even though you thought he maybe had something to do with Kelly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clay, I never thought that he had anything to do with Kelly,\" Julian says. \"Those were just rumors that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted me to help her and I tried, Julian, but now I realize you didn\u0027t care whether I got hurt or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis moves something in Julian and his face tightens and his voice begins to rise. \"Look, it\u0027s really cool you\u0027re trying to help me out here, but why do you keep thinking Rip was involved with Kelly\u0027s death? Do you know something? Do you have any proof?

I mean, come on, dude, it\u0027s a joke. Yeah, you tell people shit, but have you ever really gotten anybody anything?\" he asks sincerely. \"I mean, you promise shit and maybe you get them closer but, dude, you\u0027re lying all the time - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian, come on, don\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what I found out is that you really won\u0027t do anything for anybody,\" he says. \"Except for yourself.\" The gentle way he says this forces me to finally turn away. \"This, like, delusional fantasy you have of yourself is ... \" He pauses. \"Come on, dude, it\u0027s a joke.\" He pauses again. \"It\u0027s kind of embarrassing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force myself to grin in order to lighten the moment and not scare him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you smiling?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be a pretty good act,\" I say. \"This ... fantasy I have of myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you bought into it,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never thought you\u0027d actually fall for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you think that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Blair told me how cold you could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you drive?\" Julian asks as the elevator heads down to the garage. \"Or do you want me to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I can drive,\" I say. \"Are you sure you want to do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027m sure,\" Julian says. \"Let\u0027s just get this over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him have her,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re leaving tonight,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not telling you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving along Sunset I keep checking the rearview mirror and Julian sits in the passenger seat texting someone, probably Rain, and I keep turning on the radio and then turning it off but he doesn\u0027t notice, and then we\u0027re crossing Highland and the Eurythmics song fades into a voice from the radio talking about the aftershocks from an earthquake earlier, something that I slept through, and I have to roll down all the windows and pull the car over three times in order to steady myself because I keep hearing sirens all around us and my eyes are fixed on the rearview mirror because two black Escalades are following us and the last time I pull over, in front of the Cinerama Dome, Julian finally asks, \"What\u0027s wrong? Why do you keep stopping?\" and where Sunset Boulevard and Hollywood intersect I smile at him coolly as if this is all going to be okay, because in the condo I felt like I was sinking into a rage but now, turning onto Hillhurst, I\u0027m feeling better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside a building past Franklin that\u0027s surrounded by eucalyptus trees Julian gets out of the BMW, and starts walking toward the entrance just as I receive a text that says don\u0027t get out of the car, and when Julian realizes I\u0027m still sitting in the driver\u0027s seat he turns around and our eyes lock. A black Escalade pulls up behind the BMW and flashes its headlights over us. Julian leans into the opened passenger window. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-46.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
