She didn\u0027t sound particularly shaken up about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Mitchell had called from UTSA, asking me to bring a curriculum vitae and a dossier when I came to my interview on Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya had called, reminding me she needed to hear by next week whether I was coming back to work and by the way could I take Jem for a few hours tomorrow night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would mean a lot to him. I could hear Jem in the background singing the Barney the Dinosaur song at the top of his lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy next call was collect, persontoperson to Gene Schaeffer at the SAPD homicide office. Persontoperson was the most expensive calling rate I could think of. As usual Schaeffer accepted the charges graciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a privilege,\" he said. \"I get to pay money to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should form a calling circle. You, me, Ralph Arguello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screw yourself, Navarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph Arguello is one of my less reputable friends. I made the mistake of introducing Arguello to Schaeffer once, thinking they could help each other on a West Side murder case. The problems started when Ralph offered Schaeffer a finder\u0027s fee for any unclaimed goods the detective could send to Ralph\u0027s pawnshops from the SAPD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eevidence locker. Schaeffer and Ralph did not come away from the encounter with a warm fuzzy feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume you have an excellent reason for calling,\" Schaeffer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julie Kearnes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walk light on Guadalupe changed. Students drifted across, their faces now featureless in the dusk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Schaeffer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember. The fiddler. I assumed you had enough sense to get off that case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just curious what you\u0027d found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, probably wondering if hanging up would be enough to dissuade me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently he decided not. \"We found nothing. The job was clean and professional?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonly a few custodians in the SAC building that time of morning and nobody saw anything. Weapon was a highpowered rifle. Hasn\u0027t been found yet and I doubt it will be. Your client\u0027s going to have to look elsewhere for her missing demo tape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a little more than that, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Schaeffer about Les SaintPierre\u0027s disappearance. I told him about Miranda Daniels\u0027 problems getting out from under Tilden Sheckly\u0027s thumb and Milo\u0027s theory that Les might have used information from Kearnes in some kind of botched blackmail attempt. I told him about the man who had been arguing with Julie Kearnes Saturday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuiet on the other end of the line. Too much of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured you\u0027d want to know about SaintPierre,\" I said. \"I figured you\u0027d want to find him, clear up some of those pesky questions, like is he still alive? Did he get Kearnes killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, kid. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guy in the BMW. Who does that sound like to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let\u0027s obfuscate, Schaeffer. You know damn well it\u0027s Samuel Barrera. He was at Erainya\u0027s not two hours after Kearnes got gunned down. Alex Blanceagle at the Paintbrush hinted that another investigator besides me had been poking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrera\u0027s in this somehow—not one of his twenty operatives but Barrera himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen was the last time Sam had a contract so juicy he handled it personally?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re jumping to some large conclusions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ll talk to Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchaeffer hesitated. \"As I remember, Barrera turned you down for a job. A couple of years ago when you were shopping around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that got to do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was it he told you—you weren\u0027t stable enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disciplined. The word was disciplined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really stuck in your craw, didn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a trainer. I stayed with the program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. To prove what to who? All I\u0027m saying, kid, you would be illadvised to go forward on this Sheckly case, to see it as some personal competition between you and Barrera. I\u0027m advising you, as a friend, to drop it. I know for a fact Erainya isn\u0027t going to cover your butt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at the phone lines above me. I counted rows of grackles. I said, \"You called it the Sheckly case. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call it whatever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s already talked to you, hasn\u0027t he? Barrera did, or some of his friends in the Bureau. What the hell is going on, Schaeffer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re sounding paranoid. You think I can get pressured off a case that easy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about his choice of words. \"Not easy at all. That\u0027s what scares me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let it go, Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the lines of grackles. Every few seconds another little rag of darkness would flit in from the evening sky and join the congregation. You couldn\u0027t identify the screeching as coming from individual birds, or even from the group of birds. The sonar static was disembodied, floating noise. It echoed up and down the malls between the limestone campus buildings behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll think about what you said,\" I promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you insist on continuing, if there is anything else you need to tell me, anything that needs reporting—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be the first to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchaeffer paused. Then he laughed dryly, wearily, like a man who had lost so many coins in the same slot machine that the whole idea of bad luck was starting to be amusing. \"I\u0027m brimming with confidence about that, Navarre. I truly am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWednesday night during midterms, to hear a country band, I hadn\u0027t figured the Cactus Cafe would exactly be standing room only. I was wrong. A small whiteboard sign out front said: MIRANDA DANIELS, COVER $5. There was a line of about fifty people waiting to pay it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of them were couples in their twenties— cleanlooking young urban kickers with nice haircuts and pressed denim and Tony Lama boots. A few college kids. A few older couples who looked like they\u0027d just driven in from the ranch in Williamson County and were still trying to adjust to being around people instead of cows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the back of the line, two guys were having an argument. One of them was my brother Garrett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett\u0027s hard to miss with the wheelchair. It\u0027s a custom made job—white and black Holstein hidecovered seat, dingo balls along the edges, bright red wheel grips set close to the axle like Garrett likes them, nothing motorized, a Persian seat cushion designed for a guy whose weight distribution is different because he has no legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s plastered the back of the chair with bumper stickers: SAVE BARTON SPRINGS, I\u0027D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRATHER BE GROWING HEMP, several advertising Nike and Converse. Garrett enjoys endorsing athletic shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chair\u0027s got a beer cooler under the seat and a pouch for Garrett\u0027s onehitter and a bicycle flagona pole that Garrett long ago changed to a Jolly Roger. Garrett kids about putting retractable spikes on his wheels like they had in Ben Hur. At least I think he\u0027s kidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy he was arguing with had patched jeans and a black Tshirt and longish strawcoloured hair. If I\u0027d still been in California I\u0027d\u0027ve pegged him for a surfer—he had the build and the wind burned face and the jerky random head movements of somebody who\u0027d been watching the crests of waves too long. He was blowing cigarette smoke at the floor and shaking his head. \"Naw, naw, naw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, man,\" Garrett protested. \"She\u0027s not Jimmy Buffet, okay? I just like the tunes. Hey, little bro, I want you to meet Cam Compton, the guitar player.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guitar player looked up, annoyed that he had to be introduced at all. One of his brown irises had a bloody ring around it, as if somebody had tried to smash it in. He studied me for about five seconds before deciding I wasn\u0027t worth the trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and yo\u0027 brother get your brains in the same place, son?\" His accent was pure Southern, too rounded in the vowels for Texas. \"What you think? She\u0027s gonna get eaten alive, isn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said. \"Who are we talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Son, son, son.\" Compton jerked his head toward the cafe door. He flicked ashes at the carpet. \"Miranda Daniels, you idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Cam,\" Garrett said. \"Calm it down. Like I told you—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm it down,\" Compton repeated. He took a long drag on his cigarette, gave me a smile that was not at all friendly. \"Ain\u0027t I calm? Just need to teach a bitch a lesson, is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral young urban kickers in line glanced back nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompton tugged on his Tshirt, stretching the blue gray markings above the breast pocket that had probably been words about six hundred Laundromats ago. He pointed two fingers at Garrett and started to say something, then changed his mind. Garrett was down a little low to be effectively argued with. You felt like you were scolding one of the Munchkins. Instead Cam turned to me and stabbed his fingers lightly into my chest. \"You got any idea what Nashville\u0027s like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need those fingers to play guitar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam blinked, momentarily derailed. The fingers slipped off my chest. He jerked his head randomly a few times, trying to regain his bearings on the waves, then looked back at me and gave another closelipped smile. Everything under control again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s gonna get one album if she\u0027s lucky, son, a week of parties, then adios\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adios,\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam nodded, waved his cigarette to underscore the point. \"Old Sheck knew what he was doing, putting her with me. She ditches Cam Compton she ain\u0027t going to last a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said. Sudden revelation. \"That Cam Compton. The washedup artist from Sheckly\u0027s stable. Yeah, Milo\u0027s told me about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled politely and held out my hand to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam\u0027s forehead slowly turned scarlet. He glanced at Garrett, then held up the lit end of his cigarette and examined it. \"What\u0027d this son of a bitch just say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett looked back and forth between us. He pulled his scraggly saltandpepper beard, the way he does when he\u0027s worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I talk to you?\" he asked me. \" \u0027Scuse us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett wheeled himself out of line toward the men\u0027s room. I smiled again at Cam, then followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" said Garrett when I joined him, \"is this going to be another Texas Chilli Parlour scene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me his evil look. With the crooked teeth and the long hair and the beard and the crazy stoned eyes, my brother can look disturbingly like a chubby Charles Manson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to sound offended. \"Give me some credit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\" Garrett scratched his belly underneath the tie dyed I\u0027m With Stupid Tshirt. He produced a joint, lit it, then started talking with it still in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last time I took you out we ended up with a three hundreddollar bar tab for broken furniture. They won\u0027t let me in the Chilli Parlour for dollar magnum night anymore, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was different. I\u0027d burned that guy for worker\u0027s comp fraud and he recognized me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett blew smoke. \"Cam Compton isn\u0027t some out ofwork schmuck, little bro. He\u0027s been on Austin City Limits, for Chris sakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know him well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows half the people in town, man.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-13.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
