Those capable of walking in had to wait for the doctors to finish with the victims of a more serious car wreck that had come in before them. Fortunately, there was only one other walk-in, a four-year-old with a bad tummy ache. She was being held by her mother, who kept eyeing them suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we look like we\u0027ve been in a gang fight,\" Thomas muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they first came in, the nurse had regarded them in the same manner. \"You been in a fight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, a really competitive golf tournament,\" Marcus had said dryly. Thomas winced at the \"fuck off and mind your own business\" New York undertone. She\u0027d thinned her lips and thrust the clipboard at Thomas. \"Fill this out.\" It had felt odd to help Marcus do that. His name, medical history. History of illness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Marcus had claimed not applicable and \"none\" to most of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t have let you go out there by yourself.\" Thomas stretched an arm over the back of the bolted plastic seats, grazing Marcus\u0027 shoulder. He didn\u0027t want to be rebuffed for hovering, but he needed the contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me?\" Marcus eyed him from his one non-swollen eye, then closed it. \"You my keeper now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I get the feeling you need one. Weird, huh?\" Thomas shifted so he was sitting sideways on his hip. Propping his head on his fist, he reached out and pushed Marcus\u0027 hair back from his temple, rubbing his thumb against the unmarked slope of his left cheekbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll say.\" But the fact Marcus submitted without further comment to the stroking told Thomas how bad Marcus was probably feeling. He snagged a pillow from a gurney and put it between Marcus\u0027 head and the wall to give him something to support his head and neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not your fault, pet,\" Marcus murmured. \"None of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have been there sooner,\" Thomas repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a face. Just flesh and bone. When you die, it all rots away.\" A corner of Marcus\u0027 mouth twitched. \"Should I be worried? You\u0027re going to dump me if I stop being pretty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re pretty?\" Thomas was glad Marcus\u0027 eyes were closed so he wouldn\u0027t see the war between anger and concern in his expression. \"I mean, you\u0027re old, almost forty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour pecs are starting to sag like my grandmother\u0027s breasts...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Marcus swung a hand out to deliver a weak-knuckled slap to his abdomen, Thomas caught it. Instead of thrusting it back, he held on, a light grip of Marcus\u0027 wrist, his fingers tracing Marcus\u0027 palm. Marcus stayed still for a moment or two, then his fingers moved, a caress to Thomas\u0027 sternum with his knuckles before he pulled away to switch hands on the ice pack they\u0027d provided for his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to that whole thing at the farm, your argument about not solving anything by being confrontational?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was a little different. They hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus made a noncommittal noise, laid his other hand on his knee, carefully stretching out one leg. \"I think we\u0027re going to be here for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me check on things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let you. That\u0027s more like it. Need to remember your place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up and wait here.\" Thomas approached the front desk, the nurse who narrowed her gaze at him as he came. He knew he had blood on the front of his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably splattered on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he should visit the restroom. But he didn\u0027t want Marcus out of his sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you the doctor - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Thomas said. He glanced back, saw Marcus had his eyes still closed, jaw held taut, breathing shallow. \"Can he have something for the pain until then? He doesn\u0027t have any allergies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t administer drugs without the doctor\u0027s permission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they...do they do good stitching here? He - \" Thomas abruptly pulled out his wallet, fished out something he knew he shouldn\u0027t be showing, and slid it across the counter to her. \"I know he\u0027s surly and unlivable at the moment, and even on a good day he can be like that, but that\u0027s what he normally looks like, inside and out.\" The wallet picture was one of many that had been done at one of Julie\u0027s post production parties by a professional photographer. Despite her budget trepidations, she\u0027d known the promo brochure was important. Marcus had been listening to someone, his head turned at a slight profile, dipped a bit. The photographer had reproduced it in black and white and come up with a finished product that was reminiscent of a still of a legendary great, such as Gary Cooper, Jimmy Stewart, Rock Hudson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulie had given this one to Thomas. He kept it behind a couple of other things in his wallet that didn\u0027t get disturbed much. An old video club card, his county library card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, the corners of the photo had gotten dog-eared from the nights he\u0027d taken it out to look at it in the quiet darkness of his room at home. He laid it on the nurse\u0027s clipboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not who he is,\" he said in a low voice. \"Not what\u0027s special about him, but it\u0027s still important. It\u0027s...his armor. His way of coping.\" As the words came out of his mouth, compelled by some instinct, Thomas knew it was true. It protected whatever it was Marcus so steadfastly refused to tell him, to tell anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse gave him a quiet look, reached out and patted his hand. \"Dr. Tillman does very fine stitch work. My boy split open his forehead on a rock last year and you can barely see the scar anymore. You go sit down with your friend and we\u0027ll get to you as soon as possible, I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas nodded, tucked the picture away and returned to Marcus, whose eyes were still closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you offer her sex to get me in faster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the squeak of wheels and a lingering shadow, Thomas glanced up, surprised to see an orderly pushing a hamper full of dirty linens stop to peer at Marcus. Leaning over further, he took a step forward, his light brown eyes studying the gash, or so Thomas thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dodger? Is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This day just gets better and better,\" Marcus mumbled under his breath, so low Thomas was sure only he\u0027d heard him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Marcus lifted the ice pack and raised his head, the orderly\u0027s face creased into a smile. He looked as pleased as if Marcus didn\u0027t have blood all over his jaw and shirtfront, his eye swollen shut, arm gripping his ribs as if he were holding his insides in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse gave the orderly a sharp, admonishing look at the enthusiastic shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, he quieted with an apologetic look, clasping both hands over his mouth before he leaned over again, spoke in an exaggerated whisper through his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps in his late thirties, the man had lanky dark hair to his shoulders, combed back and held with a rubber band, eyes that were a trifle wide, and a mass of scar tissue around his left eye, which was hidden beneath a permanent patch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder his hospital smock, the man wore pressed jeans and a clean striped shirt. For some reason, his appearance gave Thomas the impression of a first grader setting out to school, carefully prepared by his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your shoe\u0027s untied, Toby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis from an older black man who approached and immediately flanked Toby with the protective demeanor of a parent. Putting a hand on Toby\u0027s shoulder, he compelled the younger man to kneel and begin the apparent thoughtful challenge of tying his shoe. \"It\u0027s Dodger,\" Toby repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see that. How you doing? Never thought I\u0027d see anyone nail that face of yours.\" His face creasing into a well-used terrain of lines, the man reached out and shook Marcus\u0027 unoccupied hand. Since they were having to shake with the same side hand, Thomas noted it was more like they squeezed grips as long-time friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They got lucky,\" Marcus said. \"How\u0027re you doing, Owen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s head custodian,\" Toby said proudly. \"Employee of the month. That looks like it hurts.\" He straightened and reached out to touch. Thomas watched, intrigued as Marcus sat still, let Tobias place his fingers with an odd gentleness on his jaw below the laceration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know you two were out here. Last time we\u0027d talked you were still in Boston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the briefest flicker in Marcus\u0027 eyes, Thomas knew he was lying. And he understood why Marcus hadn\u0027t wanted to come to this hospital. From Owen\u0027s steady look, he apparently knew it was a lie as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, this was better for Toby. Small town, everyone knows him. He does a good job here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Stanton.\" The nurse spoke. \"The doctor will see you now, Exam One. Sorry, you have to stay.\" She gestured to Thomas. \"You can come in after awhile, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The doctor has to make sure you aren\u0027t the one who beat me up,\" Marcus finished, giving her an arch look. \"Does this pussy look capable of beating anyone up?\" The nurse, unfazed, arched a brow. \"Well, seeing as all the blood on him appears to be yours, I\u0027d say yes.\" Her brows lowered. \"But I\u0027m here to tell you that I can whip your ass if you don\u0027t clean up your language and get yourself in Exam One before Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTillman decides to make you wait until tomorrow and goes to get herself a nice, well-deserved latte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby giggled. \"She\u0027s nice, Marcus. Mean, but nice. Like you. Don\u0027t be messing with her. She\u0027ll tear you up.\" As he rose, he patted Marcus\u0027 shoulder, then abruptly put both his arms around him, holding him. Thomas stiffened at the same time as Owen moved forward, but Toby held Marcus as if holding an egg. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, and Thomas was amazed to hear the man muffle a sob. \"Marcus. My friend. He\u0027s my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on now, boy. Marcus has to get his face fixed up.\" Owen\u0027s face was full of pain and regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby shook his head, grip tightening. \"Better if he\u0027s ugly. Safer.\" Though he could see Marcus was being gentle about extricating himself, Thomas could almost hear the vibration of his distress. He rose, intending to help, and suddenly Toby turned on him. \"Did you hurt him, like Nurse thinks?\" He shouted it, lunging at Thomas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas fell back, startled. Despite his injuries, Marcus was surprisingly quick, vaulting forward and catching Toby by the collar, hauling him back, though he let out a painful grunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Toby. No.\" He snapped it out through gritted teeth. \"Thomas is like you. He takes care of me. He brought me to the hospital. He beat up the guys who hurt me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he did take them by surprise,\" he added with grim humor. His face was white, strained lines around his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas shot him a narrow look, but the teasing had fallen short. Owen was having a quick word with the nurse on duty, who was obviously getting a little concerned about Toby\u0027s agitated state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of them? He beat up all of them? They\u0027re all gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Marcus said after a moment. Suddenly he looked tired and in desperate pain, for reasons that Thomas could tell had nothing to do with being beaten up tonight. \"Now, go on back to work. There are people waiting for you to help them, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby nodded, his brow creased. He gripped the handle of the cart with both hands and pushed it on down the hall, stopping to look back once, his expression puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned the corner, disappearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bed pan,\" Marcus said abruptly. Thomas lunged up but Owen was already there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus grabbed it, turned to face the wall and got violently sick. Thomas stood by, close, wanting to touch, help, but oddly restrained by Owen\u0027s light hand and a quick, silent shake of his head. When Marcus was done, he was sweating. He lowered himself into the chair, his arm shaking. The nurse fortunately appeared with a wheelchair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may have yourself a bit of a concussion, Mr. Stanton. I think we better take you in this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact he let himself be helped into the chair like an old man, rather than telling the nurse what she could do with the wheelchair, frightened Thomas worse than anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come get you just as soon as Dr. Tillman says it\u0027s okay,\" she promised, but in a firm tone that brooked no argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marcus.\" Thomas closed his hand on his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to get the hell out of here,\" Marcus said abruptly. He lifted his head and pinned Thomas with a hard green stare that was almost glassy. \"No matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re not admitting me here. I want to go home after they stitch me up, even if I pass out. You got it? You nod and don\u0027t mean it, I won\u0027t forgive you.\" Thomas tightened his grip. \"I\u0027ll take care of you, of everything. Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if your life\u0027s in danger. If they say you have a punctured organ or a concussion, then tough shit. Get over it. You stay here. Anything else, I\u0027ll get you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus sat back in the chair. \"Asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stubborn bastard. Let them take care of you.\" Thomas had to close his hands into hard fists to keep from reaching out again as they wheeled him down the hall and out of his sight. \"Goddamn it,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whirled on Owen. \"What the hell was that about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwen ran a hand over his balding head. \"Of all the places Dodger could show up, this would\u0027ve been the last I\u0027d guess. Like Fate, isn\u0027t it?\" He shook his head at Thomas\u0027 searing look of impatience and moved back to his own cart. \"Not my story to tell, son. If you\u0027re the right person to tell, he\u0027ll tell you. But I don\u0027t know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t tell anybody anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwen stopped, his hands clasping the handle. \"Sometimes when you lose everything, the last thing you want to do is remember. And telling is remembering. You do what you said you\u0027d do.\" His dark gaze fixed on Thomas. \"If it isn\u0027t too serious, get him out of here. Best for him and Toby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching Owen retreat down the hall, Thomas wanted to put his already swollen knuckles through the sheetrock of the hospital\u0027s sea green wall. Fortunately, it wasn\u0027t long before the nurse let him go back to Exam One. Marcus was stripped out of his shirt, his slacks open in the front. The doctor, a small-boned woman in her forties who barely came up to his chin, was checking out his ribs. A nurse had prepared a tray of sutures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like they\u0027re going to give me a wrap, stitch me up and then we can head on,\" Marcus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the X-rays say so,\" Dr. Tillman corrected. \"You his family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Thomas said without hesitation. \"Is he okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other than being arrogant as hell, which I don\u0027t think can be surgically removed, I think he\u0027s going to be fine. He was lucky.\" She glanced sharply at Thomas, taking in his appearance. \"Do you need medical attention?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not my blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s obviously a better fighter than you,\" the doctor observed to Marcus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus curled his lip. \"I\u0027m getting tired of hearing that. I was taken by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey jumped me. He had the advantage of jumping them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm. I\u0027m going to go check those X-rays.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the doctor and her nurse left them alone, Thomas approached the table, ran his hand up the curve of Marcus\u0027 bare back. There were bruises rising there from where they\u0027d kicked him. He wanted to go hurt them some more. \"You hanging in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hanging. I just want out of here. Christ, what a stupid thing to do, wandering behind that place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess talking to Lawrence really stirred you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" Marcus gave him a blank expression, then he shrugged, looking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas dropped his hand, swallowed the hurt. \"Who was on the phone? And who the hell are Toby and Owen, and why does Toby call you Dodger?\" Marcus\u0027 eyes shuttered. It was a look Thomas knew. In the past it had frustrated him, annoyed him, made him angry. Now, fury just erupted. Somehow, if he\u0027d known more about who was on the phone, Marcus wouldn\u0027t have gone outside to a place he never should have been, to hide the conversation from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not going to tell me, are you? It\u0027s okay to slap me down for leaving to take care of my family, but maybe that\u0027s because whatever happened with yours is so awful you don\u0027t want me to have anything to do with mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out.\" Marcus\u0027 eyes went freezing cold, his face a hard mask, the cleaned but unstitched slash making him look far more dangerous. \"I don\u0027t want to deal with this crap right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never gotten in, so how the hell can I get out?\" Thomas snarled. \"You want me to be your family? You let family in. Knowing they\u0027ll hurt you, you do it anyway, because that\u0027s what love is. You let them in to hurt you, love you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus surged up now, coming nose to nose with Thomas despite having to hold his side to do so. \"Why should I pour out my guts to someone who considers me family only when it\u0027s convenient, which means he\u0027s never considered me family at all? You\u0027ve got a permanent hard-on for me, but hey, join the rest of the world. You\u0027re right. Go home. Go home to North Carolina and be everything your family wants you to be.\" His expression hardened further. \"But you better be ready for the fact it will never be enough. Years from now, when you\u0027ve done what you think they wanted you to do and you\u0027re coming home every night to sit in your recliner with your beer gut and your passive aggression drowning in cable, you\u0027ll be hating that girl you married. The family you thought you loved. And you still won\u0027t be enough, because what they want is for you to be truly happy being someone you were fucking never meant to be!\" Venom was pouring off Marcus. Thomas didn\u0027t know if it was aimed at him or if it was a poison Marcus was coating his whole world with, but it was all bullshit. All defenses against what he didn\u0027t want Thomas to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas took one step back, looked steadily at him. Took a deep breath. \"Is it that bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus stared at him. Myriad emotions chased each other through his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worse,\" he said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anyone know all of it? Have you ever trusted someone more than me?\" Marcus wanted Thomas to keep fighting, keep it on the level of irrational anger, but Thomas wasn\u0027t obliging. And if he couldn\u0027t ride out all of tonight\u0027s shit in fury, Marcus wasn\u0027t sure how he was going to survive it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said, sinking back down on the table, feeling the pain in every bone and muscle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then.\" Thomas spoke after a moment, as if that was an answer he could accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See if you can get that nurse in here and get this done,\" Marcus said, looking down at the tile floor, a depressing checkered pattern of white and green illuminated far too much by the fluorescent lighting. \"Then we\u0027ll go back to the house and get you packed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re supposed to go home tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I could stay...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Marcus shook his head. \"We said the week. You needed to go back by the weekend. Tomorrow\u0027s Saturday. You need to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hurt was there. Marcus thought the agony of it, joining the pain in his ribs, was going to squeeze the life from him. He needed Thomas to go now. Not tomorrow, this minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a great start on some excellent pieces,\" he managed. \"Take them home, finish them, let me know when you think you can estimate a completion date. I\u0027ll get them picked up and brought to New York - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas planted his feet between Marcus\u0027 braced ones and startled him by catching his face in both hands, tilting it up so Marcus was forced to look him in the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe position crowded him. With his ribs throbbing, there wasn\u0027t much he could do to shake Thomas off. God, those artist\u0027s hands touching his face, Thomas\u0027 expression unsmiling, the dark eyes searching Marcus\u0027. His thumb traced the cut, then moved down over Marcus\u0027 bottom lip. When his hip brushed the inside of Marcus\u0027 thigh, it was too tempting not to put his hands on Thomas\u0027 waist, his hips, draw him forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t fuck a Cabbage Patch doll right now, let alone Thomas, but that wasn\u0027t what he wanted anyway. His hands were holding onto Thomas\u0027 waist much too tightly, almost violently digging in to his shirt. Almost like Thomas had clutched him, that day Marcus had come to see him at the hardware store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms were rigid bands of muscle as Thomas ran his hands down them, moved just an inch or two closer. It freed Marcus\u0027 head to go where it would and he was tired, tired enough to let it fall forward, just barely brushing Thomas. He wanted...but he wouldn\u0027t move forward any further. He felt as if he moved at all, he\u0027d break. Thomas closed the gap, that one last step forward, then Marcus\u0027 forehead rested solidly in the middle of Thomas\u0027 chest. Marcus could feel Thomas\u0027 heartbeat through the throbbing of his own skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew in a breath, looking down at the slope of Thomas\u0027 abdomen, the thighs that looked so damn good in jeans, the curve of his cock beneath the zipper. Shoes with socks. Size twelve, wide. Thomas\u0027 hands stroked his hair, curled over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBending, he brushed his lips on the crown of Marcus\u0027 head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to go,\" Marcus muttered. His hands tightened as if he could hold Thomas with just his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the root of it. The fight, the anger, the memories of family. It was all about Thomas leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas propped his chin on Marcus\u0027 skull, overlapped his arms around his back, holding him loosely. \"We knew it would suck, didn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I could stay, if it was only about what I wanted, I\u0027d stay until you got tired of me and kicked me out. I swear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus closed his eyes, breathed him in. For Thomas\u0027 wellbeing, he should let him go. Just let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay?\" When Marcus didn\u0027t answer, just sat there, breathing in everything that was Thomas, Thomas sighed, held his tense body closer. He rubbed Marcus\u0027 back, easy, caring strokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis steadying touch and presence were like a carefully timed release valve, allowing some of the pressure to dissipate so Marcus could breathe. Even when the doctor came back to report the X-rays were clean, he found he couldn\u0027t bring himself to draw back, let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot until he had no other choice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rough-canvas-nature-of-desire-6/page-14.html","bookId":1911,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:25:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:25:35 PM"}
