Could he take me? Were all the rumors true? Would the dead come and kick his ass for me, or was I tough enough to do it without them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sure willing to give it the old college try. My anger simmered underneath the surface like one of my mom\u0027s pots coming to a boil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrazier blew it when he touched Jade\u0027s arm, wrapping his big hand around it entirely, jerking her backward, he hissed, \"You\u0027re not going with him, he\u0027s a menace, not allowed on school property either.\" He winked at me and Jade\u0027s green eyes got big as she stumbled backward, completely unprepared for his advance. There was something on her face as she saw me come for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Brett was there. He yelled, \"Hart!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and Howie belted me with a cheap shot and Jade screamed. He caught me just right on the edge of my chin. I spun backward as Brett grabbed Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery guy\u0027s jaw is made of glass if you hit him right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine felt shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what hurt worse, seeing Jade in Brett\u0027s arms or the sucker punch I\u0027d just taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowie tried to land on me to start the whaling he had planned but I fell backward and let my hands bite the ground as I simultaneously jabbed out with my foot, catching him in the middle of his bread basket. My head spun and I felt puke rising but now was not the time to get squeamish \u0027cuz I took a hit. And there was a new and exciting development:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt him before I saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde was there before I\u0027d thought of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, the manure was rolling downhill to collect at my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear crawled into my belly and Howie smiled. He\u0027d planned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fucker was trying to get me locked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew when Jade would leave, he knew when my probation was up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd most importantly, he had some kind of bead on me and my boy Clyde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett took Jade behind him and launched himself at Howie. It was bizarre, one minute Jade had been glued to him (hated it), the next he was landing on an unprepared but smug Howie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rolled around on the weedy grass of his family\u0027s outlawed lawn and Clyde hauled me up by my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go,\" I said roughly and he ignored me, looking at the teens that were almost men beating the tar out of each other not two meters away from where we stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb...\" Clyde started, his thick dark blond hair lifting in the morning breeze that\u0027d come up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, hoping for clarity and getting nothing but bile for my trouble, it rose unbidden in my throat and I planted my hands on my knees, stabilizing myself. I was trying to ride out getting my bell rung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear the sirens in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI craned my head to the side and looked up at Clyde\u0027s face, his suit that he always wore mended to perfection, always clean, always perfect. \"They\u0027re coming, ya gotta go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde curled his mighty hands into fists and strode to the dueling teens. He tore Brett off of Howie and knelt beside Howie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowie, every bit of six foot of solid muscle cringed from the nearness of my zombie. And man, did he not look dead. But that didn\u0027t matter, he was. Howie knew it. Somewhere deep inside, his humanity had been shaken by something so unnatural, so foreign in its essence, his very being withdrew from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get back, fucker!\" Howie screamed, trying to scuttle backwards out of range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde wasn\u0027t a fan of foul language. He grabbed him by the lapel of his shirt and dragged him close to his face. He ran a strong tapered finger down his jaw and I watched Howie shiver at his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith flagrant revulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde shook Howie casually in his unbreakable hold and I heard his teeth rattle. \"I am well-versed in human anatomy, varmint. I can make much look accidental. I have been told that my DNA,\" it was comical, Clyde looked at me for confirmation and I nodded dully, \"and fingerprints will not be identified. I am far too old for the technology of this era to apply to my deeds. Nefarious or otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowie looked at him with a stunned expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clyde go!\" I yelled, knowing what would happen if they found him here with me. They wouldn\u0027t need an excuse to kill him, incarcerate me. It\u0027d be over. And Howie would have won. And every other person that didn\u0027t like the cauldron of the dead I\u0027d stirred up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he daft?\" Clyde asked no one in particular as the siren wail came nearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefinitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bore down on Howie. \"Let me speak plainly then. Know this: I will kill you. Stop your efforts now, or suffer the consequences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clyde,\" Jade said softly and he dropped Howie in a heap on the grass where he cracked his head on the sidewalk and made a girl-like yelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLovin\u0027 that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde came to Jade and he collected her tiny hands in his large ones. Farmer\u0027s hands, he\u0027d told me once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd fighting hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe searched his eyes, his dead flesh encapsulating her living. \"You have to go, they\u0027ll burn you... and take... Caleb.\" She flicked her eyes to mine and I gave a terse nod, walking over to where they stood. He nodded once and turned on Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde stared at him thoughtfully then hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed easier when his mouth looked normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett stood his ground, his eyes very wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCouldn\u0027t say I blamed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, Clyde. He gets a free pass, he beat the crap out of Howie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde frowned and cocked his head. \"They come.\" He turned and sprinted for the fence which separated one dismal yard from another. It was like watching a champion hurdler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swiveled his head to look at me just as he cleared the top of the fence and his glittering gaze held mine for a second then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until that night that I realized Gale hadn\u0027t been with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia had his nightstick jammed up underneath my chin before I could even say hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that he would\u0027ve allowed that, no way, not now. We were way beyond exchanging small change pleasantries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blamed me for Gale. For everything. Little lines that hadn\u0027t been there a year ago framed his dark eyes, his jaw was harder, his body, leaner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face right now was hella pissed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade screamed when he propped my wounded chin on the tip of the blunt instrument of beatings and she ran for us. Brett jerked her back against him and spoke quietly to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she sobbed as his dark eyes met mine, I nodded at him, happy he hadn\u0027t let her get closer. \"Don\u0027t you hurt him, Garcia!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes sought hers and his expression hardened. \"I\u0027m doing my job here, Jade. You\u0027d do well to remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowie walked over to where we stood, our eyes locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hart had his pet zombie here, all droolin\u0027 and threatening me, right here,\" Howie, the braniac, pointed to where we stood and expounded on his supreme intelligence, \"He threatened me. Can you believe this shit? He threatened me with death!\" he snorted. Howie thought he was so funny, what with his supposed pun and all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Garcia wasn\u0027t caring about the intellectual quotient that was Howie, that accusing stare landed on me like a ton of bricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed the tip of the police-grade baton into the tender spot in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah, Garcia. Do ya see any dead people?\" I said out of my half-closed mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia gave a tight smile. \"Why would this guy lie?\" he asked, jerking his chin in Howie\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously? Damn... why wouldn\u0027t he? Had Garcia taken a look around the digs here? Hell, it was Planet Dysfunction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was here! I swear!\" Howie said, throwing out his hands, trying his best to look sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t doing half-bad considering he was telling the truth. I\u0027m sure it wasn\u0027t normal for him but whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia straightened, removing the hardness of the piece from under my chin. I fought not to rub it. His stare turned to Brett and Jade. \"I\u0027m going to ask this question once: was Clyde the zombie here today, threatening the victim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who Howie?\" Brett asked with surprise. \"He\u0027s the victim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia nodded slowly. \"He looks like the victim,\" his gaze took in Jade. \"Did you see the zombie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade gulped when he pointed the nightstick at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like that one little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia stepped toward her and I did the dumbass again and grabbed his forearm. He whipped that stick around and caught me under my knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn man!\" Brett yelled. \"You\u0027re a cop! You can\u0027t whale on him like that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded where I stood. I hadn\u0027t liked him going toward my girl like he meant harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed he wasn\u0027t responding to things neutrally anymore, the back of my leg was one big throbbing inferno of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raul!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that voice. I went ahead and puked on the overgrown and weedy Frazier lawn. I guess the hit to my jaw along with the bludgeon to the back of the knee had done me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA concussion was looking probable about now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale ran to me, jerking me up to my feet. I turned away from her, puking some more. With any luck I\u0027d get some on that tard, Howie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swayed and she said quietly, \"Clyde sent me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell damn, that was fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia pivoted in his shiny cop shoes and strode to her. It cleared my head immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing like a Chick In Danger to set a dude on point. Even a chick that was a cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFormer cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade came jogging after him with Brett on her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved to stab a finger in Gale\u0027s chest and I swung her behind me, my leg screaming in protest at the pivot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey Caleb!\" she said loudly, \"I\u0027ve got this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis manic gaze swung to mine and he said quietly, \"Get out of my way. As it is, you\u0027re in a boatload of trouble young man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You deck your former partner in front of four witnesses and you\u0027ll be on the same boat.\" I looked over at Howie who scowled at me. \"Three witnesses,\" I corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat clown couldn\u0027t tell something straight if he had a gun barrel pressed to his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression darkened and he opened his mouth to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Frazier,\" I said preemptively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale had weaseled her way around me and stood shouting at Garcia. Jade and Brett slid to a stop at the edge of the ragged brown grass. I couldn\u0027t believe the entire neighborhood hadn\u0027t gotten out of their houses to see what the noise was about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess it was pretty typical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spit a mess of puke and spittle out on the grass where no one stood and met Garcia\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved to go around Gale to get to me and she grabbed his forearm to restrain him and he swung the nightstick around, lifting the club above his head, I had a second to react and it wasn\u0027t enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale was trained in hand to hand but not hand to baton. She lifted her forearm to defend her face when the wrist that held it was clamped like a vise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde was back and things went from bad to worse in a hurry, landslide style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia, who had lost all sense of justice, his badge winking in the early morning light swept his free arm into Clyde\u0027s temple. The knuckles of his index and middle fingers jabbing the tender side of Clyde\u0027s head. Clyde stumbled and loosened his hold suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia tightened his grip on the baton, turning on Gale again in a rage. The face that I\u0027d known before, changed irretrievably into a mask of hate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde shook his head and charged Garcia. He took him in the gut and they flew, landing onto the patch of grass that was alarmingly close to my puke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade ran to me and buried her face against my chest. Brett followed her and I left her with him and ran to Garcia and Clyde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde had started the head banging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will not touch my intended!\" Bang, thwack, bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clyde,\" I bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused in his assault, gazed at Gale and began again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia began choking from the hold on his throat by Clyde. I roared over there, sliding in like it was home base and screamed at Clyde, \"Release him!\" I gave the command everything I had, something like tectonic plates slipping inside my brain, the strength of my command making me ill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI though I was gonna toss my cookies again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde let go instantly, staggering to his feet. He backed up, clutching his head with both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia held his throat, gasping and choking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale held up her pulse like a bright red talisman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d pulsed for back up. We all stared at Garcia on the grass, coughing up a lung, glaring at us. Even Howie gazed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d well and truly lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo cop cars showed up and four patrolman poured out, weapons naked in their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pointed the guns at Clyde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved in to protect my zombie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never noticed Brett take Jade in his arms and her shoulders slump in relief. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-20.html","bookId":2493,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM"}
