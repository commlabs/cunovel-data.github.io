{"id":820,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 9 Bathsheba meets a handsome soldier","content":"Farmers always gave a special supper to the sheep shearers when they had finished their work. This year Bathsheba had ordered her maids to put a long table in the garden，with the top end of the table just inside the house. The farm workers took their seats，and she sat at the top of the table，so that she was with them，but a little apart. There was an empty place at the bottom of the table. At first she asked Gabriel to sit there，but just then Mr Boldwood arrived， apologizing for his lateness. ‘Gabriel，’said Bathsheba，‘will you move again please， and let Mr Boldwood sit there？’Gabriel moved away in silence to another seat. They all ate and drank，and celebrated the end of the sheep－shearing by singing their favourite songs. Mr Boldwood seemed unusually cheerful，and at the end of the meal he left his seat and went to join Bathsheba at her end of the table，just inside the sitting-room . It was growing dark，but Gabriel and the other men could not avoid noticing how Boldwood looked at her. It was clear that the middle－aged farmer was deeply in love.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After a while Bathsheba said goodnight to her farm workers，and closed the sitting－room door and windows. Now she and Boldwood were alone. Kneeling in front of her，he took her hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Tell me，tell me what you\u0027ve decided！’he begged.\u0026nbsp; ‘I\u0027ll try to love you，’she answered in a trembling voice. ‘And if you think I\u0027ll make a good wife，I\u0027ll agree to marry you But，Mr Boldwood，any woman would hesitate before deciding on something as important as marriage. Could you wait a few weeks until I\u0027m sure？’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I\u0027ll be away on business for five or six weeks anyway. Do you really think that by that time you will…’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I feel almost sure that when you come back，at harvest time，I\u0027ll be able to promise to marry you. But，remember，I can\u0027t promise yet. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I don\u0027t ask for anything more. I can wait. Goodnight， Miss Everdene！’And he left her.\u0026nbsp; Bathsheba now realized how thoughtlessly she had behaved towards him，and understood how deeply he loved her. She was very sorry for her mistake and was therefore punishing herself by agreeing to marry him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That evening she went round the farm as usual，lighting her lamp whenever necessary，to check that all the animals were safe. On her way back，she was walking along the narrow public path which led to her house. It was very dark there， among the trees，and she was a little surprised to hear some footsteps coming towards her. It was unfortunate that she would meet the traveller at the darkest point of the path. As she was about to pass the dark shape，something seemed to attach her skirt to the ground，and she had to stop\u0026nbsp; ‘What\u0027s happened？Have I hurt you，friend？\u0027a man asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘No，’said Bathsheba，trying to pull her skirt away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Ah！You\u0027re a lady！The spur on my boot has got tied up with your dress. Have you got a lamp？I\u0027ll light it for you. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The light from the lamp shone suddenly on a handsome young man in a bright red and gold army uniform. He looked admiringly at Bathsheba.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Thank you for letting me see such a beautiful face！’he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I didn\u0027t want to show it to you，’she said coldly， blushing. ‘Please undo your spur quickly！’He bent down to pull rather lazily at his boots. ‘You are making it even worse，’she accused him angrily，‘to keep me here longer！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Oh no，surely not，’smiled the soldier. ‘Don\u0027t be angry. I was doing it so that I could have the pleasure of apologizing to such a lovely woman. ’ Bathsheba had no idea what to say. She wondered whether to escape by pulling the material away，but did not want to tear her best dress.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I\u0027ve seen many women in my life，’continued the young man，staring into her face，‘but I\u0027ve never seen a woman as beautiful as you. I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re offended，that\u0027s the truth. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Who are you，then，if you don\u0027t care who you offend？’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘People know me in Weatherbury. My name\u0027s Sergeant Troy. Ah，you see，your skirt\u0027s free now！I wish you and I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; had been tied together for ever！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She pulled her dress quickly away from his spurs，and ran up the path and into her house. The next day she discovered from Liddy that Sergeant Troy\u0027s supposed father was a doctor，but people said his real father was a nobleman. He had been brought up in Weatherbury，and was well known as a young soldier with a great interest in girls. Bathsheba could not remain angry for long with someone who admired her as much as he obviously did. It was unfortunate that Boldwood，when courting her，had forgotten to tell her，even once，that she was beautiful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sergeant Troy was certainly an unusual man. He lived only in the present，caring nothing for the past or the future. Because he never expected anything，he was never disappoint－ed. To men he usually told the truth，but to women，never. He was intelligent and well－educated， and proud of his success with women.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A week or two after the sheep－shearing，Bathsheba was in the hayfields，where her workers were cutting the hay. She was surprised to see a bright red figure appear from behind a cart. Sergeant Troy had come to help on the farm. She blushed as the young soldier came to speak to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Miss Everdene！’he said. ‘I didn\u0027t realize it was the “Queen of Casterbridge market”I was speaking to the other night. I apologize for expressing my feelings so strongly to you 102 then. Of course，I\u0027m not a stranger here. I often helped your uncle on the farm，and now I\u0027m helping you. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I suppose I must thank you for that，’replied the Queen of Casterbridge market rather ungratefully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘You\u0027re cross because I was honest when I spoke to you that night. But I couldn\u0027t look at you，and say you aren\u0027t beautiful！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘You are pretending，Sergeant Troy！’said Bathsheba，laughing in spite of herself at his clever way of talking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘No，Miss Everdene，you must let me say how lovely you are！What\u0027s wrong with that？’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘It\u0027s wrong because—it isn\u0027t true，’she said，hesitating.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘But you know that everybody notices how beautiful you are，don\u0027t you？’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Well，no—that is，I\u0027ve heard Liddy say they do，but…’She paused. She had never intended to become involved in this kind of conversation with the soldier，but somehow he had trapped her into replying. Thank you for helping the men with the hay， she continued. ‘But please don\u0027t speak to me again. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Oh Miss Bathsheba！That\u0027s too hard！I won\u0027t be here long. I\u0027m going back to the army in a month. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘But you don\u0027t really care about a word from me，do you？\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I do，Miss Everdene. Perhaps you think it\u0027s foolish of me to want just a “good morning”，but you have never loved a beautiful woman like yourself，as I do. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘But you only saw me the other night！I don\u0027t believe you could fall in love so fast. I won\u0027t listen to you any more. I wish I knew what time it was. I\u0027ve spent too much time with you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Haven\u0027t you got a watch，miss？I\u0027ll give you one，’and he handed her a heavy gold watch. ‘That watch belonged to a nobleman，my father，and is all the inheritance I have. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘But Sergeant Troy，I can\u0027t take this！It\u0027s your father’s，and so valuable！’said Bathsheba，horrified.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I loved my father，true，but I love you more. ’The young man was not pretending now，as he looked at Bathsheba\u0027s beautiful，excited face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Can it be true，that you love me？You have seen so little of me！Please take it back！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Wll then，I\u0027ll take it，’he said，‘because it\u0027s all I have to prove that I come of good family. But will you speak to me while I\u0027m in Weatherbury？Will you let me work in your fields？’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Yes！Or no，I don\u0027t know！Oh，why did you come and disturb me like this！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Perhaps，in setting a trap，I\u0027ve caught myself. Such things sometimes happen. Goodbye，Miss Everdene！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Blushing and almost crying，Bathsheba hurried home，whis-pering to herself，‘Oh what have I done？What does it mean？I wish I knew how much of what he says is true！\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015/30553.html","bookId":29,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:37:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:37:05 AM"}
