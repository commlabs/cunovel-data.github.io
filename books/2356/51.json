It had begun to snow, a soft, windblown powder that dusted the city. In the administration building of Roffe and Sons, the lights of the deserted offices glowed against the darkness like pale yellow moons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her office Elizabeth was alone, working late, waiting for Rhys to return from Geneva, where he had gone for a meeting. She wished that he would hurry. Everyone had long since left the building. Elizabeth felt restless, unable to concentrate. She could not get Walther and Anna out of her mind. She remembered Walther as she had first met him, boyish and handsome and madly in love with Anna. Or pretending to be. It was so hard to believe that Walther was responsible for all those terrible acts. Elizabeth\u0027s heart went out to Anna. Elizabeth had tried several times to telephone her, but there had been no answer. She would fly to Berlin, to give her whatever comfort she could. The telephone rang, startling her. She picked it up. It was Alec on the other end of the line, and Elizabeth was pleased to hear his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve heard about Walther?\" Alec asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s horrible. I can\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t, Elizabeth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she had misunderstood him. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t believe it. Walther\u0027s not guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police said - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve made a mistake. Walther was the first person Sam and I checked out. We cleared him. He\u0027s not the one we were looking for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth stared at the phone, filled with a sense of confusion. He\u0027s not the one we were looking for. She said, \"I - I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec replied hesitantly, \"It\u0027s awkward doing this over a telephone, Elizabeth, but I haven\u0027t had an opportunity to speak to you alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speak to me about what?\" Elizabeth asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the past year,\" Alec said, \"someone has been sabotaging the company. There was an explosion in one of our South American factories, patents have been stolen, dangerous drugs have been mislabeled. There isn\u0027t time to go into it all now. I went to Sam and suggested that we engage an outside investigating agency to try to find out who was behind it. We agreed not to discuss it with anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though the earth had suddenly stopped and time was frozen. A dizzying feeling of deja vu swept through Elizabeth. Alec\u0027s words were coming through the telephone, but it was Rhys\u0027s voice she was hearing. Rhys saying, Someone has been sabotaging Roffe and Sons. It was done very cleverly, so that it seemed to be a series of accidents. But I began to see a pattern. I went to Sam with it and we decided to hire an outside agency to investigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec\u0027s voice was going on. \"They finished their report and Sam took it with him to Chamonix. We discussed it over the telephone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth could hear Rhys\u0027s voice saying, Sam asked me to come up to Chamonix to discuss it with him...We decided to keep it just between the two of us until we could find out who was responsible for what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth was suddenly finding it hard to breathe. When she spoke, she tried to make her voice sound normal. \"Alec, who - who else knew about the report beside you and Sam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one. That was the whole point. According to Sam, the report showed that whoever was guilty had to be someone high up in the company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highest echelon. And Rhys had not mentioned being in Chamonix until the detective had brought it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked slowly, the words dragged out of her, \"Could Sam have told Rhys about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one way Rhys could have known what was in the report. He had stolen it. There was only one reason he could have gone to Chamonix. To kill Sam. Elizabeth did not hear the rest of what Alec was saying. The roaring in her ears drowned out his words. She dropped the receiver, her head spinning, fighting off the horror that was starting to engulf her. Her mind was a series of chaotic, jumbled images. At the time she had had the Jeep accident, she had left a message for Rhys that she would be in Sardinia. The night of the elevator crash, Rhys had not been at the board meeting, but he had appeared later when she and Kate were alone. Thought I ought to give you a hand. And soon afterward he had left the building. Or had he? Her body was trembling now. It had to be some terrible mistake. Not Rhys. No! It was a scream in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth rose from the desk and on unsteady legs walked through the connecting door to Rhys\u0027s office. The room was dark. She turned on the lights and stood looking around uncertainly, not sure what she expected to find. She was not searching for evidence of Rhys\u0027s guilt, she was looking for evidence of his innocence. It was unbearable to think that the man she loved, the man who had held her in his arms and made love to her, could be a coldblooded murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an engagement book on Rhys\u0027s desk. Elizabeth opened it, turning the pages back to September, to the holiday weekend of the Jeep accident. Nairobi was marked on his calendar. She would need to check his passport to see if he had gone there. She started to look through Rhys\u0027s desk for the passport, feeling guilty, knowing that somehow there had to be an innocent explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom drawer of Rhys\u0027s desk was locked. Elizabeh hesitated. She knew she had no right to break into it Somehow it was a violation of faith, the crossing of a forbidden boundary, from which there could be no return. Rhys would know that she had done this and she would have to tell him why. And yet Elizabeth had to know. She picked up a letter opener from the desk and broke the lock, splintering the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the drawer were stacks of notes and memoranda. She lifted them out. There was an envelope addressed to Rhys Williams in a woman\u0027s handwriting. It was postmarked a few days earlier, from Paris. Elizabeth hesitated a moment, then opened it. The letter was from Helene. It began, \"Chiri, I tried to reach you by phone. It is urgent that we meet again soon to make our plans...\" Elizabeth did not finish reading the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was staring at the stolen report in the drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMR. SAM ROFFE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCONFIDENTIAL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO COPIES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the room begin to spin and she clutched the edge of the desk for support. She stood there forever, eyes closed, waiting for the dizziness to pass. Her killer had a face now. It was the face of her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence was broken by the insistent ringing of a distant telephone. It took Elizabeth a long time to realize where the sound was coming from. Slowly she walked back to her office. She picked up the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the attendant in the lobby, his voice cheerful. \"Just checkin\u0027 that you\u0027re still there, Mrs. Williams. Mr. Williams is on his way up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo stage another accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer life was all that stood between Rhys and the control of Roffe and Sons. She could not face him, could not pretend that nothing was wrong. The moment he saw her, he would know. She had to escape. In a blind panic, Elizabeth grabbed her purse and coat and started out of the office. She stopped. She had forgotten somehing. Her passport! She had to get far away from Rhys, someplace where he could not find her. She hurried back to her desk, found the passport and ran out into the corridor, her heart pounding as though it would burst. The indicator on the private elevator was swinging upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight...nine...ten...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth began racing down the stairs, running for her life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline/page-51.html","bookId":2356,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:13 AM"}
