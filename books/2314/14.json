The body was cremated, and then they had a nice nondenominational service in the clubhouse, and afterward his daughter and son-in-law rode golf carts to the sixteenth hole and put his ashes in the water hazard.” She laughed involuntarily, and let go of his wrist to cover her mouth with her hand. “Pardon me for laughing, but I was thinking what somebody said. How his balls were already there, and now he could go look for them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand returned to his wrist. He looked at her, and her eyes were looking back at him. “Well,” he said. “My car’s at your office, so you’d better run me back there. And then I’ll want to get back to where I’m staying and freshen up, but after that I’d love to take you to dinner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I wish,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have plans?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My daughter lives with me,” she said, “and I like to be home with her on school nights, and especially tonight because there’s a program on television we never miss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re on your own for dinner,” she said, “but what do you and I care about dinner, David? Why don’t you just take me into old Mr. Lattimore’s bedroom and fuck me senseless?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a nice body and used it eagerly and imaginatively. Keller, his mind on his work, had been only vaguely aware of the sexual possibilities, and had in fact surprised himself by asking her to dinner. In the Lattimore bedroom he surprised himself further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward she said, “Well, I had high expectations, but I have to say they were exceeded. Isn’t it a good thing I’m busy tonight? Otherwise it’d be a couple of hours before we even got to the restaurant, and ages before we got to bed. I mean, why waste all that time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to think of something to say, but she didn’t seem to require comment. “For all those years,” she said, “I was the most faithful wife since Penelope. And it’s not like nobody was interested. Men used to hit on me all the time. David, I even had girls hitting on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I was never interested, and if I was, if I felt a little itch, a little tickle, well, I just pushed it away and put it out of my mind. Because of a little thing called marriage. I’d made some vows, and I took them seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then I found out the son of a bitch was cheating on me, and it turned out it was nothing new. On our wedding day? It was years before I knew it, but that son of a bitch got lucky with one of my bridesmaids. And over the years he was catting around all the time. Not just my friends, but my sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your sister?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, my half-sister, really. My daddy died when I was little, and my mama remarried, and that’s where she came from.” She told him more than he needed to know about her childhood, and he lay there with his eyes closed and let the words wash over him. He hoped there wasn’t going to be a test, because he wasn’t paying close attention…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I decided to make up for lost time,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d dozed off, and after she woke him they’d showered in separate bathrooms. Now they were dressed again, and he’d followed her into the kitchen, where she opened the refrigerator and seemed surprised to find it empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed it and turned to him and said, “When I meet someone I feel like sleeping with, well, I go ahead and do it. I mean, why wait?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Works for me,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The only thing I don’t like to do,” she said, “is mix business and pleasure. So I made sure not to commit myself until I knew you weren’t going to buy this place. And you’re not, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A feeling I got, when I said how you should make an offer. Instead of trying to think how much to offer, you were looking for a way out-or at least that was what I picked up. Which was okay with me, because by then I was more interested in getting laid than in selling a house. I didn’t have to tell you about a whole lot of tax advantages, and how easy it is to rent the place out during the time you spend somewhere else. It’s all pretty persuasive, and I could give you that whole rap now, but you don’t really want to hear it, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I might be in the market in a little while,” he said, “but you’re right, I’m nowhere near ready to make an offer at the present time. I suppose it was wrong of me to drag you out here and waste your time, but-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you hear me complaining, David?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I just wanted to see the place,” he said. “So I exaggerated my interest somewhat. Whether or not I’ll be serious about settling in here depends on the outcome of a couple of business matters, and it’ll be a while before I know how they’re going to turn out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds very mysterious,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish I could talk about it, but you know how it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could tell me,” she said, “but then you’d have to kill me. In that case, don’t you say a word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ate dinner by himself in a Mexican restaurant that reminded him of another Mexican restaurant. He was lingering over a second cup of café con leche before he figured it out. Years ago work had taken him to Roseburg, Oregon, and before he got out of there he’d picked out a real estate agent and spent an afternoon driving around looking at houses for sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t gone to bed with the Oregon realtor, or even considered it, nor had he used her as a way to get information on an approach to his quarry. That man, whom the Witness Protection Program had imperfectly protected, had been all too easy to find, but Keller, who ordinarily knew well enough to keep his business and personal life separate, had somehow let himself befriend the poor bastard. Before he knew it he was having fantasies about moving to Roseburg himself, buying a house, getting a dog, settling down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d looked at houses, but that was as far as he’d let it go. The night came when he got a grip on himself, and the next thing he got a grip on was the man who’d brought him there. He used a garrote, and what he got a grip on was the guy’s throat, and then it was time to go back to New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the Mexican café in Roseburg now. The food had been good, though he didn’t suppose it was all that special, and he’d had a mild crush on the waitress, about as realistic as the whole idea of moving there. He thought of the man he’d killed, an accountant who’d become the proprietor of a quick-print shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could learn the business in a couple of hours, the man had said of his new career. You could buy the place and move in the same day, Mitzi had said of the Lattimore house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatterns…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could tell me, she’d said, thinking she was joking, but then you’d have to kill me. Oddly, in the languor that followed their lovemaking, he’d had the impulse to confide in her, to tell her what had brought him to Scottsdale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove around for a while, then found his way back to his motel and surfed the TV channels without finding anything that caught his interest. He turned off the set and sat there in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of calling Dot. There were things he could talk about with her, but others he couldn’t, and anyway he didn’t want to do any talking on a cell phone, not even an untraceable one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself thinking about the guy in Roseburg. He tried to picture him and couldn’t. Early on he’d worked out a way to keep people from the past from flooding the present with their faces. You worked with their images in your mind, leached the color out of them, made the features grow dimmer, shrank the picture as if viewing it through the wrong end of a telescope. You made them grow smaller and darker and hazier until they disappeared, and if you did it correctly you forgot everything but the barest of facts about them. There was no emotional charge, no weight to them, and they became more and more difficult to recall to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now he’d bridged a gap and closed a circuit, and the man’s face was there in his memory, the face of an aging chipmunk. Jesus, Keller thought, get out of my memory, will you? You’ve been dead for years. Leave me the hell alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you were here, he told the face, I could talk to you. And you’d listen, because what the hell else could you do? You couldn’t talk back, you couldn’t judge me, you couldn’t tell me to shut up. You’re dead, so you couldn’t say a goddam word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went outside, walked around for a while, came back in and sat on the edge of the bed. Very deliberately he set about getting rid of the man’s face, washing it of color, pushing it farther and farther away, making it disappear. The process was more difficult than it had been in years, but it worked, finally, and the little man was gone to wherever the washed-out faces of dead people went. Wherever it was, Keller prayed he’d stay there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a long hot shower and went to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning he found someplace new to have breakfast. He read the paper and had a second cup of coffee, then drove pointlessly around the perimeter of Sundowner Estates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the motel, he called Dot on his cell phone. “Here’s what I’ve been able to come up with,” he said. “I park where I can watch the entrance. Then, when some resident drives out, I follow them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, him or her, depending which it is. Or them, if there’s more than one in the car. Sooner or later, they stop somewhere and get out of the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you take them out, and you keep doing this, and sooner or later it’s the right guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They get out of the car,” he said, “and I hang around until nobody’s watching, and I get in the trunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The trunk of their car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I wanted to get in the trunk of my own car,” he said, “I could go do that right now. Yes, the trunk of their car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I get it,” she said. “Their car morphs into the Trojan Chrysler. They sail back into the walled city, and you’re in there, and hoping they’ll open the trunk eventually and let you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Car trunks have a release mechanism built in these days,” he said. “So kidnap victims can escape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re kidding,” she said. “The automakers added something for the benefit of the eight people a year who get stuffed into car trunks?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s probably more than eight a year,” he said, “and then there are the people, kids mostly, who get locked in accidentally. Anyway, it’s no problem getting out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about getting in? You real clever with auto locks?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That might be a problem,” he admitted. “Does everybody lock their car nowadays?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-parade-keller-3/page-14.html","bookId":2314,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:32 PM"}
