A knight draped his cape about Kit’s bare lower half, while the other men stared down at Dougless. Her hair was down, her dress torn, she’d lost a shoe, and Nicholas’s blood was on one sleeve and the other sleeve was missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last Kit quit coughing and leaned back against his brother. Tiredly, Kit looked at Nicholas’s arm that was wrapped tightly about his chest. His brother’s blood trickled down Kit’s bare, wet chest. Kit looked up at his men, and saw all six of them staring down at the Montgomery woman who was crying softly into her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a fine way to treat a man back from the dead,” Kit managed to croak out. “My brother bleeds on me, and a pretty woman sheds tears. Is no one glad that I yet live?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anything, Nicholas’s grip on Kit tightened. Dougless looked up, wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, and sniffed. A knight handed her a handkerchief. “Thank you,” she murmured, then blew her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The maid has saved you,” one of the knights said, awe in his voice. “It is a miracle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Witchcraft,” muttered another man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas looked up at the man, his eyes black with threat. “You call her witch again and you will not live to repeat the words.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men knew that Nicholas meant what he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dougless looked at Nicholas, she knew that his hatred of her was over, and that now he’d listen to her. She blew her nose again, then tried to stand. When she stumbled, one of the men helped her up, but they were all looking at her as though she were part saint, part demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, heavens,” she said, “stop looking at me like that. This is a common practice in my country. We have lots of water and people are always drowning. Really, what I did was no miracle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her relief, she could see the men believed her, but probably only because they wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, I want all of you to stop standing around and get busy. Poor Kit must be freezing, and, Nicholas, your arm is a mess. You two help Kit, and you two see if there are any clean bandages for Nicholas’s arm, and you two go see if the horses survived the trip. Now go! Scurry!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne advantage women throughout time have had is that the little boy in men always remembers a time when women were all-powerful. The men bumped into each other as they ran to do her bidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a shrew on your hands, brother,” Kit said happily. Nicholas still held his brother tightly, as though he were afraid Kit would die if he released him. “Perhaps you would fetch my clothes for me,” Kit said softly to Nicholas, then shook his head as Dougless started for Kit’s clothes piled on the bank of the pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Nicholas released his hold on his brother and started to rise, but he swayed on his feet. The loss of blood, combined with his ride and his fear, had weakened him. Standing to one side, Dougless watched as Nicholas slowly made his way to the bank, picked up Kit’s clothes, then took them back to his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKit accepted the clothes with the solemnity of a king receiving the crown at his coronation, then he grinned. “Sit down, little brother,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Nicholas took a step, he swayed, so Dougless caught him in her arms and led him to sit down; then she sat beside him. Turning, Nicholas put his head on her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKit laughed. “Now that is more the brother I know.” He looked up as his men came back into the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless looked down at Nicholas and stroked his sweat-dampened black curls. This was, at long last, her Nicholas. Here again was the man she’d loved and lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you grow onion-eyed again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words, so heart-stoppingly familiar, did indeed bring tears to her eyes. “The wind,” she murmured. “Nothing more.” She smiled at him. “Give me your arm. I want to see what you’ve done to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObediently, he held up his arm, and her stomach lurched. The bandage was saturated with blood and his hand was encrusted, as well as his sleeve above the wrappings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How bad is it?” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not believe I will lose the arm. The leeches—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leeches!” Dougless said. “You can’t afford more blood loss.” Glancing up, she saw that Kit was now dressed, but he was so weak that he was being supported as the men led him to his horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nicholas, get up. We’re going back to take care of that arm,” Dougless said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nay,” he said. “I would the two of us stayed here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had that look in his eye, that soft, sexy, hooded look that promised he would make Dougless glad she stayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said, even as she bent down to kiss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A woman’s ‘no’ pleases me much,” Nicholas said softly, his uninjured arm moving up to her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir lips didn’t meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, no, you don’t,” Dougless said sternly. “Up! I mean it, Nicholas, get up. You aren’t going to sweet-talk me into doing whatever you want while your arm turns to gangrene. We’re going back to the house and clean up the wound; then we’ll get Honoria to sew it back together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honoria?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She can sew better than anyone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. “The arm does pain me some.” Slowly, reluctantly, he lifted his head from her lap, but, as he moved past her lips, he planted a quick, sweet kiss on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rode slowly back to the Stafford house, and as they approached, Dougless tried to straighten her spine and her clothing. But her dress, torn and bloody, was beyond repair. In the wild ride, she’d lost her little pearl-studded cap. As they drew nearer to the house, Dougless remembered running past Lady Margaret and not speaking, and, too, practically before the lady’s face, she’d kicked the gate open. And now here she was, looking like something off the streets, riding astride, her skirts up to her calves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think I can face your mother,” Dougless said to Nicholas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a puzzled look, but turned away when he heard a shout. One of the guards had ridden ahead, so the news of Kit’s near-death had reached the household. Lady Margaret and all her ladies were waiting to greet them. At the sight, Dougless swallowed in fear. Would she again be accused of witchcraft?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Kit dismounted, Lady Margaret clasped her eldest son to her; then she turned to Dougless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I beg your pardon, my lady,” Dougless said, “for my appearance. I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking Dougless’s face in her hands, Lady Margaret kissed her on both cheeks. “You are beautiful to me,” she said, her voice full of her gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless felt her face grow pink with embarrassment, but also with pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to Nicholas, Lady Margaret glanced at his bloody arm, then yelled, “Leech!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that, Dougless put herself between mother and son. “Please, my lady, may I see to his arm? Please,” she whispered. “Honoria will help me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Margaret seemed to be torn. “Do you have a tablet for wounds?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, just soap and water and disinfectant. Please, let me care for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a look over Dougless’s shoulder to Nicholas, Lady Margaret nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce upstairs in Nicholas’s bedchamber, Dougless gave Honoria a list of things she’d need. “The strongest, harshest soap you have, something with lye in it; then I want a kettle for boiling water, and I’ll need needles—silver needles—white silk thread, beeswax, my tote bag, and the cleanest, whitest linen in this house.” Three maids scurried to do her bidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was alone with Nicholas, she had him soak his bandaged arm in a long copper pan of boiled water she had taken from the kettle over the fireplace. He was bare from the waist up, and as efficient as Dougless tried to be, she could feel his hot eyes on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me of what we once were each to the other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless put more water on to boil. “You came to me in my time.” Now that he was ready to listen, she found herself reluctant to talk. The Nicholas who accused her of witchcraft had no power over her, but this Nicholas, who looked at her with sparkling eyes, made her toes curl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she went back to him, she saw that the dried blood had softened away from the bandages. Propping his arm on the pan, she took small sewing scissors and began to snip away the encrusted bandage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were we lovers?” he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless’s breath drew in sharply. “I cannot do this if you don’t hold still.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not move, you did,” he said, then watched her for a while. “Were we together long? Did we love much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Nicholas,” she said and found to her shame that tears were again coming to her eyes. “It wasn’t like that. You came to me for a reason. You had been found guilty of treason, and you came to my time because Lady Margaret’s papers had been found. You and I researched to find out who had betrayed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she began to peel strips of linen off his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did we find the truth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she said softly. “We did not. I found out the truth after you went back, after you . . .” She looked up at him. “After you had been executed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas’s face was changing, losing its look of sex. He could no longer continue to not listen to the woman. She had known about the servants in the closet when he and Arabella had been fumbling on the table. And she had known about Kit. His heart hammered in his chest when he thought how close he had come to losing Kit. If the woman had not been there, Kit would have died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it would have been Nicholas’s fault, he thought. His own fault and no one else’s, because he’d lied when she’d asked him about the cabinet at Bellwood. She had said that Kit showed Nicholas the cabinet a week before his death, but Nicholas had not listened. He had heard only that she spoke of his handsome brother. His jealousy had nearly cost his brother’s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas leaned back against the pillows. “What more do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth to tell him of Lettice, but she couldn’t, not yet. It was too soon and he didn’t yet trust her enough. She knew he loved Lettice deeply. He had so much wanted to leave the twentieth century—and Dougless—to get back to his beloved wife. It would take more time before she had his trust enough that she could talk to him about his beloved Lettice. Certainly, now was not the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will tell you everything later,” she said, “but now I must see to your arm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless continued pulling the bandage from his wound until she at last saw the deep slash. She’d never been good with bloody wounds, but years of teaching elementary school had taught her to look at chipped teeth, blood-dripping wounds, and broken limbs while remaining cheerful for the child’s sake. She knew Nicholas’s wound needed a doctor, but she also knew that now she was the best that was available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Honoria and the maids returned with all Dougless had ordered, she set them to work. Honoria did not allow the maids to question anything Dougless told them to do. The four women removed their outer sleeves, rolled up the linen sleeves above the elbow; then Dougless had them scour their hands and arms while she boiled needles and silk thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only sedative-type pills she had in her tote bag were what she took to calm her nervous stomach. She wished she had good ol’ Valium, but she didn’t. She gave Nicholas two pills and hoped they’d make him drowsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did, and within minutes, he was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen all the equipment was as clean as she could get it, Dougless set Honoria to sewing Nicholas’s arm. Honoria blanched, but Dougless insisted because Honoria’s stitches were fine and accurate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless wasn’t sure exactly how to do it, but she directed Honoria to sew the gash in Nicholas’s arm in two layers. The inside stitches would have to remain in his arm forever, but Dougless’s father had a steel plate in his leg from his time in the military, so she guessed Nicholas could live with some silk inside his arm. Dougless carefully held Nicholas’s skin together while Honoria sewed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Nicholas’s wound was sewn together, Dougless wrapped his arm in clean linen. She told the maids she wanted them to boil linen to be used the next day, and when they touched the linen, their hands were to be very clean. Honoria said she would see to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Dougless dismissed all of them; then she sat down on a chair by the fire and proceeded to wait—and to worry. If Nicholas developed a fever she had no penicillin, no oral antibiotics, nothing but a few aspirin. She told herself she needn’t worry because she knew Nicholas’s future, but today she had changed history. If Kit didn’t die, then perhaps Nicholas would. Would she go back to the twentieth century and find that Kit had lived to a grand old age, but his younger brother had died from an infected cut on his arm? History, or in this case, the future, was different from now on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours later, Dougless was dozing in the chair when the door opened and Honoria entered. In her arms was a beautiful gown of deep purple velvet, the color of an eggplant, with wide, trailing sleeves of soft white ermine, the little black tails sewn on at intervals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady Margaret sends this to you,” Honoria whispered so as not to disturb Nicholas. “It will have to be fit to you, but I thought you might see it now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless touched the soft velvet. It wasn’t like modern rayon velvet or heavy cotton velvet, but this was all silk and glistened as only silk could. “How is Kit?” Dougless whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sleeping. He says someone tried to kill him. When he swam out to the girl, someone, or maybe two of them, came from under the water, caught his legs, and pulled him under.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDougless looked away. In Lady Margaret’s account found in the wall, she said she believed that Kit had been murdered, that his drowning had not been an accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you had not known how to raise him from the dead . . .” Honoria whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t raise anyone from the dead,” Dougless said sharply. “There was no magic or witchcraft involved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria gave her a hard look. “Your arm no longer pains you? It is well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine now, just a dull ache. It’s—” Breaking off, she refused to meet Honoria’s eyes. Yes, there was magic involved. Her feeling the pain of Nicholas’s cut arm was the least of the magic, but Honoria didn’t need to be told that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should rest now,” Honoria said. “And change your gown.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-knight-in-shining-armor-montgomery-taggart-15/page-42.html","bookId":1851,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:08 PM"}
