If I woke up tomorrow with my tits sewn to the curtains, I wouldn\u0027t be this much in shock,\" I replied petulantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I tried to shut you up. Several times. It\u0027s not my fault everyone now knows you have an irritable vagina. Heh, irritable vagina!\" she laughed at her own joke. “Maybe it’s like irritable bowel and you can get some medication for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim chose that moment to stick his head in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you two yentas are finished discussing Claire’s rabid who-ha, me and the boys would like to eat sometime this century.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and \u0027the boys?\u0027 You just met them today. Does the Ya Ya Brotherhood already have a secret handshake and a password?\" Liz joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim made a production of grabbing his crotch. \"Secret handshake - check. And the password is ‘Claire’s Coochie Kills’.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw an oven-mitt at him, hitting him square in the face. Just then the buzzer to the oven went off and the doorbell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s probably Jenny,\" Liz said as she opened the oven door and pulled out the pan of lasagna. Being the good friend that I am, I had the foresight to send her a text with the news about Jenny joining us for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect timing. We\u0027ll all sit down and eat, she will inevitably say a bunch of stupid shit and everyone will forget about your pikachu. That should give you enough time to figure out a way to tell Carter his boys can swim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later we were all seated around the dining room table, filling up our plates. Thankfully, my earlier embarrassment was pushed to the side while I watched Drew fall all over Jenny. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0027t ignore the Carter situation since he was sitting right across from me and I couldn\u0027t stop staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck he\u0027s hot. I mean, really, really hot. He filled out a lot in five years. I bet he works out. He’s probably a runner. He’s got that lean look to him. I wonder who cuts his hair? It looks like he pays a small fortune to make it look like he doesn’t care what it looks like. Totally works for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit! Focus. Who cares what kind of hair products he uses? How are you going to tell this man he’s a father?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey Carter, how about this crazy weather we\u0027ve been having? Speaking of crazy, your spunk has a crazy backstroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hum of conversation around the table shook me from my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, I was in the left-hand lane and some idiot tried to come over to where I was. I had to slam on my breaks so I didn\u0027t hit the medium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stopped what they were doing and waited for Jenny to correct her mistake. Unless she really meant that she almost ran her car into someone who could communicate with the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, Jenny, do you mean median?\" Jim asked when the silence around the table lasted for far too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused with her fork halfway to her mouth and looked at him funny. \"Isn\u0027t that cement thingy in the middle of the highway called a medium?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter tried to cover up a laugh by coughing, and I saw Drew punch him in the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s alright, Jenny. You can call it whatever you want to,\" Drew said, patting her hand in reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Claire, I forgot to tell you. The purchase I made tonight worked awesome!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should never have taken a drink of my water at that moment. As soon as the words left Jenny’s mouth, I took a deep breath in shock and the water went down the wrong pipe. I started hacking and coughing, tears running down my face as Liz put her fork down and started smacking me on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you buy?\" Drew asked as over a mouthful of noodles and sauce, completely ignoring the fact that I was dying across the table from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter at least gave me a concerned look and did that half-sitting, half-standing thing like he was getting ready to vault over the table to make sure I was okay. His concern for me was hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey Carter, speaking of hot - your hot beef injection had a play date with my eggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best vibrator I\u0027ve ever owned,\" Jenny announced proudly, answering Drew’s question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his turn to choke. Some of the lasagna flew out of his mouth as he pounded his fist against his chest and Carter reached over to slap his palm against his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was starting to look like a Heimlich convention in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously, Liz, you have some great products for sale. I can\u0027t wait to try out the rest of the stuff I bought. What about you, Claire? Did you get some alone time yet with all the toys everyone bought you tonight?\" she said with a wink and a wag of her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, the girls at the party bought you vibrators?\" Liz questioned, suddenly forgetting about the fact that everyone was supposed to be thinking of something other than my down-there-place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope, this isn\u0027t at all uncomfortable. Thanks for asking,\" I said under my breath, with a roll of my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we go back to what Jenny was saying? I\u0027d like some more details about her alone time: location, mood lighting, standing up or sitting down and if she’s in need of a spotter next time. I have excellent upper body strength,\" Drew said with a wink as he recovered from having noodles lodged in his windpipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eeew,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you really sell sex toys?\" Carter said to me with a dreamy look in his eyes as he leaned in my direction with his elbows resting on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel my face heating up. This was not a conversation I wanted to have with him of all people. I was trying to figure out a way to tell him his love mayonnaise had mad skills and no one at this table could stop talking about vibrators. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-29.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM"}
