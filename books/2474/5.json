In each hand he held a plastic bucket brimming with blackberries. His fingers, lips, and chin were stained vivid blue; his alert, dark green eyes were fixed on the vista almost seven hundred feet below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thick forests and black lakes of Usherland were dappled with deep shadow and orange light, like an intricate quilt woven with Halloween colors. And on an island at the center of the largest lake stood the biggest house in the world. Usher\u0027s Lodge, it was called. New had decided long ago that the whole town of Foxton could fit inside it, and there\u0027d still be room for a horse ranch. His ma said even the Ushers themselves couldn\u0027t stand to live in it, and the house had been empty for a long time - except for the thing that dwelled in it, all alone, in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what that thing was, she would not say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few minutes now, the dying sun would paint the Lodge\u0027s walls the color of fire. New could see the sparks of light on the dozens of weathervanes and lightning rods mounted on the slanted slate roofs. On a granite ledge running beneath the roofs were statues of lions, some resting, some stalking. When the sun caught them just right, as it did now, the tawny marble cats seemed to stretch and move, pacing the ledge as if guarding their territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew watched a flock of six wild ducks feeding in the high weeds on the lake\u0027s northern shore. The lake was ebony even in bright sunlight, and in all the many times he\u0027d come to this place to look down, he\u0027d never seen a fish jump from its surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lodge took up almost the entire island. A stone bridge over the lake connected it to one of Usherland\u0027s paved roads. Once, after a particularly hard rain, New had come here and seen the water lapping against the Lodge\u0027s foundations. He let his mind wander over the blue mountains that were the boundary of his world, and he always came back to the same question: What would life have been like, he wondered, if his ma had been an Usher instead of a Tharpe? What if he\u0027d been able to roam those forests, ride horses across the gentle green slopes, see that massive Lodge from the inside? Sometimes he felt a stirring of envy when he saw figures on horseback down there, riding the forest trails. Though he lived on the northern edge of Usherland, he knew he might as well be a hundred miles away. He saw the Lodge in his dreams, and his yearnings to enter it were getting stronger; he never told his ma about the feelings, though. She forbade him and his ten-year-old brother, Nathan, to follow any of the meandering paths from Briartop deeper into Usherland. It was a haunted place, she said. The Ushers were a depraved breed best left alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Pumpkin Man and his black familiar running in the woods, New kept his curiosity about the Lodge in check. Though he\u0027d never seen any of them, he knew the tales by heart. There were things in the woods that roamed at night, things that should be avoided at all costs. He\u0027d found large, bestial footprints in the soil before, and once on a cold January night he\u0027d heard something big moving on the cabin\u0027s roof. He\u0027d taken a flashlight and Pa\u0027s shotgun outside - because now he was the man of the house, no matter how scared he was - and had shone the light up on the roof, but there was nothing there at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he saw the ducks flap their wings and rise from the lake almost as one. They made a V formation and began to fly across the lake, passing the Lodge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFly faster, New thought. Faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ducks gained altitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurry, he urged them mentally. Hurry, before it wakes up and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ducks\u0027 formation was suddenly disturbed, as if by turbulence in the air. Four of them flapped wildly as they began to spin in a confused whirlpool. The other two dropped lower, skimming across the surface of the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurry, he thought, and held his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four ducks veered off course, toward the Lodge\u0027s mountainous north face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne after the other, they smashed into the wall and cascaded down in a shower of feathers, where they lay amid the rotting carcasses of other birds and wildfowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew heard the distant calling of one of the ducks that had escaped - then silence, but for the prowling wind. The Lodge had no windows; all of them - hundreds, in what had been every conceivable shape and size - were bricked up. New guessed why: over the years, birds had probably smashed all the glass out, and the Ushers had decided to seal them over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gettin\u0027 dark,\" Nathan said, standing beside his brother. He carried a single bucket heaped with blackberries, and he kept snapping that doggoned blue whistling yo-yo that Ma had bought him in Foxton. \"Better be gettin\u0027 home, or Ma\u0027ll pitch a fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" New replied, though he didn\u0027t retreat from the Tongue\u0027s edge. He kicked a loose stone off into space. They\u0027d been picking blackberries for the better part of the afternoon. Ma used them in the pies she baked for the Broadleaf Cafe in Foxton. They hadn\u0027t had to pass near The Devil\u0027s Tongue, but New had wandered this way, and had been standing here for ten minutes, staring down at the Lodge. Corpses of birds lay like snow on the many balconies. Perched atop the Lodge, among the chimneys and turrets, was something that looked like a huge discolored lightbulb, opaque and dirty. Why was that house so godawful big, he wondered, and why did he feel the need to come here, day after day, as if in answer to the dreams that beckoned him at night? He saw one of the ducks still jerking at the base of the house, and turned away. The image of the Lodge, bathed in fading sunlight, stayed in his mind. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I guess we\u0027d best get home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotta hurry, too. Gettin\u0027 dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the Tongue - New looked back for only a few seconds - and started walking along the narrow, rocky path that would eventually lead them home, about a mile and a half away. They were supposed to have been home long before dark, and they would have been, New realized, if he hadn\u0027t wanted to stop at the Tongue. Some man of the house, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe families who lived on Briartop\u0027s winding dirt roads had been there for generations. Nestled in shady hollows or clearings where the wilderness had been forced back were several hundred clapboard cabins, just like the one owned by the Tharpes. Briartop was a massive mountain with a rocky peak collared by a jungle of thorns. Those thorns, some said, could creep around you when your back was turned, could trap you so you\u0027d never find your way out again. It was well known that many hunters who\u0027d gone out after the deer on Briartop had been seized and buried by the thorns, and even their bones were swallowed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriartop was part of Usherland, and stood on the northern edge of the thirty-thousand-acre estate. The families inhabiting it were of hardy Scots-Irish stock; they protected their privacy and lived on an abundant supply of deer, rabbits, and quail. Outsiders -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;anyone who did not live on the mountain - were quickly run off by a few warning shots, but then again, outsiders had no use for the mountain, either. The hardships of mountain life were understood, and taken as part of life. Still, the people stayed away from untrodden paths, and made sure their doors were bolted after sundown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I woulda got as many berries as you if I\u0027da had another bucket!\" Nathan said as they walked. \"I coulda filled up three buckets!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cain\u0027t carry but one bucket without spillin\u0027 the other,\" New told him. \"Like last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can so!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cain\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can so!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cain\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe yo-yo, Nathan\u0027s prized possession, whistled impudently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew noted that their shadows were getting longer. Darkness was going to catch them, for sure. They should\u0027ve started for home an hour ago, he thought, but they\u0027d eaten a lot of the blackberries as they picked them, and the sun had felt so good on their backs that they\u0027d forgotten about time. It was harvest season - and that meant the Pumpkin Man might be near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe comes out when the pumpkins are on the ground, New\u0027s ma had told him; he can ride the wind and slither through the brush, and he comes up on you so fast you\u0027ll never know he\u0027s there until it\u0027s too late . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s walk faster,\" New said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got longer legs than me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit playin\u0027 with that damn yo-yo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna tell Ma you cussed!\" Nathan warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strong cold wind had risen, sweeping past the boys and stirring the thick foliage on either side of the path. New shivered, though he was wearing his brown sweater, patched jeans, and a brown corduroy jacket that used to be his pa\u0027s. The man-smell was still in it, the aroma of bay rum and a corncob pipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew was tall for his age. He looked a lot like his father, lean and rawboned, with a sharp nose and chin, a scatter of freckles across his cheeks, and reddish brown hair that curled over his ears and collar. His eyes were large and expressive, and at the same time curious and wary. He was at an awkward age, and he knew it. Standing at the gate of manhood, New couldn\u0027t decide whether he wanted to rush through or back away. Nathan, on the other hand, resembled their mother more. His frame was smaller, and he had a pale complexion, except for two ruddy spots on his cheeks. The kids at the school on the other side of the mountain picked on him because he was little, and New had busted more than one boy in the chops for taunting his little brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew stopped to wait for him. \"Come on, Christmas!\" He was trying to keep his voice calm, though unease was tickling his belly. The darkness was spreading like a blanket over Briartop. Ma said the Pumpkin Man had eyes that shone in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit walkin\u0027 so fast!\" Nathan complained. \"If we hadn\u0027t stayed so long at the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sharp squeaking cry. Suddenly the air around Nathan\u0027s head was filled with fluttering forms that had burst from the underbrush. The smaller boy let out a startled holler and dodged, dancing in a circle. Something was in his hair. He cried out, \"Bats!\" and flung the blackberry bucket at them in scared desperation. They scattered and wheeled into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew had been almost startled out of his britches, but now he watched the things flying away and laughed at his own quick jig of fear. \"Quail,\" he said. \"You scared up a covey of \u0027em!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were bats!\" Nathan insisted defiantly. \"They got in my hair!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bats!\" He wasn\u0027t going to admit that a few measly quail had made his heart knock like a woodpecker. \"Big ones, too!\" He still had the yo-yo in his hand, but suddenly he realized he\u0027d flung the blackberry bucket into the woods. \"My berries!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Lordy. I bet you threw blackberries from here to Asheville.\" They were all over the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027ll skin me if I don\u0027t bring that bucket home!\" He started searching through the brush, saying \"ouch\" every time a thorn nicked his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she won\u0027t. Come on, we\u0027ve gotta get - \" He stopped when Nathan looked at him. His brother was about to cry from frustration; he\u0027d worked hard all afternoon, and now a few quail had made him mess everything up. Life took a mischievous delight in tormenting Nathan. \"All right,\" New said, and set his buckets down. \"I\u0027ll help you look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadows were deepening. New pushed into the brush, thorns jabbing at his clothes. \"Why\u0027d you do that?\" he asked angrily. \"That was a stupid thing to do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Cause they was bats and they was tanglin\u0027 in my hair, that\u0027s why!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quail,\" New said pointedly. He saw something a few feet away and approached it. Snagged in the thorns was a bleached-out piece of cloth. It looked as if it might once have been a shirt. A thorn scraped New\u0027s cheek, and he swore softly. \"I don\u0027t know where the thing went! It might\u0027ve gone to the doggone moon, the way - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took another step forward, and the ground went out from under his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell, his body tearing through kudzu vines, dense weeds, and ropes of thorns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Nathan cry out his name, and then he heard the sound of his own screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d stepped over the edge of the mountain, he realized. He was going to fall to his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was rolling over and over, his flailing hands being torn by thorns. The back of his head smashed into something hard - a rock . . . hit a rock . . . damn it, my head! - and he didn\u0027t know anything else until he heard Nathan calling his name from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew lay still. He was gasping for breath, and there was blood in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . hear me, New? Can you hear me?\" Nathan\u0027s voice was frantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears of pain coursed down New\u0027s cheeks. He couldn\u0027t see, and when he tried to wipe his eyes he couldn\u0027t get his arms free. He was hung in something. There was the strong odor of earth -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and a sharper, sweeter smell. The aroma of something dead, very close to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan?\" he called. Didn\u0027t think he\u0027d spoken above a whisper. \"Nathan?\" Louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust fine, he thought, and almost laughed. Every joint in his body was on fire. He wrenched his right arm as hard as he could, and heard cloth rip; then he wiped the wetness and gummy dirt from his eyes, and he saw in the faint purple light where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t stepped off Briartop, but only into a hollow that had been hidden by underbrush. It was about thirty-five feet deep, he figured, with steeply sloping dirt walls, and angled down into darkness. New was caught in a barbed-wire prison of thorns that had tangled around his chest and legs, manacling his left arm at the wrist. Ugly, inch-long barbs curled all around him, in loops and coils and knots. If he moved, he realized with a shock of fear, they might grab him even tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the worst part was what lay caught in the thorns with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were moldering carcasses in various stages of decay, from fresh bloat to yellow bone. A stag\u0027s skeleton reared its rack of horns toward the sky, hopelessly tangled. There were raccoon, skunk, fox, snake, and bird bones everywhere. A fresh deer carcass was tangled on his right; it had recently burst open. As New twisted his head to the left, barbs scraped across his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot six feet away, enmeshed in the tangle, was a human skeleton. It wore the rags of a red flannel shirt, fringed buckskin pants, and boots. Its mouth gaped wide, as though in a final gasp or scream. Thorns grew along the spine, kudzu vines burst through cracks in the skull. The skeleton\u0027s right arm was twisted backward at a sharp angle, the bone clearly snapped. Several feet away was a rusted rifle, and the hunter wore an empty knife sheath around his waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew struggled violently to free himself. The coils snaked more firmly around his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help!\" he shouted. \"Nathan! Go get help!\" His head throbbed mercilessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan didn\u0027t respond for a few seconds. Then: \"I\u0027m scairt, New. I thought I heard somethin\u0027 just then. Somethin\u0027 walkin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go get help! Get Ma! Hurry, Nathan!\" A thorn was spiked deeply into his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard somethin\u0027, New!\" The boy\u0027s voice was shaking. \"It\u0027s gettin\u0027 closer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon was rising. Like a pumpkin, New thought - and he went cold inside. \"Run,\" he whispered. Then he shouted, \"Run home, Nathan! Go on! Run home!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Nathan\u0027s voice came floating back, there was new determination in it. \"I\u0027ll run get Ma! I\u0027ll save you, New! You\u0027ll see!\" There was the sound of him struggling through the brush, and then a faint cry - \"You\u0027ll see!\" - and silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind moved. Dead leaves floated down into the hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew listened to the sound of his own harsh breathing. The smell of death wafted around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know how much later it was, but he suddenly shivered as a terrible, aching cold passed through his bones. Something was watching him - he could sense it as surely as a hound on the track of a redtailed fox. He looked up toward the lip of the pit, his heart pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTouched by moonlight, a figure stood thirty-five feet above him, on the pit\u0027s edge. It was shrouded in black, and carried something that looked like a sack under its right arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew almost spoke - almost - but his blood had turned icy, and he knew what he was looking at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing was motionless. New couldn\u0027t tell what it was, but it seemed . . . vaguely human. Whatever was under its arm didn\u0027t move, either, but New thought for a terrifying instant that the moonlight shone upon a white, upturned face. The face of a small boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing was gone. If it had ever been there. It had slipped noiselessly away in the space of a heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan!\" he shouted. He continued to call his brother\u0027s name until his voice was reduced to a weary whisper. In his soul he felt the same black despair as when he\u0027d watched Pa\u0027s coffin being lowered into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun, run as fast as you can, \u0027cause out in the woods walks the Pumpkin Man . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shuddering cry of anguish left his lips. Around him, bones rattled when the cold wind swept past. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-5.html","bookId":2474,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:48:27 PM"}
