How pleasing and unfrightening airplanes were on the inside, how different from the hard, silvery, inhuman luster of the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bassinet was on the seat beside her. She peeped in past the blanket and the tiny, ruffled cap. Walter was sleeping. His face was the blank, round softness of infancy and his eyelids were two fringed half-moons pulled down over his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tuft of light brown hair straggled across his forehead, and with infinite delicacy, Laura drew it back beneath his cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would soon be Walter\u0027s feeding time and she hoped he was still too young to be upset by the strangeness of his surroundings. The stewardess was being very kind. She even kept his bottles in a little refrigerator. Imagine, a refrigerator on board an airplane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people in the seat across the aisle had been watching her in that peculiar way that meant they would love to talk to her if only they could think of an excuse. The moment came when she lifted Walter out of his bassinet and placed him, a little lump of pink flesh encased in a white cocoon of cotton, upon her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA baby is always legitimate as an opening for conversation between strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady across the way said (her words were predictable), \"What a lovely child. How old is he, my dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura said, through the pins in her mouth (she had spread a blanket across her knees and was changing Walter), \"He\u0027ll be four months old next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter\u0027s eyes were open and he simpered across at the woman, opening his mouth in a wet, gummy grin. (He always enjoyed being changed)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at him smile, George,\" said the lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband smiled back and twiddled fat fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goo,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter laughed in a high-pitched, hiccupy way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his name, dear?\" asked the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s Walter Michael,\" Laura said, then added, \"After his father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe floodgates were quite down. Laura learned that the couple were George and Eleanor Ellis, that they were on vacation, that they had three children, two girls and one boy, all grown-up. Both girls had married and one had two children of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura listened with a pleased expression on her thin face. Walter (senior, that is) had always said that it was because she was such a good listener that he had first grown interested in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalter was getting restless. Laura freed his arms in order to let some of his feelings evaporate in muscular effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you warm the bottle, please?\" she asked the stewardess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder strict but friendly questioning, Laura explained the number of feedings Walter was currently enjoying, the exact nature of his formula, and whether he suffered from diaper rash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope his little stomach isn\u0027t upset today,\" she worried. \"I mean the plane motion, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lord,\" said Mrs. Ellis, \"he\u0027s too young to be bothered by that. Besides, these large planes are wonderful. Unless I look out the window, I wouldn\u0027t believe we were in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you feel that way, George?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mr. Ellis, a blunt, straightforward man, said, \"I\u0027m surprised you take a baby that age on a plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Ellis turned to frown at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura held Walter over her shoulder and patted his back gently. The beginnings of a soft wail died down as his little fingers found themselves in his mother\u0027s smooth, blond hair and began grubbing into the loose bun that lay at the back of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I\u0027m taking him to his father. Walter\u0027s never seen his son, yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Ellis looked perplexed and began a comment, but Mrs. Ellis put in quickly, \"Your husband is in the service, I suppose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Mr. Ellis opened Ms mouth in a soundless \"Oh\" and subsided.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura went on, \"He\u0027s stationed just outside of Davao and he\u0027s going to be meeting me at Nichols Field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the stewardess returned with the bottle, they had discovered that her husband was a master sergeant with the Quartermaster Corps, that he had been in the Army for four years, that they had been married for two, that he was about to be discharged, and that they would spend a long honeymoon there before returning to San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she had the bottle. She cradled Walter in the crook of her left arm and put the bottle to his face. It slid right past his lips and his gums seized upon the nipple. Little bubbles began to work upward through the milk, while his hands batted ineffectively at the warm glass and his blue eyes stared fixedly at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura squeezed little Walter ever so slightly and thought how, with all the petty difficulties and annoyances that were involved, it yet remained such a wonderful thing to have a little baby all one\u0027s own. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-28.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
