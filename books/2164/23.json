{"id":97798,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\u003cp\u003eInvisible, Aliisza called upon the arcane heritage of her demon blood and transported herself in an instant to the Plains of Soulfire, in Lolth\u0027s Demonweb Pits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared on the broken, cratered landscape amidst caustic pools, steaming fumaroles, and clouds of green vapor. Her demon blood prevented the environment from harming her. She was alone on the plain. Behind her, Lolth\u0027s Infinite Web stretched over a limitless abyss and outward toward forever. The Spider Queen\u0027s city, capped with its pyramidal tabernacle, crawledthe strands. So too did more spiders than there were demons in the Abyss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore her rose sheer jagged mountains as tall as Aliisza had ever seen. Spiders crawled all over them too. Aliisza didn\u0027t know what Lolth saw in spiders. The alu-fiend thought them hideous creatures, as ugly as a dretch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still did n ot know exactly what had transpired. She knew only that Lolth had been reborn as something greater than she had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that Pharaun Mizzrym was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe acknowledgment stirred a strange sensation in her, not unlike the way she\u0027d once felt after going without food for a few days. Her stomach hurt, and her legs felt weak. She felt a sense of loss, or at least of missed opportunity. She would miss Pharaun\u0027s companionship, his ready wit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I bedded him only once, she thought with a pout, though she supposed that was better than not at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll around her lay the signs of a great battle. Severed limbs, broken weapon hafts, rent armor, dented helms, broken earth. She had learned through divinations that Pharaun had died there, fighting Inthracis and his ridiculous Black Horn Regiment. She kicked a nycaloth\u0027s helm and sent it spinning into the nearest steaming pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she was invisible, she felt the eyes of the city on her, lurking the way spiders did, watching, waiting for any sign of weakness. She found herself moving slowly across the landscape, as though she were traversing a web and wanted to keep it still lest the vibrations caused by her movement awaken the spider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe things I do for lust, she thought and smiled through her anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the shadow of Lolth\u0027s city, alone on the Plains of Soulfire, Aliisza methodically scoured the site of the battle. She used spells to assist her search from time to time but mostly relied on her own eyes and ability to see enchanted items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral cast-offs from the battle glowed in her sight but nothing of interest to her until... There.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was almost nothing left. His robes lay in tatters. His flesh, even his bones, were mostly gone, consumed by some rabid yugoloth or arachnida swarm of either or both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something had survived. Aliisza bent and retrieved it. She held it before her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharaun\u0027s severed finger, its flesh intact, still wore his Sorcere ring, which glowed in Aliisza\u0027s sight. She looked at the digit for a time, at the smooth skin, the manicured nail. She wondered what it might feel like to have those fingers on her body again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, she slipped the finger and the ring into her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, dearest,\" she said to the air, \"It looks like I\u0027ll get a piece of you after all. I\u0027ll have to think about what to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, sheteleported away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValas Hune crouched near the top of the magnificent, natural staircase that led up from the floor of Menzoberranzan\u0027s cavern to Tier Breche. Magical traps and wards glowed on the stairs, and two guards from Melee-Magthere stood at the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValas skirted the wards, and the guards looked over and past him. Shrouded in the shadows, he looked down on Menzoberranzan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready the city had mostly returned to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, slaves labored on Tier Breche, rebuilding the damage done to Sorcere and Arach-Tinilith by the duergar stonefire bombs. Many of the slaves were themselves duergar, former soldiers captured rather than slaughtered by the Menzoberranyr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the cavern, Qu\u0027ellarz\u0027orl stood in all its faerie fire-limned majesty. It looked the same as it had for centuries. With House Agrach Dyrr removed from the Ruling Council, Valascould well imagine the scramble among the lesser Houses to seize Dyrr\u0027s position in the hierarchy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings had indeed turned back to normal, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlesh peddlers, spice merchants, narcotic dealers, and more ordinary sellers thronged the booths and shacks of the city\u0027s rebuilt Bazaar. Pack lizards and trade carts crawled along Menzoberranzan\u0027s streets. Qu\u0027ellarz\u0027orl might have been Menzoberranzan\u0027s head, but the Bazaar was the city\u0027s heart. Valas knew that the marketplace reflected the status of the city at any given time. He could see that trade was thriving, which meant that Menzoberranzan was coming back to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumors had been swirling through the city, most merely hard-to-believe, but some patently absurd. Valas didn\u0027t know what he believed but he did know what he saw Quenthel Baenre was once again Mistress of Arach-Tinilith and neither Pharaun, Jeggred, Danifae, or any of the others had returned. Valas heard the unspoken message in that. Of the band that had been sent to find Lolth, none but the high priestess had returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValas was leaving the city, lest he too disappear. He had arranged with Kimmuriel, his Bregan D\u0027aerthe superior, to take a scouting mission far from Menzoberranzan. He would return again, but only after enough time had passed so that Quenthel Baenre had forgotten all about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his surprise, the thought of leaving the city turned him maudlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange, that he would feel nostalgia over such a pit. Menzoberranzan was an ugly, black-hearted bitch who devoured the weak and made bureaucrats of the strong. Still, she managed to evoke a certain attachment in her surviving citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValas supposed that was the secret of her survival. Mean as she was, the drow who lived there called her home and fought like demons to preserve her. He stared at Narbondel, glowing red in the darkness, signaling another day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother day of violence, infighting, murder, and betrayal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLolth and the city deserved each other, he decided, and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith nothing else for it, he turned, melted into the shadows, and headed away from the city for his next mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInthracis the Fifth opened his eyes. Nisviim stood over him, the jackal-faced arcanaloth\u0027s expression slack and distant. Without a word, Nisviim turned and exited the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInthracis lay there, his new mind racing. He had failed. His last memories were of searing pain. The drow mage had captured and incinerated him with a clever combination of spells. Inthracis resolved to remember the tactic so that he might use it himself one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe presumed that Lolth\u0027s Yor\u0027thae had reached the Spider Queen. He did not know which of the three priestesses had been the Chosen One, and he did not care. He cared only about the possibility of facing Vhaeraun\u0027s wrath. If the Masked Lord discovered that Inthracis lived again.... He pushed such thoughts from his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would simply have to hope that Lolth\u0027s wrath with her son would keep Vhaeraun occupied long enough that the Masked God would forget about Inthracis. Meanwhile, the ultroloth would stay in the background for a few decades and allow Nisviim to take a more active hand in the affairs of Corpsehaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up, reveling in the feel of his new body. For a moment, he wondered if Lolth too was adorned in new flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put that thought from his mind, too. He\u0027d had enough of gods and goddesses to last him a long while. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/resurrection-war-of-the-spider-queen-6/page-23.html","bookId":2164,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:43 PM"}
