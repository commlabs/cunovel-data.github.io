I squeeze the muscle just above her knee—making her jump. “I said it was a surprise. Stop fishing for hints, you’re not good at it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s brilliant and strong-minded, but her expressive eyes, tendency to blush, and complete inability to lie convincingly undermine any hope of a successful interrogation. Unless a striptease were being exchanged for information. If that were the case, the prisoners at GTMO would happily spill their guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seem kind of nervous.” She peers at me. “I’m wondering why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe? Nervous?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been over this, but it bears repeating: I don’t get nervous. Anxiety is for incapable chumps. When the world’s at your fingertips, there’s no room—no reason—for worry. Just because I’m about to ask Kate the most important question of our lives, just because I’m going to practically put my balls in her hands—giving her the power to crush them with a single word . . . Christ, that hurts to even think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust because I’ve planned this day down to the finest detail, waited for it, frigging prayed about it, doesn’t mean I’m nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ring feels like a lead weight in my back pocket. I’ve wanted to give it to her a dozen times—but I’ve held out. Because this will be the grandest of all gestures, the kind of romantic fantasy that plays out in those terrible mommy porn books my sister reads, but that you rarely see in real life. After this, there’s no way Kate will say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept . . . she still fucking could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s the rub. The risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s infinitesimally small, but it’s there. She might not be ready. She may think I’m not ready. She might think things between us are fantastic—and she’d be right—so why change anything? She might say, “If it’s not broke, don’t screw with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach twists and turns at all the thoughts. I swallow hard and grip the steering wheel tighter, with suddenly slick palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I’m nervous. There, I fucking said it. Happy now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I do a good job of covering it as I answer her. “Work has me tense. If you’d like to relieve my tension,” I glance at my crotch meaningfully, “I’m more than willing to pull over. Or—even more fun—keep driving while you do what you do so well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckles. “No, don’t want any possible delays—or you crashing into a tree. I want to see my surprise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second the car comes to a stop, Kate climbs out, stands between the open door and the car, hand on the roof, transfixed by the scene in the grassy valley below. Five huge hot-air balloons—each more colorful than the next. It’s an impressive sight. Vibrant, like a bowl full of candy from Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way!” Kate squeals. “This is the surprise? I’ve never been on a hot-air balloon ride!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving Kate new, memorable experiences has kind of become a fetish for me. The joy in her voice, the sparkle in her eyes, the astoundingly physical way she expresses her gratitude—it’s a rush. Like an adrenaline junkie searching for the next cliff to dive off of—I’m always looking for another fix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy smile mirrors Kate’s expression and her exuberance withers the nervous tentacles that wind their way into my brain. I take her hand and together we walk down the lush hill to the boarding platform, toward Mark Jonas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark is the owner of Tri-State Ballooning, a company that offers hot-air balloon rides and courses in ballooning certification. After my fifty-five hours of training, Mark and I are well acquainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate stares up at the massive air-filled bulbs while I shake Mark’s hand. “How ya doing, Drew?” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to see you, Mark.” I gesture to my dark-haired temptress. “This is Kate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate tears her eyes away from the balloons and shakes Mark’s offered hand. “Nice to meet you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to meet you, Kate. Drew’s talked so much about you, I feel like I know you already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s eyes narrow with confusion, until I gesture toward one of the baskets and ask Mark, “She all set to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. “She is. And the other arrangements are ready, too.” With a wink he wishes me good luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smack Mark’s shoulder and slip him a fifty-dollar tip. I open the wicker-basket door and step aboard. Then I hold out my hand to Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth is slightly ajar. “You’re going to fly this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a smirk I explain. “You know how much I adore your body—and my own, for that matter. Do you honestly think I’d trust anyone else to make sure we don’t splatter all over the Hudson Valley?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark passes Kate a folded jacket with his company logo. “In case it gets chilly up there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe accepts the jacket with a chuckle and steps into the basket with me. “Okay, then. Is there anything you can’t do, Drew?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-a-wonderful-tangled-christmas-carol-tangled-4-5/page-20.html","bookId":1809,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:59 PM"}
