At the helm would be an OMC, a stripped-down human brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Organic Mental Cores had a definite edge over the mechanical navigators, and this had been determined clearly long ago by experimenters at Moonbase. Navigation in all planes required subtleties of discrimination and symbol-generation that hardware never achieved. The disembodied, unencumbered brain took pleasure, or so they said, in plotting the impossible course. One goad worked on OMCs that had no effect on mechanical navigators - the OMC needed this job to stay alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe particular OMC that the techs were preparing for installation, the Alyssa Marsh number six, felt no pain or bodily pleasure as the microlaser welded in the necessary hookups. She had been trained in astronavigation at Moonbase and had borne a child in the year after splashdown on Pandora. The story that she filtered back to Flattery had the child die in an earthquake, and Alyssa Marsh had launched herself into her kelp study project with a passion. Her body had been crushed in a kelp station accident, but Flattery saw to it that her silent brain lived on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon she would be silent no more. Soon her brain would have a body that it could move - the Voidship Nietzsche. She would navigate knowing the differences between ability and desire, knowing the need for dreams. Right now she lay genderless behind a pair of locked hatches dreaming of a banquet where Flattery was the host and she was both the honored guest and the main dish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwarf MacIntosh gathered his forces outside both hatches and tried once more to contact Captain Brood. There was no reply from the OMC chamber. Three of the four monitors inside were blacked out, but the one remaining showed an overhead view of the long, specialized fingers of a nerve tech probing the webwork that encased what remained of Alyssa Marsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hookup\u0027s not scheduled until next week,\" someone said. \"What\u0027s going on in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lasgun barrel appeared on the screen, pointed at the tech.

Nor could Ben see Nevi and Zentz. Rico whistled the \"get down\" signal, hoping that the couple wouldn\u0027t run out of the boundaries of the image. They would be visible then, and in the open against an incoming tide. Rico dropped when Nevi started shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to send him a more suitable surprise, Rico thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wriggled into a position of better cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevi laid a pattern of fire into the rocks that hid Ben and Crista. Zentz covered Nevi\u0027s rear, keeping the dozen local Zavatans pinned down. Nevi stopped firing, but kept his wary crouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save charges,\" he warned Zentz. \"We might be here awhile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll was quiet except for their harsh breathing, the seething of the incoming tide and the high-pitched ping of weapon barrels cooling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico was held firmly around the waist by a budding tip of kelp vine. It reminded him of his father\u0027s arm, and the way it used to pick him off the deck in one swoop. The feathery bud of kelp felt like the palm of a small woman\u0027s hand on his belly, covering his navel, hugging him from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn image of Snej flashed through his mind and just as suddenly Snej\u0027s face appeared in thin air about ten meters in front of Nevi. The rising tide licked at the hylighter skin beneath her and hissed over Nevi\u0027s boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hel... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevi advanced a step, two steps. Zentz moved with him, backward, step for step. He glanced over his shoulder and paled when he saw Snej. He snapped his attention back to their rear defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The redhead,\" he gurgled, \"where\u0027s the rest of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico found he could reinforce the intensity of the image by looking at it, concentrating on it. It was like a huge coil of energy feeding on itself, refining itself, awakening. After a couple of slow, calming breaths he was able to materialize the rest of her. She stood there in her green singlesuit, hands on her hips, staring at Nevi. She was a bit larger than life size. He wondered if he could make her speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Nevi said, \"she\u0027s here, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother glance over his shoulder and Zentz began a wet, ragged breathing that Rico could hear a dozen meters away over the surf. He placed his back tight against Nevi\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, Nevi, a head that grows a body,\" he whined. \"Let\u0027s get back to the foil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevi stopped and looked over the scene behind Snej. It was nearly the same view that Rico had: black rocky stretch of beach between the tide and the cliff, a cluster of large basalt boulders and a foil draped with the wet shards of an unexploded hylighter. In the downcoast distance the great expanse of sea glowed like green lava against the black cliffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they?\" Nevi asked her. \"I want them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA two-toned whistle told Rico that the Zavatans were in position to rush the two men. He noticed that his illusion of Snej didn\u0027t cast a shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t think I can manage that, too, he thought. Talking will be enough of a challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shadow melted from her feet on the hylighter skin to where it met the beach, no more. It lay parallel with the other lengthening shadows of the day, but amputated at the rim of the skin. The tide already rushed the edges of the image, breaking up the light. With luck, Nevi wouldn\u0027t notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico smiled, concentrating on Snej, and quickly thanked Avata in the back of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your weapons down,\" Snej said. \"It is finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no sound came from her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Rico muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZentz responded with a burst from his lasgun. It came so fast that it startled Rico out of the illusion and it pulverized a rock just a meter in front of him. Avata brought the lost image back. Nevi fired, too, advancing them another step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not real,\" he told Zentz. \"Watch yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we\u0027re dusted,\" Zentz said. \"All this hylighter cra...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever know two dusters to share the same hallucination?\" Nevi asked. He stopped a pace from Snej, squinting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something\u0027s not righ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico held his breath. If Nevi stepped across the plane of the image, he\u0027d see Ben and Crista, and Rico wouldn\u0027t be able to see Nevi. The entire area over the downed hylighter became a dome of imagination, a hypnotism of light, a life sculpture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must be a threshold of consciousness beyond which a conscious being takes on the attributes of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Umbilicus crew member, Voidship Earthling, from The Histories\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMose\u0027s eyes were open so wide that he looked even smaller to Twisp than he had when a refugee band had carried him in half-starved ten years ago. Memories - they kept him from the kelp as they drew Kaleb. Twisp had watched the struggle for nearly a quarter-century. The kelp must be like a drug to Kaleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the kelp, Twisp thought. The past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp knew, too, how the kelp always drew him to a particular part of the past, a particular year, a particular woman. Twisp had thought her the most beautiful woman on Pandora. Later, after Flattery and the others had been removed from the hyb tanks, Pandorans got a look at unmutated humans for the first time in over two hundred years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all so testy about being clones, Twisp recalled, when \"clone\" wasn\u0027t even something you could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the bitter ceremony, with Raja Lon Flattery presiding, in which the hyb tank survivors purged the telltale \"Lon\" from their names forever. It was done with a ridiculous solemnity, and did not bestow on Flattery\u0027s people any of the attributes that Pandora demanded of them: better reflexes, more intelligence, teamwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What they didn\u0027t tell you in school,\" Twisp told Mose, \"was that Flattery couldn\u0027t control Kareen Ale. She was killed, like Kaleb\u0027s parents, by Flattery\u0027s death squad. She was the first victim. There are those who believe it was Nevi himself who did it. Shadow Panille was head of Current Control in those days. He was in love with Kareen Ale. The combination killed him, too.
