While no one had died during the Mayflower\u0027s voyage, life after arrival was extremely difficult, especially for the young. Almost all of the lost were hardly sixteen years of age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staggering mortality rate was partly due to a harsh winter, as well as the fact that, while the men were out in the air, building homes and drinking fresh water, women and children were confined to the damp, crowded recesses of the ship, where disease could spread much more quickly. After the two-month voyage, they remained on the ship for an additional four months while the men built storehouses and living quarters on land. Young Puritans routinely cared for the sick, increasing their exposure to a vast array of illnesses, including a fatal affliction of the blood that historical documents called \"consumption.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyles Standish was elected governor of the colony in 1622 for thirty consecutive one-year terms. He and his wife Rose had fourteen children, a remarkable seven sets of twins. In an extraordinary turn of events, within a few years, the colony had doubled in size, with multiple births reported in all the surviving families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- From Death and Life in the Plymouth Colonies, 1620ï¿½C1641 by Professor Lawrence Winslow Van Alen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine Carver\u0027s Diary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21st of November, 1620\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mayflower\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been a difficult winter. The sea does not agree with John, and we are always cold. Perhaps we will find peace in this new land, although many believe we have not left danger behind. Outside my window, the coastline resembles Southampton, and for that I am grateful. I will always long for home, but our kind are no longer safe there. I myself do not believe the rumors, but we must do as instructed. It has always been our way. John and I are traveling as husband and wife now. We are planning on marrying soon. There are far too few of us, and more are needed if we are to survive. Perhaps things will change. Perhaps good fortune will shine on us, and our situation will ameliorate. The ship has anchored. We have landed. A new world awaits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- C.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNEW YORK CITY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Present\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blue-bloods-blue-bloods-1/page-1.html","bookId":1864,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:41:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:41:33 PM"}
