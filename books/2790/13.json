Roll over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I will, too, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roll over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored the obvious crack. \"We\u0027ll just have a nap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then all my problems will be solved! Thank goodness for your little plan. Shel, I\u0027ve tried this. It doesn\u0027t work. I can\u0027t nap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes you can. Just close your eyes and go to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean it. Even when I didn\u0027t have insomnia. I can\u0027t sleep during the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shel! Jesus, did you really think I wouldn\u0027t have thought of this if the great Dr. Rivers hadn\u0027t come along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get that on a T-shirt? \u0027The Great Dr. Rivers\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve tried this stuff, okay? It doesn\u0027t work. I can\u0027t nap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I\u0027m not asking you to cure bone cancer, for crying out loud, just take a nap at five o\u0027clock.\" He propped himself up on his side and rubbed her arm, then began to sing in a cracking baritone, \"Go to sleeeeeeep… goooooo to sleeeeeeep…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How in the hell am I supposed to sleep with that racket?\" she bitched. \"Yet another flaw: you sing like old people drive. I\u0027m keeping a list, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"… I\u0027m ignoring you… gooooo to sleep…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop singing,\" she said, \"and I\u0027ll close my eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done and done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty minutes later…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get up now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you not sleep?\" he demanded, looming over her. \"You did that on purpose!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I really get off on irritability, memory loss, loss of appetite, and all the other fun effects of long-term insomnia. Also, I\u0027m conducting a survey, and it doesn\u0027t matter how many channels you have, there is nothing on at four in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that would not fucking surprise me!\" he shouted, sitting up. \"Who lies in a sumptuous royal suite, getting sung to sleep on a feather bed with expensive pillows and all that fancy shit, and doesn\u0027t sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all part of my sinister plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stomped around the bedroom for a minute, and she got up to brush her hair, amused. He really seemed genuinely annoyed that his plan hadn\u0027t worked. Men! She admired their confidence:I can fix it, just give me a minute .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hell,\" he said after muttering and grumbling. \"I guess we\u0027d better have dinner, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those were our only choices?\" she teased. \"Nap or eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well…\" He crossed the room and went to his navy-blue backpack. Which was odd, as she\u0027d never seen him with one before. And it was strangely deflated, as if there weren\u0027t very many things inside. \"I did have one idea…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you bring some Ritz? Because Iam a little hungry… one nice thing about being on the road is I don\u0027t have to wait until eight o\u0027clock to eat supper.\" She blinked. \"What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up something shiny, something the light bounced off of. Handcuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Dr. Rivers,\" she said, staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, it\u0027s not what you think,\" he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? It\u0027s not? Because I\u0027m thinking you\u0027re a man just full of surprises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, thanks.\" He was still holding the cuffs up, watching them spin lazily. \"What I was afraid you were thinking was that I was some big old perv.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed nervously. \"No, I wasn\u0027t thinking that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, and I know it\u0027s a big step for us, and you more than most people have to worry about, you know, the Paris Hilton effect and all that—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a video camera in there?\" She tried to figure out if she was horrified, or interested. \"I\u0027m dying to see what else you carry around with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! No no no. I\u0027d never ask you to do that. Do it on camera, I mean. Like I said, you more than most people would have to worry about it getting out. Although these things don\u0027t just \u0027get out\u0027,\" he added in a mutter. \"The asshole ex-boyfriend sells her out, is what—okay, we\u0027re getting off the subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the subject was bondage?\" She sat on the edge of the bed and looked up at him like an attentive pupil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah. And a change of clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Sorry, I\u0027m having a little trouble following you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my pack.\" He held the bag open and showed her; she could see a glimpse of white cotton, denim, and buttercup yellow. \"I got you some souvenir T-shirts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome. I also brought a change of clothes. In case you, uh, we decided to spend the night. That I could spend the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One thing at a time, doctor. I\u0027m pretty sure,\" she mused, \"that I don\u0027t know you well enough to let you cuff me to the headboard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That reminds me.\" He dug through the pack and she heard the clink as he held up the second pair. \"Okay, don\u0027t freak out, but because it\u0027s a headboard, we need two pairs. Otherwise you\u0027re lying on your hands and I don\u0027t think that\u0027d be very comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem to know a lot about it,\" she observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushed. Blushed like a kid! His cheeks went red and his eyes seemed to get darker. \"I\u0027ve never done this before. It just seemed logical, the hand thing. You\u0027re the only girl I ever wanted to tie up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Dr. Rivers!\" To cover her extreme nervousness, she folded her hands over her breasts and looked up at him adoringly, batting her eyelashes. \"That\u0027s so sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her relief, he laughed, and some of the high color left his cheeks. \"Yeah, yeah, very funny. But I really haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, I\u0027m dying to know… where did you get two pairs of stainless steel handcuffs in Minot? You didn\u0027t—\" She nearly vomited as the thought struck her. \"You didn\u0027t ask my security team for them, d—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. God, no, I\u0027d never do that. Didn\u0027t I just get done telling you I was sensitive to your needs, as a celebrity, not to be sexually embarrassed on the World Wide Web? Or anywhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where did you get them?\" she asked, calming down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her. \"Some things,\" he vowed, \"will never be told. Suffice it to say, there are some interesting people frequenting the sex shop in this town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I bet they all have doctorates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m assuming, from all the joking, that you haven\u0027t done this with anyone either?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not hardly,\" she said, watching him spin the cuffs on the end of his right index finger. \"I was nervous enough about losing my virginity, and I was nineteen when I got around tothat .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, here\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking. Think fast.\" He tossed her a pair and she caught them by reflex. Out of pure curiosity she studied them. Yes indeed, stainless steel and very sturdy. \"I think it\u0027s a control issue. With you. And not coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh boy,\" she said, flopping back down on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear me out! I think if you gave up a little bit of control, you might have a better time. That\u0027s all. It\u0027s an experiment. If it works, great. And if it doesn\u0027t—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a money-back guarantee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"No. I guess I\u0027ll throw them away if it doesn\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shel.\" She sighed. \"I told you it wasn\u0027t a problem for you to fix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m a fixer,\" he said cheerfully. \"I figured, we start out slow, and if you don\u0027t like it, we\u0027re done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied the cuffs again. \"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m even thinking about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re right in that we haven\u0027t known each other very long, but how many girls have a team of highly-trained bodyguards in the next suite, ready to kick the living shit out of me if I forget the safety word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burst out laughing. \"I hadn\u0027t thought about it like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which isDendrochirus zebra , by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The safety word.\" At her confused (possibly aghast) expression, he hurried to explain. \"You know, in case one of us takes it too far by accident. It\u0027s got to be a word you wouldn\u0027t use in everyday conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyday conversation! What the hell does it even mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the Latin name for zebra lionfish,\" he explained, in an \"everybody knows that\" tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about just zebra? I don\u0027t use that too much in everyday conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, okay, I guess, if you think—\" He did a comical double-take, just like in an old comedy. \"You want to? You\u0027ll give it a try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, why not? Being cuffed isn\u0027t as scary as trying to rememberDendrochirus zebra.\" Or watching your father get shot , a tiny voice in her mind spoke up, and she stomped on it like a bug, made it gone. \"You had a point about my guards, anyway. Try anything fishy, and you\u0027re shot, clubbed, or stabbed. Possibly all three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s so romantic. And it\u0027sDEN-drochirus ,\" he whispered, taking her in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time they had stripped and he had carefully cuffed each of her wrists to a section of the barred headboard, she was shocked to realize how excited she was. And when he slipped a hand between her thighs, he was shocked too, she saw at once, and the blood rushed to his face again—but not out of embarrassment. No indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she couldn\u0027t see his face any longer as it disappeared between her legs, as he licked and kissed away the wetness she had made, they had made. His tongue was stabbing into her; it was like a knife that didn\u0027t hurt, one made of sweet darkness, one she felt all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel his bristly cheeks—he hadn\u0027t shaved that day—rubbing against her inner thighs, felt his hands stroking her outer thighs, rubbing them restlessly, ceaselessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for starting out slow, she thought, and that made it more exciting, which she hadn\u0027t thought possible. That he couldn\u0027t. That they couldn\u0027t. That he\u0027d dived between her legs and she didn\u0027t mind, that he hadn\u0027t gone near her breasts or her mouth and she didn\u0027t mind, that she was about to… to… \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-13.html","bookId":2790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM"}
