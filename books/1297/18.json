He agrees to it, but at the same time charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further pursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend, after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at the sight of Patroclus in Achilles\u0027 armour, taking him for that hero, are cast into the uttermost consternation; he beats them off from the vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was averse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle are described; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of Achilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him, which concludes the book.\n\u003cbr\u003e So warr\u0027d both armies on the ensanguined shore,\n\u003cbr\u003e While the black vessels smoked with human gore.\n\u003cbr\u003e Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;\n\u003cbr\u003e The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes\n\u003cbr\u003e Not faster, trickling to the plains below,\n\u003cbr\u003e From the tall rock the sable waters flow.\n\u003cbr\u003e Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.\n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:243\n\u003cbr\u003e [pg 289]\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,\n\u003cbr\u003e That flows so fast in these unmanly tears?\n\u003cbr\u003e No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps\n\u003cbr\u003e From her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;\n\u003cbr\u003e Not more the mother\u0027s soul, that infant warms,\n\u003cbr\u003e Clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,\n\u003cbr\u003e Than thou hast mine!
