They all told him the same story. Lachlan and Ilysa were both held in such regard that they were allowed to walk out of the castle with nary a question, despite Connor\u0027s explicit command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know where she is,\" Connor said for the hundredth time as he wore out the floor pacing. Alex had chosen to believe the obviously fabricated story about an ill child and was annoyingly unconcerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s work on a problem we can solve.\" Alex stretched out his long legs and yawned. \"I believe I can tell ye who your spy is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do ye claim ye have The Sight now?\" Connor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ach, \u0027tis a simple matter once I have the right information,\" Alex said with an amused glint in his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in no mood for games,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re looking for a man, or a woman, who has a grudge against ye or something important to gain by helping Hugh,\" Alex continued, undeterred. \"Our culprit also must be ruthless enough to murder two innocent men of his clan to serve his purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex was right. There was always a reason people did what they did; it was just a matter of discovering what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on his door interrupted his contemplation of suspects. When Connor opened it, one of the men he had upbraided earlier for letting Lachlan and Ilysa leave was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought you\u0027d want to know that Lachlan\u0027s returned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLachlan was hauled up the stairs and into the chieftain\u0027s private chamber. While Connor clenched his fists and looked ready to murder him, a long, lean, warrior sat with his feet propped up on Connor\u0027s table. The visitor had the look of an ancient Viking except for the amusement in his sea-green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you and Ilysa done? Betrayed us to the MacLeods or to Hugh?\" Connor shouted at him, looking every inch the warrior chieftain. \"How could you, a man who has been hailed as a hero of our clan, commit this egregious act? After I trusted ye enough to make ye my captain, this betrayal cuts deep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLachlan felt himself sinking fast in a sea of disaster. Somehow, Connor had discovered his crime. But why did he mention Ilysa, as if she had been an accomplice in the attempted assassination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what I\u0027m accused of,\" Lachlan said, instinctively defending himself, though he was guilty as hell. \"As for Ilysa, your imagination far exceeds mine if ye can conceive of her betraying the clan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the two of ye talking alone time and again,\" Connor said, his eyes flashing. \"And now, ye sneak her out of the castle against my orders. You\u0027ve betrayed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Jesu, was that all? Being caught violating Connor\u0027s order to keep Ilysa in the castle was a slight offense compared with Lachlan\u0027s near-successful attempt to murder the MacDonald chieftain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sister\u0027s child was ill,\" Lachlan said. \"She would not have lasted the night without Ilysa\u0027s care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An easy claim to make,\" Connor said, folding his arms. \"Why should I believe ye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we can rule him out as Hugh\u0027s spy,\" the warrior lounging in the chair put in. \"Evidently, he has no need to stab your guards to get them to leave their posts or open the gate for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO shluagh, Connor suspected him of that? \"Ye can ask my sister - ye know both her and the child,\" Lachlan said. \"Ye were at her and Malcom\u0027s home the night the MacLeod warriors attacked. My sister told me ye saved wee Brigid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your sister\u0027s family?\" Connor asked. \"Is the child all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, thanks to Ilysa\u0027s healing skills,\" Lachlan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye brought Ilysa back with ye?\" Connor asked and started heading for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Lachlan said, bringing Connor to an abrupt halt. \"She didn\u0027t want ye to know where she is, and she claims she\u0027s never coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else did she say?\" Connor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLachlan hesitated. \"She may have mentioned something about marrying another chieftain...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor made a growling sound and started pacing the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, Ilysa\u0027s safe, and ye can sort this out later,\" the tall blond warrior said and stretched his arms as if he hadn\u0027t a care in the world. \"\u0027Tis time for fighting, aye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLachlan was more than ready to change the subject. \"Malcom crossed the inlet to the other peninsula and saw scores of MacLeod warriors moving south, toward the river,\" he told Connor. \"Ye were right - if they were attacking the castle, they\u0027d come by sea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of shouts from the courtyard, he and Connor rushed to the windows. Even the visiting warrior was stirred to drop his feet from the table and join them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fleet of war galleys is coming!\" one of the men shouted up to Connor. \"Our men from Sleat are here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor strode out of the room. When Lachlan started to follow him, the other warrior stopped him with a steel grip on his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the chieftain\u0027s cousin Alex,\" he said. \"Is Ilysa all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Lachlan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Alex said with a smile that did not reach his cold, green eyes. \"Because I\u0027ll skin ye alive if you\u0027ve harmed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a mix of relief and anguish, Connor watched the MacIain galleys - all six of them - sail toward the bay behind Ian and Duncan\u0027s boats. MacIain had arrived in time for the battle and met Connor\u0027s condition for the marriage alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shame I asked my father-in-law to use his warriors to guard North Uist for me so I could bring more of our own men to this fight,\" Alex said as they waited on the shore for the galleys to come in. \"If I\u0027d known Ilysa wanted to marry him, I would have brought him along instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor ignored the taunt. He understood why Alex was angry - hell, he was angry with himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hope you\u0027re ready to fight,\" he greeted Duncan and Ian after their galleys were pulled onto the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is my sister?\" Duncan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s away from the castle caring for a sick child,\" Connor said. This was not the time to tell Duncan that his sister did not intend to return to the castle - and it would never be a good time to tell him why. Duncan, I took your sister to bed, then condemned her for a traitor and attempted to hold her prisoner. She\u0027s a wee bit upset with me. If Alex was right and Ilysa was innocent, he had committed another great wrong against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have ye found Ilysa a husband yet?\" Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Connor said keeping his voice even. He wanted to strangle Alex for goading him in front of Duncan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ach, you\u0027re slacking in your duty to her,\" Alex said. \"But I suppose ye have been busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan raised an eyebrow and shot a look between him and Alex - and just like that, Connor could tell that Ian had guessed that something had happened between him and Ilysa. It was one thing to know each other so well that they could read each other\u0027s minds on the battlefield; this was quite another. Praise God Duncan had a blind spot when it came to his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ach, no, why did MacIain bring a Campbell with him?\" Connor asked when he caught sight of the boar-head crest of the Campbell clan on the sail of one of the galleys. Damn it. He had hoped to have the battle with the MacLeods concluded before the Crown\u0027s lieutenant learned of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s John Campbell in that galley,\" Ian said, referring to the Campbell chieftain\u0027s brother, who was also the Thane of Cawdor. \"The other galleys are his as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MacIain is no coming?\" Connor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Ian said. \"He\u0027s dead.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-chieftain-return-of-the-highlanders-4/page-41.html","bookId":2647,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:09 AM"}
