She couldn’t believe Steve would dare to ask such a question when the answer was so obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s what I want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was drawn extremely tight – almost menacing. She moved into the room and sat across from him, her heart ready to explode with dread. She met his look squarely, asking no quarter, giving none. The prolonged moment magnified the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m three months pregnant. This child is yours,\" she said, struggling to keep her voice even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don’t lie to me, Carol. I’m not completely dense.\" The anger that seeped into his expression was fierce enough to frighten her. Steve vaulted to his feet and started pacing in military fashion, each step precise and clipped, as if the drill would put order to his thoughts and ultimately to his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol’s fingernails dug into the fabric on the sides of the overstuffed chair and her pulse went crazy. Her expression, however, revealed none of the inner turmoil she was experiencing. When her throat felt as if it would cooperate with her tongue, she spoke. \"How can you even think such a thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve splayed his fingers and jerked them through his hair in an action that seemed savage enough to yank it out by the roots. \"I should have known something was wrong when you first contacted me at Christmastime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol felt some color flush into her cheeks; to her regret it probably convinced Steve she was as guilty as he believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That excuse about not wanting to spend Christmas alone was damn convenient. And if that wasn’t obvious enough, your little seduction scene should have been. God knows, I fell for it.\" He whirled around to face her. \"You did plan that, didn’t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I…I…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn’t you?\" he repeated, in harsh tones that demanded the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiserable and confused, Carol nodded. She had no choice but to admit to her scheme of seducing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne corner of his mouth curved up in a half smile, but there was no humor or amusement in the action. The love that had so recently shone from his eyes had been replaced by condemnation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If only you would let me explain.\" She tried again, shocked by this abrupt turn of events. Only a few hours before, they’d lain in each other’s arms and spoken of a reconciliation. The promise that had sprung to life between them was wilting and she was powerless to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could you possibly say that would change the facts?\" he demanded. \"I was always a fool when it came to you. Even after a year apart I hadn’t completely come to terms with the divorce and you, no doubt, knew that and used it to your advantage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steve, I – \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s little wonder,\" he continued, not allowing her to finish speaking, \"that you considered me that perfect patsy for this intrigue. You used my love for you against me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, so I planned our lovemaking Christmas Eve. You’re right about that. I suppose I was pretty obvious about the whole thing when you think about it. But I had a reason. A damn good one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol hadn’t realized a man’s eyes could be so cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That cake you’re baking in your oven isn’t mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, honestly, Steve. Your paranoia is beginning to wear a little thin. I’m doing my damnedest to keep my cool here, but you’re crazy if you think anyone else could be the father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his index finger. \"You’re good. You know that? You’re really very good. That fervent look about you, as though I’m going off the deep end to even suspect you of such a hideous deed. Just the right amount of indignation while keeping your anger in check. Good, very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that,\" she shouted. \"You’re being ridiculous. When you get in this mood, nothing appeases you. Everything I say becomes suspect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand wiped his face free of expression. \"If I didn’t know better, I could almost believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated it when Steve was like this. He was so convinced he was right that no amount of arguing would ever persuade him otherwise. \"I’m going to tell you one last time, and then I won’t say it again. Not ever. We – as in you and I, Steve – are going to have a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve stared at her for so long that she wasn’t sure what he was thinking. He longed to believe her – she could recognize that yearning in his eyes – and yet something held him back. His Adam’s apple moved up and down, and he clenched his jaw so tightly that the sides of his face went white. Still the inner struggle continued while he glared at her, as if commanding the truth – as if to say he could deal with anything as long as it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol met that look, holding her gaze as steady and sure as was humanly possible. He wanted the truth, and she’d already given it to him. Nothing she could say would alter the facts: he was her baby’s father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve then turned his back on her. \"The problem is, I desperately want to believe you. I’d give everything I’ve managed to accumulate in this life to know that baby was mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything about Steve, the way he stood with his shoulders hunched, his feet braced as if he expected a blow, told Carol he didn’t believe her. Her integrity was suspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I… my birthday – I was thirty,\" she said, faltering as she scrambled to make him recognize the truth. \"It hit me then that my childbearing years were numbered. Since the divorce I’ve been so lonely, so unhappy, and I thought a baby would help fill the void in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look at her as she spoke, then closed his eyes and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust looking at the anguish in his face was almost more than Carol could bear. \"I know you never believed me about Todd, but there’s only been one lover in my life, and that’s you. I figured that you owed me a baby. I thought if I invited you to spend Christmas with me and you accepted, that I could probably steer us into the bedroom. None of the problems we had in our marriage had extended there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carol, don’t – this isn’t necessary. I already know you were – \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is. Please, Steve, you’ve got to listen to me. You’ve got to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from her again, but Carol continued talking because it was the only thing left for her to do. If she didn’t tell him now, there might never be another chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn’t count on anything more happening between us. I’d convinced myself I was emotionally separated from you by that time and all I needed was the baby…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have been worried when I didn’t fall into your scheme immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Carol felt frantic and helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn’t immediately suggest we get back together – that must have had you worried. After Christmas Eve we decided to leave things as they were.\" He walked away from her, but not before she saw the tilt of righteous indignation in his profile. \"That visit to my apartment… what was your excuse? Ah yes, a button you’d found and thought might be mine. Come on, Carol, you should have been more original than that. As excuses go, that’s about as flimsy as they get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, if you want me to admit I planned that seduction scene, too, then I will. I didn’t get pregnant the way I planned in December… I had to try again. You had to know swallowing my pride and coming to you wasn’t easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"No, I don’t suppose it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you believe me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol hung her head in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally only one night of lovemaking wasn’t enough,\" he said with a soft denunciation. \"It made sense to plan more than one evening together in case I started questioning matters later. I’m pleased that you did credit me with some intelligence. Turning up pregnant after one time together would have seemed much too convenient. But twice… Well, that sounds far more likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol was speechless. Once more Steve had tried and found her guilty, choosing to believe the worst possible scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fool that I am, I should have known something was up by how docile and loving you were. So willing to forget the past, forgive and go on with the future. Then there was all that talk about us starting a family. That sucked me right in, didn’t it? You know, you’ve always known how much I want children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There’s nothing I can say, is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he admitted bleakly. \"I wonder what you would have told me next summer when you gave birth – although months premature, astonishingly the baby would weigh six or seven pounds and obviously be full term. Don t you think I would have questioned you then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her mouth shut, refusing to be drawn into this kind of degrading verbal battle. From experience she knew nothing she could say would vindicate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don’t want to claim this child, Steve, that’s fine, the loss is yours. My original intent was to raise her alone anyway. I’d thought… I’d hoped we could build a new life together, but it’s obvious I was wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead wrong. I won’t let you make a fool of me a second time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strained moment passed before Carol spoke, and when she did her voice was incredibly weak. \"I think it would be best if you left now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe answered her with an abrupt nod, turned away and went to her bedroom to retrieve his shirt and shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol didn’t follow him. She sat, feeling numb and growing more ill with each minute. The nausea swelled up inside her until she knew she was going to empty her stomach. Standing, she rushed into the bathroom and leaned over the toilet in a ritual that had become all too familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she’d finished, she discovered Steve waiting in the doorway, watching her. She didn’t know how long he’d been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, not looking at him, wanting him to leave so that she could curl into a tight ball and lick her wounds. No one could hurt her the way Steve did. No other man possessed the power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t seem to believe she was going to be fine, and slowly he came into the bathroom. He wet a washcloth and handed it to her, waiting while she wiped her face. Then, gently, he led her back into the bedroom and to the bed. Carol discovered that lying down did seem to ease the dizzy, sick feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve took his own sweet time buttoning his shirt, apparently stalling so that he could stick by her in case she was sick a second time, although she knew he would never have admitted he cared. If she’d had the energy, Carol would have suggested he go, because for every minute he lingered it was more difficult for her to bear seeing him. She didn’t want him to care about her – how could he when he believed the things he did? And yet, every now and again she would find him watching her guardedly, his eyes filled with worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you see the doctor next?\" He walked around the foot of the bed and resumed an alleged search for his socks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-blues-navy-2/page-15.html","bookId":1957,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:24 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:24 AM"}
