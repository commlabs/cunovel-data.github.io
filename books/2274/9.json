And you got lucky,” Jimmy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, I’ve got to get to work,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No sweat. I’ll get him situated. And stop looking so guilty. You take him home lots of weekends. Meanwhile, I’m here, and Liz Freeze, his favorite nurse, is on today, too. He’ll be fine. Now out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wanted to let you know, he’s…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s what?” Jimmy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s hallucinating. A lot. About ghosts. They’re in the walls, in the sky…. He even talks to them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing I haven’t seen before. It’ll be okay, I promise,” he said, giving her a reassuring pat on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Jimmy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a grateful smile, she hurried into Timothy’s room and gave him a kiss on the cheek. “I’m off to work now, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded gravely. “Don’t worry. The ghosts are busy dancing in the sky. Things are going to be all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course they are,” she said, then gave him another kiss and hurried out. Glancing at her watch, she realized she was going to be a bit rushed getting into costume, but she would manage. Things will be all right, she told herself. She had the routine down pat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried back down to her car, but before she unlocked it, she paused and looked around, certain that someone was watching her again, but she couldn’t see anybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe checked the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around one last time, then gave herself a mental shake and told herself to stop being ridiculous. It was a bright, sunny day. If anyone was watching her, it was Hoskins, no doubt ruing the fact that she had made the payment, so he couldn’t rent Timothy’s room to someone else—probably at a higher rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sensation of being watched followed her as she wove through traffic and all the way into the casino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost as if someone were sitting right next to her in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See? Two cameras, but notice the range,” Jerry Cheever told Dillon. “There’s Tanner Green, though it’s difficult to see him because there were a dozen other cars in the entryway at the same time. It looks as if he got out of a white limo. Can’t see the plate, though, and there must be a hundred of those things in town,” he said in frustration. “And Green looks like half the other drunks coming out of the woodwork at that time of night. He staggers there—” Cheever pointed at the screen “—but the guy ahead of him just shoves him away. See his look? Probably just thought it was a drunk falling on him. Then watch Green moving through the crowd. Everyone is talking to someone, no one is paying him the least bit of attention. Not even the doorman. He’s just holding the door open and watching that brunette with the huge tits, completely oblivious to everything else, even the guy with the knife in his back. Okay, right here he’s picked up on a new camera….” Cheever’s voice trailed off as he flicked the remote control, shifting to a scene in the casino. “He passed six cameras on his way to the craps table, but all you can see on any of them is him stumbling through the crowd—until he bumps into Miss Sparhawk and they both land on the craps table. And there you are, helping her back up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheever was discouraged; his frustration that so many security tapes could yield so few clues was evident in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like to run through them all again, if it’s all right,” Dillon told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be my guest. I’ve been staring at them for the last three hours. I had a video tech in here trying to home in on Green, but it didn’t help. Someone’s head, an arm, whatever, is blocking part of the view every step he took.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheever tossed the remote to Dillon, who studied it for a moment, then hit a button to start the tape over. “It’s almost as if someone knew that outer drive was just out of the cameras’ useful range,” he mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like,” Cheever agreed. “So what do you think it means?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it means our killer has to be someone involved with the casino, or who knows someone who is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God only knows how many people that could be,” Cheever muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon turned in his chair and looked at Cheever, who was perched at the edge of his desk. “What’s happening with the knife?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The lab has it. But preliminary reports aren’t giving us a thing. It’s a short-bladed work knife, sold—literally—in the thousands here in town. It’s a popular blade for breaking the plastic bands on stacks of money. Every casino in Vegas has a few of them. And of course there’s not a hint of a fingerprint on the hilt. The killer probably wore gloves. Green was stabbed with considerable force, and the blade was just long enough to pierce the heart, which caused Green to bleed out. Because it was a short blade, he made it through to the craps table before he died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Strange,” Dillon said, rewinding the tape. “Any possibility I could get a vid tech in here to look at this with me?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry Cheever stared at him, his eyes narrowing, as if his first instinct was to defensively tell him to go right to hell. But then he shrugged. “Sure. If you can find something I didn’t, that will be great. I’ll go grab someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute he left the office, Dillon was out of his seat, looking at the files on Cheever’s desk. Tanner Green’s was right on top. He leafed through it quickly, but Cheever had nothing more than he had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later a young woman from the video department came in and introduced herself as Sarah Clay. She had a controller with her that made the remote look like a kiddie toy. Dillon started with the first tape, and they went through it frame by frame, but Cheever had been telling the truth. It wasn’t that the security equipment wasn’t high quality, because it was the best. But the car from which Tanner Green had been expelled was just far enough out of range, of both the cameras and the neon lights, that making out details was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA white limo. That much was obvious, and also useless. As Cheever had said, Vegas was thick with the things, especially white ones. Every casino owned limos, the casino bosses owned limos, the rental companies owned limos, even half the high rollers in town had their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way to tell the make or model, but even once the tapes were enhanced, there didn’t seem to be any markings on it, nothing to indicate where it might have come from, which didn’t help him now but might mean something when they moved on to the process of elimination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went through the other tapes in order, with Dillon asking the tech to freeze certain frames and enhance them, but once again, Jerry Cheever had been dead-on. The crowd in the casino that night had worked heavily against them. The best video tech in the world couldn’t remove a body blocking a body, and even though the different angles caught by the different cameras usually helped with that kind of problem, this time they were shit out of luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we through?” Sarah asked him politely, glancing at her watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew she probably had a half-dozen other cases she was supposed to be working on, so he smiled. “Just about, and thank you. The last tape…could I see it one more time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” she said, but her voice was faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let the tape run until he got to Green staggering up to the craps table, then had her home in on Tanner Green falling forward, pinning Jessy Sparhawk beneath him. Even caught in a moment of pure surprise and horror, she was striking. He had to wonder about that last name. She was a redhead, with huge blue eyes, and he found himself fascinated with her all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Wolf?” Sarah asked politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave himself a mental shake. “Zoom in on Green’s face for me, will you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed a button, and in seconds Tanner Green’s bulging eyes filled the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, the man was dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his expression was surprised, as if he couldn’t believe it. Believe he was dying? Or how he was dying? Dillon wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen’s lips moved slightly. Dillon replayed the moment and leaned in, trying to discern what the man had been saying. Nothing, maybe. Or maybe he had been begging for help. Maybe he had found God at the moment of death and was praying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon had Sarah widen the view and surveyed the immediate area. The air had been filled with a cloud of smoke, despite the casino’s expensive air filters. Sometimes it seemed as if even people who didn’t smoke decided they needed to in Vegas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared intently at the screen for a minute longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he sat back. “Thanks very much, Sarah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe might have been aggravated at the time she’d been asked to give him, but she smiled. She probably didn’t often get thanked for what was, after all, just her job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Anytime,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean it.” She reached into her shirt pocket and produced a card. Her name and rank were on it, along with a phone number and an e-mail address. “I’ve heard about you, about what you do, what you…see. They say you’re the real deal. I meant what I said. Whatever you need—whatever—you can call me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her card, nodding gravely. “Now that, I really appreciate.” He left her feeling very grateful indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had pretty much just told him that she would work for him on the q.t. That was priceless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now he had to find Jessy Sparhawk. She was the only one who might know what Tanner Green had said right before he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been a recent period in Vegas’s history when—the tourist board had decided to turn Sin City into a family-friendly resort. The plan hadn’t worked, and the city had soon reverted to its old image, but the aftereffects lingered, and some parents still brought their children along when they came to gamble. As a result, a lot of the casinos provided diversions aimed toward the kiddie set, because the problem with Vegas was that parents could be distracted—maybe only momentarily, but still with frightening repercussions—by bright, blinking lights and a sudden insistence that the next dollar shoved into a beckoning slot machine would be the one that hit the jackpot. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nightwalker-harrison-investigation-8/page-9.html","bookId":2274,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:25 PM"}
