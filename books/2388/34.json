You’ll leave either tomorrow or the next day. We’re trying to get you all rooms here, so no one go anywhere. Otherwise you’ll be stranded in Bermuda until your parents can come and get you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As if that’s a bad thing?” Spencer murmured, rolling her eyes. She stood with her friends in a back hallway near a couple of computer terminals and vending machines, watching the chaos from afar. None of them had quite recovered from their time in the cold water—they all still had towels slung over their shoulders and goose bumps on their arms. Their hair had partially dried, but Aria had seaweed twisted in her bangs. Emily cupped a mug of hot chocolate in her hands, and Hanna was still shivering. But maybe that was because she’d just announced that Naomi wasn’t A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t know what I did to Madison,” Hanna went on after Jeremy finished his announcement. “And, I mean, she organized a rescue team for us. It’s pretty obvious the real A sent us down the wrong path again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer nodded, not really surprised. As soon as Naomi had arrived with a rescue team in tow, she’d begun to doubt their suspicions. But it was incredible how expertly A had made it look like Naomi was the one after them. Sending them notes when Naomi was around, for one. Organizing Hanna and Naomi to room together, for another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut her eyes. “But A was on the boat. And A did deflate our life raft—right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria nodded. “It’s too much of a coincidence. A definitely did it. So that leaves Graham. Maybe he’s the one and only A.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I don’t understand how Graham could have followed us to the cove without us seeing him,” Emily said, looking puzzled. “We were on open water. And he must have acted quickly—we weren’t in that cove for very long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe he overheard us talking about going to the cove and headed out there first,” Hanna suggested. “Or he could have already been there when we arrived, hiding in one of the caves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria squinted. “I don’t know if he could have gotten out there that fast after the explosion. But I guess anything is possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer twisted her silver ring around her finger. “Graham probably spied on all of our conversations in the common room. And just because Naomi wasn’t around, we thought we were safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has anyone seen Graham?” Hanna whispered. “He could be listening right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked up. Spencer scanned the crowd in the lobby. Jennifer Feldman was tapping on her iPad by the check-in desk. Lucas Beattie was roving around the lobby, taking pictures for yearbook. She didn’t see Graham anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder what his next move is,” she said uneasily. “Do you think he’s going to tell as soon as we get to back to the States?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria squared her shoulders. “I think we should confess instead of letting Graham turn us in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfess. Spencer took a deep breath. Hanna and Emily shifted uncomfortably. It was obvious they were all contemplating the promise they’d made in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily picked at her cuticles. “I’m so afraid of what’s going to happen when we tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to end this,” Aria said. “Out there in the water, I had this epiphany. I’d rather clear my conscience than live a lie. Even if that means suffering for it, I don’t think I can live another day with this hanging over me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer nodded. “I feel that way, too. But you’re underestimating it when you say suffer, Aria. We could spend years in court. We could go to jail for the rest of our lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A could torment us for the rest of our lives, too,” Aria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we’ll never get to see our families again,” Hanna said. “Everyone we love will hate us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears filled Aria’s eyes. “I know. But like I said, I can confess for everyone, and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Spencer, Emily, and Hanna all said at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer touched Aria’s hand and swallowed hard. “You’re right. We have to end this, and confessing is the only way. I’m in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too,” Hanna said after a moment. Emily nodded as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent for a while, listening to the din of the kids in the lobby. Jeremy once more announced that they were booking everyone on flights back to Philadelphia that would leave in the next few days. Spencer’s stomach sank just thinking about it. Once they got home, their lives would be over. If only she could stay in Bermuda forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a figure appeared in the doorway. Reefer stood with his hands in his pockets. “Can we talk?” he asked, eyeing Spencer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer glanced at her friends, who shrugged and nodded. She walked toward Reefer tentatively, her heart suddenly thrumming. As soon as he got close, he grabbed her and pulled her into a hug. “I just found out what happened,” he said into her ear. “Are you okay? What were you doing taking a lifeboat back to those coves?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s body remained stiff and cautious, and she glanced around the room to see who might be watching. Even though A wasn’t Naomi, A had still sent texts that she should stay away from Reefer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then she remembered that they were going to confess soon. Life was too short to stay away from him. “It’s a long story,” she admitted. “But I’m fine. Naomi rescued me, actually. So I guess she’s not such a psycho after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer shook his head rapidly. “No, Spencer, she is. She told me everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer frowned. “Told you what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was the one gaslighting you.” His voice dropped to a whisper. “She poured baby oil on the floor, rigged the bed so it would break, all of it. Everything you thought was happening was true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer blinked hard. “She actually admitted that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer nodded. “I just talked to her. First she told me about the rescue, but then she admitted what she’d been up to. She seemed to feel really bad about it. I feel bad about it, too. I didn’t believe you. Can you ever forgive me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer stared at him crazily. “I should be the one begging for forgiveness. I’m the one who’s been acting crazy. And I’m the one who broke up with you. I never should have done that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer squeezed her tight. “Of course I forgive you,” he murmured. “It’s been a weird trip, hasn’t it? Naomi tormenting you, that fugitive girl jumping overboard, and did you hear about the explosion? It might have been intentional.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer swallowed hard. “I didn’t hear that.” She hoped it sounded like the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer nodded. “It started in the boiler room. They think a passenger did it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer looked down, knowing eye contact with Reefer would give everything away. “Do they know who did it?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer shrugged. “No clue. They’re trying to bring up security cameras from the boiler room, but two of them were knocked out. I heard that they made out two people on the third camera, though—they’re just trying to figure out who they were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer glanced at Aria, who was still talking to Hanna and Emily. She was sure the two figures on the security tape were Aria … and Graham. She shut her eyes for a moment, considering Graham as A. They didn’t even know him. It all seemed so … impersonal. What kind of lunatic stalks and torments his girlfriend’s killers instead of simply turning them in to the police?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lunatic called A, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to Reefer, wanting to think about something else. “I missed you so much,” she admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I missed you, too,” Reefer said, and leaned forward to kiss her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer tilted her head back, savoring the sensation. But suddenly, as a group of tourists wearing American flag T-shirts waded through the kids, reality snapped into focus once more. They were going to call the FBI tomorrow. How would it go down? First a call, then a meeting with the investigator, then a tearful confession? She pictured her parents being summoned to jail, the press clamoring at the door with questions, their names in the news again, everyone staring at them. What would Reefer think when he found out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a small, quiet moan and hugged Reefer even tighter. When she was a little girl, she and Melissa used to play a game they’d made up called “Prince Charming,” in which they listed all of the characteristics they wanted in a future boyfriend. At first, Spencer always copied what Melissa said—tall, dark, handsome, drives a nice car, and has a good job—until she realized they were, more or less, describing their dad. But even when she imagined a unique future prince, things like smells like hemp or can quote obscure Grateful Dead songs were never on her list. But as she gazed at Reefer’s kind, gentle face, the same wistful, someday-my-prince-will-come feelings she used to have when playing the game welled up inside of her. Even though Reefer wasn’t the sort of guy she had anticipated ending up with, he was exactly what she wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut would he want her, after he found out what she’d done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE BOYFRIEND PROBLEM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the Eco Cruise company had chartered flights for the kids to take back to Philadelphia, there was still the matter of everyone collecting their stuff from their rooms on the ship. The boat pulled into the Hamilton harbor at 7 A.M. on Monday, and everyone was allowed one hour to pack up. Aria and Noel climbed up the ramp, then glanced at the auditorium, which was still decorated for the talent show. It was kind of sad to see the festive balloons, streamers, and search lights. Even the food was still set up, though flies were buzzing around it hungrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel pointed at the first-prize Vespa, which was parked near the stage. “I wonder who’s going to get that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one, I guess,” Aria murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head somberly. “Yesterday sucked.” He took Aria’s hand. “I just can’t believe you thought it was a good idea to go and get some stupid family heirloom that Spencer lost on a dive. You could have died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria lowered her eyes. “I didn’t think it was a big deal. We didn’t plan on the raft deflating. It was a freak thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just should have thought it through.” Noel cupped the sides of Aria’s face in his hands. “When Naomi told me that you guys sailed off into the sunset and hadn’t come back yet, my heart just about stopped. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be so dramatic,” Aria murmured, but tears sprung to her eyes. Those horrible moments in the water were so fresh and raw in her mind. She still couldn’t wrap her mind around the fact that Naomi wasn’t A, either—and that A might be Graham and Graham alone. He’d watched all of them, slipping in and out of the shadows so effortlessly. He’d been the one to kill Gayle and almost kill them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they walked further onto the ship, the smell of smoke grew stronger. Noel wrinkled his nose. “Nasty.” As they passed the casino, Noel glanced at the table up front, which still bore a sign for the Eco Scavenger Hunt. “Did you talk to Graham after we evacuated?” he said, making a face. “I’m surprised he didn’t want to rescue you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burned-pretty-little-liars-12/page-34.html","bookId":2388,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM"}
