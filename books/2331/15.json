{"id":64247,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003eThat night Elaine and I walked over to Armstrong\u0027s for dinner. She had a big salad. I had a bowl of chili and stirred a large side order of minced Scotch bonnet peppers into it. It must have been hot enough to blister paint, but you couldn\u0027t have proved it by me. I was barely aware of what I was eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe talked some about her day at her shop, and about what TJ had said when he dropped by to jive with her. I talked about my day. And then we both fell silent. Classical music played over the sound system, barely audible through the buzz of conversations around us. Our waiter came around to find out if we wanted more Perrier. I said we didn\u0027t, but he could bring me a cup of black coffee when he had a moment. Elaine said she\u0027d have herb tea. \"Any kind,\" she said. \"Surprise me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought her Red Zinger. \"What a surprise,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried my coffee, and something must have shown in my face, because Elaine\u0027s eyebrows went up a notch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For an instant there,\" I said, \"I could taste booze in the coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s not really there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Good coffee, but only coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What they call a sense-memory, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could say I came by it honestly. Years ago, before Jimmy lost his lease and relocated a long block to the west, Armstrong\u0027s had been situated on Ninth Avenue around the corner from my hotel, and it had functioned for me almost as an extension of my personal living space. I socialized there, I isolated there, I met clients there. I put in long hours of maintenance drinking there, and sometimes I did more than maintain and got good and drunk at the bar or at my table in the back. My usual drink was bourbon, and when I didn\u0027t drink it neat, the way God made it, I would stir it into a mug of coffee. Each flavor, it seemed to me then, complemented and enhanced the other, even as the caffeine and alcohol balanced one another, the one keeping you awake while the other softened the edges of consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have known people who, when quitting smoking, have had to give up coffee temporarily because they so strongly associate the two. I had problems of my own getting sober, but coffee was not one of them, and I have been able to go on drinking it with pleasure, and apparently with impunity, at an age when most of my contemporaries have found it advisable to switch to decaf. I like the stuff, especially when it\u0027s good, the way Elaine makes it at home (although she hardly ever has a cup herself) or the way they brew it in the Seattle-style coffee bars that have sprouted up all over town. The coffee\u0027s always been good at Armstrong\u0027s, rich and full-bodied and aromatic, and I took a sip now, savoring it, and wondered why I\u0027d tasted bourbon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was nothing you could have done,\" Elaine said. \"Was there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told him he ought to leave the country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could have pushed a little harder,\" I said, \"but I don\u0027t think he would have done anything differently, and I can\u0027t blame him for that. He had a life to live. He took all the precautions a man could be expected to take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reliable did a good job for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even in hindsight,\" I said, \"I can\u0027t point to a thing they did wrong. I suppose they could have posted men around the clock in his apartment, whether or not there was anybody in it, but even after the fact I can\u0027t argue that that\u0027s what they should have done. And as far as my own part in all this is concerned, no, I can\u0027t see anything I left undone that might have made a difference. It would have been nice if I\u0027d had some brilliant insight that told me who Will was, but that didn\u0027t happen, and that gives me something in common with eight million other New Yorkers, including however many cops they\u0027ve got assigned to the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But something\u0027s bothering you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will\u0027s out there,\" I said. \"Doing what he does, and getting away with it. I guess that bothers me, especially now that he\u0027s struck down a man I knew. A friend, I was going to say, and that would have been inaccurate, but I had the sense the last time I spoke with him that Adrian Whitfield might have become a friend. If he\u0027d lived long enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank the rest of my coffee, caught the waiter\u0027s eye and pointed to my empty cup. While he filled it I thought about the question she\u0027d asked. I said, \"The funeral\u0027s private, just for the family. There\u0027d be a crowd otherwise, with all the headlines he\u0027s getting. I understand there\u0027ll be a public memorial service sometime next month, and I\u0027ll probably go to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe I\u0027ll light a candle,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It couldn\u0027t hoit,\" she said, giving the phrase an exaggerated Brooklyn pronunciation. It was the punch line to an old joke, and I guess I smiled, and she smiled back across the table at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the money bother you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t he write you a check?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For two thousand dollars,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t you get a referral fee from Reliable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead clients don\u0027t pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A basic principle of the personal-security industry,\" I said. \"Someone used it for the title of a book on the subject. Wally took a small retainer, but it won\u0027t begin to cover what he has to pay in hourly rates to the men he\u0027s had guarding Whitfield. He\u0027s legally entitled to bill the estate, but he already told me he\u0027s going to eat it. Since he\u0027ll wind up with a net loss, I won\u0027t be picking up a referral fee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re just as glad, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t know. If he\u0027d made money on the deal I\u0027d have been comfortable taking a share of it. And if the two grand Whitfield paid me starts bothering me I can always give it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or try to earn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By chasing Will,\" I said, \"or by hunting for the man who shot Byron Leopold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On Horatio Street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Whitfield suggested there might be a link, that maybe Will killed Byron at random, more or less for practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it\u0027s possible. It\u0027s also possible Byron was gunned down by an extraterrestrial, and every bit as likely. It was his way of telling me to keep his money and investigate whatever the hell I wanted to investigate. It made as much sense for me to be working one case as the other. Either way I wasn\u0027t going to accomplish anything, was I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it? That\u0027s what\u0027s making you taste alcohol that isn\u0027t there. That you can\u0027t accomplish anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. I sipped some coffee, put the cup in the saucer. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, I took her hand as we waited for the light to change. I glanced at the building diagonally across the street, and my eyes automatically sought out a window on the twenty-ninth floor. Noticing my glance, or perhaps just reading my mind, Elaine said, \"You know what that shooting in the Village reminds me of? Glenn Holtzmann.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d lived in that twenty-ninth-floor apartment. His widow, Lisa, had gone on living there after his death. She hired me, and after I was through working for her I continued to return occasionally to her apartment, and to her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Elaine and I were married we went to Europe for a honeymoon. We were in Paris, lying together in our hotel room, when she told me that nothing had to change. We could go on being ourselves and living our lives. The rings on our fingers didn\u0027t change anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said this in a way that made the unspoken subtext unmistakable. I know there\u0027s someone else, she\u0027d been saying, and I don\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glenn Holtzmann,\" I said. \"Killed by accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless Freud\u0027s right and there\u0027s no such thing as an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought about Holtzmann when I was poking around the edges of Byron\u0027s life. The idea of someone killed by mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s bad enough being killed for a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. Somebody heard the shooter call Byron by name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he knew who he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the witness got it right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked the rest of the way home, not saying much. Upstairs in our apartment I put a hand on her shoulder and turned her toward me, and we were in each other\u0027s arms. We kissed, and I put a hand on her hindquarters and drew her against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing has to change, she\u0027d told me in Paris, but of course things change over time. We have been many things to each other over many years, Elaine and I. When we met I was a married cop and she was a sweet young call girl. We were together, and then we were apart for years, until the past drew us together again. After a while she quit hooking. After a while we found an apartment together. After a while we got married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassion, after all those years, was different from what it had been when I\u0027d made those first visits to her Turtle Bay apartment. Then our desire for each other had been fierce and urgent and undeniable. Now it had been tempered by time and custom. The love, present from the beginning, had grown infinitely broader and deeper with time; the delight we had always taken in each other\u0027s company pany was keener than ever. And our passion, if it had grown less furious, was richer as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kissed again, and her breath caught in her throat. We moved to the bedroom, shed our clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" I said. Or maybe she said it. After a while you lose track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" she said, \"if we keep on like this, I can see where we might acquire a certain degree of proficiency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re my bear and I love you. And you\u0027re about to drop off to sleep, aren\u0027t you? Unless I keep you awake by glowing in the dark. I almost could, the way I feel. Why does sex wake women up and put men to sleep? Is it just bad planning on God\u0027s part or does it somehow contribute to the survival of the species?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was turning the question over and over in my mind, trying to form an answer, when I felt her breath on my cheek and her lips brushing mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep tight,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big news over the weekend had to do with the results of the autopsy performed on Adrian Whitfield. The cause of death was no surprise. It had been confirmed as having resulted from the ingestion of a dose of potassium cyanide which, according to the Post, would have been enough to kill a dozen lawyers. (Monday night Leno read that item in his opening monologue, rolled his eyes heavenward, and got a laugh without saying a word.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the autopsy also established was that Will had done little more than anticipate Nature. At the time of his death, Adrian Whitfield had already been stricken with a malignant tumor that had metastasized from its initial site on one of the adrenal glands and invaded the lymph system. Will had cheated him, at most, out of a year of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder if he knew,\" I said to Elaine. \"It would have been largely asymptomatic, according to the story in the Times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had he been to the doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His doctor\u0027s out of town. Nobody can get hold of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctors,\" she said with feeling. \"He never said anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said something. What was it?\" I closed my eyes for a moment. \"The last time I talked with him, right before he drank the poison, he said something about wishing we\u0027d had more time. To get to know each other, was what he meant. Or maybe he meant he wished he\u0027d had more time in general.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-15.html","bookId":2331,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:02 AM"}
