Thank the Light for these rings, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fight with skill\", Demandred said, \"for one of this Age. But you still wield your sword, little man\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else would I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Become the sword yourself\", Demandred said, as if baffled that Gawyn did not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawyn growled and came in again, battering at Demandred. Gawyn was still faster. Demandred didn’t attack; he was on the defensive, then, although he didn’t retreat. He just stood there, turning aside each blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred closed his eyes. Gawyn smiled, then thrust in Black Lance’s Last Strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred’s sword became a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething struck Gawyn. He gasped, pulling to a stop. He wobbled and fell to his knees, looking down at a hole in his gut. Demandred had thrust straight through the mail, then pulled his sword free in a single fluid motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy can’t . . . why can’t I feel anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you do survive this and see Lews Therin\", Demandred said, \"tell him I am very much looking forward to a match between the two of us, sword against sword. I have improved since we last met\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred whipped his sword around, catching the back of the blade in the crook between his thumb and forefinger. He pulled the sword across, stripping the blood from the steel and splattering it to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid the weapon into his sheath. He shook his head, then released a ball of fire toward a still-firing dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt fell silent. Demandred strode away along the edge of the steep slope facing the river, his Sharan guard forming around him. Gawyn collapsed to the ground, stunned, spurting his life onto the burned grass. He tried to hold in the blood through trembling fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow Gawyn managed to push himself up to his knees. His heart cried out; he needed to return to Egwene. He began to crawl, blood mixing with the earth beneath him as it seeped from his wound. Through eyes clouded with cold perspiration, he spotted several cavalry mounts twenty paces ahead, poking at blackened tufts of grass at their feet and tethered to a picket-line. After minutes of struggle, an impossible interval of time that left him drained, he pulled himself up on to the back of the first horse he could reach and untether. Gawyn hunched over, dazed, grasping its mane in one hand. Summoning his remaining strength, he kicked his heel into the animal’s rib cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lady\", Mandevwin said to Faile, \"I have known those two men for years! They are not without a few spots in their past. No man comes to the Band without a few of those. But, Light provide, they are not Darkfriends!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaile ate her midday rations in silence, listening with as much patience as she could muster to Mandevwin’s protests. She wished Perrin were here so she could have a good argument. She felt as if she would burst from pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were close to Thakan’dar, horribly close. The black sky rumbled with lightning, and they hadn’t seen a living creature—dangerous or not—in days. Nor had they seen Vanin or Harnan again, though Faile set a double guard each night. The minions of the Dark One did not give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe now carried the Horn in a large bag tied to her waist. The others knew it, and moved between pride in their duty and horror at the import of it. At least she shared that with them now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lady\", Mandevwin said, kneeling down. \"Vanin is out there nearby somewhere. He is a very gifted scout, the best in the Band. We will not see him unless he wants us to, but I would swear that he is following us. Where else would he go? Perhaps if I call out to him, invite him in to tell his story, so we can resolve this\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will consider it, Mandevwin\", Faile said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. The one-eyed man was a good commander, but had the imagination of a brick. Uncomplicated men assumed others to have uncomplicated motivations, and he could not imagine someone like Vanin or Harnan helping the Band for so long—under orders, undoubtedly, to avoid suspicion—only to now do something so terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least now she knew that she hadn’t been worried without cause. That look of pure terror in Vanin’s eyes when he’d been caught was confirmation enough, if catching him with the Horn in his hands hadn’t been. She had not expected two Darkfriends, and they had outsmarted her in their thievery. However, they had also underestimated the dangers of the Blight. She hated to think what would have happened if they hadn’t drawn the attention of the bear-thing. Faile would have remained in her tent, anticipating the arrival of thieves who had already disappeared with one of the most powerful artifacts in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky rumbled. Dark Shayol Ghul loomed ahead, rising out of the valley of Thakan’dar in a range of smaller mountains. The air had grown chill, almost wintery. Reaching that peak would be difficult—but one way or another, she was going to bring this Horn to the forces of the Light for the Last Battle. She rested her fingers on the sack at her side, feeling the metal within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, Olver scampered across the lifeless gray rock of the Blasted Lands, wearing his knife at his belt like a sword. Perhaps she should not have brought him. Then again, boys his age in the Borderlands learned to run messages and carry supplies to besieged forts. They wouldn’t go out with a war band or be given a post until they were at least twelve, but their training started much earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaile looked toward Selande and Arrela as they approached. Faile had put Selande in charge of the scouts, now that Vanin had revealed himself. The pale little woman looked less like an Aiel than many of the others in Cha Faile. But the attitude helped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Movement, my Lady\", Selande said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Faile stood. \"What kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some kind of caravan\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the Blasted Lands?\" Faile asked. \"Show me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t just a caravan. There was a village out there. Faile could make it out through the looking glass, though only as a smudge of darkness to indicate buildings. It was settled into the foothills near Thakan’dar. A village. Light!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaile moved the looking glass down to where a caravan crept across the bleak landscape, heading toward a supply station set up a good distance outside the village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They’re doing what we did\", she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What’s that, my Lady?\" Arrela lay on her stomach beside Faile. Mandevwin was on her other side, peering throu \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-227.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
