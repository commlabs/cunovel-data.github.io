The manager was impatient, but trying to be polite, because hey, it was a six-hundred-dol ar purchase. Luis was dressed in a nice workout suit, gold chains. He looked like he could afford good things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not humor the customer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky turned purple. These huge locusts started dropping from the sky, right on the sidewalk. Hundreds of them crawling over the asphalt, like red cigarettes with legs. Luis figured the whole area used to be farmland, and the bugs were wondering where al the crops went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of that story Pastor Riggs used to tel —Pablo remembered the one—how the locusts came as a plague to Egypt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis thought: God must be fucking pissed. But he kept smiling and bul shitting the cashier, because the plan depended on him being so damn charming they wouldn’t kick him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van pul ed up, right by the entrance. His make-believe roommate, C.C., got out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePablo interrupted the story: C.C.? They opened the door for C.C.?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, Luis said. He cleaned up pretty good for a scrawny-ass nigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, C.C. was wearing this flashy Italian suit, like a damn lawyer. He came to the door, looked straight through the glass at Luis, and shook his head like he was irritated. He held up a wal et. Naughty, naughty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager turned the key and let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager started to say, “Normal y I wouldn’t—” when C.C. drew a gun and shot him in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cashier screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager knelt, hands going out to break his fal even though he was already dead. He curled into fetal position at C.C.’s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElroy and the Guide busted inside, both wearing ski masks, carrying shotguns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took the flanks, rounded up a couple of stock boys from the back of the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis told the girl cashier, “We’re going into the office now and open the safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He—” The girl pointed toward the thing that used to be her boss. “He’s the only one who knows how.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guide looked at C.C. “What the fuck you shoot him for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you,” C.C. said, but it was an act. C.C. was getting off on being the bad-ass, and the Guide was happy to let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe make a little mess, the Guide had told them their first day heading north. Every once in a while, we surface and give them a new headline. That’s the price for your freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC.C. loved it. He thought he was goddamn Jesse James. He’d taken to wearing two pistols. He was the one who shot the convenience store clerk in New Braunfels, and a gas station attendant Sunday night in Seguin that the police hadn’t tied to them yet. C.C. was the one who delivered the headlines. He’d also be the one who got them a lethal injection, if they were ever caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey herded the employees to the manager’s office and tied them up. The Guide said to forget about the safe—just get the cash from the registers. They went shopping—grabbed some new clothes, a shitload of ammunition. Elroy picked up a bow-and-arrow set and Luis was like, “What the fuck are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big black man smiled. “Always wanted to be Robin Hood, brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guide said, “Time to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back to the office and gave the employees a spiel—don’t yel for help, don’t try anything funny or we’l hunt down your families and kil them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis knew what they’d remember—the guy in charge was an Anglo in a ski mask, medium build, West Texas accent. The police would figure it was Wil Stirman. They’d figure the five of them were stil together, heading north. Four guys did the heist. The fifth stayed in the car, playing lookout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out, it would’ve been better if there had been a fifth on lookout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they got outside, there was a blaze of headlights. Some guy was shining his brights on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red Chevy. The driver wore some kind of uniform. Luis couldn’t tel through the glare—an off-duty security officer, maybe. The guy was leaning out his window, training a gun on them. He yel ed, “Freeze!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC.C. and the Guide opened fire. Luis and Elroy took off toward the van, locusts crunching under their boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard’s Chevy revved and careened forward, toward the van, and Luis knew he was going to die. At the last minute the Chevy swerved toward the glass storefront, where C.C. was standing, a pistol in each hand, firing away. C.C. didn’t have time to jump before the red Chevy plowed into him, slamming him through the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis ran up. The Chevy’s engine was grinding. It wasn’t going anywhere, steam bil owing out the hood, gas leaking from its bel y. Behind the blood-spattered web of glass that used to be the windshield, the driver was dead. He wasn’t a security guard—he was a cop. Fucker must’ve been on his way home from his shift, spotted the holdup, had to stop and play hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst was C.C. He was sprawled on the cement, half under the Chevy, broken glass and locusts al around him. He was screaming, and his leg was pumping like a busted pipe. The Guide yel ed, “Get pressure on that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis stripped off his shirt and tried to bind the wound. But then he saw what had happened. A plate glass shard had gone clean through C.C.’s calf like a guil otine blade. Nothing was holding the leg together but a few shreds of fabric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis managed to wrap the mess with his shirt, tying off the sleeves like a tourniquet, but C.C.’s eyes were rol ing back in his head. He was shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis looked at Elroy, and they didn’t need to say anything. They were both thinking about stained glass, a broken angel feather stabbed in an old supervisor’s gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guide said, “Get him in the van.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He needs a doctor,” Elroy said. “We can leave him here, cal 911—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” the Guide said. “Nobody leaves the group.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they got C.C. in the van and gunned the accelerator, made it to the highway. They drove north into the dark plains of Oklahoma, listening for sirens that never came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC.C.’s breath smel ed like raw meat. The wound oozed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d just passed the city limits sign when C.C. spat up blood, tried to wipe his chin and shuddered for the last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dug C.C. a shal ow grave in the red earth of a creek bed. They shoveled dirt on his open eyes. A little sneer traced his mouth, like he was going to tel Satan a thing or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guide took it in stride. He kept the same calm expression as when faced with police roadblocks, or WANTED signs in grocery stores, or the hotel night manager who had the fugitives’ faces on the television as they checked in for the night. The Guide was a Freon-blooded son-of-a-bitch, just like his boss, Wil Stirman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird day together, now, and Luis stil didn’t know the Guide’s name. Luis didn’t trust him any more than when they’d first met in the Floresvil e Wal-Mart parking lot, when the Guide had given them al fresh clothes and guns, cel phones with clean numbers—Luis and Pablo exchanging looks, silently promising they would keep in touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirman had said, “Take these folks to Canada. Get ’em set with paperwork and cash. Anything they want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis had never trusted that promise. He tried to believe it would happen, because he had nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d never real y cared about going home to El Paso. And there was no chance he or Elroy could have made it so far on their own. The Guide had saved their asses a dozen times already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis knew the Canada trip was a diversion. It was a false flare to make the police think Stirman was going north. Luis just hoped he and Elroy wouldn’t end up like C.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Least we take some heat off you, cuz,” he told Pablo. “Hope you get back to Angelina. Brother Stirman treating you right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePablo stared out the warehouse windows, over miles of San Antonio railways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelina. Al he wanted was to see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePablo didn’t have the heart to tel Luis what he and Stirman had been doing—how C.C.’s death sounded like a joyride compared to his last two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI own you, amigo, Stirman had told him. You are my new right-hand man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePablo remembered yesterday morning, in this room, holding a video camera for hours as Wil Stirman interrogated the former owner of this warehouse, who used to be Stirman’s right-hand man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m cool,” Pablo told Luis. “Just be careful. I keep thinking, maybe me and Angelina—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guide’s coming, man,” Luis whispered. “I got to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePablo kept his eyes on the rain. He didn’t want to turn and see the work that was waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about the night four and a half years ago in El Paso when he’d lost everything, drinking straight tequila in a bar on Airway Boulevard while a so-cal ed good neighbor stoked his worst fears into anger. He was over there again last night while you were at work, ese . I hate to tell you this, but there ain’t no doubt. If I was you . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePablo remembered very little about loading his shotgun, driving home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed his eyes to get rid of the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirman had promised a chartered plane from Stinson Field. There was a drug runners’ airstrip near Calabras, in the mountains south of Juárez, only a few miles from El Paso. Pablo would be able to contact his wife from there. Al he had to do was a few more days of service for Stirman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePablo mastered his nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned. Behind him, waiting patiently in their metal chairs, were two corpses—a pair of fucking nobodies he had to dispose of before Stirman got back. Stirman hadn’t even hated these guys. They just happened to have some information he wanted. They’d recently seen some people Stirman was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo after their heartfelt conversation, Stirman had let them die pretty easy, which was why you could stil sort of recognize Lalu and Kiko Ortiz’s faces through the burn marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWil Stirman focused on the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred Barrow’s widow was in the drop-off line for the school summer camp. There were nine cars in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy had his arm out the passenger’s window. He was drumming his fingers against the Audi’s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a mop of black hair, a coffee complexion that was nothing like his mother’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people Wil had questioned didn’t know much about the kid. He was adopted, they thought. From somewhere overseas. Not Fred Barrow’s blood, anyway. They looked at Stirman through their pain, as if wondering why the hel he cared. What was one more kid to a monster like him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWil pul ed out of line and parked on the side of the traffic circle. He didn’t have much time to think. He had misjudged the kind of place Erainya Manos would be going to. He had tailed her right into this wooded campus for the ultra-rich, the parking lot ful of Hummers and Cadil ac Escalades. His stolen Honda Civic stuck out like a skinhead in a Juneteenth parade. Soon, the uniformed security guard directing traffic would wonder what Wil was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt pissed him off that a place like this could make him feel so nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaximum security prison was no problem. But a bunch of moms dropping their kids off at soccer camp— that made Wil ’s palms sweat. It pissed him off that Barrow’s widow sent her son to this school. No way could she afford it. It rubbed Wil ’s failure in his face, flaunted what Fred Barrow had done to him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/southtown-tres-navarre-5/page-8.html","bookId":2420,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:32:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:32:19 PM"}
