A Liosan, settling on one knee, one shoulder sliced open, down through the joint, the arm hanging. Seeing her, he struggled to rise. He was old, his face lined, and the look in his eyes was bleak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePithy’s sword swing was awkward, but all of her strength was behind it. She clipped the edge of his jaw before the blade cut deep into his neck. Blood spurted, gushed all over her. Shocked by the hot deluge, she stepped back—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that one step saved her life. A spear thrust caught her head, bit into her helm. She felt the blade edge cut into her scalp, grind along the bone of her skull – and then she was pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burly man dragged her close. ‘Never mind that – y’still got your head, don’t you? Seen my sword?’ he asked. ‘I dropped the fucker – you’ll know it ’cause it’s still in my hand – never mind—’ He bent down and came up with a wood-cutter’s axe. ‘Errant’s horse-humped earhole, what the fuck is this? Never mind – to the back line with you, Captain Pithy. I started this and I mean to finish it up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNithe? Never Mind Nithe? Is that what they call you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ This is ours! ’ The chant went on and on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands took hold of her. She was being pulled out. Her first engagement against the Liosan. Her first taste – of everything. The slaughter. The hurt. The anger. The falling light. All of it. All of it. Oh, gods, all of it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly she stumbled clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinced at the blinding glare of the strand, as tendrils of agonizing light writhed overhead. Down, on to her knees. Down, on to her side. Sword and helmet away. Sounds, dimming, fading …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone drove a pair of knees against her left hip. Blinking, she looked up at Skwish, saw the knife in the witch’s gore-drenched left hand. ‘Don’t even think it,’ Pithy said in a growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last end of the rout, a scattering of Liosan, converging as they dragged wounded comrades back through the breach, vanishing into blinding light. Yedan Derryg’s sword was unaccountably heavy in his hand, so he let the tip crunch down into the soaked strand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Prince!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Address that front line, Sergeant – get our wounded and dead out of there.’ He glared at the breach. The blackened, weeping mar in Lightfall. Too damaged to do anything as miraculous as heal before his eyes, but the first probe of the enemy had been denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Liosan had taken as many of their dead and dying with them as they could, but there were still scores and scores, bodies heaped up at the base of the first berm. ‘Get a crew to start piling them up, against the breach. Make a wall, but tell them to be careful – make sure the fallen are actually dead or near enough as to make no difference.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his gaze as a shadow crossed the Lightfall, just above the wound. Bared his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new voice spoke beside him. ‘That was closer than I liked, Prince.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned. ‘Bedac. Was it you behind that last push?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Far right flank,’ the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nithe? Could’ve sworn that was a woman’s shout.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nithe got his hand chopped off. Didn’t bleed out, thankfully. Captain Pithy took that flank command, sire. Nithe made it back in time to drive a wood-axe into the skull of one of the last Liosan on that side. Hard enough to break the handle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan frowned. ‘What’s a wood-axe doing in our ranks? My orders on weapon choices were clear enough. That reminds me – Sergeant! Collect up the better Liosan weapons, will you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Got plans with your trophy, Prince?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What trophy?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded down at his sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at it. A Liosan head was impaled on the blade, from the top of the skull down and out through the neck, which had already been half severed. He grunted. ‘No wonder it felt heavy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis stood at the forest verge. Watching them dragging bodies clear, watching others tossing limbs and rolling corpses into the pit. None of it seemed real. The triumphant and suddenly exhausted Letherii ranks along the berm were settling to catch their breaths, to check on weapons and armour, to take the skins of water from the youths now threading through the ranks. They think they’ve won .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout Yedan and his Watch, that front line would have quickly crumpled. Instead, the survivors now felt bold, filled to bursting. In this one clash, something had been tempered. She knew what she was seeing. A fighting force cannot be simply assembled. It needed that brutal forge and it needed all its fires quenched in the blood of battle. Her brother was making something here. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-175.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
