The Changed wasn’t quite dead but still gulping, trying to pull in air through the blood pulsing from his mouth and around the knife jammed halfway in his throat. His feet scraped snow in a slow shamble. Then the boy managed a faint, gurgling caw, and Chris couldn’t stand it any longer. Kneeling, he wrapped his hands around the knife, felt it move against his palms as the boy’s throat convulsed—and rammed the blade home. He felt the tip scrape bone, the slight hesitation as it parted tough tendon and muscle along the boy’s spine. Chris let his weight fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy flopped as the steel found his spinal cord. A bright crimson gusher boiled from his mouth. His hands were fluttery starfish that twitched and jumped before folding, going limp, and, finally, dying. Chris waited a few more seconds to make sure, then tugged out his knife. There was blood everywhere: on the snow, the boy, his own hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s right. I don’t get it,” Nathan said. “There are no tracks out here. He had to be in the school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich meant that the boy had bypassed them to get to Lena, and that made no sense. When Lena screamed, Chris had been on the second floor, slipping from room to room. There had been many bodies, people-popsicles, really: all of them frozen solid and only some with portions—an arm here, a foot there—gnawed to bare bone. The halls were filmed with a fine cover of ice and snow, but he’d seen no tracks except his own. So there had been plenty of food and no need for the boy to show himself at all. From his tracks, the Changed had vaulted out of the school’s library, which was the way both he and Nathan had entered. Still on the ground floor and at the back of the school, Nathan had made it out first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Nathan was right there. Why not go after him, or me? We were inside and much closer. Why leave? Why go outside for Lena? Hell, why go after her in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at Lena, still cringing, a hand bunched to her scratched throat. Although he’d had plenty of time, the boy hadn’t bitten her anywhere. It’s like he wanted to get at her. He eyed the tangle of green scarf and that torn parka. Like maybe he wanted to . . . A chill shivered over his skin. The idea that the boy might have had rape on his mind disturbed him almost more than if the Changed had only wanted to tear out Lena’s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think there are others?” Lena asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question. He rifled a glance at the horses, but they’d quieted. Not that horses were all that reliable an indicator: dogs were much more sensitive to the Changed. “I don’t think so, but we probably should get out of here. Even if he was by himself, there are a lot of bodies in there. Might be others who decide to drop by for a meal, you know? Our horses were pretty loud and so were we.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Move? Again?” Lena’s skin was milky, the circles under her eyes as dark as charcoal. She was sick, eating barely enough to keep a tick alive, but she wouldn’t talk about it. He was starting to have a nasty suspicion why. The question was, what could—would—he do about it? “Chris,” she said, “we haven’t gotten any rest in—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In days. I know.” Trotting over to the roan, he unhooked his pack and then came back to kneel by Nathan. Through the rip, he could see the blood welling through a jagged rip but no pumpers. He dug out a medical kit. “But we can’t stay here, Lena. Not now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re in the middle of nowhere. The school’s all by itself. There are no other tracks, so he’s probably the only one. Chris, we have to rest sometime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bit back an impatient reply. Getting angry wouldn’t help. Instead, he turned his attention to Nathan, easing the old man’s injured arm from its sleeve and then setting about sponging off blood. He had no answers for Lena, and she was right. They were all tired. Although they’d finally decided to start looping back north and west, they’d been on the road for eleven days now. At their current rate, Oren was still a good ten days in the future if they were lucky, and two weeks if they weren’t. They had to get some rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has it ever been so bad?” Lena persisted. “With the Changed coming after you? This is the fourth kid in two days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know much about this area,” he said, unrolling Kerlix around Nathan’s wound. “Any time I’ve gone east of Rule, it’s always been with a big group where we had lots of guys and guns and dogs. Nathan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man only shook his head. “All those prints and bone mounds we’ve found are old. We haven’t run across a single homestead or group of survivors, young or old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe they ran away,” Lena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or they’re all dead,” Nathan said. “My point is this: there’s no fresh meat, anywhere. There shouldn’t be Changed around here at all, right? So what’s the story with that little stash of bodies we found in the school?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh boy. He’d never considered that possibility. “You’re talking a storehouse, like a . . . a meat locker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m talking exactly that.” Nathan pulled in a sudden hiss of pain, exposing yellowing teeth and gums that were the color of putty. “I don’t think that’s a very good sign, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean, there’ll be more?” Lena’s voice was tremulous. “Like, they might be coming now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are no fresh prints,” Chris said. This private school was secluded and lay at the end of a quarter-mile driveway, and theirs were the only tracks. From the lie of the land, this whole area looked like it had once been pasture. Other than a football field and bleachers humped with snow, there were no other buildings, and the nearest woods were a good half mile distant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know enough to understand what that means,” Nathan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t either. “So what do you think? Stay or go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should stay,” Lena said. “You said yourself, the prints are old. Look at this.” She used the toe of her boot to scuff a white bloom of icy powder. “It snowed again just last night. This is all fresh. You can tell we’re the only ones who’ve been through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not wild about either choice,” Nathan said, “but we’ve been on the move almost continuously for the last twenty hours. The horses are done in, and humping it back into any kind of woods with good cover means another two, three hours. If the animals were rested and we had some decent moon to light the way, it might be a different story.” After eleven days on the road, Nathan’s skin was drawn and his cheeks hollowed from lack of rest and poor food. “Even if we make it to the woods, sun’s gonna go before we can make camp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should stay,” Lena repeated. “He was probably alone. This might just have been this kid’s private stash. The others would’ve come out already, right? With no fresh tracks, that means there’s been nobody else in at least two days. We can barricade ourselves in somewhere on the second floor. If we get rid of the body and bring the horses in, maybe no one will know we’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were all good points. Chris’s eyes flicked back to the dead boy. The Changed was young, no more than thirteen, and looked healthy—well, aside from being dead. He was dressed for the weather, too. He studied the kid’s face, which still had a trace of baby fat under the chin. Eating pretty well, too. So maybe he was only defending his stash. But he had to know we’re no threat to that. And the only person he went for was—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chris?” Lena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a second.” The kid chose Lena. He could have taken Nathan or me. He could have left us alone. But he had to get at her—and he risked his life to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, he didn’t like where this line of thought was going. It might be nothing. But he thought he knew a way to test that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” He let out a long breath. “I vote we stay. Nathan, there’s a corner room on the second floor just above us, with windows east and north, and another on a diagonal south and west. We’ll have a good shot at seeing anything coming.” Stooping, he bent and hooked his hands under the dead boy’s pits. “Lena, let’s get him out of sight and then cover over the blood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena looked about as thrilled as if he’d asked her to pick up dog crap, but she only nodded. “It’ll be okay,” she said, grabbing the kid’s ankles. “It can’t be any more dangerous than the woods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when he lied to her for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said. “Probably not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e61\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here.” Sliding to a sit beside him at his lookout, Lena handed him a steaming aluminum camp cup. “I made you some tea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” he said, mildly surprised. He’d left Lena and Nathan next door in what had once been a chemistry lab. The room was downwind, but they’d used duct tape along the seams and under the door, just in case. The horses were in the gym because there were no windows and the one exit was easier to block off. The horses would leave mounds of crap on the basketball court, but he couldn’t think of a soul who would care. He cradled the hot metal in both hands. The steam was sweet and smelled orange. “How come you’re awake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Couldn’t sleep. I’m too wired, and my ears are cold. I can’t remember where I put my scarf either. Nathan’s out, though.” Her face was a dull silver glimmer in the darkness. “Anything going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.” Full dark had come six hours ago. A thumbnail of moon sprayed the snow a dank, dim verdigris like corroded bronze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So maybe there are no others.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be nice.” He sipped. The tea was very hot but tasted good. “How are you feeling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not so great.” She paused, then added, “I need some decent sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd something in your stomach. “So go back to bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a little while,” she said. “I don’t want to be alone in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nathan’s there.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadows-ashes-trilogy-2/page-43.html","bookId":2565,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:47:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:47:27 PM"}
