So I said, “Mom, what do you know about style?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight away, I worried she’d be mad, but it had slipped out, and it was true after all. My mother knew about as much about jewelry as she did about makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Susannah laughed, and so did my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go downstairs and tell the men we’ll be ready to go in five, Countess,” my mother ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped out of bed and curtsied dramatically. “Yes, Mum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both laughed. My mother said, “Go, you little imp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran downstairs. When I was a kid, anytime I had to go anywhere, I ran. “They’re almost ready,” I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fisher was showing my dad his new fishing rod. My dad looked relieved to see me, and he said, “Belly, what have they done to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Susannah made me up. Do you like it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad beckoned me closer, regarding me with serious eyes. “I’m not sure. You look very mature.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, very, very mature.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to hide my delight as I made a place for myself in the crook of my dad’s arm, my head right by his side. For me, there was no better compliment than being called mature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all left a little while later, the dads in pressed khakis and button-down shirts and the moms in their summer dresses. Mr. Fisher and my dad didn’t look so different when they dressed up like that. My dad hugged me good-bye and said that if I was still awake when they got back, we’d sit on the deck awhile and look for shooting stars. My mother said they’d probably be back too late, but my dad winked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way out, he whispered something to my mother that made her cover her mouth and laugh a low, throaty kind of laugh. I wonder what he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of the last times I remember them being happy. I really wish I had enjoyed it more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents had always been stable, as boring as two parents could be. They never fought. Taylor’s parents fought all the time. I’d be over for a sleepover, and Mr. Jewel would come home late and her mom would be really pissy, stomping around in her slippers and banging pots. We’d be at the dinner table, and I would sink lower and lower into my seat, and Taylor would just go on talking about stupid stuff. Like whether or not Veronika Gerard wore the same socks two days in a row in gym or if we should volunteer to be water girls for the JV football team when we were freshmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her parents got divorced, I asked Taylor if, in some little way, she was relieved. She said no. She said that even though they had fought all the time, at least they had still been a family. “Your parents never even fought,” she said, and I could hear the disdain in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what she meant. I wondered about it too. How could two people who had once been passionately in love not even fight? Didn’t they care enough to fight it out, to fight not just with each other, but also for their marriage? Were they ever really in love? Did my mother ever feel about my dad the way I felt about Conrad—alive, crazy, drunk with tenderness? Those were the questions that haunted me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to make the same mistakes my parents made. I didn’t want my love to fade away one day like an old scar. I wanted it to burn forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter twenty-nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally went back downstairs, it was dark out and Jeremiah was back. He and Conrad were sitting on the couch, watching TV like the fight had never happened. I guessed it was that way with boys. Whenever Taylor and I fought, we were mad for at least a week and there was a power struggle over who got custody of which friends. “Whose side are you on?” we’d demand of Katie or Marcy. We’d say mean things that you can’t take back and then we’d cry and make up. Somehow I doubted Conrad and Jeremiah had been crying and making up while I’d been upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if I was forgiven too, for keeping a secret from Jeremiah, for not taking a side—his side. Because it was true, we’d come here together as partners, a team, and when he’d needed me, I’d let him down. I lingered there by the stairs for a second, unsure of whether or not to go over, and then Jeremiah looked up at me and I knew I was. Forgiven, that is. He smiled, a real smile, and a real Jeremiah smile was the kind that could melt ice cream. I smiled back, grateful as anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just about to come get you,” he said. “We’re having a party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pizza box on the coffee table. “A pizza party?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah used to have pizza parties for us kids all the time. It was never just “pizza for dinner.” It was a pizza party. Except this time, with beer. And tequila. So this was it. Our last night. It would have felt a lot more real if Steven had been there too. It would have felt complete, us four together again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I ran into some people in town. They’re gonna come over later and bring a keg.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A keg?” I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. A keg, you know, of beer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, right,” I said. “A keg.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I sat down on the ground and opened the pizza box. There was one slice left, and it was a small one. “You guys are such pigs,” I said, stuffing it into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoops, sorry,” Jeremiah said. Then he went into the kitchen, and when he came back, he had three cups. He had one balanced in the crook of his elbow. He gave that one to me. “Cheers,” he said. He handed Conrad a cup too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffed it suspiciously. It was light brown with a lime wedge floating on top. “Smells strong,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because it’s tequila ,” he sang. He lifted his cup in the air. “To the last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To the last night,” we repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both drank theirs in one shot. I took a teeny sip of mine, and it wasn’t too bad. I’d never had tequila before. I drank the rest quickly. “This is pretty good,” I said. “Not strong at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah burst out laughing. “That’s because yours is ninety-five percent water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad laughed too, and I glared at them both. “That’s not fair,” I said. “I want to drink what you guys are drinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, but we don’t serve minors here,” Jeremiah said, falling next to me on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI punched him on the shoulder. “You’re a minor too, dummy. We all are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but you’re really a minor,” he said. “My mom would kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time any of us had mentioned Susannah. My eyes darted over to Conrad, but his face was blank. I let out a breath. And then I had an idea, the best idea ever. I jumped up and opened the doors of the TV console. I ran my fingers along the drawers of DVDs and home videos, all neatly labeled in Susannah’s slanted cursive handwriting. I found what I was looking for. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-33.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
