His desk is wooden and looks heavy. This desk was not bought at Ikea. This was the type of desk you bought at an antique store and had re-finished. It’s clearly mahogany (La dee dah!). And I notice the whole room is neat; not a stray paper in sight. I can’t even see my desk in Safira’s store room! It’s covered in papers, stock, and trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMental note; find your desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two framed photos on the mahogany bookshelf in the corner of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne is of a little girl who is so beautiful, my heart aches. Her smile is pure sunshine and she is missing one of her front teeth. She has Nik’s eyes. The frame is bright pink with purple glittery butterflies around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAww, cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other frame is exquisite. It is thick silver with pieces of beige mother of pearl swirling through it. The photo is an old one, a family portrait it looks like. A tall, dark haired, middle aged man stands with his arms around a short but beautiful dark haired, dark eyed woman. The woman is very much pregnant. The man looks like Nik but he is pale skinned where Nik is much darker. Most importantly are the man’s eyes. They are Nik’s eyes. I’m going to take a stab and say these are Nik’s parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo small girls flank the couple, hugging them both around the legs. Hugging the two girls are two young men. Looking closer at this picture I can see Max’s cheeky dimpled smile and it confirms my earlier suspicions that Nik and Max are brothers. Both girls have their mother’s eyes; both boys have their father’s eyes. All the children got their mother’s beautiful skin tone. They are all laughing and smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, I love this photo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in this picture is so happy. Like, blissfully happy. I think back to Nik and wonder what happened to his happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take another look around but there is nothing else to note except a filing cabinet in the opposite corner of the room close to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more photos, nothing at all personal, nothing to suggest he has a girlfriend or wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis reaction to my stupid questions. And I almost burst out laughing but manage to stop it and make a choked sound instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thinks I’m coming onto him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, I can’t blame him for thinking that because he is beauty defined. And now that I’ve spent some time with him I realize I had nothing to be nervous about. He seems like a nice, well-mannered guy but still a little too broody for my liking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn idea enters my brain and before I can think about it and verbal diarrhea spews forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina spends a good few minutes looking around my office. Her eyes land on the family portrait which was taken a few months before Dad died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize she’s looking for photos of a wife or girlfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we go. She’s gonna make her move. I should’ve left the damn note thing alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina makes a choked noise and I look up to find her trying to hold back a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCut her loose and no one gets hurt. She’s too cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is too cute. Too cute to fuck and leave, she ain’t that type. I can tell. I spend a lot of time with girls like that and they normally have the same interests as me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSex without strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body tenses. How do I turn her down without sounding like an asshole?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGirls like Tina hurt easy. That’s why I don’t deal with girls like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s smiling a small smile and waiting for me to say something. I don’t know what to say to her, she’s nervous as it is and doesn’t need me going all asshole on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start tapping my pen on the desk. I’m thinking so hard I’m sure she can see my brain moving around through my skull!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t noticed she started to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we can be friends, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her, a frown forming at my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I..? Did I just get Friend-zoned?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over again to see Tina nodding vigorously and smiling brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, this has never happened to me before. Girls usually come to the club knowing I got money; they ask me out or ask me to their place for a “drink”, which one hundred percent of the time ends up meaning sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina takes my silence as her cue to speak again. “I mean we work right across the street from each other. We can do lunch sometimes and, Ooh,” she widens her eyes almost comically, “we can get together for coffee at Winnie’s!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks so excited at the prospect of us being friends, she’s practically bouncing up and down in her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t need another friend. Definitely not a friend that’s a girl; too complicated. Cut her loose, man. You don’t need this shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust do it! Cut her loose. This is a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look into her sweet face and the words are out of my mouth before I realize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, sure. We can be friends”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat. The. Fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell did that come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can think about what just happened, Tina looks at me and smiles big. Her lips are a pale pink, not lipstick or gloss, but naturally. Her teeth are white and perfect. I tell myself to stop staring at her damn lips. So I focus on her eyes. Her eyes are slightly crinkled at the corners. Goddamn, even her eyes are smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Just great, you moron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina stands abruptly, pushing the chair out so hard it almost flies backwards onto the floor. She snatches up one of my business cards out of the holder on the desk, smiles brightly at me and says, “Great! So I guess I’ll be seeing you around, friend!” enthusiastically waving my business card back and forth in the air like it’s a Polaroid picture. She finishes with, “I’ll be in touch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she’s out the door. I sit back in my chair and my brow furrows once more as I scratch my chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously. What the fuck just happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk myself down the stairs and out of Nik’s building, thankfully remembering the way Max showed me. I make my way across the street to Safira, bound through the door grinning from ear to ear and holding Nik’s business card. Mimi looks at me, her face twisted in confusion. She looks around the store then back at me. She narrows her eyes and slowly walks over to me. She takes the business card out of my hand and reads aloud, “Nikolai Leokov. Owner. The White Rabbit.” She breaks out into a huge smile and shakes her head in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe claps her hands together and yells, “I can’t believe it! You’re actually going out with him!” Still smiling, she pats my hand. This small action is huge for Mimi. In Mimi Land, that is a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeems knows all about my past relationship; in fact all my girls know about Jace Weathers. I don’t keep secrets from them. One girl’s night out, after one too many cherry bombs, I unloaded my past onto Mimi and Lola. They listened intently as good friends do and offered me unconditional support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love my girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMental note; make the girls cupcakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the rush of warmth in my middle; my face softens a little but I quickly pull on a poker face and straighten my back. I prepare for the wrath of Mimi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI overdo it a little with the cheer, smile big and say, “Actually, we decided to be friends!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi does not speak for almost thirty seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chance a look at her. She is leaning gracefully with her tall, lithe body against the counter, one leg crossed over the other. Her eyes are narrowed (stop that darling, you’ll get wrinkles) and she wears a facial expression that clearly says Are you freaking kidding me? And not in a good way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrieks, “Are you freaking KIDDING me??!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThar she blows!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringe and bite my lip before returning with, “It’s better for everyone this way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe counters with, “Umm, No. It’s better for you.” She shakes her head slightly and looks disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to disappoint Mimi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Lola have been on a mission since I told them about Jace the Moron (which Natalie calls him, or The Moron for short). They both set me up on blind dates hoping I would meet a nice man and fall in love. I went on four dates in the last four months and all the guys were nice. But, firstly, I don’t want to fall in love again and, secondly, I’m happy with my life as it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t need a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start, “Meems, I appreciate your interest in my social life…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean Lack Of social life!” she bites back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continue “…and you’re a great friend. But I’m busy with the store and I don’t have the time for a boyfriend right now. To tell you the truth, I don’t want a boyfriend right now. I love my life. I’m back on track and loving it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJumping up, she plants her butt on the counter in front of me. She leans in and whispers, “You’re my best friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat closes up and my eyes mist. I whisper, “Honey…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe goes on, “You gave me a chance when no one else would. I’ll always be in your debt.” She looks uncomfortable and I know telling me this is taxing her. “I know I’m not the most cheerful person and I don’t do emotions well,” she whispers so quietly but I hear the words clearly. “That man damaged you. I just want you to be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi is not wrong. Jace did damage me. Not physically but mentally. I don’t trust the way I used to. It took me over a year to trust Mimi and Lola enough to tell them about myself. They know most of the dirty details of what Jace put me through. They know that loss hit me hard and, yes, damaged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho isn’t damaged in some way or another these days?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a glass-half-full kind of girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy palms start to sweat as I think about what I left behind in Cali.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss it. A lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sucks badly but I’m glad that soon I’ll have the best part of Cali right here…Natalie!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust another week. Almost there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bff is a hoot; so much attitude and sarcasm in such a small package. I love her for that; she makes me laugh all the time. Humor is my way of dealing with a plethora of things. I love to laugh. It calms me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s made me laugh a lot over the past year when I really needed it. I can’t wait to see her so I can squeeze her. I haven’t seen her in a year but we talk on the phone every few days and text every day. She knows more about Jace than Mimi and Lola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUhh, Jace Weathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can I say about Jace?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Jace just before I turned twenty. He was twenty three. We were both in college when he asked me out. I said yes, and we spent two wonderful years together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was my first in a lot of things. He was my first boyfriend, my first love and my first…you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had dated every now and again. I fooled around, too, but I kept my virginity for the one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace, I thought, was the one for me. I gave him my virginity after only three months together. After that first time, we did it a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow great is sex?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty great if you ask me! That’s the only thing I miss about having a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace was ecstatic that I was so enthusiastic about it. It was me initiating foreplay most of the time and I kept him extremely satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter two pretty great years together, we both decided that we were too young to get engaged or even move in together. We were happy with our relationship. Most of our time was spent together, laughing and goofing off. We were happy. Well, I know I was happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace is a good looking guy. About 6 foot tall, lean and muscular. He played basketball through college. Wearing his dark brown hair in a spiked style, with green eyes and an easy smile. He stole my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want it back, you goddamn thief!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was great until it wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate Jace now. I actually loathe Jace. He is a coward and a big fat stupid head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat more can I say about Jace?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke my heart; shattered it into a million pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, really, what kind of man doesn’t show up to his own daughter’s funeral?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit just got serious\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax looks incredulous as he slowly asks, “So you’re telling me you agreed to be friends with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit at the table in our ‘chill out’ room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do a lot of business dealings at the club during the day. The club consists of two floors. I own the building. There were vacant rooms on the second floor, one of which is my office. There are two conference rooms. Lastly, the ‘chill out’ room which has a huge LCD TV, cable, DVD player, computer, stereo, board games, the most comfortable sofa you’ve ever put your ass on, dining table and chairs, refrigerator, a cupboard full of snacks, and coloring books and markers (for my niece).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m looking down and tearing up a napkin into as many small pieces as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI respond, “I know, right? What the hell is wrong with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother looks at me and smirks. He says, “She got under ya skin.” He laughs and continues, “She is pretty damn cute. And that ass, mmm nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have the sudden urge to slap him across the back of the head. My brother Max is my best friend. Well, he is, and so is Asher who we nicknamed Ghost. We all grew up together, went to school together and towards the end of our high school years Ghost moved with us. This made Mom extremely happy because as she said his parents are ‘mala gente’ or ‘bad people’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole town knew this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom loves Ghost as her own son. She refuses to call him Ghost though, but he doesn’t mind. He calls her Mom and he loves her as much as I do, maybe even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost would sneak out of gym class so nobody could see the bruises all over his body. I knew they were there but it was forbidden to speak of it. I brought it up with him once and he disappeared for a week. The next time I saw him I told him I wouldn’t mention it again but let him know he was my brother and I had his back. Always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsher and I are thirty four. Max is a year younger than us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhh, the golden boy himself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost walks into the room followed by my cousin Diego who we call Trick They both take a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax starts, “Hey Casper, guess what Nik got himself?!” He’s practically giddy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/friend-zoned-friend-zoned-1/page-3.html","bookId":2798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM"}
