He enhances colors, adjusts tones, sharpens or softens images. Lips are digitally thickened, freckles are removed, an ax is placed in someone\u0027s outstretched hand, a BMW becomes a Jaguar which becomes a Mercedes which becomes a broom which becomes a frog which becomes a mop which becomes a poster of jenny McCarthy, license plates are altered, more blood is spattered around a crime-scene photo, an uncircumciscd penis is suddenly circumcised. Tapping keys, scanning images, Bentley adds motion blur (a shot of \"Victor\" jogging along the Seine), he\u0027s adding lens flair (in a remote desert in eastern Iran I\u0027m shaking hands with Arabs and wearing sunglasses and pouting, gasoline trucks lined up behind me), he\u0027s adding graininess, he\u0027s erasing people, he\u0027s inventing a new world, seamlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can move planets with this,\" Bentley says. \"You can shape lives.

Where have you been? You look like shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the shower, breathing erratically, I\u0027m flashing over the two files in the giant list containing my name with the most recent dates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"VICTOR\" Washington DC w/Samuel Johnson (father)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"VICTOR\" Washington DC w/Sally Johnson (sister)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the shower, I\u0027m led downstairs at gunpoint (which Bobby thought was excessive, needless, but not Bruce Rhinebeck) to a room hidden within a room in what I assume is some kind of basement in the house in the 8th or the 16th. This is where the French premier\u0027s son, chained to a chair, is slowly being poisoned. He\u0027s naked, gleaming with sweat, confetti floats on a puddle of blood congealing on the floor beneath him. His chest is almost completely blackened, both ni**les are missing, and because of the poison Bruce keeps administering he\u0027s having trouble breathing. Four teeth have been removed and wires are stretching his face apart, some strung through broken lips, causing him to look as if he\u0027s grinning at me. Another wire is inserted into a wound on his stomach, attaching itself to his liver, lashing it with electricity. He keeps fainting, is revived, faints again. He\u0027s fed more poison, then morphine, as Bentley videotapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt smells sweet in the room underground and I\u0027m trying to avert my eyes from a torture saw that sits on top of a Louis Vuitton trunk but there\u0027s really nowhere else to focus and music piped into the room comes from one of two radio stations (NOVA or NRJ). Bruce keeps yelling questions at the actor, in French, from a list of 320, all of them printed out in a thick stack of computer paper, many of them repeated in specific patterns, while Bobby stares levelly from a chair out of camera range, his mouth downturned. The French premier\u0027s son is shown photographs, glares wildly at them. He has no idea how to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask him 278 through 291 again,\" Bobby mutters at one point. \"At first in the same sequence. Then repeat them in C sequence.\" He directs Bruce to relax the mouth wires, to administer another dose of morphine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-178.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
