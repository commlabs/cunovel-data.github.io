I haven’t been to the grocery store yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go, but thanks, anyway.” Gloria checked her watch. “I thought this would be a good time to welcome you to the complex. If you have any questions about the town, I’ll be happy to try and answer them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be great,” Linnette told her. “I’ll definitely take you up on that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you do.” After a few parting words, Gloria was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinnette waited until the door closed before she turned on her brother. “Have I seen you somewhere before?” Linnette mimicked. “Honestly, Mack, that’s the oldest pickup line in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t trying to pick her up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mack, you couldn’t have been more obvious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, she is cute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, please. You’re so lame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me? This is the thanks I get for giving up an entire Saturday to help my sister?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, you’re right. Sorry. If you’re interested in Gloria, let me know and I’ll see what I can do to set you up—since you’re currently footloose and fancy-free.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMack raised his shoulders in a shrug. “Sure. But the truth is, she does look familiar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday night, Allison Cox was roused from a sound sleep by a tap on her bedroom window. Her clock told her it was almost three. She turned on the small light on her bed stand, tossed aside her down comforter and hurried to the window. Opening the blinds, she peered outside and gasped when Anson smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me in,” he mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d be in big trouble if her parents ever found out about this. Although the temptation was almost overpowering, she shook her head. “I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded vigorously and rubbed his bare hands together. Then he hunched his shoulders, as if to ward off the wind. His eyes pleaded with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anson, no.” She shook her head again, trying to convince herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, waited a moment and then turned around, not hiding his disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis willingness to walk away was her undoing. He’d been so good to her, so gentle and sweet. The first time they’d kissed, his goatee had bothered her and the next time she saw him, he’d shaved it off. Allison had been moved by his thoughtfulness. He cared about her more than any other guy ever had. In fact, she liked him a lot—more than she should. Her parents had no idea how often they saw each other because she hid their relationship as much as she could. Even Cecilia had voiced her concern about Anson, and she hadn’t even met him. But Allison knew he wasn’t what he appeared to be. The clothes and attitude were all for show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwice now he’d come over in the evenings, and he’d been respectful to her mother and father. That had earned him brownie points with her dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, all right,” she acquiesced and grabbed her housecoat. She threw it over her pajamas, then slid open the window. Leaving him out in the cold was more than she could bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnson crawled into her bedroom, landing on his feet with a solid thump. Thank goodness for her plush carpet, which absorbed much of the sound. His face was red from the cold, and his lips were chapped. He wore his signature black coat, a knit cap pulled low over his ears. His hands were bare. Smiling at her in the dim room, he let his eyes soften and leaned toward her, his mouth shaping hers in a long, hungry kiss. His face felt chilled and his lips, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison broke off the kiss and clutched her housecoat tighter around her. “What are you doing here?” she asked in an urgent whisper. “Do you know what time it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnson sat on the carpet, his back against the side of the bed. Allison knelt beside him. “I shouldn’t have come,” he whispered. “It was wrong, I know, but…” He looked down, unable to meet her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s all right,” she said and reached for his hands, warming them between her own. His coat had a peculiar smell. It was as if he’d been standing next to a bonfire and the smoke had clung to him. “What are you doing out at this time of night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his head lowered. “I can’t involve you in this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In what, Anson? You can’t involve me in what?” She touched his face, pressing her warm palm to his cheek and was shocked again at how cold his skin was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnson covered her hand with his own, then slowly raised his eyes to meet hers. He slid his hand to the nape of her neck and brought her mouth back to his. His kiss was demanding, desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t do this here…now,” she said, as quietly as she could. It would be easy to let him keep touching her, kissing her, but her father was a light sleeper and the risk was too great. Besides, something was terribly wrong. She felt it, saw it in Anson’s eyes, a wildness that frightened her—and yet she didn’t feel she could desert him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more Anson looked down, avoiding her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what happened,” she insisted. “Where have you been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was barely audible. “The park.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought it was closed. How’d you get in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twisted in a half smile. “All they have is a gate. It’s easy enough to jump over that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who were you with?” She should’ve realized a gate across the entrance wasn’t going to lock anyone out, least of all Anson and his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?” she asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was alone, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA siren pierced the night and Anson scrambled to his knees, crawled close to the window and peered out. “Anson?” Dread wormed its way into her stomach. “What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain he refused to answer as he crawled back to where she knelt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a fire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated and then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does it have anything to do with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t answer right away. When he did, his voice trembled. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my gosh.” She covered her mouth with both hands as she tried to take in what he was telling her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t mean to do it. It was an accident. My mother’s got some friend at the house,” he said scornfully, “and I can’t stand to be around when she has a sleepover.” He couldn’t seem to look at her. “The walls between our rooms are thin. I can hear everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t need to say any more for her to understand why he had to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to think Allison would be angry with him and when she wasn’t, he added, “I just had to get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you went to the park?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “It’s cold and I didn’t know where else to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything began to add up. “You…started a fire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was looking for a way to keep warm.” He rubbed his hand down his face. “I thought I’d make a campfire, you know, but I’m no Boy Scout. I must’ve done something wrong, because the wind picked up and before I knew it the flames caught—near the maintenance hut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what’s on fire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnson bit his lower lip. “There must’ve been some gasoline on the ground or something, because it practically exploded. I tried to put it out, but I couldn’t. Then I got scared. The flames were too hot, so I ran. I should’ve stayed, should’ve found a pay phone and called the fire department. There isn’t one in the park.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison’s heart pounded hard as she wrapped her arms around his shoulders. Anson had come to her; he needed her. They talked every day and hung out at school together. She was crazy about him, but her teachers, her friends, even Cecilia, thought he was wrong for her. Her parents were leery, too, but they’d let Anson come to the house for dinner twice. She and Anson even went to the library and studied together. Allison didn’t believe that caring about someone this much could be wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to do?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung his head. “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that case, she did. “I’m going to wake up my dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” His response was automatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dad will know what to do,” she argued. “He won’t come down on you if you’re honest with him. He’s fair, Anson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still looked uncertain. “Maybe…maybe that fire wasn’t as much of an accident as I said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked, Allison sat back on her heels. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced away and she saw that his hands had started to tremble. “I didn’t mean for it to get out of control like that,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You set the shed on fire on purpose? You mean it wasn’t an accident?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nod was barely perceptible. “Your dad will want to take me to the sheriff’s office. Allison, I can’t. I’m almost eighteen. The prosecutor might decide to try me as an adult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sick feeling invaded the pit of her stomach, but she’d learned that the best way to attack a problem was head-on. She didn’t have any reassurances to give him. “They might, but I’ll be with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your dad won’t let you have anything to do with me if I tell him what I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison already knew this was a risk. “I know, but that’s a chance we have to take. My dad’s fair and he’ll respect you for being honest. He’ll do what he can to help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison straightened her shoulders and brought her hand to his cheek. “Because his daughter cares what happens to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnson’s eyes locked onto hers. “You do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot.” Allison’s heart swelled with the intensity of her emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt her words, her touch, Anson’s eyes filled with tears. “No one’s ever really cared about me before,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I care.” And to prove how much, she leaned forward and kissed him. He smiled tentatively when she lifted her lips from his. Taking him by the hand, she led him out of her bedroom and into the kitchen. By the light of the moon, which shone coldly through the window, she urged him into a chair, instructing him to wait there while she woke her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison wasn’t sure of anything, but she trusted her father. He’d know what to do and how best to help Anson. She had no other alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dad was sitting up in bed even before Allison reached her parents’ door. “What’s going on?” he asked. Her mother slept contentedly at his side, undisturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anson needs your help,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now? In the middle of the night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his stare as he folded back the covers. “I trust you to do the right thing, Dad,” she told him, her voice shaking. That was all she would say. All she could do was pray he didn’t disappoint her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/50-harbor-street-cedar-cove-5/page-12.html","bookId":1945,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:30 AM"}
