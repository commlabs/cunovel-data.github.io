At least for Evan Tanner, eternally sleepless sometime superspy, who finds himself in Africa on the trail of the AWOL ruler of tiny Modonoland. It seems the petty despot\u0027s gone missing, and he\u0027s taken the state treasury along with him. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eNo stranger to impossible missions and international peril, Tanner\u0027s been in over his head before. This time, however, he\u0027s in imminent danger of being buried alive. And it all has to do with the CIA, white supremacists, moderate revolutionaries . . . and a blond jungle bombshell named (no joke!) Sheena. Tanner\u0027s always been a sucker for a pretty face and a curvaceous body, especially one that\u0027s wrapped in leopard skin. But this red hot renegade daughter of a local missionary is a maneater. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eWhich means this time Tanner\u0027s goose is well and truly cooked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/me-tanner-you-jane-evan-tanner-7.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/me-tanner-you-jane-evan-tanner-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:29 PM"}
