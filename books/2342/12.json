He had his pants on and was smoothing the wrinkles out of his shirt with his palm against the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love those scars,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a step closer, looking at his stomach with undisguised curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that one from?\" she asked, pointing to his right side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced down. The right side of his stomach had a violent tracery of stitches in the shape of a twisted star. They bulged out above the muscle wall, white and angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother did it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was raised by grizzly bears. In Alaska.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes and moved them up to the left side of his chest. There was a.38 caliber bullet hole there, punched right into the pectoral muscle. The hair was missing from around it. It was a big hole. She could have lost her little finger in it, right up to the first knuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exploratory surgery,\" he said. \"Checking if I had a heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re happy this morning,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I\u0027m always happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get Jodie yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I haven\u0027t tried since yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waste of time. She\u0027s not there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you worried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"She\u0027s a big girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you if I hear anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"You better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they really from?\" she asked. \"The scars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe buttoned his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gut is from bomb shrapnel,\" he said. \"The chest, somebody shot me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dramatic life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his coat from the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not really. Pretty normal, wouldn\u0027t you say? For a soldier? A soldier figuring to avoid physical violence is like a CPA figuring to avoid adding numbers. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you don\u0027t care about these women?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her. \"Who says I don\u0027t care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d be more agitated about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting agitated won\u0027t achieve anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused. \"So what will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working the clues, same as always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There aren\u0027t any clues. He doesn\u0027t leave any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"That\u0027s a clue in itself, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe used her key from the inside and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just talking in riddles,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Better than talking in bullshit, like they do downstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SAME MOTOR pool guy brought the same car to the doors. This time he stayed in the driver\u0027s seat, sitting square-on like a dutiful chauffeur. He drove them north on I-95 to the National Airport. It was before dawn. There was a halfhearted glow in the sky somewhere three hundred miles to the east, all the way out over the Atlantic Ocean. The only other illumination was from a thousand headlights streaming north toward work. The headlights were mostly on old-model cars. Old, therefore cheap, therefore owned by low-grade people aiming to be at their desks an hour before their bosses, so they would look good and get promotion, whereupon they could drive newer cars to work an hour later in the day. Reacher sat still and watched their shadowed faces as the Bureau driver sped past them, one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the airport terminal, it was reasonably busy. Men and women in dark raincoats walked quickly from one place to another. Harper collected two coach tickets from the United desk and carried them over to the check-in counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could use some legroom,\" she said to the guy behind the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe used her FBI pass for photo ID. She snapped it down like a poker player completing a flush. The guy hit a few keys and came up with an upgrade. Harper smiled, like she was genuinely surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst class was half-empty. Harper took an aisle seat, trapping Reacher against the window like a prisoner. She stretched out. She was in a third different suit, this one a fine check in a muted gray. The jacket fell open and showed a hint of nipple through the shirt, and no shoulder holster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Left your gun at home?\" Reacher asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Not worth the hassle. Airlines want too much paperwork. A Seattle guy is meeting us. Standard practice is he\u0027d bring a spare, should we need one. But we won\u0027t, not today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey taxied on time and took off a minute early. Reacher pulled the magazine out and started leafing through. Harper had her tray unfolded, ready for breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you mean?\" she asked. \"When you said it\u0027s a clue in itself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced his mind back an hour and tried to remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just thinking aloud, I guess,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thinking about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. He had time to kill. \"The history of science. Stuff like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that relevant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking about fingerprinting. How old is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face. \"Pretty old, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn of the century?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, a hundred years old,\" he said. \"That was the first big forensic test, right? Probably started using microscopes around the same time. And since then, they\u0027ve invented all kinds of other stuff. DNA, mass spectrometry, fluorescence. Lamarr said you\u0027ve got tests I wouldn\u0027t believe. I bet they can find a rug fiber, tell you where and when somebody bought it, what kind of flea sat on it, what kind of dog the flea came off. Probably tell you what the dog\u0027s name is and what brand of dog food it ate for breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amazing tests, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real science-fiction stuff, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" he said. \"Amazing, science-fiction tests. But this guy killed Amy Callan and beat all of those tests, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you call that type of a guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very, very clever guy, is what.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face. \"Among other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, a lot of other things, but whatever else, a very clever guy. Then he did it again, with Cooke. Now what do we call him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very, very clever guy. Once might have been luck. Twice, he\u0027s damn good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he did it again, with Stanley. Now what do we call him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very, very, very clever guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s the clue. We\u0027re looking for a very, very, very clever guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we know that already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head. \"I don\u0027t think you do. You\u0027re not factoring it in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what sense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think about it. I\u0027m only an errand boy. You Bureau people can do all the hard work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stewardess came out of the galley with the breakfast trolley. It was first class, so the food was reasonable. Reacher smelled bacon and egg and sausage. Strong coffee. He flipped his tray open. The cabin was half-empty, so he got the girl to give him two breakfasts. Two airline meals made for a pleasant snack. She caught on quick and kept his coffee cup full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How aren\u0027t we factoring it in?\" Harper asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figure it out for yourself,\" Reacher said. \"I\u0027m not in a helpful mood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it that he\u0027s not a soldier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to stare at her. \"That\u0027s great. We agree he\u0027s a really smart guy, and so you say well, then he\u0027s obviously not a soldier. Thanks a bunch, Harper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away, embarrassed. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean it like that. I just can\u0027t see how we\u0027re not factoring it in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing in reply. Just drained his coffee and climbed over her legs to get to the bathroom. When he got back, she was still looking contrite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should, Reacher. Blake\u0027s going to ask me about your attitude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My attitude? Tell him my attitude is if a hair on Jodie\u0027s head gets hurt, I\u0027ll tear his legs off and beat him to death with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"You really mean that, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded back. \"You bet your ass I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I don\u0027t understand. Why aren\u0027t you feeling a little bit of the same way about these women? You liked Amy Callan, right? Not the same way as Jodie, but you liked her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand you, either. Blake wanted to use you like a hooker, and you\u0027re acting like he\u0027s still your best buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"He was desperate. He gets like that. He\u0027s under a lot of stress. He gets a case like this, he\u0027s just desperate to crack it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you admire that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Sure I do. I admire dedication.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t share it. Or you wouldn\u0027t have said no to him. You\u0027d have seduced me on camera, for the good of the cause. So maybe it\u0027s you who doesn\u0027t care enough about these women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quiet for a spell. \"It was immoral. It annoyed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"And threatening Jodie was immoral, too. It annoyed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m not letting my annoyance get in the way of justice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I am. And if you don\u0027t like that, tough shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY DIDN\u0027T SPEAK again, all the way to Seattle. Five hours, without a word. Reacher was comfortable enough with that. He was not a compulsively sociable guy. He was happier not talking. He didn\u0027t see anything odd about it. There was no strain involved. He just sat there, not talking, like he was making the journey on his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarper was having more trouble with it. He could see she was worried about it. She was like most people. Put her alongside somebody she was acquainted with, she felt she had to be conversing. For her, it was unnatural not to be. But he didn\u0027t relent. Five hours, without a single word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose five hours were reduced to two by the West Coast clocks. It was still about breakfast time when they landed. The Sea-Tac terminals were filled with people starting out on their day. The arrivals hall had the usual echelon of drivers holding placards up. There was one guy in a dark suit, striped tie, short hair. He had no placard, but he was their guy. He might as well have had FBI tattooed across his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lisa Harper?\" he said. \"I\u0027m from the Seattle Field Office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shook hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Reacher,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seattle agent ignored him completely. Reacher smiled inside. Touche, he thought. But then the guy might have ignored him anyway even if they were best buddies, because he was pretty much preoccupied with paying a whole lot of attention to what was under Harper\u0027s shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re flying to Spokane,\" he said. \"Air taxi company owes us a few favors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a Bureau car parked in the tow lane. He used it to drive a mile around the perimeter road to General Aviation, which was five acres of fenced tarmac filled with parked planes, all of them tiny, one and two engines. There was a cluster of huts with low-budget signs advertising transportation and flying lessons. A guy met them outside one of the huts. He wore a generic pilot\u0027s uniform and led them toward a clean white six-seat Cessna. It was a medium-sized walk across the apron. Fall in the Northwest had brighter light than in D.C., but it was just as cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior of the plane was about the same size Lamarr\u0027s Buick had been, and a whole lot more spartan. But it looked clean and well maintained, and the engines started first touch on the button. It taxied out to the runway with the same sensation of tiny size Reacher had felt in the Lear at McGuire. It lined up behind a 747 bound for Tokyo the way a mouse lines up behind an elephant. Then it wound itself up and was off the ground in seconds, wheeling due east, settling to a noisy cruise a thousand feet above the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airspeed indicator showed more than a hundred and twenty knots, and the plane flew on for two whole hours. The seat was cramped and uncomfortable, and Reacher started wishing he\u0027d thought of a better way to waste his time. He was going to spend fourteen hours in the air, all in one day. Maybe he should have stayed and worked on the files with Lamarr. He imagined a quiet room somewhere, like a library, a stack of papers, a leather chair. Then he pictured Lamarr herself and glanced across at Harper and figured he\u0027d maybe taken the right option after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airfield at Spokane was a modest, modern place, larger than he had expected. There was a Bureau car waiting on the tarmac, identifiable even from a thousand feet up, a clean dark sedan with a man in a suit leaning on the fender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the Spokane satellite office,\" the Seattle guy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car rolled over to where the plane parked and they were on the road within twenty seconds of the pilot shutting down. The local guy had the destination address written on a pad fixed to his windshield with a rubber suction cup. He seemed to know where the place was. He drove ten miles east toward the Idaho panhandle and turned north on a narrow road into the hills. The terrain was moderate, but there were giant mountains in the middle distance. Snow gleamed on the peaks. The road had a building every mile or so, separated by thick forest and broad meadow. The population density was not encouraging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe address itself might have been the main house of an old cattle ranch, sold off long ago and refurbished by somebody looking for the rural dream but unwilling to forget the aesthetics of the city. It was boxed into a small lot by new ranch fencing. Beyond the fencing was grazing land, and inside the fencing the same grass had been fed and mowed into a fine lawn. There were trees on the perimeter, contorted by the wind. There was a small barn with garage doors punched into the side and a path veering off from the driveway to the front door. The whole structure stood close to the road and close to its own fencing, like a suburban house standing close to its neighbors, but this one stood close to nothing. The nearest man-made object was at least a mile away north or south, maybe twenty miles away east or west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe local guys stayed in the car, and Harper and Reacher got out and stood stretching on the shoulder. Then the engine shut down behind them and the stunning silence of the empty country fell on them like a weight. It hummed and hissed and echoed in their ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d feel better if she lived in a city apartment,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarper nodded. \"With a doorman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no gate. The ranch fencing just stopped either side of the mouth of the driveway. They walked together toward the house. The driveway was shale. Reassuringly noisy, at least. There was a slight breeze. Reacher could hear it in the power lines. Harper stopped at the front door. There was no bell push. Just a big iron knocker in the shape of a lion\u0027s head with a heavy ring held in its teeth. There was a fisheye spyhole above it. The spyhole was new. There were burrs of clean wood where the drill had chipped the paint. Harper grasped the iron ring and knocked twice. The ring thumped on the wood. The sound was loud and dull, and it rolled out over the grassland. Came back seconds later from the hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no response. Harper knocked again. The sound boomed out. They waited. There was a creak of floorboards inside the house. Footsteps. The sound approached unseen and stopped behind the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\" a voice called. A woman\u0027s voice, apprehensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarper went into her pocket and came out with her badge. It was backed with a slip of leather, the same type of gold-on-gold shield Lamarr had clicked against Reacher\u0027s car window. The eagle at the top, head cocked to the left. She held it up, six inches in front of the spyhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"FBI, ma\u0027am,\" she announced. \"We called you yesterday, made an appointment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened with the creak of old hinges and revealed an entrance hall with a woman in it. She was holding the doorknob, smiling with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia\u0027s got me so damn nervous,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarper smiled back in a sympathetic way and introduced herself and Reacher. The woman shook hands with both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alison Lamarr,\" she said. \"Really pleased to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led the way inside. The hall was square and as large as a room, walled and floored in old pine, which had been stripped and waxed to a fresh color a shade darker than the gold on Harper\u0027s badge. There were curtains in yellow checked gingham. Sofas with feather-filled pillows. Old oil lamps converted to take electric bulbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get you guys coffee?\" Alison Lamarr asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all set right now,\" Harper said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, please,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led them through to the kitchen, which was the whole rear quarter of the first floor. It was an attractive space, waxed floor polished to a shine, new cabinets in unostentatious timber, a big country range, a line of gleaming machines for washing clothes and dishes, electric gadgets on the countertops, more yellow gingham at the windows. An expensive renovation, he guessed, but designed to impress only herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cream and sugar?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just black,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was medium height, dark, and she moved with the bounce of a fit, muscular woman. Her face was open and friendly, tanned like she lived outdoors, and her hands were worn, like she maybe installed her own ranch fencing for herself. She smelled of lemon scent and was dressed in clean denim which had been carefully pressed. She wore tooled cowboy boots with clean soles. It looked like she\u0027d made an effort for her visitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe poured coffee from a machine into a mug. Handed it to Reacher and smiled. The smile was a mixture of things. Maybe she was lonely. But it proved there was no blood relationship with her stepsister. It was a pleasant smile, interested, friendly, smiled in a way Julia Lamarr had no idea existed. It reached her eyes, which were dark and liquid. Reacher was a connoisseur of eyes, and he rated these two as more than acceptable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I look around?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security check?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be my guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his coffee with him. The two women stayed in the kitchen. The house had four rooms on the first floor, entrance, kitchen, parlor, living room. The whole place was solidly built out of good timber. The renovations were excellent quality. All the windows were new storm units in stout wood frames. The weather was cold enough that the screens were out and stored. Each window had a key. The front door was original, old pine two inches thick and aged like steel. Big hinges and a city lock. There was a back hallway with a back door, similar vintage and thickness. Same lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside there were thick thorny foundation plantings he guessed were chosen for wind resistance, but were as good as anything for stopping people spending time trying to get in the windows. There was a steel cellar door with a big padlock latched through the handles. The garage was a decent barn, less well maintained than the house, but not about to fall down anytime soon. There was a new Jeep Cherokee inside, and a stack of cartons proving the renovations had been recent. There was a new washing machine, still boxed up and sealed. A workbench with power saws and drills stored neatly on a shelf above it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back into the house and up the stairs. Same windows as elsewhere. Four bedrooms. Alison\u0027s was clearly the back room on the left, facing west over empty country as far as the eye could see. It would be dark in the mornings, but the sunsets would be spectacular. There was a new master bathroom, stealing space from the next-door bedroom. It held a toilet, and a sink, and a shower. And a tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back down to the kitchen. Harper was standing by the window, looking out at the view. Alison Lamarr was sitting at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"Looks good to me. You keep the doors locked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do now. Julia made such a fuss about it. I lock the windows, I lock the doors, I use the spyhole, I put 911 on the speed dial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you should be OK,\" Reacher said. \"This guy isn\u0027t into breaking doors down, apparently. Don\u0027t open up to anybody, nothing can go wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"That\u0027s how I figure it. You need to ask me some questions now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why they sent me, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down opposite her. Focused on the gleaming machines on the other side of the room, desperately trying to think of something intelligent to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your father doing?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Julia mentioned he was sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, surprised. \"He\u0027s been sick two years. Cancer. Now he\u0027s dying. Almost gone, just hanging on day by day. He\u0027s in the hospital in Spokane. I go there every afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia should come out. But she\u0027s awkward with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t fly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison made a face. \"She could get over that, just once in two years. But she\u0027s all hung up on this step-family thing, as if it really matters. Far as I\u0027m concerned, she\u0027s my sister, pure and simple. And sisters take care of each other, right? She should know that. She\u0027s going to be the only relative I\u0027ve got. She\u0027ll be my next of kin, for God\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m sorry about all that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made another face. \"Right now, that\u0027s not too important. What can I help you with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got any feeling for who this guy could be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"That\u0027s rather a basic question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s rather a basic issue. You got any instinct?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s some guy who thinks it\u0027s OK to harass women. Or maybe not OK, exactly. Could be some guy who just thinks the fallout should be kept behind closed doors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that an option?\" Harper asked. She sat down, next to Reacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison glanced at her. \"I don\u0027t really know. I\u0027m not sure there is any middle ground. Either you swallow it, or it goes public in a big way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you look for the middle ground?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I\u0027m the living proof. I just went ballistic. There was no middle ground there. At least, I couldn\u0027t see any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was your guy?\" Reacher asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A colonel called Gascoigne,\" she said. \"He was always full of shit about coming to him if anything was bothering you. I went to him about getting reassigned. I saw him five times. I wasn\u0027t pleading the feminist case or anything. It wasn\u0027t a political thing. I just wanted something more interesting to do. And frankly I thought the Army was wasting a good soldier. Because I was good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"So what happened with Gascoigne? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison made a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see it coming,\" she said. \"At first I thought he was just kidding around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused. Looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said I should try next time without my uniform on,\" she said. \"I thought he was asking for a date, you know, meet him in town, some bar, off duty, plain clothes. But then he made it clear, no, he meant right there in his office, stripped off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"Not a very nice suggestion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made another face. \"Well, he led up to it pretty slow, and he was pretty jokey about it, at first. It was like he was flirting. I almost didn\u0027t notice, you know? Like he\u0027s a man, I\u0027m a woman, it\u0027s not a huge surprise, right? But clearly he figured I wasn\u0027t getting the message, so then all of a sudden he got obscene. He described what I\u0027d have to do, you know? One foot on this corner of his desk, the other foot on the other corner, hands behind my head, motionless for thirty minutes. Then bending over, you know? Like a porno movie. Then it did hit me, the rage, all in a split second, and I just went nuclear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"And you busted him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did he react?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"He was puzzled, more than anything. I\u0027m sure he\u0027d done it lots of times before, and gotten away with it. I think he was kind of surprised the rules had changed on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could he be the guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No. This guy is deadly, right? Gascoigne wasn\u0027t like that. He was an old, sad man. Tired, and ineffectual. Julia says this guy is a piece of work. I don\u0027t see Gascoigne having that kind of initiative, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded again. \"If your sister\u0027s profile is correct, this is probably a guy from the background somewhere. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Alison said. \"Maybe not connected with any specific incident. Maybe some kind of distant observer, turned avenger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Julia\u0027s profile is correct,\" Reacher said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a short silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big if,\" Alison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got doubts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I have,\" she said. \"And I know you have, too. Because we both know the same things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarper sat forward. \"What are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison made a face. \"I just can\u0027t see a soldier going to all this trouble, not over this issue. It just doesn\u0027t work like that. The Army changes the rules all the time. Go back fifty years, it\u0027s OK to harass blacks, then it\u0027s not. It\u0027s OK to shoot gook babies, then it\u0027s not. A million things like that. Hundreds of men were canned one after the other, for some new invented offense. Truman integrated the Army, nobody started killing the blacks who filed complaints. This is some kind of new reaction. I can\u0027t understand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe men versus women is more fundamental,\" Harper said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison nodded. \"Maybe it is. I really don\u0027t know. But at the end of the day, like Julia says, the target group is so specific, it has to be a soldier. Who else could even identify us? But it\u0027s a very weird soldier, that\u0027s for damn sure. Not like any I ever met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Harper said. \"Nobody at all? No threats, no comments, while it was all happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing significant. Nothing more than casual bullshit. Nothing that I recall. I even flew out to Quantico and let Julia hypnotize me, in case there was something buried there, but she said I came up with nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence again. Harper swept imaginary crumbs from the table and nodded. \"OK. Wasted trip, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, guys,\" Alison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s ever wasted,\" Reacher said. \"Negatives can be useful too. And the coffee was great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he doesn\u0027t,\" Harper said. \"We\u0027ve got to get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK.\" She stood up and followed them out of her kitchen. Crossed the hall and opened her front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let anybody in,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison smiled. \"I don\u0027t plan to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it,\" Reacher said. \"It looks like there\u0027s no force involved. This guy is just walking in. So you might know him. Or he\u0027s some kind of a con artist, with some kind of a plausible excuse. Don\u0027t fall for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t plan to,\" she said again. \"Don\u0027t worry about me. And call me if you need anything. I\u0027ll be at the hospital afternoons, as long as it takes, but any other time is good. And best of luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher followed Harper through the front door, out onto the shale path. They heard the door close behind them, and then the loud sound of the lock turning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE LOCAL BUREAU guy saved them two hours\u0027 flying time by pointing out that they could hop from Spokane to Chicago and then change there for D.C. Harper did the business with the tickets and found out it was more expensive, which was presumably why the Quantico travel desk hadn\u0027t booked it that way in the first place. But she authorized the extra money herself and decided to have the argument later. Reacher admired her for it. He liked impatience and wasn\u0027t keen on another two hours in the Cessna. So they sent the Seattle guy back west alone and boarded a Boeing for Chicago. This time there was no upgrade, because the whole plane was coach. It put them close together, elbows and thighs touching all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you think?\" Harper asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not paid to think,\" Reacher said. \"In fact, so far I\u0027m not getting paid at all. I\u0027m a consultant. So you ask me questions and I\u0027ll answer them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did ask you a question. I asked you what you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I think it\u0027s a big target group and three of them are dead. You can\u0027t guard them, but if the other eighty-eight do what Alison Lamarr is doing, they should be OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think locked doors are enough to stop this guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He chooses his own MO. Apparently he doesn\u0027t touch anything. If they don\u0027t open the door for him, what\u0027s he going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe change his MO.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In which case you\u0027ll get him, because he\u0027ll have to start leaving some hard evidence behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look out of the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" Harper said. \"We should just tell the women to lock their doors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I think you should be warning them, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t catch the guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t catch him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of this profiling bullshit. You\u0027re not factoring in how smart he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Yes, we are. I\u0027ve seen the profile. It says he\u0027s real smart. And profiling works, Reacher. Those people have had some spectacular successes. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Among how many failures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher turned back to face her. \"Suppose I was in Blake\u0027s position? He\u0027s effectively a nationwide homicide detective, right? Gets to hear about everything. So suppose I was him, getting notified about every single homicide in America. Suppose every single time I said the likely suspect was a white male, age thirty and a half, wooden leg, divorced parents, drives a blue Ferrari. Every single time. Sooner or later, I\u0027d be right. The law of averages would work for me. Then I could shout out hey, I was right. As long as I keep quiet about the ten thousand times I was wrong, I look pretty good, don\u0027t I? Amazing deduction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what Blake\u0027s doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it? Have you read stuff about his unit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Of course I have. That\u0027s why I applied for the assignment. There are all kinds of books and articles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve read them too. Chapter one, successful case. Chapter two, successful case. And so on. No chapters about all the times they were wrong. Makes me wonder about how many times that was. My guess is a lot of times. Too many times to want to write about them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying a scattergun approach will always look good, as long as you put the spotlight on the successes and sweep the failures under the rug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what they\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"No, it isn\u0027t. Not exactly. They\u0027re not just guessing. They try to work at it. But it\u0027s not an exact science. It\u0027s not rigorous. And they\u0027re one unit among many, fighting for status and funding and position. You know how organizations work. They\u0027ve got the budget hearings right now. First, second, and third duty is protecting their own ass against cuts by proclaiming their successes and concealing their failures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you think the profile is worthless?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I know it is. It\u0027s internally flawed. It makes two statements that are incompatible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What two statements?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No deal, Harper. Not until Blake apologizes for threatening Jodie and pulls Julia Lamarr off the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would he do that? She\u0027s his best profiler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE MOTOR POOL guy was at the National Airport in D.C. to pick them up. It was late when they arrived back at Quantico. Julia Lamarr met them, alone. Blake was in a budget meeting, and Poulton had signed out and gone home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was she?\" Lamarr asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My stepsister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was OK,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s her house like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secure,\" he said. \"Locked up tight as Fort Knox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But isolated, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very isolated,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. He waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she\u0027s OK?\" she said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants you to visit,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I can\u0027t.
