Every company got itself a scribe and everything was portioned out. Collected weapons and armour. Horses, all that. Winning a battle meant bonuses.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All very well, Cuttle,’ nodded Bottle. ‘But we here got us a temple treasury. The pay rolls are still being maintained. The fact is, sapper, we’re all stinking rich.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Assuming we live to get it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s always how it is. I don’t see your point.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sapper’s small eyes glittered. ‘Tell me,’ he said in a rough voice, ‘do you give a Nacht’s ass about it? Do you, Bottle?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered. Four, five, seven strides. ‘No,’ he admitted, ‘but then, I never did care much. Not in it for wealth.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re young, aye. It’s the adventure that tugs you along. But you see, get to a certain age, seen enough of all that’s out there, and you start thinking about your life when it’s all done with. Y’start thinking about some cosy cottage, or maybe a decent room above a decent tavern. Aye, you know it’ll probably never be, but you dream about it anyway. And that’s where all the coin comes in.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice dropped lower. ‘Bottle, I ain’t thinking past next week. I ain’t thought about my pay in months. You hearing me? No cottage, no tavern. No nice little fisher boat or, gods forbid, a garden. None of it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s because we’re the walking dead, right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I thought so, what with what Fid said the other night, but now I don’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, Bottle eyed the sapper. ‘Go on, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuttle shrugged, as if suddenly uncomfortable. ‘Something’s happened to us, that’s all. The Bonehunters. Maybe it was invading Lether. Maybe it was Malaz City, or even Y’Ghatan, I don’t know. Look at us. We’re an army not thinking about loot. Why do you think Koryk went and mocked Smiles here about charging for her piss?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because he’s broke,’ Smiles answered. ‘And jealous.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s because no one cares about silver and gold, or buying stinking estates, or breeding horses or taking up sea trades. We’re probably the only army in the world that doesn’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiles snorted. ‘Hold on, sapper. You don’t think that when we’ve chopped up whoever and we’re standing there on that battlefield – don’t you think we’re gonna start cutting off fingers and all the rest? Loading up on torcs and rings and decent swords and whatever?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. I don’t, Smiles.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think I agree with Cuttle on this one,’ said Bottle. ‘Then again, maybe you will—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why should I?’ she retorted. ‘I wasn’t talking about me at all—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Another first,’ Bottle muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, I’m gonna walk around checking bodies, aye,’ she said, nodding. ‘Find one still breathing, and slit goes the throat. Rings and shit? Forget it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just what I been saying,’ Cuttle said, and he fixed wide eyes upon Bottle. ‘It’s exactly it, Bottle. This army has gone insane.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fid’s captain now,’ Balm growled. ‘What more do you need to know? He’ll do us right. He was a Bridgeburner, wasn’t he? Look at his old squad, lads – didn’t lose a damned one of them. If that ain’t the kind eye of a god looking down, what is?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiddershins crowded up behind Throatslitter, Deadsmell and the sergeant. ‘Did any of you hear Bottle back there? That stuff about our name?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter scowled. ‘What?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He was asking about how we got our name.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So, I just think … well … I think it’s important. I think Bottle knows something, but he’s keeping it quiet—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Bottled up?’ Deadsmell asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter’s high-pitched laugh triggered curses up and down the line. The assassin hissed under his breath. ‘Sorry, that just came out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So give him a shake, Wid,’ pressed Deadsmell, ‘until it all gushes out. He’s got a cork somewhere, go and find it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter snorted, and then choked as he held down another squeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stop that, Deadsmell,’ Balm ordered. ‘I mean it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But I’ve just scratched the surface of possibilities, Sergeant—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You saw what Cuttle went and did to Koryk? I’ll lay you out, Deadsmell—’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-159.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
