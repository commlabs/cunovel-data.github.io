School was over and he hadn\u0027t forgotten her school girl taunting, his almost-revenge. Of course, Tiff had laid it where it hurt the most. For Carson, his prick was his pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the awful truth was, he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe couldn\u0027t always be there. Tiff\u0027s words had proven that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I couldn\u0027t be responsible for plugging the holes of the group\u0027s vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t help my rage issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esenior year\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff walked to her locker, pulsereader swinging in a loose grip. It was between classes and she had all the lame ones from prior years satisfied. Now she was taking all underwater basketweaving types now. Autopilot Mode for senior year was awesomesauce squared. The only class that was prerequisite core was AFTD which totally worked because she and Caleb could play catnip with old Dave Smith. It was tight. She\u0027d roll her gum in her mouth like a cow chewing its cud and Smith would have a cow and she\u0027d spit it into the separator. Rinse and repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePriceless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff was usually pretty good about noticing her surroundings but had let the quiet of the hall lull her into a false sense of security as she made a self-absorbed beeline to her locker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Hamilton barreled into her from behind, slamming her into the locker and pinning her against it using his body weight like an effective anchor, she thought she\u0027d pee on the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff knew it was him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027d only been a couple of weeks since she\u0027d called him the Dickless Wonder. His lack of a penis was not his fault but Tiff was honor bound to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHamilton hadn\u0027t forgotten, his eyes followed her everywhere she went since her last jibe. Hamilton had just been biding his time. She bit off the whimper that rose in response to her automatic fight and flight response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitch,\" he seethed, grinding against her posterior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawd... effing ick, she thought with sick revulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Tiff had no sense of self-preservation. \"I\u0027m not feeling it now either...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Carson hissed, pressing his hips into her back. He was such an evil turd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your dick, dumbass,\" she said in the slow tones you use with a child or someone that doesn\u0027t understand English as a first language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnatching a handful of her hair, he slammed her forehead into the locker, and Tiff saw stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, not smart on the tongue lashing, she thought in a daze. And horror of horrors, she could feel his dick and it made her armpits sweat. Her heart began beating wildly in an attempt to escape her ribcage. The perv was getting off on hurting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo surprise there, the fucking freak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff let her head tip forward and then used it like a battering ram (it had been very effective with the brothers), launching it backward into his forehead. She had to hop a little as she did it, guessing at his height, ignoring the latent dizziness of the abuse of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nailed him, and his gross tool and body fell away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff laid a palm on the cool metal of the lockers, a knot of flesh forming above her eye and turned to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey faced off: a one hundred fifteen pound, five feet four pissed off girl against two hundred pounds and six feet one of perv.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, students poured out from their portals, released from the classes they\u0027d been learning in. They flowed between the pair, unaware of what had transpired. Carson gave her a shitty smirk and with a finger like a gun, took a shot like a bull\u0027s eye aimed at her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, this was just going to be the beginning of the harassment. He sauntered off, adjusting his junk as he did. Just another day in the park, the bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clutched her own hands together to stop their shaking from the residual surge of sick adrenaline brought on by the fun little encounter with Dickless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff stared after his retreating back, wondering how many other girls he\u0027d scared, coerced or worse. Why he was focused on her... she was a pain in his ass. Chicks were throwing themselves at his feet. Good looking, rich... ah- Pyro. Kinda attractive bad boy combo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot to her. Bad boys that beat girls\u0027 heads into lockers were on her Do Not Date list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuys that were mirror-lovers were on the list too. Besides, she had a guy she kinda liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat she\u0027d always liked. Tears burned the back of her eyelids with unshed tears. She was scared. And Tiff was pissed that he\u0027d scared her. She was not gonna be intimidated by his punk-ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sure as shit wasn\u0027t going to be caught with her head wedged up her ass again. True dat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff hesitated in the middle of the hall as the teens swirled around her, jostling her with their gear packs. She wasn\u0027t sure what to do. Her head was throbbing like a rotting tooth, but she didn\u0027t want to alert the guys (especially Bry who would have ten different kinds of cows) that her antagonism had gotten her into this fucked up bind with Hamilton. She had a guilty flash when she thought of saying anything. Nah, she\u0027d take care of it in her own way. She especially didn\u0027t want John to know. Tiff wasn\u0027t a coward who begged for a guy\u0027s protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was somehow easier not to say anything when she knew that any one of them would kill Carson if they knew. It made it easier for Tiff to be brave. She took a deep breath in the middle of the herd of moving flesh, regaining her composure through sheer grit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed a hand to her head, flinching at the tenderness. Yeah, this was an in-house deal. The group didn\u0027t need to know about it. Tiff could handle it. Besides, she\u0027d look like an ass. She flipped up the hood on her screaming pink hoodie and moved down the hallway, her pulsereader clutched in her hand, fighting nausea, her head down like a rudder cutting its path in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few meters, Tiff paused, touching a passing locker, steadying herself. She couldn\u0027t remember another time in her life when she\u0027d wanted to toss her cookies more than now. Oh yeah, when she and Caleb were working that serial killer thing with the cops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a different kind of puking, though. It was brought on by a chick beater. Look at where his wounded ego had taken him? He was such a small jerk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Randi walked up and asked if she was alright, Tiff hesitated. Randi\u0027s eyes widened at the purple knob on her brow line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe just one person could know, Tiff conceded. She\u0027d keep her yap shut, principal\u0027s kid and all. Randi would never bend the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh... yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff told her and Randi listened, her face a kaleidoscope of reactions as the story unfolded. The last one mimicked Tiff\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger with a chaser of injustice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn alliance was formed. However unlikely, the two girls became better friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecrets had a way of forging distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially confidences of the violent sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff was subdued at lunch and the general table noticed. John especially, his eyes were watching her slumped shoulders closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you get that bump?\" I asked casually, eying it up. It looked like somebody had crammed an egg under her skin like a cyclops with a coating of purple on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell yeah, Tiff, ya klutz, what\u0027s doin\u0027?\" Jonesy asked around a slurp of chocolate milk. Tiff flipped him off and he barked out a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She hit her head on the locker,\" Randi explained, pushing her gross salad around on the plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Tiff could answer for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade looked across the table at Tiff and opened her mouth to say something as Tiff looked up. \"It was a lame fall, I know,\" she said with a tight smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, like a banana peel slip?\" Jonesy said, digging around on Sophie\u0027s tray for some leftovers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Sophie slapped his hand, \"let me eat my lunch ya pig!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oink!\" Jonesy said, stabbing a tater tot off her tray with his spork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh!\" Sophie cried at his thievery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like it hurts,\" John observed quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed Tiff\u0027s lip give the slightest tremble and her eyes got shiny. \"Yeah, it hurt\u0027s like a bitch.\" She cast her eyes on her tray and pushed food around in an attempt to look like she was eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve got a level three Organic in the nurse\u0027s station today,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now let me ask why you\u0027d know that, Alex?\" Archer gave him steady gray eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to be prepared for stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"Yeah, ya never know around here what fun may erupt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh, that\u0027s right Hart. Your level of shit slides in one direction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Downhill?\" Lewis Archer asked the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy pointed his spork at him and said, \"You got it, Archer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned and Jonesy grinned like a fool. \"No offense, Hart, but you\u0027re a magnet for violent weirdness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-huh, I thought, getting peeved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as Carson Hamilton strolled up. That was never a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe balanced his foot on the bench and pegged Archer with a stare. Lewis didn\u0027t flinch at the guy who\u0027d tortured him in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind began putting together dots but that almost-realization died when Carson said, \"Hey butt-humper.\" The comment was aimed like a Bigotry Torpedo at Archer. I wonder if Carson Hamilton got the memo on what assholes bullies were?Probably not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtra asshole points for his lack of originality, it was painful to observe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher stared at him. Finally, because Lewis was way brighter than Hamilton, he said, \"How would you know, Carson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, wasn\u0027t that just clever as hell, I observed with a sick thrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Jonesy couldn\u0027t let Archer fend for himself. He was a homophobe but he didn\u0027t dig unfairness; it rubbed his fur the wrong way. And like a cat, he arched and took a swipe at Hamilton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pulse. It. In,\" Jonesy told Carson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What... ya moron, pulse what in?\" Carson asked, totally stepping into the Jonester Logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice. Move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1-800-Reach Around,\" Jonesy said, completely pleased with himself. Archer groaned, knowing that was just the tip of the homosexual iceberg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s calling ya a fag, man,\" Brody explained, having sidled up behind Carson, honing in on the potential for a violent episode like a vulture circling carrion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarson\u0027s eyes narrowed to slits as he reached for Jonesy\u0027s shirt, his knuckles grazing the big ass cast littered with colorful signatures on Jonesy\u0027s forearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t help that John had fallen off the cafeteria bench, landing in an ungainly pile on the floor, tears streaming at Carson\u0027s expense. As usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colon cowboy!\" Jonesy chortled, barking out a laugh as he neatly avoided Carson\u0027s reach. Jonesy even managed to look graceful while using his bulky cast to his own advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit,\" Tiff said in soft horrified fascination, an odd look on her face while snapping gum like machine gun fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man-wrangler,\" Archer added and Jonesy stopped in his tracks with an open mouth and stared at Lewis. So did Hamilton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis shrugged at his flagrant surprise. \"Gay guys come up with the best G, Jonesy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice, Archer,\" the Jonester said with open admiration. That cool mutual regard was shattered when the bull that was Carson charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell!\" Carson trumpeted, stalking Jonesy, \"he\u0027s fucking gay!\" He whipped an arm in Archer\u0027s direction. \"Why are you telling me what to do?\" Carson asked as he inched closer to Jonesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably because it was so much more fun, I thought, taking a sip of chocolate milk while keeping my body between Carson and Jade. Insurance was key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, man,\" Jonesy answered, pinwheeling in graceful backward arcs, \"we know he\u0027s gay... we suspect your ass...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deeply suspect,\" Alex said with a wink, then added contemplatively, \"your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Tiff said in a compulsive one word answer, keeping a safe distance as Carson\u0027s eyes rested on the third eye above her brows. She backed away further, muttering, \"What he said, Hamilton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarson got a weird smile on his face for a moment but turned his attention to Jonesy again. \"You!\" Carson bellowed, gathering his momentum and charging after Jonesy in a loose circle through the cafeteria. Jonesy swept the loose lunch trays from the cafeteria tables in a trail behind him for Carson to trip over. They clattered like plastic sleet against the floor as the gang watched Carson implode in the cafeteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chen didn\u0027t buy your victim act?\" I asked Jonesy outside. All of us were standing underneath the eaves along the perimeter of the school. They were too narrow to help much with the sheeting rain; it bounced up and nailed our shins, soaking our jeans as we stood around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNovember in Kent: hovering above freezing and raining. Unpleasant as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell no she didn\u0027t,\" he said morosely. \"I wanna know why that jag-up Hamilton always gets the free card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His dad,\" Tiff said softly, not a gum bubble in sight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unrequited-death-death-6/page-5.html","bookId":2494,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:49:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:49:25 PM"}
