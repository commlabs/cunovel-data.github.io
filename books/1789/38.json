A few minutes passed before her impatience got the better of her. She nudged her husband to get his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you forgotten me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is my assignment, Colin? What do you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rest, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d sounded incensed. Colin wouldn\u0027t let her argue with him. Caine was ready to leave. He lifted his wife off his lap and stood up. Nathan also stood and started for the door. \"Come along, Alesandra. You need a nap,\" Colin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe certainly did not need a nap, she thought to herself, and if she hadn\u0027t been so tired she would have told him so. Arguing with her husband required stamina, however, and Alesandra didn\u0027t seem to have any left. The dark discussion had taken all of her energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was smiling at her. Alesandra didn\u0027t want him to think she was a weakling, and she knew he\u0027d heard Colin insist she rest. She shoved the list into his hands. \"There are other motives I\u0027ve written down you might wish to consider,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Caine could thank her, she blurted out, \"I am a little tired, but only because Colin and I have been keeping such late hours every night. He\u0027s weary, too,\" she added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine winked at her. She didn\u0027t know what to make of that. Colin turned her attention then when he nudged her up the steps. Flannaghan saw their guests out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you treating me like an invalid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked him that question in her bedroom. Colin was unbuttoning her dress for her. \"You look worn out,\" he said. \"And I like undressing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was being terribly gentle with her. After she\u0027d been stripped down to her white silk chemise, he leaned down, lifted the hair away from the back of her neck, and kissed her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the covers back and tucked her in bed. \"I\u0027m only going to rest for a few minutes,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t dare fall asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent over the bed and kissed her brow. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I sleep now, I won\u0027t be able to sleep tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin started for the door. \"All right, sweetheart. Just rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t you like to rest too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"No. I have work to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d just pulled the door open. \"What are you sorry about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always seem to interfere in your work. I\u0027m sorry about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, started out the doorway, then changed his mind. He turned around and walked back to the side of the bed. It was ridiculous for her to apologize for interfering and he wanted to tell her so. She was his wife, after all, not some distant relative making a nuisance of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t say a word. He would have to wait until later to instruct his wife when she would listen to him. She was sound asleep now. He was a little amazed at how quickly she\u0027d fallen asleep and immediately felt a little guilty because he\u0027d kept her out every night. Damn, she looked so delicate and vulnerable to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin didn\u0027t know how long he stood there staring down at Alesandra. His mind was consumed with the need to protect her. He\u0027d never felt this possessive… or this blessed, he suddenly realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, Lord, how he loved her. The truth didn\u0027t sneak up on him and clobber him over the head, though the picture was fanciful enough to make him smile. He had known for a long time that he loved her, even though he had stubbornly refused to openly acknowledge it. God only knew he had all the symptoms of a man in love. From the moment he\u0027d met her, he\u0027d been acting terribly possessive and protective. He hadn\u0027t been able to keep his hands off her and for a long while he believed he was just consumed with a simple case of lust. After a time, he knew better. It wasn\u0027t lust at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes, he\u0027d loved her for a long time. He couldn\u0027t imagine why she loved him. Had she been awake, he might have asked her that question then and there. She certainly could have done better with someone else. Someone with a title… someone with land and inheritance… someone with a sound, healthy body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin didn\u0027t think of himself as a romantic. He was a logical, practical man who had learned that he could achieve success if he worked hard enough. In a dark corner of his mind he had harbored the thought that God had turned his back on him. It was an unreasonable belief, and it had taken root right after his leg had been nearly destroyed. He remembered hearing the physician whisper the need to amputate the limb—remembered, too, his friend\u0027s vehement refusal. Nathan wouldn\u0027t let Sir Winters touch the leg, but Colin had still been so damned afraid to sleep for fear that when he awakened he wouldn\u0027t be whole again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leg had survived, but the constant pain he now lived with made the victory hollow indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiracles were for other people, Colin had always believed—until Alesandra came into his life. His princess actually loved him. In his heart he knew there weren\u0027t any restrictions or conditions surrounding her love. Had she met a man with only one leg, she would have loved him just as much. He would have gained her sympathy, perhaps, but certainly not her pity. Her every action showed her strength and her determination to take care of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would always be there for him, nagging him and arguing with him—and loving him no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that, Colin decided, was definitely a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod hadn\u0027t forgotten him after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to leave him. Alesandra knew she wasn\u0027t being reasonable, but she was so upset inside she could barely think what to do. Nathan\u0027s casual remark about how he and Colin had both counted on Sara\u0027s inheritance to help their shipping company played on her mind until she was ready to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin, she decided, had rejected her on every level possible. He didn\u0027t want her to help him with his company books, he didn\u0027t want her inheritance, and he didn\u0027t particularly want—or need—her love. His heart seemed to be surrounded by shields, and Alesandra didn\u0027t believe she would ever be able to get him to love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she was being pitiful. She didn\u0027t care. Mother Superior\u0027s letter had arrived that morning, and Alesandra had already read the thing at least a dozen times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to go home. She was so horribly homesick for the nuns and the land, she burst into tears. It was quite all right, she decided. She was alone, after all, and Colin was working in his study with the door closed. He wouldn\u0027t hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, she wished she wasn\u0027t so emotional these days. She couldn\u0027t seem to apply logic to anything. She stood at the window in her robe and gown, looking out, and her mind was so engrossed with her worries she didn\u0027t even hear the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, sweetheart? Don\u0027t you feel well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin\u0027s voice was filled with concern. She took a deep, calming breath and turned to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been prepared for that request. He looked quite astonished. He was quick to recover. He shut the door behind him and walked toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to argue with him. She didn\u0027t. \"Yes, of course,\" she agreed. \"But I would like your permission to go back to Holy Cross for a visit. The convent is just a walk away from Stone Haven, and I would like to see my parents\u0027 home again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin walked over to her writing desk. \"What is this really all about?\" he asked her. He leaned against the edge of the table while he waited for her to answer him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I received a letter from Mother Superior today, and I\u0027m suddenly very homesick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin didn\u0027t show any outward reaction to her plea. \"I can\u0027t take the time right now to…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan and Raymond would go with me,\" she interrupted. \"I don\u0027t expect you to go along. I know how busy you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel himself getting angry. The very idea of his wife leaving on such a journey without him at her side appalled him. He stopped himself from immediately denying her request, however, because in truth he had never seen her this upset. It worried the hell out of him, given her delicate condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was out of her mind if she thought he would ever let her go anywhere without him. He didn\u0027t tell her that opinion either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to use reason to make her understand. \"Alesandra…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin, you don\u0027t need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was taken aback by that absurd comment. \"The hell I don\u0027t need you,\" he countered in a near shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. He nodded. Then she turned her back on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have never needed me,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alesandra, sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t wish to sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to talk to you about this…\" He almost said he wanted to talk to her about her \"ridiculous notion,\" but he caught himself in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored him and continued to stare out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noticed the stack of papers on her desk and suddenly knew what he was going to do. He quickly sorted through her lists until he found the one with his name on the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t paying any attention to him. He folded the sheet in half and tucked it in his pocket. Then he ordered her to sit down again. His voice was harder, more insistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took her time obeying. She mopped the tears away from her face with the backs of her hands and finally walked over to the side of the bed. She sat down, folded her hands in her lap, and bowed her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you suddenly stopped loving me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been able to keep the worry out of his voice. She was so surprised by his question, she looked up at him. \"No, of course I haven\u0027t stopped loving you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, both pleased and relieved to hear her fervent answer. Then he straightened away from the desk and walked over to stand in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t any Uncle Albert, is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe switch in topic confused her. \"What does Albert have to do with my request to go home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, this is your home,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her head again. He immediately regretted the burst of anger and took a breath to calm himself. \"Bear with me for just a moment, Alesandra, and answer my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe debated telling him the truth for a long minute. \"No, there isn\u0027t any Uncle Albert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were never any letters delivered here from the man, yet I heard you tell Caine you\u0027d received a missive. You made him up, and I think I know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t wish to talk about this. I find I\u0027m weary tonight. It\u0027s quite late, almost ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t about to let her run away from this discussion. \"You had a four-hour nap today,\" he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was catching up on my sleep,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dreyson wouldn\u0027t take stock orders from a woman, would he? So you invented Albert, a convenient recluse who just happened to have your same initials.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t going to argue with him. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded again. He clasped his hands behind his back and frowned down at her. \"You hide your intelligence, don\u0027t you, Alesandra? You obviously have a knack for the market, but instead of boasting about your cleverness with investments, you invented another man to take the credit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him so he could see her frown. \"Men listen to other men,\" she announced. \"It isn\u0027t acceptable for a woman to have such interests. It isn\u0027t considered ladylike. And it isn\u0027t a knack, Colin. I read the journals and listen to Dreyson\u0027s suggestions. It doesn\u0027t take a brilliant mind to be guided by his advice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you agree you\u0027re at least fairly intelligent and can reason most things through logically?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered where in heaven\u0027s name this discussion was leading. Her husband was acting terribly uncomfortable. She couldn\u0027t imagine why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered. \"I will agree I\u0027m fairly intelligent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why in God\u0027s name haven\u0027t you been able to reason through all the obvious facts and figure out that I love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened and she leaned back. She opened her mouth to say something to him, but she couldn\u0027t remember what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Alesandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been difficult telling her what was in his heart, yet once the words were spoken, he felt incredibly free. He smiled at his wife and said the words again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bounded off the bed and frowned up at him. \"You do not love me,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sure as hell do,\" he argued. \"If you would apply a little reason…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did use reason,\" she interrupted. \"And came to the opposite conclusion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare\u0027sweetheart\u0027 me,\" she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin reached for her but she eluded him by sitting down again. \"Oh, I reasoned it through and through and through. Shall I tell you my conclusions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t give him time to answer her. \"You have turned your back on everything I had to give you. It would be illogical for me to assume you love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve what?\" he asked, stunned by the vehemence in her voice. \"You\u0027ve rejected everything,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what have I rejected?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My title, my position, my castle, my inheritance—even my help with your company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally understood. He pulled her to her feet and wrapped his arms around her. She tried to push herself away from him. They fell onto the bed. Colin protected her from his weight as he stretched out on top of her. He pinned the lower part of her body with his thighs and braced himself on his elbows so he could look down at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair spilled out on the pillows and her eyes, cloudy with unshed tears, made her appear more vulnerable to him. Dear God, she was beautiful—even when she was glaring at him. \"I love you, Alesandra,\" he whispered. \"And I have taken everything you had to give me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to protest. He wouldn\u0027t let her. He clamped his hand over her mouth so she couldn\u0027t interrupt him. \"I rejected nothing of value. You offered me all a man could ever want. You gave me your love, your trust, your loyalty, your mind, your heart, and your body. None of those offerings is material, sweetheart, and if you lost all the financial trappings that came along with you, it wouldn\u0027t matter to me. You\u0027re all I have ever wanted. Now do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was overwhelmed by his beautiful words. His eyes were actually misty, and she knew then that it had been difficult for him to tell her how he felt. Colin did love her. She was so filled with joy, she burst into tears. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-38.html","bookId":1789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM"}
