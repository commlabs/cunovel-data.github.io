He proceeded to use his right shoulder to press down heavily on Richard. An enormous force that was manifolds greater than a tank’s not only flattened Richard into a meat paste, but even created a crater in the wall approximately three square metres in area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eNeos was at the distant end of the passageway. The wounds he had suffered before weren’t light, and even if he took advantage of the chaos to flee, he couldn’t go far. The two from team Devil’s power had far exceeded his expectations, especially in these circumstances where it was a head-on fight without schemes or arrangements put in place. That was the worst possible conclusion for him. Also, he no longer had the desire to battle, and was instead thinking constantly about a way to leave behind the information. So, he just sat there on his knees. If Richard lost, he would definitely die. He might still have some hope if Richard won, but looking at it now, he was definitely going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e(Haaaaah.

The melee combatant wasn’t anxious. He brushed off the gore on him, before slowly walking towards Neos. The meat paste had already been ignited by the high temperature caused by short circuited wires. Unexpectedly, this building that had been quiet for so long still had electricity...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Wait wait.

The so-called telekinesis is just another form of psyche force, or alternatively, it could be called the most basic form of Light of the Soul. Although it doesn’t have the form of Light of the Soul, it still does have some of its rudimentary elements. Thus, it can appear in countless forms just like Light of the Soul. In other words, it can change into other forms of energy in certain circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Oh? So?” The man smiled coldly in a disinterested manner. He was only ten steps away. Although he was walking slowly, it was only due to the perverse interest of a hunter toying with its prey. He could murder Neos within seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“My trident is a medium for controlling psyche force, and can transform it into other forms of energy… including electronic signals. That’s a form of energy too… Right, apart from telekinesis, my Three Eyes Race enhancement has another additional attribute. It accelerates the thinking process, to a maximum of ten times an ordinary person. It’s just that it’s greatly damaging to the brain.” Neos smiled slightly as he used one hand to hold the trident tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe trident kept emitting a red radiance, but he didn’t attack the melee combatant. He instead turned towards the wall behind and stabbed into it.

What were you whispering? I told you long ago! I only have power and speed, and nothing else special. However, specialising in this had instead made me stronger.

A voice sounded out from behind him before he could turn around. “Why does that sound so familiar? It’s like… I’ve said that before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe melee combatant’s entire body and froze and he didn’t dare turn around. That voice was very familiar to him. It was a voice he regularly heard in his team, that of his team leader Zheng Zha. How would dare not be familiar? But, his Zheng should be standing guard over the Seventh Underground Laboratory now. He wouldn’t say such words either. Which meant… the identity of the man behind him was obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe second strongest in God’s Realm, the original Zheng Zha!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eHe simply hadn’t noticed anyone behind! If it wasn’t something wrong with his senses, that meant the comer was way too strong, already magnitudes greater than him. Also, a horrifying pressure had assaulted his back when Zheng had spoken, as if a giant mountain was crushing him beneath it. Although his body was filled with energy now, he couldn\u0027t move a muscle. He had only ever felt such a sensation in front of clone Zheng before...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“You’re team China’s Zheng?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe man had nerves of steel, and bit down on his tongue. The pain allowed him to recover from the pressure and turn his head around. He saw a person behind him that was exactly the same as clone Zheng, minus the position of the scar. He only didn’t look as cold and terrifying as clone Zheng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“I’ve always wanted to meet you.

He didn\u0027t even have the time to react as the punch struck his right shoulder. A clear and crisp sound rang out as the punch shockingly carried unfathomable power when it shattered his resilient muscles, and he lost his right shoulder and half of his lung area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“I really don’t have the time to joke with you. Who did you just kill? What did he say. TELL ME!” Zheng looked at the man with a face filled with killing intent.

He was very confident towards his power. It was above average even in team Devil, the strongest team in the realm. The battle before had even strengthened his muscles greatly.
