{"id":107058,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Manual abort?\" Susan stared at her screen, mystified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she hadn\u0027t typed any manual abort command-at least not intentionally. She wondered if maybe she\u0027d hit the wrong sequence of keys by mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible,\" she muttered. According to the headers, the abort command had been sent less than twenty minutes ago. Susan knew the only thing she\u0027d typed in the last twenty minutes washer privacy code when she\u0027d stepped out to talk to the commander. It was absurd to think the privacy code could have been misinterpreted as an abort command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing it was a waste of time, Susan pulled up her ScreenLock log and double-checked that her privacy code had been entered properly. Sure enough, it had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then where,\" she demanded angrily, \"where did it get a manual abort?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan scowled and closed the ScreenLock window. Unexpectedly, however, in the split second as the window blipped away, something caught her eye. She reopened the window and studied the data. It made no sense. There was a proper \"locking\" entry when she\u0027d left Node 3, but the timing of the subsequent \"unlock\" entry seemed strange. The two entries were less than one minute apart. Susan was certain she\u0027d been outside with the commander for more than one minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan scrolled down the page. What she saw left her aghast. Registering three minutes later, a second set of lock-unlock entries appeared. According to the log, someone had unlocked her terminal while she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not possible!\" she choked. The only candidate was Greg Hale, and Susan was quite certain she\u0027d never given Hale her privacy code. Following good cryptographic procedure, Susan had chosen her code at random and never written it down; Hale\u0027s guessing the correct five-character alphanumeric was out of the question-it was thirty-six to the fifth power, over sixty million possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the ScreenLock entries were as clear as day. Susan stared at them in wonder. Hale had somehow been on her terminal while she was gone. He had sent her tracer a manual abort command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe questions of how quickly gave way to questions of why? Hale had no motive to break into her terminal. He didn\u0027t even know Susan was running a tracer. Even if he did know, Susan thought, why would he object to her tracking some guy named North Dakota?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unanswered questions seemed to be multiplying in her head. \"First things first,\" she said aloud. She would deal with Hale in a moment. Focusing on the matter at hand, Susan reloaded her tracer and hit the enter key. Her terminal beeped once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTRACER SENT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan knew the tracer would take hours to return. She cursed Hale, wondering how in the world he\u0027d gotten her privacy code, wondering what interest he had in her tracer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan stood up and strode immediately for Hale\u0027s terminal. The screen was black, but she could tell it was not locked-the monitor was glowing faintly around the edges. Cryptographers seldom locked their terminals except when they left Node 3 for the night. Instead, they simply dimmed the brightness on their monitors-a universal, honor-code indication that no one should disturb the terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan reached for Hale\u0027s terminal. \"Screw the honor code,\" she said. \"What the hell are you up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrowing a quick glance out at the deserted Crypto floor, Susan turned up Hale\u0027s brightness controls. The monitor came into focus, but the screen was entirely empty. Susan frowned at the blank screen. Uncertain how to proceed, she called up a search engine and typed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEARCH FOR: \"TRACER\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a long shot, but if there were any references to Susan\u0027s tracer in Hale\u0027s computer, this search would find them. It might shed some light on why Hale had manually aborted her program. Seconds later the screen refreshed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO MATCHES FOUND\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan sat a moment, unsure what she was even looking for. She tried again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEARCH FOR: \"SCREENLOCK\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitor refreshed and provided a handful of innocuous references-no hint that Hale had any copies of Susan\u0027s privacy code on his computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan sighed loudly. So what programs has he been using today? She went to Hale\u0027s \"recent applications\" menu to find the last program he had used. It was his E-mail server. Susan searched his hard drive and eventually found his E-mail folder hidden discreetly inside some other directories. She opened the folder, and additional folders appeared; it seemed Hale had numerous E-mail identities and accounts. One of them, Susan noticed with little surprise, was an anonymous account. She opened the folder, clicked one of the old, inbound messages, and read it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe instantly stopped breathing. The message read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTO:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/* \u003c![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]\u003e */\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFROM:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/* \u003c![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]\u003e */\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGREAT PROGRESS!

MUTATION STRINGS ARE THE TRICK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was unthinkable, and yet there it was. E-mail from Ensei Tankado. He had been writing to Greg Hale. They were working together. Susan went numb as the impossible truth stared up at her from the terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreg Hale is NDAKOTA?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan\u0027s eyes locked on the screen. Her mind searched desperately for some other explanation, but there was none. It was proof-sudden and inescapable: Tankado had used mutation strings to create a rotating cleartext function, and Hale had conspired with him to bring down the NSA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s...\" Susan stammered. \"It\u0027s... not possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to disagree, Hale\u0027s voice echoed from the past: Tankado wrote me a few times... Strathmore took a gamble hiring me... I\u0027m getting out of here someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Susan could not accept what she was seeing. True, Greg Hale was obnoxious and arrogant-but he wasn\u0027t a traitor. He knew what Digital Fortress would do to the NSA; there was no way he was involved in a plot to release it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, Susan realized, there was nothing to stop him-nothing except honor and decency. She thought of the Skipjack algorithm. Greg Hale had ruined the NSA\u0027s plans once before. What would prevent him from trying again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Tankado...\" Susan puzzled. Why would someone as paranoid as Tankado trust someone as unreliable as Hale?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that none of it mattered now. All that mattered was getting to Strathmore. By some ironic stroke of fate, Tankado\u0027s partner was right there under their noses. She wondered if Hale knew yet that Ensei Tankado was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quickly began closing Hale\u0027s E-mail files in order to leave the terminal exactly as she had found it. Hale could suspect nothing-not yet. The Digital Fortress pass-key, she realized in amazement, was probably hidden somewhere inside that very computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as Susan closed the last of the files, a shadow passed outside the Node 3 window. Her gaze shot up, and she saw Greg Hale approaching. Her adrenaline surged. He was almost to the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn!\" she cursed, eyeing the distance back to her seat. She knew she\u0027d never make it. Hale was almost there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wheeled desperately, searching Node 3 for options. The doors behind her clicked. Then they engaged. Susan felt instinct takeover. Digging her shoes into the carpet, she accelerated in long, reaching strides toward the pantry. As the doors hissed open, Susan slid to a stop in front of the refrigerator and yanked open the door. A glass pitcher on top tipped precariously and then rocked to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hungry?\" Hale asked, entering Node 3 and walking toward her. His voice was calm and flirtatious. \"Want to share some tofu?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan exhaled and turned to face him. \"No thanks,\" she offered. \"I think I\u0027ll just-\" But the words got caught in her throat. She went white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHale eyed her oddly. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan bit her lip and locked eyes with him. \"Nothing, \"she managed. But it was a lie. Across the room, Hale\u0027s terminal glowed brightly. She\u0027d forgotten to dim it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-37.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM"}
