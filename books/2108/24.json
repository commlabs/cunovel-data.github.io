{"id":91573,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\u003cp\u003eBetween a Dwarf And a Hard Place\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the shadows of the trees, Ivan and Pikel hardly had trouble finding enemies. Goblins and orcs popped up from the undergrowth all about them, drooling and hungry for battle. True to their dwarven heritage, the Bouldershoulder brothers promptly went berserk, clubbing and slicing, and though they had been fighting steadily for many minutes, neither showed any signs of weariness. Goblins flew every which way, launched by Pikel\u0027s heavy club, and Ivan, with a mighty overhead chop, sliced one orc nearly in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough all the fury of that initial skirmish, Danica rested back behind the brothers, gathering her energy for when she would inevitably be needed. Cadderly dominated the young woman\u0027s thoughts in that lull. Danica had found no time before this to consider where the young scholar might be and she feared that he had met a gruesome end. Her duty was clear to her, though, and she would not sway from it. This time, unlike any other, Danica had to trust in Cadderly to take care of himself, had to focus on the desperate battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how many times Danica reminded herself of that fact, her heart longed to find Cadderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last orc\u0027s head flew off into the bushes. In the respite, Ivan turned about and noticed the despair in Danica\u0027s almond eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ye worry, lass,\" the dwarf comforted. \"We\u0027ll save ye a few in the next fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica\u0027s face crinkled at the words, revealing to the dwarf that he had misjudged the source of her sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s yer Cadderly, then,\" Ivan guessed, remembering the young scholar himself. \"Where\u0027d that one get himself off to, anyhow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I left him,\" Danica admitted, looking back over her shoulder to the west, toward Syldritch Trea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boulder plummeted through the tree branches, narrowly missing the three companions. In response, one arrow after another flew out from the side, zipping back in the direction of the berry bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giant!\" Shayleigh called, appearing from her hiding spot and stringing yet another arrow. \"I have hit it three times, but still it comes on!\" She drew back and fired, and the companions watched the arrow fly through the leafy tangle to thud into what seemed like a moving mountain. Another huge form shifted beside the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two giants!\" Ivan bellowed hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica grabbed him, and Pikel, as they started past her on their way to the newest foes. \"No doubt with a host of escorts beside them,\" the fiery young woman explained. \"Do not be so foolish,\" she scolded. \"You are much to valuable to us to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Pikel replied rather sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShayleigh popped another arrow into the approaching monsters, then caught up with Danica and the dwarves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must be gone quickly,\" Shayleigh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You three go on,\" Danica bade them. \"I will search for Cadderly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The priest is with Tintagel,\" Shayleigh replied. \"Fear not, for if any can keep him safe in the fight, it is the wizard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe news did brighten Danica\u0027s mood. Knowing that Cadderly was beside one as seasoned and wise as Tintagel eased her fears that her love had been abandoned to make his way alone in this forest of horrors. \"The four of us, then,\" Danica offered determinedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oo oi!\" was Pikel\u0027s reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woe to any monsters that cross our path!\" Shayleigh vowed. She spun about and launched another arrow at the mass of approaching giants, just for good luck, and together the fighting foursome sprinted off into the shadows, formulating plans as they went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout his shield, Elbereth could only grasp his sword hilt in both hands to deflect Ragnor\u0027s mighty blows. The ogrillon was finished with his defensive tactics now, determined to end this fight and move on to new battles. He cut a two-handed swipe straight across at Elbereth\u0027s chest, stepping into the blow so that the elf could not back away and would have to use his sword to parry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth\u0027s weapon rang loudly under the force of the blow, vibrating for many moments. Elbereth\u0027s arms went numb, and he had to struggle just to hold his grip on the sword. Ragnor launched a second strike, identical to the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth knew that to similarly block this blow would tear the sword from his hands. He threw himself straight back instead, tumbling to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRagnor attacked furiously, thinking that the fight was won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth\u0027s agility and speed crossed the ogrillon up, though, for the elf suddenly twisted about and whipped his sword across, swift and low, stinging Ragnor\u0027s shins and abruptly halting the ogrillon\u0027s charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth was back up again, wary and keeping his distance as Ragnor, spitting curses and limping only slightly, steadily advanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly groaned and forced himself up to his elbows, knowing that he, and especially Elbereth, could not afford any delays. The young scholar had landed hard from Ragnor\u0027s throw, and had lost his breath in the tumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked now at Elbereth, weary and sorely outmatched, and knew that Ragnor would soon win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to the fight,\" Cadderly vowed, but he didn\u0027t even manage to get to his feet before he felt the wetness along the back of his neck. Thinking it blood, Cadderly put a hand over it and scrambled to remove his pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that the moisture came from his pack, not his own body, but then he nearly swooned when he realized the only possible source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, carefully, the young scholar untied and opened the pack and removed the cracked flask. He shuddered to think of what might have happened if his landing had shattered, and not just cracked, the container of volatile Oil of Impact. He looked up to the high branches of the beech trees and imagined himself hanging up there, twisted and broken from the horrendous blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly glanced suddenly at Ragnor, then back to the flask. A wicked smile found its way across his face. He carefully removed the top half of the cracked container, then scooped his spindle-disks inside, cupping his hand to get as much of the remaining liquid as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Elbereth\u0027s back went against a tree, both the elf and the ogrillon realized that the running game had ended. Bravely, Elbereth launched a series of vicious thrusts, a few getting through to poke at Ragnor, but none solidly enough to keep the huge monster at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth barely ducked in time as the ogrillon\u0027s sword smashed in, chopping a sizable chunk from the tree. Elbereth managed yet another hit as Ragnor tore his blade free. The ogrillon winced and swung again, this time shortening up on his stroke so that he would connect on the elf, or on nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blade flew freely as Elbereth dove to the ground, the overmatched elf\u0027s only retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now it is done!\" Ragnor proclaimed, and Elbereth, cornered and on the ground, could hardly argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRagnor saw Cadderly coming in fast from the side, the young scholar\u0027s arm cocked and the curious (and useless) weapon readied for a throw. The ogrillon, sword high for a killing strike, paid the young scholar no heed, didn\u0027t even lower one arm to block the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly growled and threw all of his weight and strength into the throw. The spindle-disks slammed against the side of Ragnor\u0027s barrellike chest, and the force of the explosion spun the ogrillon about to face Cadderly squarely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Cadderly thought that Ragnor was running backward, away from him, but then the young scholar realized that Ragnor\u0027s feet, pumping helplessly, were several inches off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRagnor\u0027s arms and legs continued to flail wildly as the ogrillon tried to slow his flight. A branch bent then cracked behind him, and he came to a sudden stop, impaled through the backbone against the tree. Ragnor hung there, a foot from the ground, a scorched hole in one side of his furry leather tunic (and in the skin underneath), and his legs lifeless below him. He felt no pain in those lower limbs, felt nothing at all. He tried to plant his feet against the tree, that he might push himself free, but alas, his legs would not heed his call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned beyond words, Cadderly looked down to his weapon hand. There hung the cord, shortened by half and its end blackened. Of the rock crystal disks, there was nothing to be found except a single scorched flake on the ground where Ragnor had been standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly amazed, Elbereth rose to his feet. He looked at Cadderly curiously for a moment, then took up his sword and stomped over to Ragnor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world was a blur to the burly leader of the invading forces. Ragnor had to forcibly thrust out his chest just to draw breath. Still, the stubborn creature had held fast to his sword, and he managed to raise it in a semblance of defense against Elbereth\u0027s determined approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth swatted the blade once, then again, driving it aside. The elf\u0027s sword slashed across the ogrillon\u0027s eyes, blinding Ragnor. Wisely, Elbereth stepped back as Ragnor\u0027s fury played itself out in a series of vicious cuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly thought Ragnor a pitiful thing as the blinded ogrillon continued to slice wildly at the empty air. Ragnor began to tire, and Cadderly looked away as Elbereth stepped back in. He heard a growl, then a groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he looked back, Elbereth was wiping his crimson-stained blade and Ragnor hung near death, one hand twitching pitifully at the hole Elbereth had cut through his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid things,\" Ivan whispered, looking ahead across a small clearing to the group of mixed monsters. The dwarf and his three companions had easily backtracked to get behind the two giants, several orogs, and numerous goblins that had been pursuing them. One of the giant\u0027s movements appeared strained, the creature having caught several of Shayleigh\u0027s arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring them in,\" Ivan said with a wink to the elf maiden. He and Pikel slipped out of the tree line into the thick and deep grass of the lea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShayleigh looked to Danica. The elf was not timid by anyone\u0027s standards, but this group of monsters seemed a bit too powerful for the small band to handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica, similarly concerned but better understanding the dwarves\u0027 prowess, nodded grimly and motioned for Shayleigh to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShayleigh raised her great bow and took aim for the already wounded giant. She put a second and third arrow into the air before the first ever struck the mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first hit the giant at the base of its thick neck. The monster howled and grasped at the quivering shaft, and the second arrow whipped in beside the first, pinning the giant\u0027s hand in place. By the time the third arrow hit, just below the first two, the giant was on its way down. It fell to its knees and held unsteadily there for a few moments, then dropped into the grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the monstrous band let out a common shout of outrage and spun about, charging wildly back across the lea. Shayleigh promptly dropped one ferocious orog, putting an arrow between its bulbous eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take to the trees,\" Danica instructed her. \"Shoot for the lesser monsters. Be confident that the dwarves have a plan in mind for the giant.\" Shayleigh looked to the grass where Ivan and Pikel had disappeared, then she smiled, surprised to learn that she, too, had come to trust a couple of dwarves. With agility befitting an elf, Shayleigh found a handhold and pulled herself into the branches of the nearest tree with remarkable ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith its great strides, the remaining giant came ahead of its smaller companions. It heaved a boulder Danica\u0027s way, and the nimble monk barely dodged it as the rock took down a small sapling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arrow from above cut down a goblin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica looked up and winked her appreciation to Shayleigh. Then, to the elf maiden\u0027s amazement, Danica stormed ahead, right at the approaching giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the lumbering creature raised its huge club, Danica whipped her two already bloodied daggers into its face. The giant roared in outrage, dropped its club, and grabbed at the stuck weapons. Danica veered, smiling as Ivan and Pikel popped up from the grass, hacking and bashing at the monster\u0027s thick legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe confused giant didn\u0027t know which way to turn. Ivan chopped at one of its legs, cutting out wedges as though he were felling a tree, but the pain in the monster\u0027s face demanded its attention. Finally, the giant mustered the courage to tear out one of the stubborn daggers, but by then it was too late for the leg, and the creature toppled to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan rushed past the monster toward the oncoming orogs; Pikel headed for the giant\u0027s head to finish the job. The giant got a hand on Pikel as he neared its face, and started to squeeze. Pikel wasn\u0027t overly concerned, though, for he was close enough for a strike and Danica\u0027s remaining dagger, deep in the monster\u0027s cheek, offered a positively marvelous target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Danica broke to the side, so, too, did a group of three orogs. Danica continued to veer, allowing the monsters to stay close enough so that they would not give up the chase. Soon, the monk had nearly completed a full circuit, heading back for the same trees she had just exited. Orog swords nipped at her heels, but Danica was confident that she could keep just ahead of the stupid things. She heard a yowl of pain and surprise behind her, and a gasp after that, and knew that Shayleigh had begun her work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica dove headlong, twisting as she rolled, to come up facing the charging orogs. The closest beast, glancing back at its companion, who had taken two arrows, turned back just in time to catch Danica\u0027s fist on the chin. A sickening crack resounded above the din of battle, and the orog\u0027s jaw broke apart. When the creature at last settled on the ground, the bottom half of its jaw was aligned more with its left ear than with the upper half of its mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining orog immediately spun about and took flight. It managed to get a few strides away before Shayleigh\u0027s next arrow pierced its thigh, slowing it enough for Danica to rush up and bury it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan waded into the horde of goblins and orogs with typical dwarven finesse. The dwarf butted with his horned helmet, bit where he could, kicked with both feet, and generally whipped his axe to and fro with such ferocity that the entire band of monsters had to give ground steadily. Those that could not retreat, caught between the dwarf and their own companions, most often hit the ground at about the same time as their severed extremities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe downside to Ivan\u0027s tactics, in addition to the weariness that inevitably would accompany such a wild display, was that Ivan was all but blind to the events around him. And so the dwarf was off his guard as one orog managed to slip in behind his tirade. The creature, timing its attack between axe swipes so as not to get caught in a follow-through, stepped right up to the dwarf and let loose a wicked downward cut with its heavy club that Ivan couldn\u0027t begin to dodge or deflect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yuck,\" Pikel remarked as soon as he realized that his head-bashing had become rather redundant. The giant\u0027s grip had become quite relaxed by that point, and Pikel stepped purposely away from the gruesome thing that had once been the creature\u0027s head. The dwarf considered retrieving Danica\u0027s dagger, which was buried in giant flesh with the tip of its point poking out the other side of the huge head, but Pikel quickly decided that if Danica wanted it back, she would have to get it herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat business done, Pikel crawled over the giant\u0027s chest to join his brother, and let out a squeaky warning just as the orog\u0027s club descended on Ivan\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye called?\" Ivan replied, then he added, \"Ouch!\" almost as an afterthought. He spun about to clobber the orog, but kept on spinning, around and around, finding no bearings until his cheek came to rest on the cool grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orog howled in victory, a cry of glee cut short by Shayleigh\u0027s next arrow and even more so by Pikel\u0027s fury. The dwarf imitated the orog\u0027s own tactics, but while the orog\u0027s clubbing had sent Ivan in a spin, Pikel\u0027s bash dropped the monster straight down in a heap, weirdly, with its legs straight out to the sides and its head lolling about on a useless neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel wanted to hit the thing again, and again after that, but he had no time, for the remaining monsters had descended over helpless Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooooo!\" the dwarf bellowed, following yet another arrow into the throng. Goblins flew every which way even powerful orogs prudently leaped aside and in mere moments, Pikel straddled Ivan\u0027s prone form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica hit the group from the side a moment later, with equal fury; Shayleigh dropped another orog, sinking an arrow right through its eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monsters broke ranks and scattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel remained defensively over his brother while Danica took up the pursuit, tackling an orog and rolling over it in the grass. Shayleigh fired off several shots, but realized to her dismay that she could not down all of the monsters before they found the safety of the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monsters\u0027 hoots of relief as they made the tree line were short-lived indeed, though, for out of those same shadows came a host of elves. In a few seconds, not a goblin or orog remained alive on that blood-soaked field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly stood staring as Elbereth came over to join him. The world had gone crazy, Cadderly decided, and he had been fully caught up in that insanity. Just a few weeks before, the young scholar had known nothing but peace and security, had never even seen a living monster. But everything was upside down now, with Cadderly almost by accident playing the role of hero and with monsters, so many monsters, suddenly very real in the young scholar\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world had gone crazy, and Elbereth\u0027s forthcoming congratulations, the mighty elf\u0027s thanks for a blow that had defeated a monster beyond innocent Cadderly\u0027s wildest nightmares, only confirmed the young scholar\u0027s suspicions. Imagine, Cadderly winning where Elbereth could not, where King Galladel, lying dead at their feet, could not!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no pride in the young scholar\u0027s thoughts, just blank amazement. What cruel trick fate had played him, to drop him so terribly unprepared into such a role, and into such chaos. Was this what Deneir had in store for him? If so, did Cadderly really want to remain his disciple?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth\u0027s startled look turned the young scholar about. Ragnor\u0027s remaining elite guard, half a dozen mighty bugbears wielding tridents dripping with a substance the two companions could only assume was poison, charged at the two, not so far away, certainly not far enough for Cadderly to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so we die,\" he heard Elbereth mutter as the elf lifted his stained sword, and the young scholar, weaponless and weary, had no words to deny the proclamation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blast of lightning abruptly ended the threat. Four of the bugbears died on the spot; the other two rolled about in the dirt, scorched and crippled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly looked to the side, to Tintagel, bravely propped against a tree, wearing a smile only occasionally diminished by throbs of pain. Cadderly and Elbereth ran to their friend. Elbereth started to tend the wound, but Cadderly shoved the elf aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you, Deneir, if you do not help me now!\" the young scholar growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take someone knowledgeable in the healing arts to see that Tintagel\u0027s wound would soon prove fatal. Where the elf had found the strength and presence of mind to release the magical strike, Cadderly would never guess, but he knew that such courage could not be a prelude to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot if he had anything to say about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth put a hand on his shoulder, but Cadderly muttered and slapped it away. The young scholar grasped the spear shaft, still deep in Tintagel\u0027s side. He looked up to the blue-eyed elf, who understood and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly tore the spear out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood gushed from the wound Cadderly\u0027s fingers could not begin to hold it in and Tintagel swooned and stumbled to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold him steady!\" Cadderly cried, and Elbereth, a helpless observer in the spectacle, did as he was told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly futilely slapped at the pouring blood, actually held in Tintagel\u0027s spilling guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deneir!\" the young priest cried, more in rage than reverence. \"Deneir!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something marvelous happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly felt the power surge through him, though he did not understand it and hardly expected it. It came on the notes of a distant, melodious song. Too surprised to react, the young priest simply hung on desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched in amazement as Tintagel\u0027s wound began to mend. The blood flow lessened, then stopped altogether; Cadderly\u0027s hands were forced aside by the magically binding skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute passed, then another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get me to the fight,\" a rejuvenated Tintagel bade them. Elbereth threw a hug on his elven friend; Cadderly fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world had gone crazy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-in-sylvan-shadows-the-cleric-quintet-2/page-24.html","bookId":2108,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:36 PM"}
