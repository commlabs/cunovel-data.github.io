I lay awake all night, trying to make sense of it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy I was in love with was really a vampire? Would I spend eternity as a cool ghoul?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t react to this development in the way I\u0027d always dreamed. I didn\u0027t pick up the phone to call CNN. In fact, the whole ride home with Becky I didn\u0027t say a word, only stared out the window in disbelief as she flirted with Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt home I locked myself in my bedroom. I scoured my vampire books for answers but found none. I rehearsed telling him that I loved him, no matter who or what he was. That his secret was safe with me. But was I prepared to leave everything I knew? Trade my world for his? Leave my parents? Becky? Even Billy Boy? I stared at my reflection in the full-length mirror, as if for the last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the next day at the cemetery, pacing in front of the baroness\u0027s monument. As soon as the sun set behind the trees, I took off for the Mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came around the hill, I noticed the gate was locked. I scaled the fence to find the Mansion even more eerie and lonely than usual. The Mercedes was gone and the lights were off. I rang the bell, over and over. I rapped on the serpent knocker. No one answered. I peered through the living room window. White sheets were draped over the furniture. I ran around back and pressed my nose against the basement window. I couldn\u0027t breathe. The crates of earth were no longer there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sank. I couldn\u0027t swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for the loose brick I had formerly used to sneak in. But when I pulled on it, an envelope with my name written across it in large letters fell out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced to the front gate and held the letter under the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw my name clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out a black card. In blood-red letters were four simple words: BECAUSE I LOVE YOU. I caressed the words with my fingertips and held the letter to my heart. Tears fell from my face as I wearily slunk against the Mansion gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a stake shoved into my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirds chirped overhead and I looked up to see them hovering over the trees. One swooped down and landed above me on the iron gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts wings remained solemnly still as it fixed its gaze upon me. Its shadow prominent on the pavement, its breath in time with mine. Bats are blind, but this one seemed to be staring right into my soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly reached for it. \"Alexander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it flew away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-kisses-vampire-kisses-1/page-22.html","bookId":2137,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:52 PM"}
