Do you need my help with your hair? Or your shoes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am about to refuse, but I really do need help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit down on a stool in front of the mirror, and she stands behind me, her eyes dutifully trained on the task at hand rather than her reflection. They do not lift, not even for an instant, as she runs a comb through my hair. And she doesn’t ask about my shoulder, how I was shot, what happened when I left the Abnegation safe house to stop the simulation. I get the sense that if I were to whittle her down to her core, she would be Abnegation all the way through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you seen Robert yet?” I say. Her brother, Robert, chose Amity when I chose Dauntless, so he is somewhere in this compound. I wonder if their reunion will be anything like Caleb’s and mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Briefly, last night,” she says. “I left him to grieve with his faction as I grieve with mine. It is nice to see him again, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a finality in her tone that tells me the subject is closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a shame this happened when it did,” Susan says. “Our leaders were about to do something wonderful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” Susan blushes. “I just knew that something was happening. I didn’t mean to be curious; I just noticed things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t blame you for being curious even if you had been.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and keeps combing. I wonder what the Abnegation leaders—including my father—were doing. And I can’t help but marvel at Susan’s assumption that whatever they were doing was wonderful. I wish I could believe that of people again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I ever did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Dauntless wear their hair down, right?” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes,” I say. “Do you know how to braid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo her deft fingers tuck pieces of my hair into one braid that tickles the middle of my spine. I stare hard at my reflection until she finishes. I thank her when she’s done, and she leaves with a small smile, closing the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep staring, but I don’t see myself. I can still feel her fingers brushing the back of my neck, so much like my mother’s fingers, the last morning I spent with her. My eyes wet with tears, I rock back and forth on the stool, trying to push the memory from my mind. I am afraid that if I start to sob, I will never stop until I shrivel up like a raisin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see a sewing kit on the dresser. In it are two colors of thread, red and yellow, and a pair of scissors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel calm as I undo the braid in my hair and comb it again. I part my hair down the middle and make sure that it is straight and flat. I close the scissors over the hair by my chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can I look the same, when she’s gone and everything is different? I can’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut in as straight a line as I can, using my jaw as a guide. The tricky part is the back, which I can’t see very well, so I do the best I can by touch instead of sight. Locks of blond hair surround me on the floor in a semicircle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave the room without looking at my reflection again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tobias and Caleb come to get me later, they stare at me like I am not the person they knew yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You cut your hair,” says Caleb, his eyebrows high. Grabbing hold of facts in the midst of shock is very Erudite of him. His hair sticks up on one side from where he slept on it, and his eyes are bloodshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I say. “It’s . . . too hot for long hair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fair enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk down the hallway together. The floorboards creak beneath our feet. I miss the way my footsteps echoed in the Dauntless compound; I miss the cool underground air. But mostly I miss the fears of the past few weeks, rendered small by my fears now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe exit the building. The outside air presses around me like a pillow meant to suffocate me. It smells green, the way a leaf does when you tear it in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does everyone know you’re Marcus’s son?” Caleb says. “The Abnegation, I mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not to my knowledge,” says Tobias, glancing at Caleb. “And I would appreciate it if you didn’t mention it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t need to mention it. Anyone with eyes can see it for themselves.” Caleb frowns at him. “How old are you, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eighteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you don’t think you’re too old to be with my little sister?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias lets out a short laugh. “She isn’t your little anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop it. Both of you,” I say. A crowd of people in yellow walks ahead of us, toward a wide, squat building made entirely of glass. The sunlight reflecting off the panes feels like a pinch to my eyes. I shield my face with my hand and keep walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors to the building are wide open. Around the edge of the circular greenhouse, plants and trees grow in troughs of water or small pools. Dozens of fans positioned around the room serve only to blow the hot air around, so I am already sweating. But that fades from my mind when the crowd before me thins and I see the rest of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn its center grows a huge tree. Its branches are spread over most of the greenhouse, and its roots bubble up from the ground, forming a dense web of bark. In the spaces between the roots, I see not dirt but water, and metal rods holding the roots in place. I should not be surprised—the Amity spend their lives accomplishing feats of agriculture like this one, with the help of Erudite technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding on a cluster of roots is Johanna Reyes, her hair falling over the scarred half of her face. I learned in Faction History that the Amity recognize no official leader—they vote on everything, and the result is usually close to unanimous. They are like many parts of a single mind, and Johanna is their mouthpiece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Amity sit on the floor, most with their legs crossed, in knots and clusters that vaguely resemble the tree roots to me. The Abnegation sit in tight rows a few yards to my left. My eyes search the crowd for a few seconds before I realize what I’m looking for: my parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard, and try to forget. Tobias touches the small of my back, guiding me to the edge of the meeting space, behind the Abnegation. Before we sit down, he puts his mouth next to my ear and says, “I like your hair that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find a small smile to give him, and lean into him when I sit down, my arm against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna lifts her hands and bows her head. All conversation in the room ceases before I can draw my next breath. All around me the Amity sit in silence, some with their eyes closed, some with their lips mouthing words I can’t hear, some staring at a point far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery second chafes. By the time Johanna lifts her head I am worn to the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have before us today an urgent question,” she says, “which is: How will we conduct ourselves in this time of conflict as people who pursue peace?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery Amity in the room turns to the person next to him or her and starts talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do they get anything done?” I say, as the minutes of chatter wear on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They don’t care about efficiency,” Tobias says. “They care about agreement. Watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo women in yellow dresses a few feet away rise and join a trio of men. A young man shifts so that his small circle becomes a large one with the group next to him. All around the room, the smaller crowds grow and expand, and fewer and fewer voices fill the room, until there are only three or four. I can only hear pieces of what they say: “Peace—Dauntless—Erudite—safe house—involvement—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is bizarre,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s beautiful,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” He laughs a little. “They each have an equal role in government; they each feel equally responsible. And it makes them care; it makes them kind. I think that’s beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s unsustainable,” I say. “Sure, it works for the Amity. But what happens when not everyone wants to strum banjos and grow crops? What happens when someone does something terrible and talking about it can’t solve the problem?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. “I guess we’ll find out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually someone from each of the big groups stands and approaches Johanna, picking their way carefully over the roots of the big tree. I expect them to address the rest of us, but instead they stand in a circle with Johanna and the other spokespeople and talk quietly. I begin to get the feeling that I will never know what they’re saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re not going to let us argue with them, are they,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I doubt it,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are done for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen everyone has said his or her piece, they sit down again, leaving Johanna alone in the center of the room. She angles her body toward us and folds her hands in front of her. Where will we go when they tell us to leave? Back into the city, where nothing is safe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our faction has had a close relationship with Erudite for as long as any of us can remember. We need each other to survive, and we have always cooperated with each other,” says Johanna. “But we have also had a strong relationship with Abnegation in the past, and we do not think it is right to revoke the hand of friendship when it has for so long been extended.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice is honey-sweet, and moves like honey too, slow and careful. I wipe the sweat from my hairline with the back of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We feel that the only way to preserve our relationships with both factions is to remain impartial and uninvolved,” she continues. “Your presence here, though welcome, complicates that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere it comes, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have arrived at the conclusion that we will establish our faction headquarters as a safe house for members of all factions,” she says, “under a set of conditions. The first is that no weaponry of any kind is allowed on the compound. The second is that if any serious conflict arises, whether verbal or physical, all involved parties will be asked to leave. The third is that the conflict may not be discussed, even privately, within the confines of this compound. And the fourth is that everyone who stays here must contribute to the welfare of this environment by working. We will report this to Erudite, Candor, and Dauntless as soon as we can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer stare drifts to Tobias and me, and stays there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are welcome to stay here if and only if you can abide by our rules,” she says. “That is our decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of the gun I hid under my mattress, and the tension between me and Peter, and Tobias and Marcus, and my mouth feels dry. I am not good at avoiding conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We won’t be able to stay long,” I say to Tobias under my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment ago, he was still faintly smiling. Now the corners of his mouth have disappeared into a frown. “No, we won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT EVENING I return to my room and slide my hand beneath my mattress to make sure the gun is still there. My fingers brush over the trigger, and my throat tightens like I am having an allergic reaction. I withdraw my hand and kneel on the edge of the bed, taking hard swallows of air until the feeling subsides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is wrong with you? I shake my head. Pull it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that is what it feels like: pulling the different parts of me up and in like a shoelace. I feel suffocated, but at least I feel strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see a flicker of movement in my periphery, and look out the window that faces the apple orchard. Johanna Reyes and Marcus Eaton walk side by side, pausing at the herb garden to pluck mint leaves from their stems. I am out of my room before I can evaluate why I want to follow them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprint through the building so that I don’t lose them. Once I am outside, I have to be more careful. I walk around the far side of the greenhouse and, after I see Johanna and Marcus disappear into one row of trees, I creep down the next row, hoping the branches will hide me if either of them looks back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . . been confused about is the timing of the attack,” says Johanna. “Is it just that Jeanine finally finished planning it, and acted, or was there an inciting incident of some kind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Marcus’s face through a divided tree trunk. He presses his lips together and says, “Hmm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose we’ll never know.” Johanna raises her good eyebrow. “Will we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, perhaps not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna places her hand on his arm and turns toward him. I stiffen, afraid for a moment that she will see me, but she looks only at Marcus. I sink into a crouch and crawl toward one of the trees so that the trunk will hide me. The bark itches my spine, but I don’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you do know,” she says. “You know why she attacked when she did. I may not be Candor anymore, but I can still tell when someone is keeping the truth from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Inquisitiveness is self-serving, Johanna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were Johanna, I would snap at him for a comment like that, but she says kindly, “My faction depends on me to advise them, and if you know information this crucial, it is important that I know it also so that I can share it with them. I’m sure you can understand that, Marcus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a reason you don’t know all the things I know. A long time ago, the Abnegation were entrusted with some sensitive information,” says Marcus. “Jeanine attacked us to steal it. And if I am not careful, she will destroy it, so that is all I can tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But surely—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Marcus cuts her off. “This information is far more important than you can imagine. Most of the leaders of this city risked their lives to protect it from Jeanine and died, and I will not jeopardize it now for the sake of sating your selfish curiosity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna is quiet for a few seconds. It’s so dark now I can barely see my own hands. The air smells like dirt and apples, and I try not to breathe it too loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” says Johanna. “I must have done something to make you believe I am not trustworthy.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurgent-divergent-2/page-2.html","bookId":1699,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM"}
