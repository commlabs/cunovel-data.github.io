The Lord tried him by delaying to fulfill His promise. Satan tried him by temptation; men tried him by jealousy, distrust, and opposition; Sarah tried him by her peevishness. But he patiently endured. He did not question God\u0027s veracity, nor limit His power, nor doubt His faithfulness, nor grieve His love; but he bowed to Divine Sovereignty, submitted to Infinite Wisdom, and was silent under delays, waiting the Lord\u0027s time. And so, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGod\u0027s promises cannot fail of their accomplishment. Patient waiters cannot be disappointed. Believing expectation shall be realized. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBeloved, Abraham\u0027s conduct condemns a hasty spirit, reproves a murmuring one, commends a patient one, and encourages quiet submission to God\u0027s will and way. Remember, Abraham was tried; he patiently waited; he received the promise, and was satisfied. Imitate his example, and you will share the same blessing.—Selected \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e九月十一日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「这样，亚伯拉罕既恒久忍耐，就得了所应许的。」（来六15）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e读者，亚伯拉罕所受的试验极久，但是他所得到的酬报却极厚。神用迁延应许的方法试验他，撒但用诱惑试验他；世人用嫉妒、怀疑、反对、；试验他撒拉用乖戾的性情试验他。但是他却恒久忍耐。他并不质问神的诚实，也不限制神的权力；他不怀疑神的信实，也不伤忧神的慈心；但向神圣的君王俯伏、绝对信任祂的智慧。虽然神迁延日久，他却并不作声，只安安心心地等待神的时候。这样，他既恒久忍耐，就得了所应许的。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e神的应许，是不能不完成的。忍耐的等候者，是不能失望的。信心的盼望，终必实现。亲爱的，亚伯拉罕的德行，眞叫急躁的人受羞愧，叫出怨言的人受谴责，叫忍耐的人得揄扬，叫安心顺服神旨的人得鼓励。请你记得，亚伯拉罕曾受过试验，曾恒久等候，曾得了所应许的，而心满意足了。你当效法他的榜样，这样，你将要享受到同样的祝福。－－选\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5402.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:48:21 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:48:21 AM"}
