Annie, please, there’s no need to raise your voice.” He glanced nervously around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeething on the inside, Annie closed her eyes in an effort to control her raging emotions. “I can’t believe this is happening,” she finally muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know it’s a shock and everything,” Vance responded, sounding calm now, “but I brought you here because I wanted our goodbye dinner to be special.” After what was obviously meant to be a significant pause, he said, “I feel our love is strong enough to wait a year, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t answer right away. She could barely take in that he didn’t have an engagement ring in his pocket, let alone the fact that he planned to travel in Europe with his friend and another woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You went to University Jewelers,” she mumbled. She’d assumed that meant he was going to propose. She’d assumed—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did?” He frowned and then relaxed. “Oh, yeah. My mom asked me to drop off her watch for repair. It was still under warranty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie wadded up the linen napkin on her lap. “When do you leave?” She would be adult about this. Okay, fine, he wasn’t asking her to marry him. Instead, he wanted her to twiddle her thumbs for a year while he explored Europe with Matt and Jessie Olivarez. Jessie Olivarez!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually…the three of us are flying out tomorrow night. Do you think you could drop us off at the airport?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was out of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Matt’s father was going to do it, but he forget and made other plans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want me to drive you and another girl to the airport?” The insensitive jerk!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you could. It’d be a big help and that way you can see me off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d see him off, all right. “I don’t think so,” she said, then leaned down and reached for her purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re upset, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly Vance had talents she never knew. Now he was a mind reader as well as a jerk. “What was your first clue?” she asked sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you said there wasn’t anything we couldn’t discuss! Come on, Annie, it’s only a year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s more than the fact that you’re going to Europe, Vance. You’ve been planning this for a long time. Didn’t you even think to mention it to me?” By his own admission, this trip had been in the works for months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did look slightly guilty. “I wanted to tell you, but Matt said it would just cause problems. I can see he was right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie stood and threw her napkin on the table. “Have a great time, and when you get back, don’t bother to call. We’re done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annie,” he cried, “you don’t mean that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wanna bet?” They had the attention of half the restaurant. The entire room seemed to go quiet. Not wanting to be the subject of anyone’s dinner conversation, Annie ran toward the elevator. A line had formed, waiting to be taken down to street level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVance hurried after her. “I was afraid you were going to be upset. I wanted to tell you, I really did, but Matt said—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already know what Matt said.” Annie crossed her arms and stared fixedly at the elevator door, willing it to open. Pressing her lips together, she did her best to ignore him. There was nothing Vance had to say that she wanted to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Annie. I hate leaving when you’re upset with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her back and looked in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annie, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was taking the elevator so long? All she could think about was escaping Vance as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, fine, be mad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t need any encouragement from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me the silent treatment. See if I care.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pretended not to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I want to know is if this means you won’t be driving us to the airport.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled around, shocked that he could even ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” He spoke with an air of defiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “No, Vance, I won’t be driving you to the airport, but have a nice trip. In fact, have the time of your life because that’s certainly what I intend to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator arrived and, after it emptied, the line moved forward. Annie stepped inside and, just before the doors closed, she took one last look at Vance, standing in front of her, still holding the black linen napkin in his hand. She gave him a short, sarcastic wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ta-ta,” she said as the door glided shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, waking Bethanne from a sound sleep. No one called in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency. Caller ID indicated her daughter’s name. With nervous, uncooperative fingers Bethanne answered. “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom!” Annie wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting into a sitting position, Bethanne rubbed her eyes. “Annie, what’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie tried to speak but Bethanne couldn’t understand a word she said. And what she did grasp made no sense. “Vance is going away?” Bethanne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To Europe with Jessie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis came out in a screech, which led Bethanne to believe Jessie was most likely a girl. So tonight’s dinner at the Space Needle wasn’t the marriage proposal Annie had so eagerly anticipated. While Bethanne was grateful, she hurt for her daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, baby, I’m so sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I… He actually wanted me to drive them to the airport. Can you believe that?” The anger was coming through loud and clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said he couldn’t ask me to go to Europe with him because I had another year of school and…and responsibilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone has responsibilities,” Bethanne said, stifling a yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I… Mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sweetheart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is what it was like when Daddy told you about…the lovely Tiffany, isn’t it? You didn’t know, you didn’t even suspect. You were completely oblivious to what was going on right in front of you. Well, so was I.” She sniffed loudly. “I feel so stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Annie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could Vance be so insensitive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne remembered the shocked, numb sensation that had come over her when Grant left. Unlike her, Annie didn’t have a twenty-year marriage; still, she’d just been given a small taste of what Bethanne had experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, honey?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I go to Florida with you and Grandma Hamlin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t bear to stay here alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne resisted the urge to remind her that Grant and her brother would be in town. And she had lots of friends. Annie was far from being alone. On the other hand, having her accompany them wasn’t a bad idea. “I’m sure your grandmother will be fine with it, and I’d love to have you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Mom,” she said, still sniffling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to come home and sleep in your old room?” Bethanne asked, thinking that what Annie really needed was to feel loved and protected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…I’ll be okay now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I could, I’d give you a big hug.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. You’re the best mom in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne smiled sleepily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Mom… Would you call Grandma in the morning and ask her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’m telling Dad, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If that’s what you want, go ahead.” Bethanne had no objection to Grant’s knowing her plans but she felt no obligation to tell him herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spoke for a few more minutes and then Bethanne replaced the phone. Resting her head on the pillow, she closed her eyes, trying to go back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be a fascinating trip across the country now that both her ex-mother-in-law and her daughter were coming…. Well, interesting at any rate. Bethanne drifted off as she began to make mental lists of the clothes she needed to pack and the people she needed to call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday morning she woke later than usual. Although it was a holiday weekend, she had a hundred things to take care of at work if they were going to head out early Wednesday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter showering and dressing, she set off for the office. She’d wait until after ten to call Ruth regarding Annie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she was driving in Seattle traffic, her cell phone rang. The readout on her dashboard showed Ruth’s name and number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne pushed a button on her steering wheel to answer the phone, and Ruth’s voice came through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bethanne, where are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m in my car. What can I do for you, Ruth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it be too much trouble to stop by the house this morning sometime…soon? I really hate to bother you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no bother. I’ll leave now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long will that take you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, about ten minutes, fifteen at the most. Is everything all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I…think so.” Her voice wavered slightly, indicating that everything wasn’t all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be there as soon as I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Ruth whispered gratefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bethanne pulled up to the Hamlin family home, she saw two cars in the driveway. The first belonged to Grant, and the second she guessed was Robin’s. Brother and sister were double-teaming their mother. The poor woman needed backup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne rang the doorbell, then let herself into the house. “Hello, anyone home?” she called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth appeared immediately, and the relief that spread over her features the instant she saw Bethanne was almost comical. The older woman rushed across the room to grab Bethanne’s elbow. “Thank goodness you’re here,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bethanne,” Robin said in the tone she probably used to intimidate witnesses in the courtroom. “Tell me you aren’t serious about driving cross-country on some ludicrous scheme of my mother’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one time Robin might have intimidated her, too, but no longer. With a cool smile, Bethanne faced her. “Personally, I don’t think attending a fifty-year class reunion is all that ludicrous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant stood by the fireplace and seemed content to let his sister do the talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobin didn’t give up. “You two don’t have a clue what you could be getting yourselves into. It isn’t safe out there. You’re both much too trusting. I simply can’t allow my mother—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t ask your permission,” Ruth told her daughter stiffly. She raised her chin to signal that she wouldn’t be browbeaten, nor would she change her mind. Robin could disapprove all she liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother, for once be sensible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sensible?” Ruth repeated. “I’ve been nothing but sensible. It’s my life, and at sixty-eight I should be able to do what I want, when I want. If I choose to drive to Florida, then I will.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-7.html","bookId":1940,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM"}
