I had been engulfed in flames and burnt severely. I would not like a repeat of that particular incident in my temporary haven. “Please take care of it immediately, Adem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will, Countess.” Adem’s gaze rested on Katya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lovely blond thing was lingering near the bed, her fingers lightly skimming over the silken bedclothes. It was bedding Vlad had explicitly requested during our previous stay. Her expression was languid and sensual. It was obvious that she was waiting for Adem to leave us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproaching me, Adem looked apprehensive. Slowly, he leaned down to whisper, “Do you think it wise to feed off her? We do not want to anger her father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My husband often feeds from her during his visits. I will only take a little.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps you should feed from my men,” Adem suggested, his dark eyes narrowing on the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you?” I arched a brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem smirked. “My blood would not satisfy you. I shall arrange for my men to offer their throats to you every night. Take what you need. They are all born of Lord Astir’s haven and have given their blood before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatya frowned, overhearing our conversation. “But I want her to kiss me! How dare you interfere!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is enough,” I said sharply to the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her bottom lip, her eyes filling with tears. Surprisingly, she stayed silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, I turned to Adem. “A little sip every night will probably be wise considering my situation. It is best if I do not hunt with any regularity in the city for fear of drawing attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agreed. I shall send one of my men to your door every night at the hour of your choosing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. I do appreciate your assistance in the matters of my security and comfort,” I said, and meant my words. I was maudlin and agitated by my circumstances, but his presence was strangely comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, the scars on his cheeks and lip tugging oddly on his flesh. “It is my pleasure. Shall I take the girl with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatya fumed, her gaze imploring me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. No. I must feed tonight and a sip now and again will keep her...” I turned study her flushed, eager gaze, “...sated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile at Adem was triumphant and he bowed his head to my wishes. “Until tomorrow, dear Countess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good evening, Adem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one last concerned glance at my guest, Adem left the room and I locked the door after him. I turned to find Katya near. She was breathing heavily, her chest heaving, her pale skin flushed, and her eyes dewy with need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” she whispered, turning her head to expose her slim throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my teeth growing sharp and my stomach felt hollow. The hunger was whispering through my veins as I stepped toward her. My arm caught her about the waist and she moaned with pleasure as she swooned. Since she was taller, I found myself at a disadvantage. I lowered her to the floor, resting her head gently against the wood. Her blond hair was radiant in the firelight and reminded me vividly of Cneajna. Leaning over her, I opened my mouth, my fangs sharp against my lips. Katya trembled beneath me, her fingers tangled in her skirts, clutching them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a quick lunge forward, I sank my sharp teeth deep into her flesh and reveled in the first great burst of blood in my mouth. I drank in the rich fluid, feeling it rushing through my body like warm wine. I took small sips from the girl’s throat, my hands gripping her shoulders tightly. Her moans of delight were disconcerting, but I ignored them as I fed. Quickly satiated, I withdrew my fangs and licked the blood from my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More,” she cried out softly. “More!” Her hands gripped at my arms as I drew away. She followed me up, her hands pressed to my neck and cheek. As I ran my tongue over my bloodied lips, she pressed her mouth against my cheek, murmuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood sharply, disturbed by her seduction. I snatched up my handkerchief from my desk and pressed it to my lips. I felt her hands on my skirt, pulling on it, begging me to drink again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can go now,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, she drew close once more, her hands rising to her bodice. “Please, drink from me. You may drink from me however you want. I do not care. Please!” Exposing her creamy breasts to me, I saw the scars of Vlad’s teeth on her soft skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cover yourself!” I felt a flash of anger and jealousy at the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, she obeyed. I could see her fear, bewilderment and desire. “Perhaps here then?” She raised her skirt, exposing her thighs. I could see his bites there as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped her arms and shook her. “I do not want to use you as he did. Do you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head in confusion. “Please...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave me!” I threw her away, disgusted. I was mortified by the corruption of such a young woman by Vlad. But was I not the same as her? My bites did not scar, but I knew his bite intimately. The pleasure it brought caused me to burn at the mere thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing to her feet, Katya let out a plaintive cry. “Please, mistress, forgive me. Do not shun me. I will not...try to do this again. I will...” She timidly approached me. “I will not touch you or seduce you. Just let me feel your kiss. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy anger leaving me, I reached out and stroked her cheek. “I will let you feel my kiss. But I am not my husband. I will not defile you as he did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved, she kissed my hand and reluctantly went to the door. I could see that she wanted to once more fling herself into my arms and beg for my bite, but she refrained. Unlocking the door, she slipped out into the hall. I saw Adem’s keen eyes watching from the doorway across from my room. Inclining his head, his gaze did not stray from my face until I closed the door and locked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, I threw myself across my bed and wept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay 8, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDearest Astir,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am pressed to secure passage to my next destination, so I write this in haste. Have you received word of Count Vlad Dracula and Lady Glynis? I am most concerned for their safety considering the attack on their home in Buda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have had contact with them, please let me know their current location and if they need assistance. I shall endeavor to join them as soon as my Mistress permits it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSincerely,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Ignatius\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay 12, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Father Ignatius,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this letter finds you safe and sound in the lovely arms of the Immortal Beloved. Please send your gracious and most beautiful Mistress my love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Count Vlad Dracula and his wife, Glynis, I have not seen a word from his noble hand. I suppose I should assume they have returned to their estate in the Carpathian Mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill you be returning to Buda soon? If so, be aware that the vampire hunters have murdered quite a few of your brethren as well as suspected innocents. You may not desire to be too hasty in your return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou friend,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstir\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay 8, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Golden Krone Hotel, Bistriţa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am tormented in the aftermath of the horrors that engulfed my mind as I lay sleeping. I have dreamt of Vlad before, but as I slumbered during the hours of the day I suffered the most vivid nightmare. Though I am loath to put to paper what I endured, I recognize that I must be aware of dark powers at work. By documenting this terrible nightmare, I shall have a written record of the event. Should it be nothing more than my mind deceiving me as I sleep, than I shall be quite relieved. But if it is an ill omen of Vlad Dracula rising from his tomb...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dream began as many do. I thought I had awakened in my darkened hotel room, the bedcovers pulled up to my chin. The shuttered windows let in not one sliver of light and in my stupor it took a few moments for my eyes to accustom to the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing down my covers, I let the cool air brush over my face and neck. It was a sensuous feeling as I rolled onto my side, tucking my hand under the pillows. The silk coverlet bundled around my waist as I lay quietly, listening to the sounds of the humans in the street below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could imagine them bustling about, hurrying on errands, working, chatting, laughing, and doing the sort of tasks mortal men and women occupy their time with during the daylight hours. In the distance, I heard a baby crying and a mother crooning to soothe the infant’s ill temper. Horses neighed and carriages creaked as they carried their passengers and wares to unknown destinations. I imagined myself out in the sun, looking up at the white clouds skimming across pale blue skies as birds took flight. In my fanciful notion, I added Ignatius at my side, his rare smile making me laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand slid over my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped in surprise. I attempted to sit up, but was restrained. A firm, broad chest pressed against my back as I felt cool lips trail up my neck to nestle against my red hair. Twisting about, I could make out a dark shape in the bed beside me. Dark, long hair fell over my body like a curtain as a bare leg, thick with muscle, thrust between my thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flailed as my hands sought to break the iron grip around my waist. With a growl of passion, my attacker licked my throat. I gasped as my fingers traced over the large hand pressed under my breasts. I felt the outline of the signet ring of Vlad Dracula. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-3.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
