She clenched her hand and muttered, “Senior Zhou Tong was clearly killed by Yuan Gate one hundred years ago.

Meanwhile, the expression in his eyes were changing rapidly. Clearly, the emotions in his heart were far too intense. It seems like the current scene had a huge impact on him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Lin Dong looked at the disciples from Dao Sect, who had burst into an uproar, he frowned slightly. Promptly, a somewhat solemn expression appeared in his eyes. A hundred years ago, the position that Zhou Tong enjoyed amongst the disciples of Dao Sect was approximately the same as his current position. In fact, when Lin Dong first entered Dao Sect, he even regarded senior Zhou Tong as his target deep within his heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlong the way, he broke many records set by Zhou Tong and gradually made a name for himself in Dao Sect. This was because he did not wish for there to be an obstacle in his training journey that he could not surpass.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEvery generation would have its own legend. Clearly, a hundred years ago, Zhou Tong was the legend in Dao Sect. This person had also comprehended that extremely profound Great Desolation Scripture and led the disciples of Dao Sect to fight against Yuan Gate during the Great Sect Competition. Finally, he even charged up to Yuan Gate alone. Although he was eventually killed, he left a significant mark on the Eastern Xuan Region and his name was forever imprinted in the hearts of all the Dao Sect disciples.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, as of now, this former legend of Dao Sect had once again appeared alive in front of them. Moreover, he was now on the opposing side of their Dao Sect… At this moment, it felt as though their faith had crumbled, as the originally spirited Dao Sect disciples were all beginning to feel disheartened.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“He is indeed martial senior Zhou Tong.” Beside him, Ying Huanhuan slowly said.

Ying Xuanzi, this is the disciple whom you were the proudest of, a legend in the hearts of countless Dao Sect disciples. However, as of now, he is siding with my Yuan Gate. Don’t you think this is comical?” Tian Yuanzi laughed faintly and said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Why?” Ying Xuanzi’s body trembled as he cried out sternly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Tong’s lips moved upon hearing that explosive cry.

Beside him, Ying Xiaoxiao hurriedly supported him. Meanwhile, the Dao Sect disciples behind, who were originally raring to go, were all dumbstruck when they saw this scene.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong involuntarily frowned when he saw this unexpected scene. His sharp eyes stared intently at Zhou Tong. A moment later, he slowly said, “Martial senior Zhou Tong, I believe that the current you is no longer the real you, am I right?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Tong’s body seemed to have stilled for a moment. After which, his eyes turned towards Lin Dong.

We, the disciples of Dao Sect will never forget the martial senior Zhou Tong who dared to charge up to Yuan Gate all by himself for the sake of Dao Sect. Moreover, I believe that you are definitely not acting out of your own volition.” Lin Dong’s somewhat hoarse voice slowly spread, gradually suppressing the chaos amongst the Dao Sect disciples. Immediately, many disciples began to regain their composure. After all, given martial senior Zhou Tong’s character, how was it possible for him to stand on the side of Yuan Gate. There was definitely something amiss!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Tong continued to stare at Lin Dong. A long while later, a gentle breeze blew over, causing his long hair to drift. After which, tears began to fall on his handsome face, while his body shook violently. It looked as though he was struggling against something. After which, an extremely hoarse and indistinct voice was emitted from his mouth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Tea...cher!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThere was endless despair within his hoarse voice.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Xuanzi’s body stiffened. He looked at the struggling Zhou Tong before he came to a sudden realization.

Then, he snorted coldly before he shook his sleeve. After which, Zhou Tong’s struggling body slowly stilled. The emotions that had just rose on his face gradually faded away and he looked just like a zombie, that was being controlled by someone else.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Your disciple has an exceptionally tough mind. Even after he was eroded for a hundred years, he is still able to retain a trace of consciousness. Haha, actually I didn’t do much. It’s just that I was unwilling to see such a good seedling go to waste. Therefore, I decided to change his allegiance from Dao Sect to my Yuan Gate.” Tian Yuanzi laughed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Xuanzi was outraged and even his face became distorted.

Then, he directly appeared in front of Ying Xuanzi in a phantom like manner. Swiping his hand, the space in front of him became greatly distorted.

Then, he was actually sent flying. Soon after, Zhou Tong took a step forward, before his body strangely appeared in front of Ying Xuanzi.
