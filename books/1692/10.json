It\u0027s not coming from the island - the angle is too steep. He must\u0027ve been waiting for us.\" Logan turns and looks at me. \"You still want to stay here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has a point. But I don\u0027t care about who was right or wrong now; I just want to get us all out of here, quickly and safely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now what?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only have a few shots left in my pistol,\" Logan says. \"There\u0027s no way I\u0027d hit him. He\u0027s too far. That\u0027s a long-distance rifle. He\u0027s got us pinned here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen crosses the cave, grabs the bow and arrows. He wears a new expression - tough, fearless - one I haven\u0027t seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he just struts out of the cave without hesitating, into the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben!\" I yell. \"Don\u0027t! You\u0027ll get killed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Ben keeps walking, and as he does, another gunshot rings out, missing him by a few inches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen keeps walking, doesn\u0027t even flinch. It is unbelievable. He struts with his chin up, determined, walking right out through the trees, towards the direction of the gunfire. It is as if he is suicidal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it occurs to me: maybe he is suicidal. Maybe he feels so overwhelmed with guilt about his brother, that a part of him wants to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurry to the mouth of the cave, as we all do, and stand there, watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to get himself killed,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s his choice,\" Logan says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen walks through the trees, gunfire hailing down all around him, barely missing him in the tree cover. He reaches the shore, and stands there, out in the open. Gun fire hits the sand near him, just missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if he has all the time in the world, Ben slowly removes the bow from his shoulder, takes out an arrow, and studies the far shoreline. On the horizon, on the other side of the Hudson, high up on a cliff, there is a lone gunman, aiming down with his rifle. The stock of his rifle glistens in the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore shots ring out, but Ben doesn\u0027t flinch. He stands there, boldly. I wonder if this is courage, or suicide. Or both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen places a single arrow on the bow, pulls it back, and takes aim. He holds it there for several seconds, waiting, aiming. Another gunshot rings out, missing him, but he doesn\u0027t flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, finally, he lets go the arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the arrow sail through the air, high across the Hudson, a good hundred yards. It is a thing of beauty. I\u0027m amazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m even more amazed to watch as it finds its target: it lodges right into the chest of the lone gunman. After a moment, he falls face down, dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at Ben in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen walks back to us. He stands at the mouth of the cave, holding his bow and arrow, and we stand there, staring back at him. No more gunshots hail down. It wasn\u0027t the slaverunners. It must\u0027ve been a lone, crazed gunman. A survivor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen stares back at us wordlessly, and for the first time I can see the warrior in his eyes, a whole different Ben than I\u0027ve seen before. I can also sense that a part of him had indeed wanted to die, had wanted the gunman to kill him, had wanted to join his brother. But he didn\u0027t get his wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, it seems like the episode was cathartic, like it exorcised something within him. Some sort of guilt about his brother or Rose. As if he faced death, and now he\u0027s ready to live again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ready to leave,\" he says. \"Let\u0027s go north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of us sit silently in the boat, each lost in our own world, as our boat continues up the Hudson. Logan is steering, and we have been driving for hours, winding our way slowly upriver, avoiding chunks of separating ice. We all keep our eyes peeled forward; none of us dare look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all left behind too much back there. Since the shooting, Ben doesn\u0027t talk about going home. I have nothing more to say, either. Obviously, it wasn\u0027t safe to stay there, after all. That shooter may have been a stray - or there may be more where he came from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mood now is much more somber. We all feel the absence of Rose. Penelope sits in Bree\u0027s lap, shaking, and I feel like we\u0027re all in mourning for a lost comrade. I think her passing also reminds us all of how close we came. It could\u0027ve been any one of us - by pure happenstance it just happened to be her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think any of us really believe we will live for long. Each day is like looking our own mortality in the face. It\u0027s not a matter of if we will all die. But when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA part of me has given up caring. I just look ahead, focus on the far north, on the distant goal of Canada. I hold it in my mind, and try not to let it go. Whether it\u0027s real or not, it doesn\u0027t really matter anymore. It\u0027s something. A destination. It beats our aimlessly wandering, heading God knows where, for God knows what. It\u0027s comforting to think that we\u0027re heading some place that might one day be home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen surprised me back there - he surprised all of us. I was sure that he was going to get killed. Whatever his motive, his actions were brave, and he took out the sniper and saved us all. I think Logan has a new respect for him. I certainly do. And I think Ben, sitting a little taller, has a new respect for himself. It\u0027s like, finally, he\u0027s a member of our team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBree, on the other hand, has withdrawn into herself, ever since Rose\u0027s passing. Her eyes seem sunk, hollow, and she seems more out of it than I\u0027ve ever seen her. It is as if a part of her died with Rose. She clutches Penelope as if she\u0027s holding a piece of Rose, and looks off into the water as if she\u0027s bearing the sorrows of the world. I can\u0027t stand to see her like this. But I don\u0027t know what else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan, beside me, is quiet, and I can see the concern in his face. He stands over the wheel, checking the gas gauge every few seconds. We are now officially in the red. He keeps scanning the shoreline, as do I, for any signs of a town, a station - anything. But there is nothing. We\u0027ll be out of gas soon. And we\u0027ll be stranded. What I would give now for just a gallon of gas. I don\u0027t know what we\u0027ll do without this boat, if we have to leave it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, I spot something coming towards us in the river. At first I wonder if I\u0027m seeing things, but then I see it\u0027s real. I grab my gun, even though there\u0027s no ammo left, and brace myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"GET DOWN!\" I scream to Bree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Ben jump down, looking out over the rail. Logan looks over at me, not understanding, then he looks out and sees it, too. He squats down, and reaches over and grabs his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing right at us is another boat. It is a huge, rusted metal boat, maybe a hundred feet long and half as wide - it looks like a mini barge. It floats towards us, between the chunks of ice, crookedly, on an angle. That is when I realize that something looks wrong with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it comes into better view, I see what it is. And I relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a ghost ship. Its entire hull is hollowed out, and I can see right through it. It is incredible: a huge, empty, rusted shell, floating down the river. It creaks and groans as it bounces in the river, sandwiched between large chunks of ice, leaning. It drifts our way and Logan turns us away, to keep us a good distance from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe float right past it and I look up, amazed by its size, as it blocks the sun. It is eerie. It is like looking at an old pirate ship. I wonder who piloted it, wonder how many months it\u0027s been floating down this river. It is other-worldly, this strange relic, this vestige of a world that once was. It makes me wonder if there is anything left in the world anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of us say anything as it passes. I relax my guard, realizing there is no danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I hear a noise and I look down, as our boat starts to slow. At first I wonder if we ran out of gas. But that\u0027s not what it is. We suddenly stop moving, our boat groaning. We are stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down, trying to figure out what happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did we hit a rock?\" I ask. \"Aren\u0027t we too far from shore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan shakes his head, looking down grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ice,\" he answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean over the boat, and see it. There, all around us, are huge chunks of ice, boxing us in. So much of it has gathered around us that we can no longer move. I can\u0027t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" Ben asks, also leaning over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to break out,\" Logan says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need some kind of tool,\" Logan says. \"Like a saw. Or a hammer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember the hammer I salvaged from my dad\u0027s house, and rummage through my sack and pull it out. I lean over the edge and hammer at the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it hardly does a thing. The ice is too thick, and my hammer is too small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean back, exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice try,\" Logan says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look all around the river, and realize we are sitting ducks out here. This is bad. It could take hours for the ice to thaw. And the current is now bringing us back downriver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan, Ben and I all exchange a nervous glance; clearly, none of us have any ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the anchor?\" Bree asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all turn and look at her. She stands there, pointing. I follow her finger to the back of the boat, to the small anchor on an iron chain. Bree\u0027s right. It\u0027s a brilliant idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan hurries over and hoists it. I am impressed by his strength: it must weigh thirty pounds, solid iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand back,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans over the edge, winds up the chain and anchor, and brings it down hard on the ice. It hits with a cracking noise, and I watch as the ice cracks and splits in several parts. Logan does it again and again, and soon, the huge chunks of ice break free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drops the anchor and turns to Bree with a smile: \"Smart thinking,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI come over and put my arm around her, and she smiles proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know what us grownups would do without you,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan guns it and we break through the remaining ice, back into open water. We are moving, but more slowly than before, Logan doing his best to avoid the floating chunks. I stand beside him, watching the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See that up there?\" he asks, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squint, and in the distance I see, on the shore, the remains of what looks like a gas station. It is a small, crumbling dock, with the remnants of rusted gas pumps. It looks like it once fueled boats. It sits on the periphery of a sprawling town, dilapidated, like all the towns we passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say we give it a shot,\" he says. \"Probably empty, but we need to try. We\u0027re running on fumes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be risky, getting that close to shore again,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no choice,\" Logan says. \"It won\u0027t be long until the river freezes over for good. And if the pumps are empty, we can scavenge that town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen and Bree are standing beside us, looking too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any objections?\" Logan asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are all silent. It\u0027s probably a waste of time, but he\u0027s right: it\u0027s not like we have a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan turns us towards the dock. We pull up to it, my heart beating in anticipation, and I silently wish and pray that there is gas left in these pumps. All we need is some gas, in just one pump. Just a few gallons. Something. Anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan pulls up expertly beside the dock, aligning the nozzle. He jumps out, our boat rocking, as he lands on the dock two feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifts the rusted nozzle, inserts it into the boat, and pulls the lever. My heart stops as I hear a swooshing noise. Then silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan tries again and again. He leans back and bangs the pump. But nothing happens. It is empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all look away, grimacing. We know what that means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\" Ben asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no choice,\" Logan says. \"We\u0027ve got to see if we can find some gas. We\u0027ve got to check this town out. A canister, anything. Maybe even siphon it off an old car, if we can find any. The boat\u0027s useless to us now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s right. I know he\u0027s right, but I hate to admit it. I don\u0027t want to leave the safety of the boat, don\u0027t want to go back on shore. But I know that it\u0027s useless without gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do it,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jump off the boat, the dock bobbing as I do, then turn for Bree and pull her up. Ben lingers, reluctant to leave the boat, then finally jumps off and joins us. Logan reaches down and drops the anchor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the boat?\" Ben asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan shakes his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t take it with us,\" he says. \"One of us could stand guard, but that\u0027d be a waste of time. Don\u0027t worry about it,\" he says. \"It\u0027s useless without gas. It\u0027s not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we all follow Logan towards town, I check back over my shoulder, and look one more time at the boat. I don\u0027t know why, but I have a sinking feeling that I\u0027ll never see it again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/arena-two/page-10.html","bookId":1692,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:56 AM"}
