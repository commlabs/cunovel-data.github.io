He had certainly done well for his employer, for he had sold out his mining property at a profit of seven thousand dollars, while as for himself he had two thousand dollars to show as the recompense of his shrewdness. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Our hero did not immediately leave Custer City, but looked about him, as instructed by Mr. Bradford. The result was that he purchased a new mine, paying three thousand dollars, one thousand being on his own account, the other two-thirds on behalf of his employer. This he left in charge of his new friend, Jim Scott, and, when matters had been fully arranged, started on his way home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At Omaha Paul decided to stop over for twenty-four hours, having a little business to attend to for Mr. Bradford.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He applied at a hotel for accommodations.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sorry,\" said the landlord, \"that I can\u0027t give you a room by yourself. I am crowded.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 262]Paul hesitated, for he didn\u0027t like sharing the room of a total stranger.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are the other hotels in the city likely to be full?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"More than likely. Still, you can try.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n However, Paul didn\u0027t care to take the time for searching, when there was such a slight chance of success.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where can you put me?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In No. 37. There is one gentleman there, who seems quiet; I don\u0027t think he will disturb you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are there two beds?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I suppose I may as well make it do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul was accordingly shown up to No. 37. He found that it was what is called a double room. That is, there were two beds in it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where is the other gentleman?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He won\u0027t be in till late in the evening,\" was the reply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you happen to remember his name?\" Paul inquired.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"John Davenport.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where does he hail from?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Kansas City.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Probably he is all right,\" thought our hero,[Pg 263] \"though I don\u0027t quite like the idea of rooming with a complete stranger. Well, I will take the room.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was about the middle of the afternoon. Paul deposited his carpet-bag in the room, but what articles of value he had he left for safe keeping in the office of the hotel, as prudent travelers generally do, at any rate when they find themselves paired off with strangers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Deferring his business to the next day, Paul took a walk about the streets and made himself familiar with the outward appearance of a city which has become one of the most important on the transcontinental route. He admired the new high-school building, built on the site of the old capitol, with its spire rising nearly two hundred feet above the street, the elegant private dwellings on the hill, and perhaps more than all, the huge railroad bridge that spans the Missouri River. Everywhere he marked signs of prosperity and enterprise, and he felt that it must be inspiring to live where growth is so rapid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He used his time well, and went back to the hotel to supper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n About nine o\u0027clock, feeling fatigued with his journey, he decided to go up stairs to bed, so as to feel quite refreshed the next day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The room was empty, his roommate, Mr. Davenport, of Kansas City, not having arrived.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paul undressed and got into bed. How long he had[Pg 264] slept he did not know, but he woke all at once, and from his bed looked on a sight which instantly awakened him thoroughly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A man was exploring his carpet-bag, which for convenience he had deposited on the table, in search, no doubt, of valuables.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What are you doing there?\" demanded Paul, sitting up in bed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man turned suddenly, and revealed to Paul the well known features of Luke Denton.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83109.html","bookId":282,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:41:02 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:41:02 AM"}
