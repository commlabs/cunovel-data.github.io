They were actually challenged and stopped here by a mere 16 year old boy who had trash talked them, and yet no one dared to step up. What kind of situation was this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEspecially since at this time, the newly converted Linmaniacs of Divine Phoenix Island began to raucously shout.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Big Brother Lin, that’s my boy!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Big Brother Lin, you rock!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Big Brother Lin is a true man, a man whose flesh and blood are\u0026nbsp;iron!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, you can do it, we believe!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ah!

There was simply no better feeling in the world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, there were a few disciples like Yan Fuhong that had an increasingly ugly complexion. Their faces had already sunk as far as they could. Yan Fuhong was horrified. He didn’t think that he had actually tried to mess with such an abnormal boy. If Lin Ming ever found out… Yan Fuhong dared not to think about what would happen. Just the possibilities already sent shivers running down his spine.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany of the disciples of Divine Phoenix Island had stepped on their chairs, some stripping their clothes and waving them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was simply a revival of madness.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt had to be known that Divine Phoenix Island disciples were always especially proud and arrogant individuals with a high view of themselves. Especially core disciples – they were the chosen of heaven among all chosen of heaven. The men cared much about their image, much less the women. Any random female disciples of Divine Phoenix Island already had a status that was hundreds of times superior to a country’s princess.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, these young infatuated girls had lost all restraints and disregarded any pride, screaming and crying out at the top of their lungs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDivine Phoenix Island had many female disciples. As these young Linmaniacs wept and moaned and screamed, even some of the other female disciples flushed red. These women were simply devolving into sex-crazed beasts! How could the disciples of the Five Element Region possibly permit this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo male animals in nature, the most painful affront was to have many other beautiful female animals taken by another male animal, being unable to lift their heads.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough humans often flaunted their wisdom and morals, this sort of animal disposition was etched into their very bones. These were the most basic instincts that were impossible to suppress.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe disciples of the Five Element Region were unable to bear such a massive pressure. A desperate blue-clothed youth stood up, a calm expression in his eyes, like a spirit that was unafraid of walking on death’s edge. He walked onstage with resolution, preparing to serve as cannon fodder and bravely face death for the Five Element Region, becoming a heroic martyr. This self-sacrifice immediately ushered in looks of admiration and sympathy from those around him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe blue-clothed youth had a thought that echoed in his mind. That was that he could die, but he would not die on his knees, and other such sayings.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo sacrifice one’s life for honor and die as a martyr, for fame and justice – that was a worthy death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was utterly speechless as he watched this idiot stand up. The reason that he had participated in this war of attrition was because he wanted to repay Mu Yuhuang and also to force himself to his limits, and use this chance to enhance his strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut this fellow that came up was only wasting his time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis cultivation wasn’t even at the Houtian realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, fortunately a direct disciple of Storm Valley was finally unable to watch such a sad scene and stood up. He was the third ranked disciple of Storm Valley, Zhan Huo. He was slightly stronger than Chu Yunfei, but against someone like Lin Ming, he didn’t have much confidence in himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Brother, which one of us should go up?” The peak Pulse Condensation martial artist saw Zhan Huo stand up and asked him, his heart quivering. When he walked onstage, he was finally able to feel the pressure. This was a completely different feeling from the heroic self-sacrifice that clouded his mind earlier. This pressure made him intensely nervous, and as he heard the cheering from both sides, this pressure had reached the extreme.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs he faced Lin Ming who was standing calm and straight onstage, this pressure became a massive oppressive feeling, a crushing aura that he couldn’t withstand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe finally understood why even though there were dozens of Houtian realm disciples, no one had gone up for a full ten breaths of time. With all the heaven blessed talents and Revolving Core Elders watching this fight, the pressure to succeed could be imagined. Under such a compelling pressure, every person had to be careful about walking onto the stage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhan Huo looked at this blue-clothed idiot and sighed. He sent a true essence sound transmission, “Go back. In the time that you fight him, he’ll recover more energy than you can make him consume.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe blue-clothed youth turned green. At the moment that he wasn’t sure what to do, Zhan Huo had walked onstage. “Storm Valley’s Zhan Huo, please advise.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhan Huo pulled out his weapon, surprising everyone. This weapon was actually a whip.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA whip was much more difficult to use than a spear. Zhan Huo’s whip seemed to be made from twisted animal sinews. The surface of the whip was embellished with a variety of sharp metal features, every one with keen edges and corners. If one was really lashed by this whip, their flesh would be mutilated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis whip was very long, it was around 50 feet. Brandishing it was also very difficult in terms of control.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming casually waved his spear, and drew a crescent move on the floor with the spearpoint. “Make your move.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhan Huo’s lips curved up, showing a trace of a sly smirk and also a taunt. Lin Ming frowned, what was this fellow planning?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Boy, consider it bad luck that you met me!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Zhan Huo spoke, he bent his knees and then suddenly leapt upwards!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm? He jumped up?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhan Huo jumped over 100 feet high, and then his ascending speed began to slow down. When he finally reached the point where he should fall back down, an unexpected event occurred.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhan Huo opened both arms wide, the clothes around him fluttering in the wind as he stopped in midair.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe’s floating?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Divine Phoenix Island disciples were shocked. Besides Storm Valley, the disciples from the other Five Element Region sects were also stunned. There were even slight changes in the expressions of some Divine Phoenix Island elders.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Oh? This fellow is quite interesting. Storm Valley truly does produce geniuses that have an amazing comprehension of the Concept of Wind!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Zhan Huo is also one of the four heroic Storm talents. This weird comprehension of a Concept is no worse than Chu Yunfei’s. Storm Valley’s 1000 years of accumulated knowledge truly lives up to its reputation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha, the sect inheritances are one thing, but this Zhan Huo boy also has very good perception. This sort of flying technique is not something that any Storm Valley disciple can learn; it is an extremely difficult and challenging skill to grasp. In the younger generation, only Zhan Huo has understood this Concept utilization.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s face revealed a very strange expression.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFlying technique?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe watched as Zhan You swayed in the air. Periodically, a small current of air formed around him. This was a sign of the unstable wind origin energy that he controlled.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf this technique was compared to the Golden Roc Shattering the Void that Lin Ming cultivated, it had zero combat value. It could only be described as an extremely shoddy and useless technique.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Lin Ming was able to understand one matter. For someone below the Xiantian realm to fly was not a big deal at all. The reason that he had hid the secret of Golden Roc Shattering the Void was because he feared that this cultivation method would be too shocking and draw in a disaster. However, it seemed as if any heaven blessed rare talent with good perception would be able to comprehend a flying technique from the Concept of Wind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow he no longer needed to hide this. He had already revealed some secrets that had caused others to believe he had a monstrous perception. Even if he revealed his comprehension of the Concept of Wind, it shouldn’t be too shocking; no one should suspect anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf one could freely use Golden Roc Shattering the Void, it was possible to suddenly change directions in midair. If this skill was used in combat, it would be very difficult to guard against.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Zhan Huo had already flown more than 200 feet high, there was only a palm-sized shadow left from him on the ground. He cunningly smiled, and then loudly said, “Lin Ming, in this battle I am now in an invincible position. Just what can you do to me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhan Huo was smart. He realized that he wasn’t a direct match for Lin Ming, so he used his flying technique to float in the air. Then, he could use the superior length of his whip to attack. With the addition of his true essence fused into the wind, he would have an advantage in long distance attacks, and slowly consume Lin Ming’s energy. With this, if the fight continued, even if he eventually lost he would have used up all of Lin Ming’s energy, and he wouldn’t have the ability to fight any longer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming could only passively be beaten by him. Although a martial artist was able to jump 200 feet high, by the time they did, they would have already lost their striking strength and velocity. At that time, all Zhan Huo had to do was move away from Lin Ming’s jumping trajectory, calmly dodging him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-370\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-372\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-371","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:18 AM"}
