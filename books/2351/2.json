{"id":66797,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003e3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCindy Darwin is an anthropology professor at UCI. Her expertise is in the anthropology of religion, which, she tells me, is an important aspect of anthropology. And, yes, she can trace her lineage back to Charles Darwin, which makes her a sort of icon in her field. She knows more things about anthropology than she probably should, and too few things about the real world. Maybe that\u0027s why she keeps me around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late and we were walking hand-in-hand along the Huntington Pier. From here we could see the lights of Catalina Island, where the reclusive sorts live and travel via ferry and plane. To the north, in the far distance, we could see Long Beach glittering away. The air was cool and windy and we were dressed in light jackets and jeans. Her jeans were much snugger and more form-fitting than mine. As they should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking of giving San Diego a call,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s in San Diego?\" she asked. She had a slightly higher pitched voice than most women. I found it endlessly sexy. She said her voice made it easier to holler across an assembly hall. Gave it more range, or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was silent. She put two and two together. She let go of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They call you again?\" she asked. \"The Rams, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Chargers. Christ, Cindy, your own brother plays on the team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s all sort of silly. Football, I mean. And all those silly mascots, I just don\u0027t get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mascots help us boys tell the teams apart,\" I said. \"And, no, they didn\u0027t call. But I\u0027m thinking about their last offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, that was two years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right. I turned them down two years ago. My leg hadn\u0027t felt strong enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The leg\u0027s better now,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit. You still limp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as much. And when I workout, I feel the strength again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you still have metal pins in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of players play with pins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you told Rob yet?\" she asked. Rob was her brother, the Chargers fourth wide receiver. Rob had introduced me to Cindy during college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thinks it\u0027s a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped walking and leaned over the heavy wooden rail. The air was suffused with brine and salt. Waves crashed beneath us, whitecaps glowing in the moonlight. A lifeguard Jeep was parked next to us, a quarter into the ocean on the pier. All that extra weight on the pier made me nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why now?\" she asked finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My window is rapidly closing,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention you\u0027ve always wondered if you could do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re frustrated out of your gourd that a fucking leg injury has prevented you from finding this out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such language from an anthropologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed and hugged me around my waist. She was exactly a foot shorter than me, which made hugging easy, and kissing difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you think?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re frustrated and angry and that you need to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention I might just make a hell of a fullback.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he the one who throws the ball?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had gone over this precisely one hundred and two times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snuggled closer, burying her sharp chin deep into my side. It tickled. If I wasn\u0027t so tough I would have laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just don\u0027t get yourself hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t plan to, but these things have a way of taking you by surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you really that good?\" she asked, looking up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away. \"If you make the team, things will change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged her tighter. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a conference room at the Orange County jail in Santa Ana, accompanied by Charley Brown\u0027s assistant, Mary Cho. We were alone, waiting for Derrick Booker to make his grand appearance. Mary was Chinese and petite and pretty. She wore a blue power suit, with the hem just above her knees. She sat next to me, and from our close proximity I had a clear view of her knees. Nice knees. Cho was probably still a law student. Probably worked out a whole lot. Seemed a little uptight, but nothing a little alcohol couldn\u0027t fix. Was probably a little tigress in bed. She wasn\u0027t much of a talker and seemed immune to my considerable charm. Probably because she had caught me looking at her knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy door with the wire window opened and Derrick was shown into the conference room by two strapping wardens. He was left alone with us, the wardens waiting just outside the door. The kid himself was manacled and hogtied. Should he make a run for it, Pope John Paul II himself could have caught him from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Cho sprang to life, brightening considerably, leaning forward and gesturing to a chair opposite us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Derrick, thanks for meeting us,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, raising his cuffed hands slightly. \"As if I had anything better to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is what I would have said. I stifled a grin. I suspected grins were illegal in the Orange County jail. Derrick sounded white, although he tried to hide that fact with a lot of swaggering showmanship. In fact, he sounded white and rich, with a slightly arrogant lilt to his voice. He was good looking, with strong features and light brown eyes. He was tall and built like an athlete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have someone here who wants to speak with you,\" said Cho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who? Whitey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my hand. \"That would be me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerrick\u0027s father owned lots of real estate across southern California, and Derrick himself had grown up filthy rich. He was about as far from the ghetto as you could get. Yet here he was, sounding as if he had lived the mean streets all his life. As if he had grown up in poverty, rather than experiencing the best Orange County had to offer, which is considerable. I suspected here in prison he was in survival mode, where being a wealthy black kid is as bad as being a wealthy white kid. Except that he had the jargon wrong and a few years out of date, and he still sounded upper class, no matter how hard he tried to hide it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Jim Knighthorse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I know you, man!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who doesn\u0027t?\" I said. \"And those who don\u0027t, should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, showing a row of perfect white teeth. \"How\u0027s your leg? Saw you bust it up against Miami. Hell, I wanted to throw up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did throw up. You play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Running back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You any good?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"School is full of whities, what do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Some whities can run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned again. \"Yeah, no shit. You could run, bro. Dad says wasn\u0027t for your leg you\u0027d be in the pros.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still might.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the leg?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see about the leg,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were silent. Derrick was losing the ghetto speak. His eyes had brightened considerably with the football talk. We looked at each other. Down to business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do her, Derrick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He means kill her, Derrick,\" said Cho. \"He\u0027s asking if you killed Amanda Peterson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, assistant Cho,\" I said, smiling at her. She looked away quickly. Clearly she didn\u0027t trust herself around me. I looked back at Derrick. \"You kill her, Derrick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms flexed. Bulbous veins stood out against his forearms, disappearing up the short sleeves of his white prison attire. I could see those arms carrying a football.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should anyone believe you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give a fuck what anyone believes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They found the knife in your car, Derrick. Her blood was on the knife. It adds up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was trying for hostile bad-ass, but he was just a kid, and eventually his emotions won out. They rippled across his expressive face, brief glimpses into his psyche: disbelief, rage, frustration. But most of all I saw sorrow. Deep sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because... \" He stopped, swallowed, looked away. \"Because we were going to get married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventeen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old was she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone know about the marriage?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed hollowly. \"Hell, no. Her dad hates me, and I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t think much of me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t imagine he does,\" I said. \"You have any theories who might have killed her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she seeing anyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were exclusive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She loved me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you love her?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer immediately. The silence that followed was palpable. The ticking of the clock behind us accentuated the silence and gave it depth and profundity. I listened to him breathe through his mouth. The corners of his mouth were flecked with dried spittle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I loved her,\" he said finally. He swiped his sleeve across his face, using a shrugging motion to compensate for his cuffed wrists. The sleeve was streaked with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will be enough, Mr. Knighthorse,\" said Cho. \"Thank you, Derrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up and went to the door. She knocked on the window and the two wardens entered and led the shuffling Derrick out of the room. He didn\u0027t look back. I got up and stood by the door with Cho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re secretly in love with me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re secretly in love with yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no secret,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left the conference room and moved down the purposefully bare-walled hallway. Perhaps colorful paintings would have given the accused false hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The kid didn\u0027t do her,\" I said. \"No one\u0027s that good an actor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"We know. He\u0027s going to need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to need a lot of help,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess: and you\u0027re the man to do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Took the words right out of my mouth.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-horse-jim-knighthorse-1/page-2.html","bookId":2351,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:29 AM"}
