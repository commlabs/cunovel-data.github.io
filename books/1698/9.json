He dodges another punch, slipping around Al and kicking him hard in the back. Al lurches forward and turns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was younger, I read a book about grizzly bears. There was a picture of one standing on its hind legs with its paws outstretched, roaring. That is how Al looks now. He charges at Will, grabbing his arm so he can’t slip away, and punches him hard in the jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch the light leave Will’s eyes, which are pale green, like celery. They roll back into his head, and all the tension falls from his body. He slips from Al’s grasp, dead weight, and crumples to the floor. Cold rushes down my back and fills my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl’s eyes widen, and he crouches next to Will, tapping his cheek with one hand. The room falls silent as we wait for Will to respond. For a few seconds, he doesn’t, just lies on the ground with an arm bent beneath him. Then he blinks, clearly dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get him up,” Eric says. He stares with greedy eyes at Will’s fallen body, like the sight is a meal and he hasn’t eaten in weeks. The curl of his lip is cruel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour turns to the chalkboard and circles Al’s name. Victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next up—Molly and Christina!” shouts Eric. Al pulls Will’s arm across his shoulders and drags him out of the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina cracks her knuckles. I would wish her luck, but I don’t know what good that would do. Christina isn’t weak, but she’s much narrower than Molly. Hopefully her height will help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the room, Four supports Will from the waist and leads him out. Al stands for a moment by the door, watching them go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour leaving makes me nervous. Leaving us with Eric is like hiring a babysitter who spends his time sharpening knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina tucks her hair behind her ears. It is chin-length, black, and pinned back with silver clips. She cracks another knuckle. She looks nervous, and no wonder—who wouldn’t be nervous after watching Will collapse like a rag doll?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf conflict in Dauntless ends with only one person standing, I am unsure of what this part of initiation will do to me. Will I be Al, standing over a man’s body, knowing I’m the one who put him on the ground, or will I be Will, lying in a helpless heap? And is it selfish of me to crave victory, or is it brave? I wipe my sweaty palms on my pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snap to attention when Christina kicks Molly in the side. Molly gasps and grits her teeth like she’s about to growl through them. A lock of stringy black hair falls across her face, but she doesn’t brush it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl stands next to me, but I’m too focused on the new fight to look at him, or congratulate him on winning, assuming that’s what he wants. I am not sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly smirks at Christina, and without warning, dives, hands outstretched, at Christina’s midsection. She hits her hard, knocking her down, and pins her to the ground. Christina thrashes, but Molly is heavy and doesn’t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe punches, and Christina moves her head out of the way, but Molly just punches again, and again, until her fist hits Christina’s jaw, her nose, her mouth. Without thinking, I grab Al’s arm and squeeze it as tightly as I can. I just need something to hold on to. Blood runs down the side of Christina’s face and splatters on the ground next to her cheek. This is the first time I have ever prayed for someone to fall unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she doesn’t. Christina screams and drags one of her arms free. She punches Molly in the ear, knocking her off-balance, and wriggles free. She comes to her knees, holding her face with one hand. The blood streaming from her nose is thick and dark and covers her fingers in seconds. She screams again and crawls away from Molly. I can tell by the heaving of her shoulders that she’s sobbing, but I can barely hear her over the throbbing in my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease go unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly kicks Christina’s side, sending her sprawling on her back. Al frees his hand and pulls me tight to his side. I clench my teeth to keep from crying out. I had no sympathy for Al the first night, but I am not cruel yet; the sight of Christina clutching her rib cage makes me want to stand between her and Molly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop!” wails Christina as Molly pulls her foot back to kick again. She holds out a hand. “Stop! I’m…” She coughs. “I’m done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly smiles, and I sigh with relief. Al sighs too, his rib cage lifting and falling against my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric walks toward the center of the arena, his movements slow, and stands over Christina with his arms folded. He says quietly, “I’m sorry, what did you say? You’re done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina pushes herself to her knees. When she takes her hand from the ground, it leaves a red handprint behind. She pinches her nose to stop the bleeding and nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get up,” he says. If he had yelled, I might not have felt like everything inside my stomach was about to come out of it. If he had yelled, I would have known that the yelling was the worst he planned to do. But his voice is quiet and his words precise. He grabs Christina’s arm, yanks her to her feet, and drags her out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Follow me,” he says to the rest of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the roar of the river in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stand near the railing. The Pit is almost empty; it is the middle of the afternoon, though it feels like it’s been night for days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there were people around, I doubt any of them would help Christina. We are with Eric, for one thing, and for another, the Dauntless have different rules—rules that brutality does not violate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric shoves Christina against the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Climb over it,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” She says it like she expects him to relent, but her wide eyes and ashen face suggest otherwise. Eric will not back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Climb over the railing,” says Eric again, pronouncing each word slowly. “If you can hang over the chasm for five minutes, I will forget your cowardice. If you can’t, I will not allow you to continue initiation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe railing is narrow and made of metal. The spray from the river coats it, making it slippery and cold. Even if Christina is brave enough to hang from the railing for five minutes, she may not be able to hold on. Either she decides to be factionless, or she risks death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I close my eyes, I imagine her falling onto the jagged rocks below and shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” she says, her voice shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is tall enough to swing her leg over the railing. Her foot shakes. She puts her toe on the ledge as she lifts her other leg over. Facing us, she wipes her hands on her pants and holds on to the railing so hard her knuckles turn white. Then she takes one foot off the ledge. And the other. I see her face between the bars of the barrier, determined, her lips pressed together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to me, Al sets his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first minute and a half, Christina is fine. Her hands stay firm around the railing and her arms don’t shake. I start to think she might make it and show Eric how foolish he was to doubt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then the river hits the wall, and white water sprays against Christina’s back. Her face strikes the barrier, and she cries out. Her hands slip so she’s just holding on by her fingertips. She tries to get a better grip, but now her hands are wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I help her, Eric would make my fate the same as hers. Will I let her fall to her death, or will I resign myself to being factionless? What’s worse: to be idle while someone dies, or to be exiled and empty-handed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents would have no problem answering that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I am not my parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as I know, Christina hasn’t cried since we got here, but now her face crumples and she lets out a sob that is louder than the river. Another wave hits the wall and the spray coats her body. One of the droplets hits my cheek. Her hands slip again, and this time, one of them falls from the railing, so she’s hanging by four fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Christina,” says Al, his low voice surprisingly loud. She looks at him. He claps. “Come on, grab it again. You can do it. Grab it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould I even be strong enough to hold on to her? Would it be worth my effort to try to help her if I know I’m too weak to do any good?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what those questions are: excuses. Human reason can excuse any evil; that is why it’s so important that we don’t rely on it. My father’s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina swings her arm, fumbling for the railing. No one else cheers her on, but Al brings his big hands together and shouts, his eyes holding hers. I wish I could; I wish I could move, but I just stare at her and wonder how long I have been this disgustingly selfish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at Al’s watch. Four minutes have passed. He elbows me hard in the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” I say. My voice is a whisper. I clear my throat. “One minute left,” I say, louder this time. Christina’s other hand finds the railing again. Her arms shake so hard I wonder if the earth is quaking beneath me, jiggling my vision, and I just didn’t notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Christina,” Al and I say, and as our voices join, I believe I might be strong enough to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will help her. If she slips again, I will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother wave of water splashes against Christina’s back, and she shrieks as both her hands slip off the railing. A scream launches from my mouth. It sounds like it belongs to someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she doesn’t fall. She grabs the bars of the barrier. Her fingers slide down the metal until I can’t see her head anymore; they are all I see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl’s watch reads 5:00.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five minutes are up,” he says, almost spitting the words at Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric checks his own watch. Taking his time, tilting his wrist, all while my stomach twists and I can’t breathe. When I blink, I see Rita’s sister on the pavement below the train tracks, limbs bent at strange angles; I see Rita screaming and sobbing; I see myself turning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” Eric says. “You can come up, Christina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl walks toward the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Eric says. “She has to do it on her own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, she doesn’t,” Al growls. “She did what you said. She’s not a coward. She did what you said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric doesn’t respond. Al reaches over the railing, and he’s so tall that he can reach Christina’s wrist. She grabs his forearm. Al pulls her up, his face red with frustration, and I run forward to help. I’m too short to do much good, as I suspected, but I grip Christina under the shoulder once she’s high enough, and Al and I haul her over the barrier. She drops to the ground, her face still blood-smeared from the fight, her back soaking wet, her body quivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kneel next to her. Her eyes lift to mine, then shift to Al, and we all catch our breath together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT NIGHT I dream that Christina hangs from the railing again, by her toes this time, and someone shouts that only someone who is Divergent can help her. So I run forward to pull her up, but someone shoves me over the edge, and I wake before I hit the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat-soaked and shaky from the dream, I walk to the girls’ bathroom to shower and change. When I come back, the word “Stiff” is spray-painted across my mattress in red. The word is written smaller along the bed frame, and again on my pillow. I look around, my heart pounding with anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter stands behind me, whistling as he fluffs his pillow. It’s hard to believe I could hate someone who looks so kind—his eyebrows turn upward naturally, and he has a wide, white smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice decorations,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I do something to you that I’m unaware of?” I demand. I grab the corner of a sheet and yank it away from the mattress. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but we are in the same faction now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what you’re referring to,” he says lightly. Then he glances at me. “And you and I will never be in the same faction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head as I remove my pillowcase from the pillow. Don’t get angry. He wants to get a rise out of me; he won’t. But every time he fluffs his pillow, I think about punching him in the gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl walks in, and I don’t even have to ask him to help me; he just walks over and strips bedding with me. I will have to scrub the bed frame later. Al carries the stack of sheets to the trash can and together we walk toward the training room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ignore him,” Al says. “He’s an idiot, and if you don’t get angry, he’ll stop eventually.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” I touch my cheeks. They are still warm with an angry blush. I try to distract myself. “Did you talk to Will?” I ask quietly. “After…you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. He’s fine. He isn’t angry.” Al sighs. “Now I’ll always be remembered as the first guy who knocked someone out cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are worse ways to be remembered. At least they won’t antagonize you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are better ways too.” He nudges me with his elbow, smiling. “First jumper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I was the first jumper, but I suspect that’s where my Dauntless fame begins and ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat. “One of you had to get knocked out, you know. If it hadn’t been him, it would have been you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still, I don’t want to do it again.” Al shakes his head, too many times, too fast. He sniffs. “I really don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reach the door to the training room and I say, “But you have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has a kind face. Maybe he is too kind for Dauntless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the chalkboard when I walk in. I didn’t have to fight yesterday, but today I definitely will. When I see my name, I stop in the middle of the step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy opponent is Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh no,” says Christina, who shuffles in behind us. Her face is bruised, and she looks like she is trying not to limp. When she sees the board, she crumples the muffin wrapper she is holding into her fist. “Are they serious? They’re really going to make you fight him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter is almost a foot taller than I am, and yesterday, he beat Drew in less than five minutes. Today Drew’s face is more black-and-blue than flesh-toned. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/divergent-divergent-1/page-9.html","bookId":1698,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:44 AM"}
