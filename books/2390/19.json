Then she pulled out her phone, scrolled to find Fuji’s number, and dialed. Annoyingly, it went to voicemail. Just like her six other calls to Fuji in the past twenty-four hours had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Spencer Hastings again,” Spencer said after the beep. “I’m just checking about that extra security detail on my friend Chase—I’m really worried about him. Also, I think my sister might need one, too. And you got the Acura keychain, right? And my letter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday, because e-mailing was far too risky, she’d hand-delivered to Fuji a letter of connections and leads. Like how Ali and/or Helper A had been in New York a few months ago when Spencer, her mom, Mr. Pennythistle, and his son and daughter visited—Spencer had gotten an A note practically the second Mr. Pennythistle walked in on Spencer and his son, Zach, in bed together. Maybe Team A was staying in the Hudson Hotel, too. Perhaps it would be useful to search Amtrak passenger manifests from around that time. There were tons of avenues to investigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, give me a call back when you can,” Spencer chirped. Then she hung up and turned into Rosewood Day. After parking the car, she trudged through the wet grass to the elementary-school swings, where she and her friends always met to talk—they hadn’t spoken about A in a while, and maybe it was time. Emily dangled languidly from a low swing, her long legs dragging on the ground. Aria pulled the strings on the hood of her bright-green jacket. Hanna checked her reflection in a round Chanel compact. It was one of those beautiful spring mornings where practically the whole senior class was lingering outside before the bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what’s the news?” Spencer asked her friends when she approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, Sean Ackard’s now officially a stalker,” Aria mumbled. She gestured to a clump of kids on the stairs. Both Sean and Klaudia Huusko, the Kahns’ exchange student, were staring at them. When they noticed the girls looking back, they turned away fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe Sean likes you again, Hanna,” Emily teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or maybe it’s about those suicide rumors.” Aria looked at Hanna. “Sean gave me a pamphlet the other day for a support group at his church. He was looking at me like I was going to slit my wrists right there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna rolled her eyes. “I’m getting sick of those rumors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer cocked her head. “I wonder if the cops questioned Sean about Kyla.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna shrugged. “There were cops all over the burn clinic. They probably did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria scratched her chin. “Maybe Fuji slipped and admitted that Kyla was secretly Ali.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer twisted her mouth. “I thought Fuji wanted to keep that a secret. Not freak out anyone until they were close to tracking her down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, maybe this means they have tracked her down,” Hanna said excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dreamy smile spread across Aria’s lips. “Guys, can you imagine it? Ali behind bars. For real this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone paused, the fantasy sinking in. Spencer pictured Ali in a prison jumpsuit, stamping out license plates, guarded twenty-four hours a day. That bitch totally deserved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once they catch her, we’re going to have to do a lot more interviews,” Aria pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but cool interviews,” Hanna said. “Like on Oprah. Jimmy Fallon. Not the six-o’clock local crap where they don’t even spring for a makeup artist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stopped swinging. “Speaking of the suicide rumors, has anyone told you they’ve gotten anonymous notes about us wanting to hurt ourselves?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s eyes widened, and then she nodded. “Mike did. And so did my dad.” She rolled her eyes. “I don’t know if it was from Team A, though, or someone just messing with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily suddenly looked worried. “My sister got one like that, too. Saying something like we’re all really upset and we might go off the rails. What do you think that’s about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer waved her hand dismissively. “It’s all over school that we have some sort of suicide pact going. It’s such a stupid rumor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you don’t think they’re from A?” Emily asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even if they are, does it matter?” Spencer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, sirens blared. Four black SUVs raced up the drive, swerving around the buses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone on the sidewalk and in the Commons stopped and stared. Elementary-age kids dropped from the climbing domes and gawked. Teachers stepped out of their classrooms, their faces sheet-white. The cars screeched to a stop by the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer reached over and grabbed Aria’s hand. “Guys, maybe this is it. Maybe they found Ali today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first cruiser door opened, and a tall agent who could have been Will Smith’s Men in Black body double stepped out. Spencer leaned forward, expecting to see Ali slumped in the backseat, handcuffs around her wrists, but the seat was empty. A second SUV door opened, and a shorter, chubbier agent, still intimidating in his mirrored sunglasses, got out and slammed it shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agents strode across the lawn toward the girls, their faces grave. Spencer’s heart hammered fast. Whatever news they had, it was big. Serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill Smith Look-alike stared hard at the four of them. “Spencer Hastings? Aria Montgomery? Emily Fields? Hanna Marin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?” Spencer’s voice cracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria squeezed her hand tight. Hanna’s lips parted. Spencer could feel the stares of her classmates. And at the curb, another figure stood by the SUVs. Agent Fuji. She had her arms crossed over her chest, and there was a proud, satisfied look on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it, Spencer thought. They really did find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second agent stepped forward. At first, Spencer thought it was to take her hand, but then he revealed a pair of shiny handcuffs. He quickly and deftly secured them to her wrists with a snap. Then he did the same to Aria. Will Smith cuffed Hanna and Emily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“W-what the hell?” Aria wailed, jolting away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t try to run, girls,” the second agent said in a low voice. “You’re under arrest for the murder of Tabitha Clark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Spencer shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Us?” Emily screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first agent spoke over them. “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men pushed Spencer and the others toward the cars. Spencer’s feet tumbled over each other across the grass and the sidewalk. Fuji’s face loomed before her, her satisfied smile still there. “What are you doing?” Spencer wailed at her. “This is a mistake!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuji sank into one hip. “Is it, Spencer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the notes we gave you?” Hanna called out. “Everything we told you? What about A?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuji removed her Ray-Bans. The expression in her eyes was derisive, absolute. “We retrieved IP information on every single text and e-mail sent from A. We dusted every postcard and handwritten note for prints. And you know what we found?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer blinked. Next to her, Aria shifted. “What?” Emily whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuji stepped forward, drawing the girls into a circle. “Every one of those texts came from one of your phones,” she hissed. “Every note, every picture had only your fingerprints on it, no one else’s. The only A in your lives, girls, is the four of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRISON BLUES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria sat up like a shot and looked around. She was sprawled out on the floor of a dingy cinder-block cell. The fetid scent of urine and sweat wafted through the air, and she could hear angry shouts and swears through the walls. She was locked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria?” It was Spencer, who was in the next cell over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Y-yeah?” Aria turned toward the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were mumbling really loudly,” Spencer whispered. “Were you sleeping?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria ran her hand through her gnarled hair. She must have passed out from fear and shock. She doubted she’d been out for long, though—light still streamed through the small window at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe past few hours twisted in her head like a tornado. After the bombshell at Rosewood Day, the police had shoved the four of them into separate cars and driven them to holding cells at the Rosewood jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn’t be true. A had orchestrated this. Only . . . how? Once again, Aria relived the moment Fuji had told them that every single A note they’d received had been from their phones. It was like those dreams she sometimes had where she tried to dial an emergency phone number again and again, but the buttons kept disintegrating. She felt trapped. Helpless. Voiceless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria glanced at the window near the ceiling of her cell. The light was dimmer; maybe a few hours had passed. Did her parents know about their arrest? Had the news picked up the story; was Aria’s face plastered all over CNN? She pictured Noel watching from his couch, slack-jawed. She imagined Asher the artist paling as he read a Google Alert, and she pictured her artistic future as a drawing on a chalkboard slowly being erased. She envisioned her parents and Mike getting a phone call and sinking to their knees, inconsolable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone rapped at the bars, and Aria shot up. A familiar man in a well-fitting suit stood outside her cell. “Dad?” Spencer’s voice rang out from down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Spencer.” Mr. Hastings sounded very serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here?” Spencer called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My firm is going to represent you. All of you.” He looked up and down the cells. “My associate is with me, and he’s working on posting bail for all four of you. You’ll be out of here soon, don’t worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria ran her tongue over her teeth. She’d never known Mr. Hastings well—even on weekends, he was always out doing something, whether it was going on marathon bike rides or taking care of the lawn or playing a round of golf—but he’d always seemed friendly and caring. He’d look out for them, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Hastings glanced down the hall, then leaned forward. “But we’d like to speak to you about a few things while we’re here. My associate Mr. Goddard is going to question you—criminal cases are more his area of expertise. But you’re in good hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCriminal cases. Aria almost threw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, they’ve allowed us a conference room,” Mr. Hastings said, clapping his hands. “We have twenty minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed, and there were footsteps and the jingling of keys. The bristly-haired police officer, Gates, appeared, unlocking the girls’ cells one by one. “Conference room’s that way,” he said, jutting a finger to the end of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria struggled to stand. Her legs felt cramped and weak, as though she’d been a prisoner for years instead of hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed Mr. Hastings into the small, square, cinder-block room she and the others had sat in more than a year ago, not long before Jenna Cavanaugh’s body was found in her backyard. It was very cold inside. A pitcher of water sat in the center of the table, a stack of plastic cups next to it. The room smelled vaguely of vomit. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deadly-pretty-little-liars-14/page-19.html","bookId":2390,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:50 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:50 AM"}
