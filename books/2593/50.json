Who do they belong to?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Mr. Erlanger,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Erlanger from Lehman\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Mr. Erlanger from Salomon Brothers,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I ever tell you that I want to wear a big yellow smiley-face mask and then put on the CD version of Bobby McFerrin\u0027s \u0027Don\u0027t Worry, Be Happy\u0027 and then take a girl and a dog - a collie, a chow, a sharpei, it doesn\u0027t really matter - and then hook up this transfusion pump, this IV set, and switch their blood, you know, pump the dog\u0027s blood into the hardbody and vice versa, did I ever tell you this?\" While I\u0027m speaking I can hear the girl working on my feet humming one of the songs from Les Miserables to herself, and then Helga runs a moistened cotton ball across my nose, leaning close to the face, inspecting the pores. I laugh maniacally, then take a deep breath and touch my chest - expecting a heart to be thumping quickly, impatiently, but there\u0027s nothing there, not even a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh, Mr. Bateman,\" Helga says, running a warm loofah sponge over my face, which stings then cools the skin. \"Relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" I say. \"I\u0027m relaxing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Mr. Bateman,\" Helga croons, \"you have such a nice complexion. How old are you? May I ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m twenty-six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, that\u0027s why. It\u0027s so clean. So smooth.\" She sighs. \"Just relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drift, my eyes rolling back into my head, the Muzak version of \"Don\u0027t Worry, Baby\" drowning out all bad thoughts, and I start thinking only positive things - the reservations I have tonight with Marcus Halberstam\u0027s girlfriend, Cecelia Wagner, the mashed turnips at Union Square Cafe, skiing down Buttermilk Mountain in Aspen last Christmas, the new Huey Lewis and the News compact disc, dress shirts by Ike Behar, by Joseph Abboud, by Ralph Lauren, beautiful oiled hardbodies eating each other\u0027s pussies and ass**les under harsh video lights, truckloads of arugula and cilantro, my tan line, the way the muscles in my back look when the lights in my bathroom fall on them at the right angle, Helga\u0027s hands caressing the smooth skin on my face, lathering and spreading cream and lotions and tonics into it admiringly, whispering, \"Oh Mr. Bateman, your face is so clean and smooth, so clean,\" the fact that I don\u0027t live in a trailer park or work in a bowling alley or attend hockey games or eat barbecued ribs, the look of the AT\u0026amp;T building at midnight, only at midnight. Jeannie comes in and starts the manicure, first clipping and filing the nails, then brushing them with a sandpaper disk to smooth out the remaining edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time I\u0027d prefer them a bit longer, Jeannie,\" I warn her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently she soaks them in warm lanolin cream, then dries both hands off and uses a cuticle moisturizer, then removes all the cuticles while cleaning under the nails with a cotton-on-wood stick. A heat vibrator massages the hand and forearm. The nails are buffed first with chamois and then with bung lotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDate with Evelyn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn comes in on the call waiting of my third line and I wasn\u0027t going to take it, but since I\u0027m holding on the second line to find out if Bullock, the maitre d\u0027 at the new Davis Fran\u0026amp;ccedil;ois restaurant on Central Park South, has any cancellations for tonight so Courtney (holding on the first line) and I might have dinner, I pick it up in the hope that it\u0027s my dry cleaners. But no, it\u0027s Evelyn and though it really isn\u0027t fair to Courtney, I take her call. I tell Evelyn I\u0027m on the other line with my private trainer. I then tell Courtney I have to take Paul Owen\u0027s call and that I\u0027ll see her at Turtles at eight and then I cut myself off from Bullock, the maitre d\u0027. Evelyn\u0027s staying at the Carlyle since the woman who lives in the brownstone next to hers was found murdered last night, decapitated, and this is why Evelyn\u0027s all shook up. She couldn\u0027t deal with the office today so she spent the afternoon calming herself with facials at Elizabeth Arden. She demands that we have dinner tonight, and then says, before I can make up a plausible lie, an acceptable. excuse, \"Where were you last night, Patrick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause. \"Why? Where were you?\" I ask, while guzzling from a liter of Evian, still slightly sweaty from this afternoon\u0027s workout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arguing with the concierge at the Carlyle,\" she says, sounding rather pissed off. \"Now tell me, Patrick, where were you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-50.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
