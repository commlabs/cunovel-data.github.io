{"id":69656,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"\u003cp\u003eAt ten of noon, Sam Marten hitched his way out of the taxicab, trying as usual to open the door with one hand, hold his briefcase in another and reach for his wallet with a third. Having only two hands, he found it a difficult job and, again as usual, he thudded his knee against the cab-door and found himself still groping uselessly for his wallet when his feet touched pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe traffic of Madison Avenue inched past. A red truck slowed its crawl reluctantly, then moved on with a rasp as the light changed. White script on its side informed an unresponsive world that its ownership was that of F. Lewkowitz and Sons, Wholesale Clothiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevkowich, thought Marten with brief inconsequence, and finally fished out his wallet. He cast an eye on the meter as he clamped his briefcase under his arm. Dollar sixty-five, make that twenty cents more as a tip, two singles gone would leave him only one for emergencies, better break a fiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said, \"take out one-eighty-five, bud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" said the cabbie with mechanical insincerity and made the change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarten crammed three singles into his wallet, put it away, lifted his briefcase and breasted the human currents on the sidewalk to reach the glass doors of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevkovich? he thought sharply, and stopped. A passerby glanced off his elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" muttered Marten, and made for the door again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevkovich? That wasn\u0027t what the sign on the truck had said. The name had read Lewkowitz, Lookoh-itz. Why did he think Levkovich? Even with his college German in the near past changing the w\u0027s to v\u0027s, where did he get the \"-ich\" from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevkovich? He shrugged the whole matter away roughly. Give it a chance and it would haunt him like a Hit Parade tinkle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcentrate on business. He was here for a luncheon appointment with this man, Naylor. He was here to turn a contract into an account and begin, at twenty-three, the smooth business rise which, as he planned it, would marry him to Elizabeth in two years and make him a paterfamilias in the suburbs in ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered the lobby with grim firmness and headed for the banks of elevators, his eye catching at the white-lettered directory as he passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a silly habit of his to want to catch suite numbers as he passed, without slowing, or (heaven forbid) coming to a full halt. With no break in his progress, he told himself, he could maintain the impression of belonging, of knowing his way around, and that was important to a man whose job involved dealing with other human beings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKulin-etts was what he wanted, and the word amused him. A firm specializing in the production of minor kitchen gadgets, striving manfully for a name that was significant, feminine, and coy, all at once-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes snagged at the M\u0027s and moved upward as he walked. Mandel, Lusk, Lippert Publishing Company (two full floors), Lafkowitz, Kulin-etts. There it was-1024. Tenth floor. OK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, after all, he came to a dead halt, turned in reluctant fascination, returned to the directory, and stared at it as though he were an out-of-towner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLafkowitz?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of spelling was that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear enough. Lafkowitz, Henry }., 701. With an A. That was no good. That was useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUseless? Why useless? He gave his head one violent shake as though to clear it of mist. Damn it, what did he care how it was spelled? He turned away, frowning and angry, and hastened to an elevator door, which closed just before he reached it, leaving him flustered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother door opened and he stepped in briskly. He tucked his briefcase under his arm and tried to look bright alive-junior executive in its finest sense. He had to make an impression on Alex Naylor, with whom so far he had communicated only by telephone. If he was going to brood about Lewkowitzes and Lafkowitzes-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator slid noiselessly to a halt at seven. A youth in shirt-sleeves stepped off, balancing what looked like a desk-drawer in which were three J containers of coffee and three sandwiches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, just as the doors began closing, frosted glass with black lettering S\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eloomed before Marten\u0027s eyes. It read: 701-henry j. lefkowitz-importer and was pinched off by the inexorable coming together of the elevator doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarten leaned forward in excitement. It was his impulse to say: Take me back down to 7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were others in the car. And after all, he had no reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet there was a tingle of excitement within him. The Directory had been wrong. It wasn\u0027t A, it was E. Some fool of a non-spelling menial with a packet of small letters to go on the board and only one hind foot to do it with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLefkowitz. Still not right, though. Again, he shook his head. Twice. Not right for what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator stopped at ten and Marten got off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex Naylor of Kulin-etts turned out to be a bluff, middle-aged man with a shock of white hair, a ruddy complexion, and a broad smile. His palms were dry and rough, and he shook hands with a considerable pressure, putting his left hand on Marten\u0027s shoulder in an earnest display of friendliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Be with you in two minutes. How about eating right here in the building? Excellent restaurant, and they\u0027ve got a boy who makes a good martini. That sound all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Fine.\" Marten pumped up enthusiasm from a somehow-clogged reservoir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nearer ten minutes than two, and Marten waited with the usual uneasiness of a man in a strange office. He stared at the upholstery on the chairs and at the little cubby-hole within which a young and bored switchboard operator sat. He gazed at the pictures on the wall and even made a half-hearted attempt to glance through a trade journal on the table next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he did not do was think of Lev-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not think of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restaurant was good, or it would have been good if Marten had been perfectly at ease. Fortunately, he was freed of the necessity of carrying the burden of the conversation. Naylor talked rapidly and loudly, glanced over the menu with a practiced eye, recommended the Eggs Benedict, and commented on the weather and the miserable traffic situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn occasion, Marten tried to snap out of it, to lose that edge of fuzzed absence of mind. But each time the restlessness would return. Something was wrong. The name was wrong. It stood in the way of what he had to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith main force, he tried to break through the madness. In sudden verbal clatter, he led the conversation into the subject of wiring. It was reckless of him. There was no proper foundation; the transition was too abrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the lunch had been a good one; the dessert was on its way; and Naylor responded nicely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe admitted dissatisfaction with existing arrangements. Yes, he had been looking into Marten\u0027s firm and, actually, it seemed to him that, yes, there was a chance, a good chance, he thought, that-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand came down on Naylor\u0027s shoulder as a man passed behind his chair. \"How\u0027s the boy, Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaylor looked up, grin ready-made and flashing. \"Hey, Lefk, how\u0027s business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t complain. See you at the-\" He faded into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarten wasn\u0027t listening. He felt his knees trembling, as he half-rose. \"Who was that man?\" he asked, intensely. It sounded more peremptory than he intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who? Lefk? Jerry Lefkovitz. You know him?\" Naylor stared with cool surprise at his lunch companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. How do you spell his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"L-E-F-K-O-V-I-T-Z, I think. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a V?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An F. . . . Oh, there\u0027s a V in it, too.\" Most of the good nature had left Naylor\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarten drove on. \"There\u0027s a Lefkowitz in the building. With a W. You know, Lef-COW-itz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Room 701. This is not the same one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerry doesn\u0027t work in this building. He\u0027s got a place across the street. I don\u0027t know this other one. This is a big building, you know. I don\u0027t keep tabs on everyone in it. What is all this, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarten shook his head and sat back. He didn\u0027t know what all this was, anyway. Or at least, if he did, it was nothing he dared explain. Could he say: I\u0027m being haunted by all manner of Lefkowitzes today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"We were talking about wiring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaylor said, \"Yes. Well, as I said, I\u0027ve been considering your company. I\u0027ve got to talk it over with the production boys, you understand. I\u0027ll let you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" said Marten, infinitely depressed. Naylor wouldn\u0027t let him know. The whole thing was shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, through and beyond his depression, there was still that restlessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hell with Naylor. All Marten wanted was to break this up and get on with it. (Get on with what? But the question was only a whisper. Whatever did the questioning inside him was ebbing away, dying down . . .)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lunch frayed to an ending. If they had greeted each other like long-separated friends at last reunited, they parted like strangers Marten felt only relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left with pulses thudding, threading through the tables, out of the haunted building, onto the haunted street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaunted? Madison Avenue at 1:20 p.m. in an early fall afternoon with the sun shining brightly and ten thousand men and women be-hiving its long straight stretch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Marten felt the haunting. He tucked his briefcase under his arm and headed desperately northward. A last sigh of the normal within him warned him he had a three o\u0027clock appointment on 36th Street. Never mind. He headed uptown. Northward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 54th Street, he crossed Madison and walked west, came abruptly to a halt and looked upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sign on the window, three stories up. He could make it out clearly: a. s. lefkowich, certified accountant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had an F and an OW, but it was the first \"-ich\" ending he had seen. The first one. He was getting closer. He turned north again on Fifth Avenue, hurrying through the unreal streets of an unreal city, panting with the chase of something, while the crowds about him began to fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sign in a ground floor window, m. r. lefkowicz, m.d.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small gold-leaf semi-circle of letters in a candy-store window: jacob levkow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Half a name, he thought savagely. Why is he disturbing me with half a name?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets were empty now except for the varying clan of Lefkowitz, Levkowitz, Lefkowicz to stand out in the vacuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dimly aware of the park ahead, standing out in painted motionless green. He turned west. A piece of newspaper fluttered at the corner of his eyes, the only movement in a dead world. He veered, stooped, and picked it up, without slackening his pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in Yiddish, a torn half-page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t read it. He couldn\u0027t make out the blurred Hebrew letters, and could not have read it if they were clear. But one word was clear. It stood out in dark letters in the center of the page, each letter clear in its every serif. And it said Lefkovitsch, he knew, and as he said it to himself, he placed its accent on the second syllable: Lef-KUH-vich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let the paper flutter away and entered the empty park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trees were still and the leaves hung in odd, suspended attitudes. The sunlight was a dead weight upon him and gave no warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was running, but his feet kicked up no dust and a tuft of grass on which he placed his weight did not bend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there on a bench was an old man; the only man in the desolate park. He wore a dark felt cap, with a visor shading his eyes. From underneath it, tufts of gray hair protruded His grizzled beard reached the uppermost but-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eton of his rougb jacket. His old trousers were patched, and a strip of burlap was wrapped about each worn and shapeless shoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarten stopped. It was difficult to breathe. He could only say one word and he used it to ask his question: \"Levkovich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, while the old man rose slowly to his feet; brown old eyes peering close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marten,\" he sighed. \"Samuel Marten. You have come.\" The words sounded with an effect of double exposure, for under the English, Marten heard the faint sigh of a foreign tongue. Under the \"Samuel\" was the unheard shadow of a \"Schmu-el.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man\u0027s rough, veined hands reached out, then withdrew as though he were afraid to touch. \"I have been looking but there are so many people in this wilderness of a city-that-is-to-come. So many Martins and Martines and Mortons and Mertons. I stopped at last when I found greenery, but for a moment only-I would not commit the sin of losing faith. And then you came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is I,\" said Marten, and knew it was. \"And you are Phinehas Levkovich. Why are we here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Phinehas ben Jehudah, assigned the name Levkovich by the ukase of the Tsar that ordered family names for all. And we are here,\" the old man said, softly, \"because I prayed. When I was already old, Leah, my only daughter, the child of my old age, left for America with her husband, left the knouts of the old for the hope of the new. And my sons died, and Sarah, the wife of my bosom, was long dead and I was alone. And the time came when I, too, must die. But I had not seen Leah since her leaving for the far country and word had come but rarely. My soul yearned that I might see sons bom unto her; sons of my seed; sons in whom my soul might yet live and not die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was steady and the soundless shadow of sound beneath his words was the stately roll of an ancient language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I was answered and two hours were given me that I might see the first son of my line to be born in a new land and in a new time. My daughter\u0027s daughter\u0027s daughter\u0027s son, have I found you, then, amidst the splendor of this city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why the search? Why not have brought us together at once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because there is pleasure in the hope of the seeking, my son,\" said the old man, radiantly, \"and in the delight of the finding. I was given two hours in which I might seek, two hours in which I might find . . . and behold, thou art here, and I have found that which I had not looked to see in life.\" His voice was old, caressing. \"Is it well with thee, my son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is well, my father, now that I have found thee,\" said Marten, and dropped to his knees. \"Give me thy blessing, my father, that it may be well with me all the days of my life, and with the maid whom I am to take to wife and the little ones yet to be bom of my seed and thine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eiflP He felt the old hand resting lightly on his head and there was only the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esoundless whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarten rose. The old man\u0027s eyes gazed into his yearningly. Were they losing focus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I go to my fathers now in peace, my son,\" said the old man, and Marten was alone in the empty park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an instant of renewing motion, of the Sun taking up its interrupted task, of the wind reviving, and even with that first instant of sensation, all slipped back-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt ten of noon, Sam Marten hitched his way out of the taxicab, and found himself groping uselessly for his wallet while traffic inched on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red truck slowed, then moved on. A white script on its side announced: F. Lewkowitz and Sons, Wholesale Clothiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarten didn\u0027t see it. Yet somehow he knew that all would be well with him. Somehow, as never before, he knew. ... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-42.html","bookId":1734,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM"}
