{"id":66007,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"What happened a year and a half ago?\" Reacher asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer. They were on a long straight deserted road, with the sun just about dead-center above them. Heading south and near noon, he figured. The road was made of patched blacktop, smooth enough, but the shoulders were ragged. There were lonely billboards at random intervals, advertising gas and accommodations and markets many miles ahead. Either side of the road the landscape was flat and parched and featureless, dotted here and there with still windmills in the middle distance. There were automobile engines mounted on concrete pads, closer to the road. Big V-8s, like you would see under the hood of an ancient Chevrolet or Chrysler, painted yellow and streaked with rust, with stubby black exhaust pipes standing vertically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Water pumps,\" Carmen said. \"For irrigating the fields. There was agriculture here, in the old days. Back then, gasoline was cheaper than water, so those things ran all day and all night. Now there\u0027s no water left, and gas has gotten too expensive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe land fell away on every side, covered with dry brush. On the far horizon southwest of the endless road, there might have been mountains a hundred miles away. Or it might have been a trick of the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hungry?\" she asked. \"If we don\u0027t stop we could pick Ellie up from school, and I\u0027d really like to do that. I haven\u0027t seen her since yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you want,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe accelerated until the big Cadillac was doing eighty and wallowing heavily over the undulations in the road. He straightened in his seat and tightened his belt against the reel. She glanced across at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe me yet?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced back at her. He had spent thirteen years as an investigator, and his natural instinct was to believe nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened a year and a half ago?\" he asked. \"Why did he stop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe adjusted her grip on the wheel. Opened her palms, stretched her fingers, closed them tight again on the rim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He went to prison,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For beating up on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Texas?\" she said. She laughed, just a yelp, like a short cry of pain. \"Now I know you\u0027re new here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing. Just watched Texas reel in through the windshield ahead of him, hot and brassy and yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just doesn\u0027t happen,\" she said. \"In Texas a gentleman would never raise his hand to a woman. Everybody knows that. Especially not a white gentleman whose family has been here over a hundred years. So if a greaseball whore wife dared to claim a thing like that, they\u0027d lock her up, probably in a rubber room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day her life changed forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what did he do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He evaded federal taxes,\" she said. \"He made a lot of money trading oil leases and selling drilling equipment down in Mexico. He neglected to tell the IRS about it. In fact, he neglected to tell the IRS about anything. One day they caught him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They put you in jail for that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face. \"Actually, they try hard not to. A first-time thing like that, they were willing to let him pay, you know, make proposals and so forth. A clean breast and a payback plan is what they\u0027re looking for. But Sloop was way too stubborn for that. He made them dig everything out for themselves. He was hiding things right up to the trial. He refused to pay anything. He even disputed that he owed them anything, which was ridiculous. And all the money was hidden behind family trusts, so they couldn\u0027t just take it. It made them mad, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they prosecuted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded at the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a vengeance,\" she said. \"A federal case. You know that expression? Making a federal case out of something? Now I see why people say that. Biggest fuss you ever saw. A real contest, the local good old boys against the Treasury Department. Sloop\u0027s lawyer is his best friend from high school, and his other best friend from high school is the DA in Pecos County, and he was advising them on strategy and stuff like that, but the IRS just rolled right over all of them. It was a massacre. He got three-to-five years. The judge set the minimum at thirty months in jail. And cut me a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing. She accelerated past a truck, the first vehicle they had seen in more than twenty miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was so happy,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll never forget it. A white-collar thing like that, after the verdict came in they just told him to present himself at the federal prison the next morning. They didn\u0027t drag him away in handcuffs or anything. He came home and packed a little suitcase. We had a big family meal, stayed up kind of late. Went upstairs, and that was the last time he hit me. Next morning, his friends drove him up to the jail, someplace near Abilene. A Club Fed is what they call it. Minimum security. It\u0027s supposed to be comfortable. I heard you can play tennis there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you visit him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pretend he\u0027s dead,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went quiet, and the car sped on toward the haze on the horizon. There were mountains visible to the southwest, unimaginably distant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Trans-Pecos,\" she said. \"Watch for the light to change color. It\u0027s very beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked ahead, but the light was so bright it had no color at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minimum thirty months is two and a half years,\" she said. \"I thought it safest to bet on the minimum. He\u0027s probably behaving himself in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, two and a half years,\" she said. \"I wasted the first one and a half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve still got twelve months. That\u0027s plenty of time for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quiet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk me through it,\" she said. \"We have to agree on what needs to be done. That\u0027s important. That way, you\u0027re seeing it exactly the same way I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me,\" she said. \"Please. Just theoretically for now, if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. Then he thought about it, from her point of view. From his, it was too easy. Disappearing and living invisibly was second nature to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to get away,\" he said. \"An abusive marriage, that\u0027s all a person can do, I guess. So, a place to live, and an income. That\u0027s what you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t sound much, when you say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any big city,\" he said. They have shelters. All kinds of organizations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Ellie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The shelters have baby-sitters,\" he said. \"They\u0027ll look after her while you\u0027re working. There are lots of kids in those places. She\u0027d have friends. And after a little while you could get a place of your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What job could I get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything,\" he said. \"You can read and write. You went to college.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I get there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On a plane, on a train, in a bus. Two one-way tickets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"What little I had ran out a week ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dress pretty sharp for a person with no money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mail order,\" she said. \"I have to get approval from Sloops lawyer. He signs the checks. So I\u0027ve got clothes. But what I haven\u0027t got is cash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could sell the diamond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to,\" she said. \"It\u0027s a fake. He told me it was real, but it\u0027s stainless steel and cubic zirconium. The jeweler laughed at me. It\u0027s worth maybe thirty bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be money in the house,\" he said. \"You could steal some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went quiet again, another fast mile south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m a double fugitive,\" she said. \"You\u0027re forgetting about Ellie\u0027s legal status. And that\u0027s the whole problem. Always has been. Because she\u0027s Sloop\u0027s child, too. If I transport her across a state line without his consent, then I\u0027m a kidnapper. They\u0027ll put her picture on milk cartons, and they\u0027ll find me, and they\u0027ll take her away from me, and I\u0027ll go to jail. They\u0027re very strict about it. Taking children out of a failed marriage is the number one reason for kidnapping today. The lawyers all warned me. They all say I need Sloop\u0027s agreement. And I\u0027m not going to get it, am I? How can I even go up there and ask him if he\u0027d consent to me disappearing forever with his baby? Someplace he\u0027ll never find either of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So don\u0027t cross the state line. Stay in Texas. Go to Dallas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not staying in Texas,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said it with finality. Reacher said nothing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not easy,\" she said. \"His mother watches me, on his behalf. That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t go ahead and sell the ring, even though I could have used the thirty bucks. She\u0027d notice, and it would put her on her guard. She\u0027d know what I\u0027m planning. She\u0027s smart. So if one day money is missing and Ellie is missing, I might get a few hours start before she calls the sheriff and the sheriff calls the FBI. But a few hours isn\u0027t too much help, because Texas is real big, and buses are real slow. I wouldn\u0027t make it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to be some way,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced back at her briefcase on the rear seat. The legal paperwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are lots of ways,\" she said. \"Procedures, provisions, wards of the court, all kinds of things. But lawyers are slow, and very expensive, and I don\u0027t have any money. There are pro-bono people who do it for free, but they\u0027re always very busy. It\u0027s a mess. A big, complicated mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it is,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it should be possible in a year,\" she said. \"A year\u0027s a long time, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I need you to forgive me for wasting the first year and a half. I need you to understand why. It was all so daunting, I kept putting it off. I was safe. I said to myself, plenty of time to go. You just agreed, twelve months is plenty of time for anything. So even if I was starting cold, right now, I could be excused for that, right? Nobody could say I\u0027d left it too late, could they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a polite beep from somewhere deep inside the dashboard. A little orange light started flashing in the stylized shape of a gas pump, right next to the speedometer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Low fuel,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s Exxon up ahead,\" he said. \"I saw a billboard. Maybe fifteen miles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need Mobil,\" she said. \"There\u0027s a card for Mobil in the glove box. I don\u0027t have any way of paying at Exxon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t even have money for gas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I ran out. Now I\u0027m charging it all to my mother-in-law\u0027s Mobil account. She won\u0027t get the bill for a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe steered one-handed and groped behind her for her pocketbook. Dragged it forward and dumped it on his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check it out,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there, with the bag on his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be poking through a lady\u0027s pocketbook,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to,\" she said. \"I need you to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused a beat and snapped it open and a soft aroma came up at him. Perfume and makeup. There was a hairbrush, tangled with long black hairs. A nail clipper. And a thin wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check it out,\" she said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a worn dollar bill in the money section. That was all. A solitary buck. No credit cards. A Texas driver\u0027s license, with a startled picture of her on it. There was a plastic window with a photograph of a little girl behind it. She was slightly chubby, with perfect pink skin. Shiny blond hair and bright lively eyes. A radiant smile filled with tiny square teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ellie,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s very cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is, isn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you sleep last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the car,\" she said. \"Motels are forty bucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine was nearer twenty,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything over a dollar, I haven\u0027t got it,\" she said. \"So it\u0027s the car for me. It\u0027s comfortable enough. Then I wait for the breakfast rush and wash up in some diner\u0027s restroom, when they\u0027re too busy to notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about eating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was slowing down, maybe trying to preserve the rest of her gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pay for it,\" Reacher said. \"You\u0027re giving me a ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another billboard, on the right shoulder. Exxon, ten miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O.K.,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll let you pay. But only so I can get back to Ellie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe accelerated again, confident the tank would last ten miles. Less than a gallon, Reacher figured, even with a big old engine like that. Even driving fast. He sat back and watched the horizon reel in. Then he suddenly realized what he should do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop the car,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just do it, O.K.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at him, puzzled, but she pulled over on the ragged shoulder. Left it with two wheels on the blacktop, the engine running, the air blasting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now wait,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited in the cold until the truck she had passed came through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now sit still,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe undipped his seat belt and squinted down and tore the pocket off his shirt. Cheap material, weak stitching, it came away with no trouble at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you wearing?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me exactly what you\u0027re wearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed. Fidgeted nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This dress,\" she said. \"And underwear. And shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show me your shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused a second, and then leaned down and worked her shoes off. Passed them across to him, one at a time. He checked them carefully. Nothing in them. He passed them back. Then he leaned forward and unbuttoned his shirt. Took it off. Passed it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting out now,\" he said. \"I\u0027m going to turn my back. Take all your clothes off and put the shirt on. Leave your clothes on the seat and then get out, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to help you, just do it. All of them, O.K.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out of the car and walked away. Turned around and stared down the road, back the way they had come. It was very hot. He could feel the sun burning the skin on his shoulders. Then he heard the car door open. He turned back and saw her climbing out, barefoot, wearing his shirt. It was huge on her. She was hopping from foot to foot because the road was burning her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can keep your shoes,\" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned in and picked them up and put them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now walk away and wait,\" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused again, and then moved ten feet away. He stepped back to the car. Her clothes were neatly folded on her seat. He ignored them. Reached back and searched her pocketbook again, and then the briefcase. Nothing there. He turned back to the clothes and shook them out. They were warm from her body. The dress, a bra, underpants. Nothing hidden in them. He laid them on the roof of the car and searched the rest of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him twenty minutes. He covered it completely. Under the hood, the whole of the interior, under the carpets, in the seats, under the seats, in the trunk, under the fenders, everywhere. He found nothing at all, and he was absolutely prepared to bet his life no civilian could conceal anything from him in an automobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O.K.,\" he called. \"Get dressed now. Same routine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited with his back turned until he heard her behind him. She was holding his shirt. He took it from her and put it back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that about?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I\u0027ll help you,\" he said. \"Because now I believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you really don\u0027t have any money,\" he said. \"No credit cards, either. Not in your wallet, and not hidden anyplace else. And nobody travels three hundred miles from home, not overnight, with absolutely no money. Not unless they\u0027ve got some real big problems. And a person with real big problems deserves some kind of help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing. Just ducked her head slightly, like she was accepting a compliment. Or offering one. They climbed back in the car and shut the doors. Sat for a minute in the cool air, and then she maneuvered back onto the road again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you\u0027ve got a year,\" he said. \"That\u0027s plenty of time. A year from now, you could be a million miles away. New start, new life. Is that what you want me for? To help you get away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing for a couple of minutes. A couple of miles. The road rolled down a slight hill, and then up again. There were buildings in the far distance, on the next crest. Probably the gas station. Maybe a tow-truck operation next to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now just agree with me,\" she said. \"A year is enough. So it\u0027s O.K. to have waited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" he said. \"A year is enough. It\u0027s O.K. to have waited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing more. Just drove straight ahead for the gas station, like her life depended on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first establishment was a junkyard. There was a long low shed made out of corrugated tin, with the front wall all covered with old hubcaps. Behind it was an acre of wrecked cars. They were piled five or six deep, with the older models at the bottom, like geological strata. Beyond the low shed was the turn for the gas station. It was old enough to have pumps with pointers instead of figures, and four public rest rooms instead of two. Old enough that a taciturn guy came out into the heat and filled your car for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cadillac took more than twenty gallons, which cost Reacher the price of a motel room. He passed the bills through his window and waved away a dollar in change. He figured the guy should have it. The outside temperature reading on the dash showed one hundred and eleven degrees. No wonder the guy didn\u0027t talk. Then he found himself wondering whether it was because the guy didn\u0027t like to see a beaner driving a white man around in a Cadillac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gracias, senor,\" Carmen said. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pleasure,\" he said. \"De nada, senorita.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak Spanish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" he said. \"I served all over, so I can say a few words in a lot of languages. But that\u0027s all. Except French. I speak French pretty well. My mother was French.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From Louisiana or Canada?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From Paris, France.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re half-foreign,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I feel a lot more than half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled like she didn\u0027t believe him and eased back to the road. The gas needle jumped up to F, which seemed to reassure her. She got the car straight in her lane and accelerated back to a cruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you should call me senora,\" she said. \"Not senorita. I\u0027m a married woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said. \"I guess you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went quiet for a mile. Settled back in the seat and rested both hands lightly on the bottom curve of the wheel. Then she took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O.K., here\u0027s the problem,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t have a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because a month ago his lawyer friend came out to the house. Told us there was some kind of deal on the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know for sure. Nobody told me exactly. My guess is Sloop\u0027s going to rat out some business associates in exchange for early release. I think his other friend is brokering it through the DA\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmen nodded. \"Yes, shit. They\u0027ve all been working their asses off, getting it going. I\u0027ve had to be all smiles, like oh great, Sloop\u0027s coming home early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But inside, I\u0027m screaming,\" she said. \"I left it too late, you see. A year and a half, I did nothing at all. I thought I was safe. I was wrong. I was stupid. I was sitting around in a trap without knowing it, and now it\u0027s sprung shut, and I\u0027m still in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded slowly. Hope for the best, plan for the worst. That was his guiding principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the progress on the deal?\" he asked. The car sped on south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s done,\" she said, in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So when does he get out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today\u0027s Friday,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t think they can do it on the weekend. So it\u0027ll be Monday, I expect. A couple of days, is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m scared,\" she said. \"He\u0027s coming home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" Reacher said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monday night,\" she said. \"He\u0027s going to start it all up again. It\u0027s going to be worse than ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s changed,\" Reacher said. \"Prison can change people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a useless thing to say. He could see it in her face. And in his experience, prison didn\u0027t change people for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s going to be worse than ever,\" she said. \"I know it. I know it for sure. I\u0027m in big trouble, Reacher. I can promise you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved her hands on the wheel. Closed her eyes tight, even though she was doing seventy miles an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it was me who told the IRS about him,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crown Victoria drove south, and then west, and then looped back north in a giant sweeping curve. It detoured over near the highway so it could fill up with gas at a self-service pump in a busy station. The driver used a stolen Amex card in the slot and then wiped his prints off it and dropped it in the trash next to the pump, with the empty oil bottles and the soda cans and the used paper towels covered with windshield dirt. The woman busied herself with a map and selected their next destination. Kept her finger on the spot until the driver got back in and squirmed around to take a look at it. \"Now?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just to check it out,\" she replied. \"For later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seemed like such a good plan,\" Carmen said. \"It seemed foolproof. I knew how stubborn he was, and how greedy he was, so I knew he wouldn\u0027t cooperate with them, so I knew he would go to jail, at least for a little while. Even if by some chance he didn\u0027t, I thought it might preoccupy him for a spell. And I thought it might shake some money loose for me, you know, when he was hiding it all. And it worked real well, apart from the money. But that seemed like such a small thing at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just called them. They\u0027re in the book. They have a whole section to take information from spouses. It\u0027s one of their big ways to get people. Normally it happens during divorces, when you\u0027re mad at each other. But I was already mad at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why haven\u0027t you gone ahead and got a divorce?\" he asked. \"Husband in jail is grounds, right? Some kind of desertion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced in the mirror, at the briefcase on the rear seat. \"It doesn\u0027t solve the problem with Ellie,\" she said. \"In fact, it makes it much worse. It alerts everybody to the possibility I\u0027ll leave the state. Legally, Sloop could require me to register her whereabouts, and I\u0027m sure he would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could stay in Texas,\" he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know,\" she said. \"But I can\u0027t. I just can\u0027t. I know I\u0027m being irrational, but I can\u0027t stay here, Reacher. It\u0027s a beautiful state, and there are nice people here, and it\u0027s very big, so I could get a long way away, but it\u0027s a symbol. Things have happened to me here that I have to get away from. Not just with Sloop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your call,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went quiet and concentrated on driving. The road reeled in. It was dropping down off of a wide flat mesa that looked the size of Rhode Island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The caprock,\" she said. \"It\u0027s limestone, or something. All the water evaporated about a million years ago and left the rock behind. Geological deposits, or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded vague. Her tour-guide explanation was less definitive than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you want me to do?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she said, although he was certain that she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help you run? I could do that, probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You picked me out,\" he said. \"You must have had something in mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing. He fell to thinking about the potential target group she had outlined to him. Out-of-work rodeo riders and roughnecks. Men of various talents, but he wasn\u0027t sure if beating a federal manhunt would be among them. So she had chosen well. Or lucked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to move fast,\" he said. \"Two days, you need to get started right now. We should pick Ellie up and turn the car around and get going. Vegas, maybe, for the first stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And do what there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pick up some ID,\" he said. \"Place like Vegas, we could find something, even if it\u0027s only temporary. I\u0027ve got some money. I can get more, if you need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t take your money,\" she said. \"That wouldn\u0027t be fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair or not, you\u0027re going to need money. You can pay me back later. Then maybe you should go back to L.A. You could start building some new paperwork there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quiet again, another mile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I can\u0027t run,\" she said. \"I can\u0027t be a fugitive. I can\u0027t be an illegal. Whatever else I am, I\u0027ve never been an illegal. I\u0027m not going to start being one now. And neither is Ellie. She deserves better than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You both deserve better than that,\" he said. \"But you\u0027ve got to do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a citizen,\" she said. \"Think about what that means to a person like me. I\u0027m not going to give it up. I\u0027m not going to pretend to be somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s your plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re my plan,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBull riders, roughnecks, a six-foot-five two-hundred-fifty-pound ex-military cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to be your bodyguard?\u0027\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made no reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carmen, I\u0027m sorry about your situation,\" he said. \"Believe me, I really am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can\u0027t be your bodyguard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be,\" he said again. \"It\u0027s ridiculous. What do you think is going to happen? You think I\u0027m going to be with you twenty-four hours a day? Seven days a week? Making sure he doesn\u0027t hit you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reply. A huge highway interchange sprawled across the empty landscape, miles away in the haze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s ridiculous,\" he said again. \"I could warn him off, I guess. I could scare him. I could smack him around a little, to back up the message. But what happens when I\u0027m gone? Because sooner or later, I\u0027m going to be gone, Carmen. I\u0027m not going to stay around. I don\u0027t like to stay anywhere. And it\u0027s not just me. Face it, nobody is going to stay around. Not long enough. Not ten years. Or twenty, or thirty or however long it is until he ups and dies of old age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reply. No effect, either. It wasn\u0027t like what he was saying was a big disappointment to her. She just listened and drove, fast and smooth, and silent, like she was biding her time. The highway cloverleaf grew larger and nearer and she swooped onto it and around it and headed due west, following a big green sign that said: PECOS 75 MILES.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want a bodyguard,\" she said. \"I agree, that would be ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what am I supposed to be for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe settled onto the highway, center lane, driving faster than before. He watched her face. It was completely blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I supposed to be for?\" he asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. \"I can\u0027t say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth. Closed it again. Swallowed hard, and said nothing. He stared at her. Bull riders, roughnecks, an ex-MP. Clay Allison\u0027s grave, the fancy inscription, the obituary in the Kansas City newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are crazy,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\" The spots of color came back to her face, the size of quarters, burning red high above her cheekbones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Totally crazy,\" he said. \"And you can forget about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t forget about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want him dead, Reacher,\" she said. \"I really do. It\u0027s my only way out, literally. And he deserves it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me you\u0027re kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not kidding,\" she said. \"I want him killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. Stared out of the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just forget all about it,\" he said. \"It\u0027s absurd. This isn\u0027t the Wild West anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it? Isn\u0027t it still O.K. to kill a man who needs killing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she went quiet, just driving, like she was waiting him out. He stared at the speeding landscape in front of him. They were heading for the distant mountains. The blazing afternoon sun made them red and purple. It changed the color of the air. The Trans-Pecos, she had called them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Reacher,\" she said. \"Please. At least think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing. Please? Think about it? He was beyond reaction. He dropped his eyes from the mountains and watched the highway. It was busy with traffic. A river of cars and trucks, crawling across the vastness. She was passing them all, one after another. Driving way too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not crazy,\" she said. \"Please. I tried to do this right. I really did. Soon as his lawyer told me about the deal, I saw a lawyer of my own, and then three more, and none of them could do anything for me as fast as a month. All they could do was tell me Ellie traps me exactly where I am. So then I looked for protection. I asked private detectives. They wouldn\u0027t do anything for me. I went to a security firm in Austin and they said yes, they could guard me around the clock, but it would be six men and nearly ten thousand dollars a week. Which is the same thing as saying no. So I tried, Reacher. I tried to do it right. But it\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I bought a gun,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And bullets,\" she said. \"It took all the cash I had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You picked the wrong guy,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why? You\u0027ve killed people before. In the army. You told me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This would be murder. Cold-blooded murder. It would be an assassination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it would be just the same. Just like the army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Carmen, it wouldn\u0027t be the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you take an oath or something? To protect people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the same,\" he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe passed an eighteen-wheeler bound for the coast, and the Cadillac rocked and shimmied through the superheated turbulent air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slow down,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I can\u0027t slow down. I want to see Ellie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched the dashboard in front of him, steadying himself. The freezing air from the vents blasted against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not going to crash. Ellie needs me. If it wasn\u0027t for Ellie, I\u0027d have crashed a long time ago, believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she eased off a little, anyway. The big rig crept back alongside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know this is a difficult conversation,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have to look at it from my point of view. Please, Reacher. I\u0027ve been through it a million times. I\u0027ve thought it through. I\u0027ve been from A to B to C to D, all the way to Z. Then again, and again. And again. I\u0027ve examined all the options. So this is all logical to me. And this is the only way. I know that. But it\u0027s hard to talk about, because it\u0027s new to you. You haven\u0027t thought about it before. It comes out of the blue. So I sound crazy and cold-blooded to you. I know that. I appreciate that. But I\u0027m not crazy or cold-blooded. It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve had the time to reach the conclusion, and you haven\u0027t. And this is the only conclusion, I promise you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever, I\u0027m not killing a guy I never saw before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hits me, Reacher,\" she said. \"He beats me, badly. Punches me, kicks me, hurts me. He enjoys it. He laughs while he does it. I live in fear, all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So go to the cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cop. There\u0027s only one. And he wouldn\u0027t believe me. And even if he did, he wouldn\u0027t do anything about it. They\u0027re all big buddies. You don\u0027t know how it is here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s coming home,\" she said. \"Can you imagine what he\u0027s going to do to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trapped, Reacher. I\u0027m boxed in, because of Ellie. Do you see that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why won\u0027t you help me? Is it the money? Is it because I can\u0027t pay you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m desperate,\" she said. \"You\u0027re my only chance. I\u0027m begging you. Why won\u0027t you do it? Is it because I\u0027m Mexican?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s because I\u0027m just a greaseball, right? A beaner? You\u0027d do it for a white woman? Like your girlfriend? I bet she\u0027s a white woman. Probably a blonde, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she\u0027s a blonde,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some guy was beating up on her, you\u0027d kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I would, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she ran off to Europe without you. Didn\u0027t want you to go with her. But you\u0027d do it for her, and you won\u0027t do it for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the same,\" he said for the third time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she said. \"Because I\u0027m just beaner trash. I\u0027m not worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s her name?\" she asked. \"Your girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jodie,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O.K., imagine Jodie over there in Europe. She\u0027s trapped in some bad situation, getting beat up every day by some maniac sadist. She tells you all about it. Bares her soul. Every horrible humiliating detail. What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKill him, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded like she could read his mind. \"But you won\u0027t do that for me. You\u0027d do it for the gringa, but not for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused a beat with his mouth halfway open. It was true. He would do it for Jodie Garber, but he wouldn\u0027t do it for Carmen Greer. Why not? Because it comes in a rush. You can\u0027t force it. It\u0027s a hot-blooded thing, like a drug in your veins, and you go with it. If it\u0027s not there, you can\u0027t go with it. Simple as that. He\u0027d gone with it before in his life, many times. People mess with him, they get what they get. They mess with Jodie, that\u0027s the same thing as messing with him. Because Jodie was him. Or at least she used to be. In a way that Carmen wasn\u0027t. And never would be. So it just wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not about gringas or latinas,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Carmen,\" he said. \"You need to understand that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what is it about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about I know her and I don\u0027t know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that makes a difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then get to know me,\" she said. \"We\u0027ve got two days. You\u0027re about to meet my daughter. Get to know us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing. She drove on. PECOS 55 MILES.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were a policeman,\" she said. \"You should want to help people. Or are you scared? Is that it? Are you a coward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could do it,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve done it before. So you know how. You could do it and get clean away. You could dump his body where nobody would find it. Out in the desert. Nobody would ever know. It wouldn\u0027t come back on you, if you were careful. You\u0027d never get caught. You\u0027re smart enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you smart enough? Do you know how? Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I know how,\" he said. \"But I won\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you why not. Because I\u0027m not an assassin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m desperate,\" she said. \"I need you to do this. I\u0027m begging you. I\u0027ll do anything if you\u0027ll help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want, Reacher? You want sex? We could do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop the car,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027ve had enough of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jammed her foot down hard on the gas. The car leapt forward. He glanced back at the traffic and leaned over toward her and knocked the transmission into N. The engine unloaded and screamed and the car coasted and slowed. He used his left hand on the wheel and hauled it around against her desperate grip and steered the car to the shoulder. It bounced off the blacktop and the gravel bit against the tires and the speed washed away. He jammed the lever into P and opened his door, all in one movement. The car skidded to a stop with the transmission locked. He slid out and stood up unsteadily. Felt the heat on his body like a blow from a hammer and slammed the door and walked away from her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/echo-burning-jack-reacher-5/page-3.html","bookId":2343,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:42 AM"}
