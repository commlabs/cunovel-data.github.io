I lean my back against the wall of the building and make a call with trembling fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet pound the treadmill with savagery. They\u0027re clawing at it. My heart is racing and my fingers are almost reaching for the handlebars. They don’t, because I never touch the handles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how long I\u0027ve been running at this pace. I just am, until I can\u0027t. I need to feel something and exhaustion seems like a harmless thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate the way I am. I hate the pity and understanding in Shell\u0027s eyes when I bail on her New Leaf trips and adventures. I hate the way Stuart notices my psychotic-ness and yet justifies my actions and makes my excuses for me. He lets me do it. They all let me get away with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get away with not improving or changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst is that I see it. I ride on their understanding and the pathetic way they see me. I\u0027m technically doing well. For people like me, breathing and eating and showering, is doing well. I hate doing well. I just want to be normal. I want to be his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push it back angrily and drive my feet harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of something takes me out of my raging run. The treadmill slows right down and stops. I\u0027m gasping and heaving for air. I bend forward immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wh-wh-what are you doing?\" I ask in between panting and coughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian is in my face, \"You trying to die?\" He\u0027s angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was fine.\" I\u0027m humiliated just seeing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran out on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hazel eyes are greener than normal. Against his olive skin they stand out, as does the worry and concern plastered to his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up straight and climb off the treadmill. He grabs my arm. I pull harshly. I stop myself mid pull and shake my head, \"Sor-sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his hand in the air fast, \"No. I\u0027m sorry. But you looked like you were about to pass out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands on my hips and pace, \"I was.\" I laugh and cough. My throat is ragged. I force myself to look at him, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"No. Don\u0027t be. I shouldn’t have grabbed at you.\" He still gets it. Even after running out o him, he gets it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"I mean about the penthouse.\" I clear my throat and notice it\u0027s not happy with me. It hurts like it\u0027s bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, looking crushed. \"Ah yes, the lovely dinner I had being made for you that you ran out on. Yes, I suppose you owe me an apology for that. The chef was at my place for five hours prepping. It was delicious. You missed out. Maybe next time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pace back and forth, \"I don’t have an excuse. I\u0027m just…well…I\u0027m sorry.\" I could cry any second. I\u0027m so embarrassed. I hate myself so much. I would do anything to make it okay, make me be normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls hand sanitizer from his jogging pants pocket and holds it up. I burst into laughter. He smiles, \"You\u0027ve got me addicted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pours some on my hands and then his. I rub them and walk for the wipe cloths. I tug a few out of the dispenser and go clean my machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs my water bottle. I can\u0027t drink from it now, but it was nice of him to grab it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sees me eyeballing his hands on my water bottle. He holds it out, \"Drink some.\" His eyes challenge me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him, \"I can\u0027t.\" I can\u0027t fight the frown on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands in front of me and shakes his head, \"Do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop and look at the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe speaks loudly, \"I\u0027ve cleaned my hands. I never touched anything before I touched it. Just have some water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only he knew what he was asking me. I shake my head and try to walk past him. He grabs my arm again. I don\u0027t pull away. He drags me into his embrace. He holds me tight to his chest. His shirt is damp with the sweat from his own workout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could die feeling the cold, damp fabric against my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink it, Emalyn. Please.\" His voice has become a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper back, \"How did you know I wouldn’t have any?\" He takes my hand in his and pulls me outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fresh air is nice. It\u0027s not one hundred percent fresh with the humidity but it\u0027s better than the recycled air in the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull at his hand, \"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes say things he doesn’t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerk my hand free, \"Which website did you check out?\" I hate being diagnosed. He isn’t the first person to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"I called my uncle. He recommended a friend. I told him that you saw that chef and that penthouse and you spazzed. Any normal girl would have died and gone to heaven for a guy to put that kind of effort in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sees how not normal I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw trembles. I point, \"I never asked you to be my friend. I never asked for your help.\" I stomp away. I would run but my legs are almost crippled from the run. It\u0027s a bad feeling. I ran so hard I can\u0027t run away when I need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear his footsteps behind me. My heart races. I look back, \"Just leave me alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and does the thing I asked him to do. He turns away and walks off. It disappoints me, which makes me mad at myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate being a predictable girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slow down as I reach my dorm. He\u0027s standing on the steps with his arms crossed, breathing heavily. He\u0027s run around the other side of the building to beat me here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn’t your uncle\u0027s friend explain about the paranoia, people like me get?\" I ask, trying desperately to be funny. I joke, praying he will give up on the water thing. The worst part about being me, is realizing how irrational I am. I only ever see it afterward. I know in an hour I\u0027ll be upset with myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian nods slowly, \"He did. He also said that the only way to help was to force you out of your comfort zone, one tiny baby step at a time. He walks down the steps and holds my water bottle out. \"Drink some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI panic, \"You\u0027ve taken it with you. You could have done something to it.\" I almost stutter. I see the irrational behavior but am incapable of stopping it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I sprinted around the building to beat you here. You know that it\u0027s impossible for me to even have longer than a second to unscrew it. I would have missed you if I had. Drink some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snatch the bottle as my anger flares, \"You\u0027re making a big deal about nothing.\" I snap at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The penthouse wasn\u0027t nothing. Baby steps, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New Leaf. If not for him, for me, I sigh, unscrewing the cap and I licking my lips. His eyes are hopeful. I can\u0027t stop the trembling hand or the twitching lips, as I lift it to my mouth. The warmth of the plastic makes me sick. I almost gag but I tilt it back. He watches every tremble. Every motion and emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blank my mind and let the liquid pour into the back of my mouth.\" My throat wants to close. My lips want to clamp shut. But I take the control and force myself to drink the liquid. I lower the bottle and screw the cap on. \"Happy?\" My words are cold and dead. I\u0027m angry and I hate that it\u0027s not entirely him I\u0027m mad at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even close.\" His voice is so hard and filled with disgust. I disgust him. I can see it. He walks away from me. Leaving me standing on the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the shower, I spend a long time trying to talk myself out of the crazy way I am acting. I like him. I like him a lot. But the crazy side of me has made up her mind. She hates him. She hates the challenges he creates. She likes the safety and comfort of the routine. There isn’t any point in arguing with her when she\u0027s lie this. I shut my mind down and try to relax and not think about the communal showers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rinse off and wrap myself in my robe. I shuffle down the hall, looking behind me several times. I despise the communal showers. It\u0027s the worst part of my day. I have to drag travel-sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner and put them through the dishwasher afterward. Not to mention the number of rubber shower shoes I\u0027ve gone through or the fact I can\u0027t touch the shower curtain with my bare hand, I always have wipes next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShell looks up from her phone when I walk in, \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I\u0027m tired of being a shell of a human. I would do anything to be a real girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grimaces but snorts, \"It\u0027s not that bad. You\u0027re getting better everyday. I never would have imagined you would make dorm life happen and look at you. And we went to the bar. And you\u0027ve eaten in restaurants. And Sebastian seems nice. Hot and nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"I don’t want to see him anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits up on her bed. \"Did he try something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"No. He\u0027s just like everyone else. He\u0027ll never see me.\" I lie back on the bed and close my eyes. She climbs on the bed with me and wraps herself around me. She smells like pumpkin-spice. It makes me happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer warmth and softness is comforting. I imagine it\u0027s what a mother feels like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let her wrap around me and be there. Be the wall that separates the girl I am and the girl I want to be. I feel her fingers at my ears. We\u0027re sharing ear buds, like we did when we were little. Mine smells like sani wipes. It makes me smile and feel grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBon Iver starts singing and I forget everything. It\u0027s me and her. I don’t need boys. I need her and ear buds, one for her and one for me. Mine has to be clean though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone vibrates. I grab it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hi. Are you having a good day?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m confused. \u0027Hi. Did Doctor Bradley up your meds? You seem cheerful.\u0027 It\u0027s brazen of me, but I don’t care at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Funny girl. What are you doing?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hanging out. Listening to music with Shell.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Call her Michelle please. What are you listening to?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin, \u0027Bon Iver.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Bon Iver is a very talented group. I\u0027ve been to four of their concerts.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \u0027No way.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Way! See how silly it sounds. Please speak like an adult.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. Michelle moans, \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s being funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin, \"Uncle Daddy Dude. He\u0027s been to like four of Bon Iver\u0027s concerts.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-8.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
