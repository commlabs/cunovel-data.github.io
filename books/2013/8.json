Bruthen Trana nodded, then turned and left the compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he was gone from sight, the Invigilator faced Tanal. ‘An embarrassment,’ he said. ‘Those unconscious ones.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA change of heads on the outer wall.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now, Tanal Yathvanar, before anything else, you must come with me. It will take but a moment, then you can return to the tasks at hand.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked back into the building, the Invigilator’s short steps forcing Tanal to slow up again and again as they made their way to Karos’s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most powerful man next to the Emperor himself look his place once more behind the desk. He picked up the cage of bronze pins, shifted a dozen or so in a flurry of precise moves, and the puzzle collapsed flat. Karos Invictad smiled across at Tanal, then flung the object onto the desk. ‘Despatch a missive to Senorbo in Bluerose. Inform him of the time required for me to find a solution, then add, from me to him, that I fear he is losing his touch.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad reached out for a scroll. ‘Now, what was our agreed percentage on my interest in the Inn of the Belly-up Snake?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I believe Rautos indicated forty-five, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good. Even so, I believe a meeting is in order with the Master of the Liberty Consign. Later this week will do. For all our takings of late, we still possess a strange paucity in actual coin, and I want to know why.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir, you know Rautos Hivanar’s suspicions on that matter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Vaguely. He will be pleased to learn I am now prepared to listen more closely to said suspicions. Thus, two issues on the agenda. Schedule the meeting for a bell’s duration. Oh, and one last thing, Tanal.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Bruthen Trana. These weekly visits. I want to know, is he compelled? Is this some Edur form of royal disaffection or punishment? Or are the bastards truly interested in what we’re up to? Bruthen makes no comment, ever. He does not even ask what punishments follow our judgements. Furthermore, his rude impatience tires me. It may be worth our while to investigate him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanal’s brows rose. ‘Investigate a Tiste Edur?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Quietly, of course. Granted, they ever give us the appearance of unquestioning loyalty, but I cannot help but wonder if they truly are immune to sedition among their own kind.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Even if they aren’t, sir, respectfully, are the Patriotists the right organization-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Patriotists, Tanal Yathvanar,’ said Karos sharply, ‘possess the imperial charter to police the empire. In that charter no distinction is made between Edur and Letherii, only between the loyal and the disloyal.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir.’ ‘\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now, I believe you have tasks awaiting you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanal Yathvanar bowed, then strode from the office. * * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe estate dominated a shelf of land on the north bank of Lether River, four streets west of Quillas Canal. Stepped walls marking its boundaries made their way down the hank, extending Out into the water-on posts to ease the current’s tug-more than two boat-lengths. Just beyond rose two mooring poles. There had been flooding this season. An infrequent occurrence in the past century, Kautos Hivanar noted as he leafed through the Estate Compendium-a family tome of notes and maps recording the full eight hundred years of Hivanar blood on this land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe settled back in the plush chair and, with contemplative languor, finished his balat tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house steward and principal agent, Venitt Sathad, quietly stepped forward to return the Compendium to the wood and iron chest sunk in the floor beneath the map table, then replaced the floorboards and unfurled the rug over the spot. His tasks completed, he stepped back to resume his position beside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRautos Hivanar was a large man, his complexion florid, his features robust. His presence tended to dominate a room, no matter how spacious. He sat in the estate’s library now, the walls shelved to the ceiling. Scrolls, clay tablets and bound books filled every available space, the gathered learning of a thousand scholars, many of whom bore the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eH ivanar name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs head of the family and overseer of its vast financial holdings, Rautos Hivanar was a busy man, and such demands on his intellect had redoubled since the Tiste Edur conquest-which had triggered the official formation and recognition of the Liberty Consign, an association of the wealthiest families in the Lether Empire-in ways he could never have imagined before. He would be hard-pressed to explain how he found all such activities tedious or enervating. Yet that was what they had become, even as his suspicions slowly, incrementally, resolved into certainties; even as he began to perceive that, somewhere out there, there was an enemy-or enemies-bent on the singular task of economic sabotage. Not mere embezzlement, an activity with which he was personally very familiar, but something more profound, all-encompassing. An enemy. To all that sustained Rautos Hivanar, and the Liberty Consign of which he was Master; indeed, to all that sustained the empire itself, regardless of who sat upon the throne, regardless even of those savage, miserable barbarians who were now preening at the very pinnacle of Letherii society, like grey-feathered jackdaws atop a hoard of baubles. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-8.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
