If Qin Xingxuan went to a mortal country, then with her Houtian realm strength, that was enough to guarantee her and Lin Ming’s parents’ safety. \u0026nbsp;As for the South Sea Demon Region, it was impossible for them to chase down a single unknown Houtian realm martial artist over a million miles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“I see…” Hearing that Qin Xingxuan and his parents were safe, Lin Ming let out a sigh of relief. As long as they were safe and alive then it was great. As for everything else that was lost, it could be taken back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eAt this time, Mu Qianyu finally discovered Lin Ming’s cultivation.

Two and a half years ago, Lin Ming was at the early Xiantian realm. After leaving for such a short time, he actually managed to break through to Revolving Core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eAnd looking at Lin Ming’s dantian, the energy was collected, the origin energy was dense, and a faint vortex could be vaguely seen.

This had taken a full eight years. But, Lin Ming had only used two and a half years, and he wasn’t even 21 years old yet!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eWhen Mu Qianyu was Lin Ming’s age, she was only at the peak Houtian realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eThis was simply the difference between the heavens and earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eThis was no longer something that could be described as just an Emperor level talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“Lin Ming… how strong are you now?” Mu Qianyu asked with wide eyes. When Lin Ming had left, he was at the early Xiantian realm and Mu Qianyu was at the extreme Xiantian realm. The difference between their strength hadn’t been too great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eNow Lin Ming had jumped an entire boundary. By all reasoning he should have strength at least equal to a late Revolving Core master. Or perhaps he could even compare with the weakest of Life Destruction powerhouses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eLin Ming naturally didn’t need to hide anything from Mu Qianyu. “I’m not too sure what the limits of my strength are. It’s only a rough estimate, but I can kill a first stage Life Destruction master. As for Xuan Yuqie and other second stage Life Destruction powerhouses, I’m probably not their match yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003e“You can kill a first stage Life Destruction powerhouse?” Mu Qianyu’s heart jumped.

It was a very special stage within the Revolving Core realm. For Life Destruction martial artists, their true essence was also located in their dantian’s Revolving Core. It was only because they experienced a remolding and transformation of their bodies and dantian that a Life Destruction martial artist’s strength far surpassed that of a Revolving Core martial artist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eIf Lin Ming could kill a first stage Life Destruction martial artist, what would happen once he reached Life Destruction?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding-left: 0;padding-right: 0\"\u003eAs Mu Qianyu thought of this, she was suddenly startled.
