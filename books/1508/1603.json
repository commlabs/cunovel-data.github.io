He had some of the pills and divine runic symbols he drew up at the Blue Moon Sect, and some of them were even decent in quality, but none of these things would be able to sell at a good enough price.

The Divine Runic Masters Guild often issued out missions.

But, these techniques weren’t particularly heaven-defying. Even if he contributed them, it was nothing but a drop in the ocean compared to the hundreds of millions of points he needed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf Lin Ming had a true heaven-defying technique, that would be the understandings of the Asura Heavenly Dao Laws described in the Asura Sutra First Volume. But, Lin Ming hadn’t even fully cultivated the Asura Sutra so it was impossible for him to copy down the intricate secrets within, and even if he could he wouldn’t reveal the tiniest secret related to the Asura Sutra.

Do you know how many points you will receive per mission at your level? I don’t know what you’ve been messing around with during these last 20 some years, but I could approximately guess it. A monstrous abnormality like you can surprise me, but no matter just how amazing your achievements have been in these 20 some years, you shouldn’t think of relying on that alone to earn enough points through missions. If you want to buy all the materials you want, I estimate you will need at least 3 billion points! Even if I wanted to earn 3 billion points I would have to work myself to the bone and I’d still have no idea how long it would be until I would have earned them all.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Ming had already thought of everything that Elder Xue spoke of. Although he had a shortcut to studying the divine runic arts and alchemy, in terms of grade, Lin Ming was still a fifth grade divine runic master. After all, the three divine runic masters Lin Ming killed had been at most at the sixth grade, and wanting to surpass them would take more time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTo practice to the point of being a fifth grade divine runic master in a mere 25 years was far too exaggerated; there wouldn’t be anyone who believed this.

Lin Ming had spent an unimaginable price to first establish the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace and then spent a considerable effort to obtain the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace section of the Celestial Tyrant Manual, finally finding a light on the road. It was impossible for him to give up now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Elder Xue, where is the special Mission Division?” Lin Ming asked.

At his age, it was no longer possible to increase his cultivation and he liked to idle his time away. Setting up a stall was just a casual lifestyle that Old Xue liked to live. He loved the sense of achievement of selling high and buying low, and also finding good treasures. The truth was that he didn’t need the stall for any income. This was what people meant by fishing for the fishing and not for the fish.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOld Xue brought Lin Ming through some ancient-looking corridors.
