It would be impossible for him to kill Lin Ming. If he were to stay, his avatar might be killed by Lin Ming and Mo Eversnow instead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi had already decided to withdraw, however, he was currently surrounded by the Primal God Pure Lands. Although the Catastrophic Pagoda was able to just barely resist it, wanting to escape from here would be difficult.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi didn’t want to loser this avatar. This was an avatar formed from severing his hand and he had even placed a wisp of his soul inside. If he lost it, it would consume a tremendous amount of his true self’s essence energy and cultivation, even damaging his soul.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBefore this, Tian Mingzi had been working with the saint race. With the help of the saints, Tian Mingzi had started to gradually touch upon the realm of a half-step Empyrean. Once he took this step, it would only be a matter of time for him to become an Empyrean. However, if he were to lose his avatar now, this would cause severe and lasting damage to his foundation, causing him to be stuck at the peak World King boundary for an even longer time. This was not a loss he could withstand; it would greatly affect his future boundary.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi’s ambitions were enormous. After coming into contact with the saints, he wasn’t even satisfied with becoming an Empyrean anymore. He wanted to become a True Divinity and even seek the true road to eternal life. How could he allow a portion of his mortal body to be destroyed like this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe remained absolutely vigilant as he probed the Primal God Pure Lands for any flaws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Do you think there is a chance you will be able to run away here?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMo Eversnow sneered. Her palms gathered together and then came apart as a beam of light appeared between them; this was an energy sword formed by pure condensed origin energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Today, you will leave this avatar of yours here!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMo Eversnow suddenly took a step forwards, cutting down at Tian Mingzi. At the same time Lin Ming also moved, the Phoenix Blood Spear in his hands revolving with the power of thunder and fire heavenly tribulation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHeavenly Dao Judgment!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMo Eversnow and Lin Ming, one left, one right, both of them rushing towards Tian Mingzi!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven if they were alone, either one of them could battle Tian Mingzi. In particular, Mo Eversnow could absolutely kill Tian Mingzi by herself. However, they didn’t wish to do such a thing. Facing scum like Tian Mingzi, anything like honorable martial arts conduct was nothing but a joke. To kill Tian Mingzi’s avatar with absolutely overwhelming strength was the only true righteous way to go about it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Damn it all!” Tian Mingzi grit his teeth. Behind him, the Catastrophic Pagoda began to shine with a brilliant light, stabilizing the skies above.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMeanwhile, he poured all of his strength into this pagoda. Asura demon god phantoms began to appear around Tian Mingzi, maintaining the final barrier of the Eternal Demon Domain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, anything he did was useless; the disparity between them was simply far too great, especially against Mo Eversnow. Within her Primal God Pure Lands, she was the absolute ruler, controlling all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA sword slashed down. Before the sword light arrived, the pressure of the blade and the Laws already came crashing down from the skies. Even within the Eternal Demon Domain, Tian Mingzi felt all of his blood vitality tumble around, his true essence becoming chaotic.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the same time, Lin Ming’s Heavenly Dao Judgment also arrived. The power of thunder and fire heavenly tribulation wove together into a sea of red and purple. Flames howled, thunder billowed!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKa ka ka ka!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe attacks from both sides combined together. The Catastrophic Pagoda violently trembled as cracks began to spread through its form like a growing spider web; it would soon break!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi’s face darkened. He forced out all the strength within his body, but no matter what he did, it was useless. In just several breaths of time, there was a loud shattering sound as the Catastrophic Pagoda broke apart, fading into ash!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi spat out a mouthful of blood and his body flew backwards!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi was tossed several miles away. But even though he was sent tumbling such a long distance away, the Primal God Pure Lands still followed him the entire time, covering him within so that he didn’t have the slightest chance to escape through the void.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi’s figure became increasingly blurry as his complexion turned gloomy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You will pay a deep price. Even if my avatar cannot escape here today, I will activate my arcane skill and leave behind a mark of my flesh and blood essence energy in your body. Then, in the future, my true self will chase you down to the ends of the world!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi made one final threat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hahahaha!” Lin Ming wildly laughed. “Do you hear yourself speaking? Do you understand how ridiculous you sound? You have colluded with the saint race. For your own ambitions, you did not even hesitate to betray your fellow man. After I return to the Divine Realm, I will announce this truth to the public. I believe that once Empyrean Divine Dream and Empyrean Vast Universe sea the corpse of the saint in my spatial ring, they will believe my words without a doubt. At that time, it won’t be you chasing me, but everyone underneath the heavens chasing you!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s words had completely poked at Tian Mingzi’s fatal weakness. Tian Mingzi’s face twisted as if someone had touched his reverse scale. “Lin Ming, you are courting death!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming chuckled once more. “How funny. Do you actually think I would keep this secret for you?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi seemed to suddenly think of something. A fierce smile spread across his face. “Perhaps what you say is true, but on the day that the great calamity approaches, do you think that the saint race will be defeated, or will humanity be defeated? Do you think that the inevitable rivers that will wash away this world are something that can be caused by my betrayal alone? Hahahaha! Let me tell you something, the saints are 10 times stronger than humanity. Humans only have a single Divine Realm but the saints control far more realms! A wise man can recognize the circumstances. I am only someone that is following the trends and making the most suitable decisions in this world! One day, you will eventually realize that my choice was correct all along. When the saint race controls this world, I will flay you alive until there is nothing but you divine soul left. I will torture you for 100,000 years and have you suffer in the most miserable way possible!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi hatefully said, his voice as haunting as the shrill cries of ghosts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi had joined the side of the saint race. One reason was because of his great ambitions, but another reason came from the fact that he recognized that the human race had an extremely high chance of losing to the saint race. Whether it was in the world of martial artists or the mortal world, when two sides fought, for all sorts of various reasons, there would always be traitors and defectors. In particular when one side was far stronger than the other.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe saint race was truly far more formidable than humanity. In ancient times, the saint race, the human race, and the soul race all existed as equals, controlling the 33 Layered Heavens together. But afterwards, humanity began to control less and less of the universe. Every time a \u0026nbsp;universe fell to the enemy, the strength of humanity would weaken more and more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen the great calamity truly arrived, it was impossible to say what would happen to humanity, who only occupied the Divine Realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I cannot predict the trends of the world, but what I can predict is that you will absolutely die before then!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming shouted out loud as he swept his spear outwards. In that moment, innumerable Divine Seal runes swept towards Tian Mingzi, covering the skies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll around Tian Mingzi, the Eternal Demon Domain was compressed to less than a hundred feet around him. These seals fell onto a massive number of fierce devils, instantly turning them to ash!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWoosh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Phoenix Blood Spear cut through the void. Tian Mingzi hurriedly drew back. However, his protective true essence was swept over by Lin Ming’s spear light, causing it to explode into pieces.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter barely offsetting this spear light, before Tian Mingzi could even catch his breath, Mo Eversnow’s attack also arrived!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMo Eversnow was currently far stronger than Lin Ming. Her attack was unstoppable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Damnit!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi desperately combusted his blood essence, cutting down with his eight foot long sword.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, at this time, the Primal God Pure Lands took this chance to break through the gaps of Tian Mingzi’s shattered protective true essence and drill into his body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi’s body shook, his strength immediately weakening by a dramatic amount.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDing!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a loud ringing sound, Tian Mingzi’s sword was sent flying away. Mo Eversnow’s sword chopped down on Tian Mingzi’s left shoulder. The energy sword cut down, tearing through Tian Mingzi’s body and cutting open his lungs as well as over 20 ribs. As Mo Eversnow’s sword slashed through, a massive amount of blood rained down. Tian Mingzi was nearly cut in half by her strike!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, Tian Mingzi’s eyes glazed over without any response at all. All he felt was another cold feeling pierce through his chest. From behind, Lin Ming’s bloodstained spear had penetrated through his body, emerging from his chest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLike this, Tian Mingzi was pierced through by Lin Ming’s spear. His incomplete body hung atop the Phoenix Blood Spear, thick red blood flowing down the shaft!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the limit of an avatar. Even though Tian Mingzi was strong, every time he used his strength he became that much weaker. After several rounds of fierce combat, he was unable to maintain his peak state. As for Lin Ming and Mo Eversnow, their blood vitality seemed to be endless. They could fight on and on for days on end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi was already on the losing side, and under such an imbalance of power, in this round of attacks he was killed by Lin Ming and Mo Eversnow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi grasped the Phoenix Blood Spear in one hand and Mo Eversnow’s energy sword in the other, his palms wet with blood…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithout words, all he did was glare at Mo Eversnow and Lin Ming with undisguised hatred.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis blood leaked out as more and more strength faded from his body.

Do you really plan on refining this? This is only a wisp of his soul; there won’t be any meaning to it at all.” Lin Ming wanted to use the Divine Dream Law to directly refine this wisp of soul and turn it into pure soul force. He wanted to avoid Tian Mingzi’s tricks and reduce the number of potential problems.
