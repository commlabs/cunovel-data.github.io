Each of the six took place in a different region of the system and in each case I made use of the astonomical facts-as they were then known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, a quarter-century later, Gregg Press is bringing out the novels in new hardcover editions; but what a quarter-century it has been! More has been learned about the worlds of our Solar System in this last quarter-century than in all the thousands of years of earlier observations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to the 1950s, you see, we could only look from Earth\u0027s surface; since then, we have been able to send out rocket probes to take photographs and make studies at close range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only one of the six Lucky Starr novels that has remained untouched by this-at least so far-is LUCKY STARR AND THE PIRATES OF THE ASTEROIDS, which was written in 1953. There is evidence that many of the asteroids may be a little darker and just a little larger than had been thought earlier, but that makes very little difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, Lucky can fight the pirates and engage in his deadly duels right now just as he did a quarter-century ago, when this book was written. It I had to write the novel today, I would hardly have to change a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac Asimov\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDEDICATION\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Frederik Pohl,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat contradiction in terms-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lovable agent. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-pirates-of-the-asteroids-lucky-starr-2/page-1.html","bookId":1755,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 AM"}
