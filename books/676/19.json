And there is no Miss Zarves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You already know all that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But how do you explain the cow in her classroom?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves drew a triangle on the blackboard. \"A triangle has three sides,\" she said, then pointed to each side. \"One, two, three.\" She drew a square. \"A square has four sides. One, two, three, four.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e 104\n\u003cbr\u003e She walked around the cow to the other side of the board. She drew a pentagon, a hexagon, and a perfect heptagon. \"A heptagon has seven sides,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves was very good at drawing shapes. When most people try to draw heptagons, there is always one side that sticks out funny. But Miss Zarves\u0027s heptagon was perfect. Every side was the same length, and every angle the same degree.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a great talent. But nobody appreciated her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nobody appreciated anything she did. It was like they didn\u0027t know she was there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She counted the sides on the heptagon. \"One, two, three, fo-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"MOOOOO,\" said the cow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves dropped her chalk. She glared at the cow. \"I hate this!\" she shouted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a brown cow with a white head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s all right, Miss Zarves,\" said Virginia, her best student. \"I\u0027ll get the chalk for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Miss Zarves. \"Leave it where it is. The cow made me drop the chalk. The cow should pick it up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her students gaped at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will not continue,\" said Miss Zarves, \"until that cow picks up the piece of chalk and draws an octagon on the board!\" She folded her arms across her chest, stared at the cow, and waited.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ray raised his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Ray,\" said Miss Zarves, arms still folded across her chest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Uh, cows can\u0027t pick up chalk,\" said Ray.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves sighed. \"I know,\" she said. \"And I can\u0027t teach with a cow in my classroom!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No one had ever seen Miss Zarves so upset. She usually had a pleasant disposition.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s okay, Miss Zarves,\" said Virginia. \"I don\u0027t mind the cow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You get used to it after a while,\" said Ray.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What cow?\" asked Nick. \"Oh, that one! I forgot it was there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves smiled. She knew her students were trying to make her feel better.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Other classrooms have goldfish or hamsters,\" said Virginia. \"It\u0027s really no different.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Miss Zarves. \"I won\u0027t have it! All my life I\u0027ve tried to be accommodating. I\u0027ve never been one to complain. And what has it gotten me? A cow!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She shook her head. \"When I was a little girl, my friends never did what I wanted to do,\" she said. \"I always had to do whatever they wanted to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e 106\n\u003cbr\u003e \"And my teacher never called on me in class. She always called on the kids who just shouted out without raising their hands, even though she said she wouldn\u0027t. She\u0027d say, \u0027I won\u0027t call on you if you don\u0027t raise your hand,\u0027 but then she always did anyway. But I was a good girl. I never shouted\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e out\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And she always did things alphabetically, so I was always last if there was time for me at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My parents were too busy for me. They were always dressing up and going out to fancy parties. I had to tuck myself in at night and wish myself\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e sweet dreams.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She took a tissue out of her sleeve and wiped\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e a tear from her eye.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Still, I always tried to keep a smile on my face.

The days of walk-all-over-Miss-Zarves are finished!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She threw open her classroom door. \"The squeaky wheel gets the grease!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What are you going to do?\" asked Virginia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m going out there!\" said Miss Zarves. \"And I\u0027m not coming back until I get some grease!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She stepped outside. She decided she\u0027d go right to the top! So she headed down the stairs-to the principal\u0027s office.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy and Maurecia were coming up the stairs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Todd is uglier than stupid,\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re crazy!\" said Joy. \"He\u0027s stupider than ugly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oooh,\" teased Maurecia. \"I\u0027m going to tell Todd you think he\u0027s cute.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves stepped in front of them. \"What are you children doing out of class?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I didn\u0027t say he was cute,\" said Joy. \"He\u0027s just not as ugly as he is stupid.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That means you think he\u0027s handsome,\" said Maurecia. \"Are you going to marry him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I asked you a question,\" said Miss Zarves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ugh, gross!\" said Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m a teacher,\" said Miss Zarves. \"That means you are supposed to listen to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy and Maurecia walked right past her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves sighed, then continued down to Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s office. She took a deep breath to steady her nerves. She was about to knock but then changed her mind and just marched right in. \"Hey, Kidswatter, I want to talk to you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The principal was making a rubber-band ball.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you hear me?\" asked Miss Zarves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He opened his desk drawer and looked for some more rubber bands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you don\u0027t answer me right now,\" said Miss\n\u003cbr\u003e 108\n\u003cbr\u003e Zarves, \"I\u0027m walking out the door and never coming back!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. K. pressed the buzzer on his phone. \"Miss Night, you need to order more rubber bands.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s it!\" said Miss Zarves. \"I\u0027m leaving.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Good-bye. I quit!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She walked out of the school and took a deep\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e breath of fresh air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Please don\u0027t go, Miss Zarves,\" said a voice\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e behind her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Startled, she turned around.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We need you,\" said a bald-headed man. He was standing between two other men. Both had black mustaches, and one carried a black attach case. The bald man didn\u0027t have a mustache,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you see me?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, of course,\" said the bald man. \"And we appreciate all your hard work.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All three nodded very sincerely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves was touched. \"I\u0027ve been teaching for thirty years,\" she said. \"And nobody has ever\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e said that before.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, it\u0027s not easy being a teacher,\" said the\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e bald man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t get any respect,\" said Miss Zarves. \"People treat me like I\u0027m a nobody.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s not easy being a teacher,\" said the man with the attach case. \"You have to work long hours for very little money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve never gotten paid,\" said Miss Zarves. \"And this is the first time in thirty years I\u0027ve ever left the building.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s not easy being a teacher,\" agreed the other man with a mustache.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Even the book I\u0027m reading to my class,\" said Miss Zarves. \"The author makes fun of teachers!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s a tragedy,\" said the bald man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then why do it?\" asked Miss Zarves. \"Why teach anymore?

He took out a handkerchief and handed it to Miss Zarves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you,\" she said, blew her nose, then gave it back to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He placed it back in his attach case.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you at least get the cow out of my classroom?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e 110\n\u003cbr\u003e The bald man smiled. \"I\u0027ll see what I can do,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Zarves smiled as she slowly shook her head.

Then everyone went crazy!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yahooooo!\" yelled Sharie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hot diggity dog!\" shouted Dameon.\n\u003cbr\u003e 112\n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone was yelling and jumping, \"Zippity doo dan!\" shouted Mrs. Drazil.
