The SUV found traction again, barreled backward as the guillotine of bullets sliced just inches in front of the bumper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second helicopter dove toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarak opened fire skyward. The copter’s searchlight shattered away. But it kept coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill going in reverse, Coral spun the wheel. The car fishtailed in the mud. “Omaha, your left!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Barak was busy with the helicopter, one of the guards had decided to take advantage of his inattention. The man rose with his rifle on his shoulder. Omaha leaned back in his seat. The SUV swung to face the man. No choice, Omaha fired his Desert Eagle through the windshield. He squeezed two more shots. The safety glass held, but fractured into spiderwebs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard ducked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SUV caught traction in the fresh mud and sped across the lot, still in reverse. Craned around, Coral expertly maneuvered the vehicle, aiming for the gate to the compound, going in ass backward, pursued by the helicopters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:44 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP INNED IN the alley, Safia stood between Painter and Cassandra. Ahead, Kane pointed his gun. Everyone had frozen for half a breath as the helicopter exploded behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shoot him,” Cassandra repeated, staying focused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Safia attempted to step around Painter, to shield him. Every movement flamed her shoulder. Blood ran down her arm. “Kill him and I won’t help you! You’ll never discover the secret at Ubar!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter held her back, protecting her from Kane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra pushed through the hedge. “Kane, you have your order.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia glanced between the two armed assailants. She spotted a shift of shadows behind the man. Something rose from a crouch, sharing the crest of the wall. Eyes shone a feral red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter tensed beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a growled roar, the leopard pounced on Kane. His pistol fired. Safia felt the shot whistle past her ear and strike the dirt with a thud. Man and cat tumbled off the wall, into the prayer room beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter ducked, grabbed Safia’s arm, and swung her behind him as he turned to face Cassandra. He had a second pistol in his free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra leaped backward, crashing through the bushes. The bullet missed, clipping the corner of the tomb. She ducked to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext door, screams arose—bloody and sharp. It was impossible to discern man from beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBullets ricocheted off the sandstone walls as Cassandra returned fire, staying low around the corner, shooting through the bushes. Painter pushed Safia against the tomb’s wall, out of direct line of fire…at least for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make for the outer wall,” he urged, and shoved her down the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’ll follow us. The slope’s too exposed.” He intended to hold Cassandra at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goddamnit, go!” He pushed her harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia stumbled down the alley. The sooner she reached safety, the sooner Painter could make his own escape. So she justified it in her head. But a part of her knew she was simply running for her own life. With each step, her shoulder throbbed, protesting her cowardly flight. Still, she kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exchange of gunfire continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the neighboring ruins of the prayer room, all had gone deathly quiet, the fate of Kane unknown. More gunfire erupted from the parking lot. A helicopter flashed low overhead, whipping up the rain with its rotor wash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the end of the alleyway, Safia lunged across the wet gardens toward the far wall. It was only four feet high, but with her wounded shoulder, she feared she’d never make it over. Blood soaked through the shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom beneath a baobab tree, a camel appeared on the far side of the wall. It moved to meet her. It seemed to be the same camel that had sauntered past the tomb’s door earlier. In fact, it had the same companion: the naked woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly now she rode atop the camel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia didn’t know whether to trust the stranger or not, but if Cassandra shot at her, then the woman had to be on her side. The enemy of my enemy…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stranger offered her arm as Safia reached the wall—then spoke. It wasn’t Arabic or English. Yet Safia understood it—not because she had studied the language, which she had, but because it seemed to translate through her skull on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome, sister,” the stranger said in Aramaic, the dead language of this land. “Be at peace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia reached for the woman’s hand. Fingers gripped hers, hard and strong. She felt herself pulled up effortlessly. Pain lanced out, shooting down her wounded arm. A cry escaped her. Blackness closed her vision to a pinpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peace,” the woman repeated softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia felt the word wash over her, through her, taking pain and the world with it. She slumped and slipped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:47 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP AINTER PULLED the screen off the window beside his head. It was a flimsy affair. With his back pressed against the tomb’s wall, he fired his pistol twice, keeping Cassandra at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used his palm to slide open the window. Thankfully it was unlocked. He glanced down the alleyway and watched Safia vanish around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping to a knee, Painter fired another shot, ejected his clip, grabbed another from his belt, and slammed it home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra fired again. The slug struck the wall by his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was another goddamn leopard when you needed one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter returned a shot, then holstered his weapon. Without a second glance, he leaped up, boosted himself through the window, and fell in an undignified tumble into the tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, he rolled to his feet. His eyes discerned a central shrouded mound. He kept to the wall and circled the gravesite, his pistol back in his hand, aimed at the door. Crossing past the back window, he felt a wet breeze through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was how that bastard got the jump on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter glanced through the window, noting movement outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the wall, a camel turned away, heading down the far slope. A naked woman sat astride it, seemingly guiding it with her knees. In her arms, she cradled another woman. Limp, unmoving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Safia…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camel and its riders descended out of sight. A pair of leopards bounded from the dark gardens to the wall, then away, following the camel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could decide to pursue or not, Painter heard a scuff by the door. He dropped and turned. A shadow lay draped across the entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t over, Crowe!” Cassandra called in to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter kept his pistol trained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new roar reached his ears. A truck. Barreling his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShots fired. He recognized the retort of a Kalashnikov. Someone from his own group. Cassandra’s shadow vanished, sweeping out of sight, retreating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter hurried to the door, keeping his weapon ready. He spotted a discarded map on the floor. He reached down and crumpled it in a fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the courtyard, one of the Mitsubishi trucks bounced through the gardens, digging ragged furrows. A figure protruded through the moonroof. A muzzle, pointed skyward, flashed. Barak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter checked the rest of the yard. It appeared empty. Cassandra had retreated into hiding, outgunned for the brief moment. He stepped out of the tomb and waved the crumpled map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpotting him, the driver of the Mitsubishi swung sharply. Its back bumper aimed for him. He fell back inside to avoid getting hit. The SUV skidded to a stop, scraping paint off its side panels. Its backseat door landed abreast of the tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spotted Coral in the driver’s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get in!” Barak called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter glanced back to the tomb’s back window. Safia…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever had taken her, they had at least been heading away, out of immediate harm. That would have to do for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning back, he popped the handle, dove inside, and slammed the door. “Go!” he called to the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoral jostled the SUV into forward gear, and the truck sped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of helicopters gave chase. Barak shot at them from his topside vantage. The SUV raced toward the open gate. Coral leaned forward to peer through the cracked windshield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey swept out of the complex, bounced over a muddy rut, momentarily airborne, then jammed back down. Wheels spun, caught, and the SUV sped toward the road and the cover of the heavy forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the front, Omaha stared back at him, eyes lost. “Where’s Safia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gone.” Painter shook his head, unblinking. “She’s gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15 Mountain Trek\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDECEMBER 4, 12:18 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDHOFAR MOUNTAINS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS AFIA WOKE from slumber, falling. She threw her arms out, panic racking her body, as familiar as her own breath. Agony speared her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calm yourself, sister,” someone said near her ear. “I have you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world swirled into focus, midnight dark. She was propped against a couched camel, who chewed its cud with indifference. A woman loomed at her side, an arm under her good shoulder, holding her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where…?” she mumbled, but her lips seemed glued together. She tried to find her legs, but failed. Memory slowly returned. The fight at the tomb. Gunfire filled her head. Flashes of images. One face. Painter. She shuddered in the woman’s arms. What had happened? Where was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally found enough strength to stand, leaning heavily on the camel. Safia noted that her wounded shoulder had been crudely bandaged, wrapped to slow the bleeding. It ached with every movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman at her side, shadowy in the gloom, appeared to be the one who had rescued her; only now she wore a desert cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help comes,” the other whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” she forced out, suddenly noting the cold of the night. She was in some jungle grotto. The rain had stopped, but drops still wept from the canopy overhead. Palm and tamarind trees rose all around her. Tangles of lianas and hanging gardens of jasmine draped everywhere, perfuming the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman remained silent. She pointed an arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bit of fiery light pierced the jungle ahead, glowing brightly through the ropy vines. Someone was coming, bearing aloft a torch or lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia had an urge to flee, but her body was too weak to obey. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sandstorm-sigma-force-1/page-56.html","bookId":1530,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM"}
