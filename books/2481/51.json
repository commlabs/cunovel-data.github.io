When Truths Are Revealed No One Is Safe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe low hum of the gate opening was joined in harmony by a steady squeal. Huge lights had been rigged up over the new area of the fort and a team was diligently working into the night on resolving the issues with the gate. The new area was still cut off from the rest of the fort and only accessible by long ladders placed up on the wall and a small platform that bridged the two walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Katie walked across the site, she could hear Juan\u0027s voice rising over the din. She knew he was working long hours to get the first gate working properly before the second gate went up. It was dangerous work and stress levels were high. Occasionally, a zombie would try to attack the construction workers. The sharp-eyed former hunters on sentry duty would take them down. As more and more people flooded into their tiny fort, it was evident that space was fast becoming an issue and the taking of the hotel was the talk of everyone at dinner. Things were moving forward because they had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis was on watch at the far side of the fort, far away from the construction of the gate. Shrouded in the darkness on his tiny watch platform, he was gazing out at the now empty main street where so many zombies had met brutal deaths in their first real victory against the undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince that first big battle with the zombie horde, the main street had been eerily empty. The moans were fast becoming a distant memory and a thick layer of dirt had covered the smell of death and decay. As spring took a firmer hold, grass and wildflowers had taken root out on the main street and Katie suspected it would soon look like a little field in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the terror of that crowd of zombies moaning and screeching in their desperation to reach the living had burned deeply into the psyche of those in the fort. It had been decided that they had to keep the zombies from forming in a horde outside the fort. Ideas were running rampant in the fort on how to keep this from happening, but after the almost disaster of the mass slaughter when the zombies had breached the perimeter, every idea was being heavily scrutinized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie strode up the stairs to Travis\u0027 side and he gave her a small smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpring was in the air and the nights were cool. Spring in Texas meant cold nights and warm days. She was in the Reverend\u0027s jacket tonight and its fragrant tobacco smell and its comforting warmth was a gentle reminder of the man who had died for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheer luck of the draw that enabled so many in the fort to survive that first hellish day still wore on Katie. Call it survivor\u0027s guilt, but it was not easy to deal with. She knew for sure that Travis dealt with it as well. Perhaps maybe all of the survivors suffered from it. At times it was hard to talk of their life before and the people they had lost. At other times there was relief in their conversations as they spoke of their future plans. But it was like being caught between heaven and hell: both happy and sad to be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis glanced over her as she stepped onto the platform and joined him. Again, he gave her a slight smile, then glanced back down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I saw a few flashes down the road,\" he said. \"They looked almost like headlights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously? Think other survivors are coming this way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Though at times I\u0027m afraid those things have learned to drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr remembered how to drive,” Travis answered, his brow furrowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie shivered at the thought. \"Well, since Laura\u0027s remains tried to open that truck door, we haven\u0027t seen anymore of them appearing to think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know. I keep hoping that what she did was some sort of memory, not her reasoning out her actions.\" Travis continued to stare down the street intently. \"The last thing we need is thinking zombies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie leaned against the railing, rubbing her hands together. Travis was obviously deep in thought. They were both ill at ease with each other in this moment, which was not the norm for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About earlier,\" Katie started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis sighed, but didn\u0027t look at her. He double-checked the spotlightpresently turned off- to make sure it was properly hooked up. \"Probably just my imagination. It probably wasn\u0027t headlights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie rested her hand on his shoulder. \"No, not that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis stood up and looked down at her. \"It\u0027s okay. I shouldn\u0027t have tried to say anything. I realized that during supper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie shook her head. \"No, no, it\u0027s okay. I\u0027m partially to blame. I was rather pushy about it then chickened out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis gave her a sheepish look. \"I\u0027ve been kinda obvious, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie smiled warmly. \"Yeah, kinda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis blushed and shook his head. \"Juan says I\u0027m a sucker for the unattainable girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie laughed. \"Yeah, me, too. For a long time. Then I found Lydia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis sighed. \"You\u0027re so lucky to have had her. My ex-fiancee and I never had what you did. I was always trying to please her and make her happy and in the end, I guess I failed and she left. I guess I\u0027m not good at this whole girl thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of Lydia made her heart literally hurt and she sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Travis…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know, Katie. I know how this goes down. Yeah, I\u0027ve tried to pretend, but I knew even during moments of hope it was not going to happen.\" Travis looked down at the rifle in his hands, then over at the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In this new world you\u0027ve been one of the good things in it. Everything has changed and gone to hell, but you help make it tolerable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t help but smile at his words. She reached out and hugged him gently. \"You and Jenni and Jason are very special to me. My new family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want you to understand that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis looked down into her eyes, sad and resigned. \"But?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie rested her hand on his cheek and found the words harder to say than she had imagined. She opened her mouth to speak, reconsidered, then closed it. What was there to say? Instead, she kissed his cheek softly. It was rough and slightly scraggly against her lips. He clung to her and it was a comforting expression between them and the world felt far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis turned slightly and pressed a quick kiss to her lips. \"Friends only?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie nodded, mutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis nodded back then kissed her lightly again, but the platonic veneer quickly faded. Forgetting all her reservations, Katie kissed him back, softly and sweetly. The kiss turned into something both of them had not expected and that energy pulsated between them. They clung together, wrapped in each other\u0027s embrace, their kiss real and intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharply, overwhelmingly, Lydia\u0027s image filled her mind. Images of her lovely face, sweet kisses, gentle hugs and then her screaming reanimated corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling away abruptly, but more reluctantly than she would have ever imagined before, she said softly, \"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Travis said with a sigh. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenni adores you,\" Katie said lamely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not go there,\" Travis answered almost bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said helplessly. She wanted to comfort him, but the energy of their kiss still tingled over her skin and she couldn\u0027t risk it. She had to stay true to Lydia. To what they had shared. She had to mourn her and remember her. How could she let herself care for someone else when Lydia was still out there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Katie. I really am. But you can\u0027t just deflect my emotions onto Jenni. Don\u0027t get me wrong. She\u0027s gorgeous and makes me laugh. I really like her a lot, but please, just don\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it’s stupid of me to think I just cleared the way for you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis gave her a small smile. \"I would never call you stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a bright light blinded them both. The roar of an engine broke through the sound of the gates\u0027 construction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a motorbike,\" Travis answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flipped on the searchlight that had been rigged upon the platform and aimed it down the main street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old battered motorbike darted into the light. A scraggly looking young man and his equally scruffy girlfriend looked up at them with desperate, terrified expressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us in! They\u0027re right behind us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis flashed the light up the road to reveal a crowd of zombies running toward the fort, obviously following those on the motorbike. Katie noted immediately that most were in doctor\u0027s coats or nurse\u0027s uniforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The clinic. They went to the clinic,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us in!\" The boy was yelling loudly, stirring up the pursuing zombies even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie and Travis were so stunned at this quick turn of events they both seemed incapable of figuring out what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy noticed the open gate and gunned the engine. He swerved around the corner and headed up the road toward the next unblocked intersection to loop around the block and to the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s heading for the gate,\" Katie said in a trembling voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit! Shit!\" Travis grabbed the walkie-talkie. \"Juan! Close the gate!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose the gate!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a cackling noise, then, \"We\u0027re working on it, dude. Chill out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zombies coming, Juan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Shit? From where,\" Juan\u0027s voice demanded over the static. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-51.html","bookId":2481,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM"}
