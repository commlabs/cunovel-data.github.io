Blood spilled from her ears, left bright red trails down her white skin. An eyeball popped and oozed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen backed away, shaking his head, eyes wide and horrified. \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What went wrong? I can\u0027t believe this.\" Bitterness laced Cassandra\u0027s voice. \"All the time and effort. So many plans.\" The skin under her eyes came loose, began to slide down her face. \"Damn it. This is bulls-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer bottom jaw fell off, landed with a wet splat on the cavern floor. Teeth knocked loose rattled on the stone. The rest of the skin melted off her body, revealing organs and bone, a beating heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen screamed. He took a dozen steps backward but was unable to avert his eyes. He was transfixed by the woman coming apart in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra cried a final, strangled scream before collapsing into a pile of steaming meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no psychotherapy on earth that would ever erase that image from Allen\u0027s mind, but he felt something unclench in his chest, a veil lift from his eyes. He was free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra was gone, and Allen was in possession of his own soul once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul led them over the dam, down the narrow stairs to the stream below, kept walking until the waterwheel came into view. He saw flickering torchlight. Someone was definitely down here. He kept his shotgun ready, motioned for the others behind him to stay alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spotted Allen sitting on the bottom step of a raised dais, strange gizmos hanging over him, big glass discs. This must have been the machine he\u0027d described before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul jogged toward Allen. \"Are you okay? We came as fast as we-what the hell is THAT?\" He backed away from the still-melting heap of flesh and bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others arrived and saw it too. Penny groaned. Amy turned away, made a gagging sound but managed to refrain from vomiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Cassandra,\" Allen told them. \"Or what\u0027s left of her. She\u0027d wanted to use the machine on herself all along. I guess she was tired of being a vampire, wanted to be human again. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m going to say this, but I felt sorry for her. I saw the whole thing. She came apart right before my eyes. It was awful, the worst thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul looked at the machine, then back at the melted pile of Cassandra. \"What went wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen shrugged. \"No clue. Maybe the thing never worked at all.\" He hung his head, rubbed his eyes with his palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all over now,\" Father Paul said. \"I\u0027ll take the stone back to the Vatican, hide it in the secret room where we keep the Ark of the Covenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen looked up at the priest. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul laughed. \"Just fucking with you. But we\u0027ll put it in a safe place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a shotgun shell being pumped into a chamber forced all eyes to Father Starkes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Change of plan.\" Starkes leveled the shotgun at Father Paul. \"The stone comes with me. Drop the weapons, and I won\u0027t splatter you with buckshot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul said, \"I have to say, Starkes, this comes as a bit of a surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a surprise?\" Starkes smirked. \"Check this out.\" He held the shotgun on Father Paul one-handed while he pulled a thin vial of red liquid from his pants pocket with the other. He thumbed out the cork, drank the liquid in one rapid motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarkes\u0027s face began to twitch, the skin going rubbery. It stretched and distorted, then re-formed itself into the leering likeness of Abraham Zabel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s that asshole,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the asshole? You little fuckers burn down my whole house, and I\u0027m the asshole?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You paralyzed us in your basement,\" Amy shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah,\" Zabel said. \"Well, tough shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny took a step back, kicked off her deck shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel frowned. \"What the hell is she doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This.\" Penny grunted, fur spreading across her body as she transformed into the half-wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sprang at Zabel, claws extended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel flung his hand up, barked a command word. Lightning sprang from his fingertips, caught Penny in midair. Her body convulsed with the electrical impact. She fell, hit the stone floor hard, and lay still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen leaped to his feet. \"Penny!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul already had the.45 out of his shoulder holster. He ran for cover while squeezing the trigger, four quick blasts shaking the cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel blasted with the shotgun. Buckshot ricocheted off stone. He pumped in another shell, blasted again. Penny dove for cover one way, Allen another. Zabel and Father Paul exchanged fire. The priest scurried behind the protective lead wall, and Zabel followed him with the shotgun, pumping, blasting, and pumping in another shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid goddamn priest,\" Zabel shouted. \"All I wanted was the stone. Now it\u0027s got to be hard. You want it hard? You got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel scooped three gray pebbles from his pocket, blew on them, and tossed them to the floor of the cavern. They grew into armored spiders the size of beagles. They scurried behind the lead wall to attack Father Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul\u0027s.45 thundered behind the wall. He ran out, the last spider pursuing him. It jumped at him, and Father Paul squeezed the trigger twice. The spider crumbled in midair, fell and rolled over on its back, legs curling up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Father Paul had broken cover. Zabel leveled the shotgun and squeezed the trigger. It bucked in his hands, buckshot scorching Father Paul\u0027s chest and belly. The priest spun and fell to the ground, hand going to his guts, blood oozing between his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Allen shouted. How had it come to this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay then,\" Zabel said. \"Anyone else want to get dead? I didn\u0027t think so. Now, I\u0027m taking that stone, and I\u0027m going to walk straight out of-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shotgun suddenly glowed fiery orange in his hands. \"Shit!\" He dropped the shotgun, blew on his scorched palms. \"What the hell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry for the dramatic entrance.\" Jackson Fay stood by the waterwheel, hands on hips, a manic gleam in his eye. \"Hope I\u0027m not interrupting anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize I\u0027m a little late to the party,\" Fay said. \"And what I\u0027m about to say isn\u0027t very original, but I\u0027m afraid the philosopher\u0027s stone is coming with me. I\u0027d say something too about standing aside or getting hurt, but the fact is, I have absolutely no problem hurting every single person here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel said, \"I don\u0027t know who you are, dickhead, but you just bit off a mouthful of trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I know who you are, Mr. Zabel,\" Fay said. \"You are a sad, second-rate magician with delusions of grandeur. What do you think you would possibly do with the stone? You\u0027d only hurt yourself. You make a good living as a hired spell-peddler. Stick with what you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen watched, held his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you know who I am,\" Zabel said. \"Now tell me your name. I want to be able to tell everyone who I killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Jackson Fay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...\" Zabel slowly turned pale. \"Yes. I\u0027ve heard of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing unflattering, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Zabel said. \"I\u0027ll pit my skills against yours any day. Still, maybe we can talk this out, eh?\" He wiped the sweat off his forehead with his fingertips. \"So tell me. What do you think of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flicked his fingers at Fay, the sweat droplets flying through the air. Harsh syllables spilled from Zabel\u0027s mouth, and the droplets elongated and hardened, became flashing silver blades, slicing through the air toward Fay\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay spat words in return, blew a puff of air when the blades were six inches from his face. The blades jerked to a halt, transformed into silver butterflies, which flapped harmlessly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay laughed. \"Not even close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Zabel was already running toward one of the torches on the wall. He tossed a pinch of dust into the torch flame, followed by elaborate, arcane hand gestures. The flame shot up into an arc and poured itself onto the floor between himself and Fay. The fire formed itself into a flaming bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen belly-crawled to Father Paul, put two fingers on his throat. A weak pulse. He glanced up, saw Amy trying to get to Penny. Maybe they could all sneak out of here while the wizards dueled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flame bull snorted, charged Fay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay cast a spell at the stream that ran to the waterwheel. A giant hand emerged from the stream on a long column of water, reared up like a snake. The palm was ten feet wide. Fay made a swatting gesture, and the hand came down hard and flat on the flame bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water hand exploded on contact, obliterating the bull in a hiss of steam. A ton of warm water surged across the cavern floor, knocked into Allen and Father Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest opened his eyes, coughed. \"Allen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me. Hold on. We\u0027ll figure out something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Paul\u0027s chest rose and fell with a wheeze. \"Everything\u0027s all wrecked inside me. I\u0027m not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen couldn\u0027t think of anything comforting to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take this. Maybe it\u0027ll come in handy.\" The priest slipped something cold and heavy into Allen\u0027s hand. \"You\u0027ll only have a few... a few seconds...\" His eyes rolled up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Father Paul was no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mr. Zabel,\" Fay said. \"You\u0027ve been amusing. I liked the bull. I\u0027d have formed it into a minotaur. That would have added a little flare, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay frowned. \"Time to end it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay gestured with both hands at the waterwheel, spoke the words. The waterwheel shook, broke loose from its base, and lifted into the air. It started to spin, faster and faster, then flew straight at Zabel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel threw up his hands, screamed the words to the counter-spell. The waterwheel halted a foot from his face. He pushed back, sent the waterwheel flying at Fay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t!\" Fay grunted as he willed the waterwheel back toward Zabel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen watched the two wizards struggle, the waterwheel hovering a dozen feet in the air between them. Now was the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dashed toward Amy and Penny, his footfalls splashing water. He was relieved to find Penny still breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s unconscious,\" Amy said. \"Can you lift her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen lifted her, put her over his shoulder. \"Let\u0027s get the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the stone?\" Amy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it. I don\u0027t want to be under that waterwheel when it comes down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ran back toward the dam. Two seconds later a cataclysmic crash echoed though the cave, wood splintering, stone crumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep going,\" Allen shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey climbed the stairs up the side of the dam. When they reached the top, they paused to look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell,\" Allen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson Fay hovered ten feet in the air, green light glowing around him. He flew toward them, arms outstretched, a maniacal expression twisting his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Amy said. \"He\u0027ll come after us. He\u0027ll follow us and kill us. We\u0027ve got to end this now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay floated closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen said, \"Unless you\u0027ve got a Sherman tank in your pocket, I suggest we haul ass out of here right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy leaned in close, whispered in his ear, \"You know how you don\u0027t think I have any magical powers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy grinned. \"Well, you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jogged out toward the dam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Come back! You\u0027ll get killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy picked her way along the top of the dam until she stood in the very center. She faced Fay and waited. He floated to within twenty feet of her, then stopped and hovered there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You defeated Zabel,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Fay said. \"I must admit he was somewhat more formidable than I had anticipated. Good thing I disposed of him. He might have actually been able to do something with the stone if he\u0027d obtained it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked to Margaret,\" Amy told him. \"You\u0027re a traitorous bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Margaret?\" Genuine surprise in his voice. \"Well, the old bat had one last trick up her sleeve. Interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got past Zabel,\" Amy said. \"But you won\u0027t get past me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, but are you high or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been studying my craft. I\u0027m more powerful than you think. Much more powerful than Zabel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay held his belly and laughed hard. He wiped a tear from his eye. \"Oh, yeah. You\u0027re one mighty sorceress. Just like your friend Clover. You should have seen the surprised look on her face when I killed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy went red, fury boiling within her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell you what,\" Fay said. \"I\u0027ll just float here. You go first. Seriously. You cast your mightiest spell.\" He laughed again. \"I mean it. Let\u0027s see what you got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Amy raised her hands, formed an arcane gesture. \"You asked for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Fay urged. \"Cast away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" She reached behind her under her shirt and came out with the.50-caliber Desert Eagle. \"Suck on this, motherfucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed the trigger, and the pistol bucked and thundered. Blood and flesh erupted from Fay\u0027s shoulder. He spun in midair, screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay tried to right himself, twirling slowly in midair like some lazy weather vane. He reached out with one hand and flayed Amy with a weak blast of blue lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy contorted, spasms of shock spreading to every inch of her body. She threw her head back, eyes shut tight. The electricity dissipated, and Amy went to her knees with a splash, barely catching herself before falling back into the pool of icy water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFay had stabilized, floated toward Amy with both hands outstretched, hellfire in his eyes. \"Bitch! That\u0027s cheating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy lifted the heavy pistol, closed one eye, sighted along the barrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fired twice more, flame flashing from the gun. The slugs smacked into Fay\u0027s side, exploded out his back. His mouth fell open in a noiseless gasp; eyes wide with disbelief. He crumbled and plummeted, trailing blood in the air. He landed with a splash and a crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy turned and ran from the dam to join Allen on the narrow path that led back up to St. Vitus Cathedral. She stumbled, fell forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen barely caught her. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, panting. \"Just a little woozy. Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more thing,\" Allen said. \"Can you take her? Are you strong enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy grabbed Penny under each armpit, dragged her up the path. \"Hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen went to the edge of the dam, peered over. Fay lay at the bottom, still moving. The wizard looked up and saw Allen. \"You... little shits. I\u0027m going to h-heal. Going to heal up and then I\u0027ll d-drink wine out of your f-fucking skulls.\" He coughed, flecks of blood covering his bottom lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" Allen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the grenade Father Paul had given him from his pocket, jammed it into a niche between two stones. He pulled the pin and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just made it to the passage back to the daylight when he heard the explosion behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the grenade went off, I saw the whole thing. A pretty good show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small explosion only damaged the dam a little at first, rocks and dust flying. But Allen had put the grenade in just the right spot. Never underestimate dumb luck. Geysers spouted from the dam, opening fissures. Jackson Fay had a front-row seat when the dam finally broke, tons and tons of water and rock tumbling down on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water swept through the caverns, wrecking Roderick\u0027s machine, smashing lenses, washing away bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rush of water was so powerful that it even sent the lead box with the philosopher\u0027s stone rolling and tumbling along deep underground caverns, through a shaft that emptied itself into the Vlatva. The box sank into the mud at the bottom of the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened to it after that, I can\u0027t say. I\u0027ve come to the end of my part in the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know that at first, but I know it now. I can feel it. I\u0027m going someplace. Events have come to fruition, and I\u0027ve been released. I know now that I\u0027ve waited centuries to finish this, to witness, to tell you about it. I don\u0027t know what happens next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the big, deep gray loom before me, and I\u0027m afraid. I don\u0027t want to go. For hundreds of years I\u0027ve prayed for release, but now I don\u0027t want to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can help you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know who this is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re me, aren\u0027t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m you an hour from now. You know how funny time works here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was difficult, so I\u0027ve come back to help you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to start thinking. You need to face up to some things. It\u0027ll go quicker if you start now. I resisted, and it took longer. It was... uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about what you\u0027re doing here. Why are you a ghost? What happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened. I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, you do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo away. I don\u0027t need your help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember Roderick. Remember how he died, the agony. From exposing himself to the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it because of the emperor\u0027s cousin? Am I being punished for that? He died just like the vampire. Because I smudged the lens. Is that it? It was worth it. Rudolph sealed up the caverns after that. He didn\u0027t think the machine worked. It was a good thing. I\u0027m sorry about the emperor\u0027s cousin, but it was good he thought the machine a failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know that\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to speak to you anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember Roderick\u0027s agony. How he withered away. You were exposed to the stone too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou didn\u0027t want to die like that, did you? So much pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what did you do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t do anything. Go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHAT DID YOU DO?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI t-took a rope. A noose. I put it around my neck. Oh, God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. I remember. Oh, my God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wept. I don\u0027t know how long. It\u0027s hard to tell when you\u0027re disembodied, when you can\u0027t feel warm tears roll down your cheek. I wept and wept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. Feel better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know. I feel tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going on ahead. I\u0027ll see you there soon. You\u0027ll make it okay now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I feel myself being pulled along. Not like when Zabel summoned me to his rooftop. More like floating along with a gentle current. I\u0027m floating into the gray. There\u0027s no tunnel of light. No choir of angels. Just the long gray. And I\u0027m going there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToward an ending. And a beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto all things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter fleeing St. Vitus Cathedral and Prague Castle, they returned to Penny\u0027s apartment, where Allen and Amy laid Penny on her bed. She woke several hours later, pleasantly surprised to be in her own room. Allen and Amy filled her in on what she\u0027d missed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny cried for Father Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all slept, aches and bruises and fatigue forcing them into the deepest slumber of their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, Allen and Penny walked Amy to the nearest tram stop. Amy wore a pink T-shirt, white shorts, and sandals, her toenails painted the same pink as the T-shirt. She wore a small backpack over one shoulder. She looked like she was on her way to a sorority beach party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew I never had any powers,\" Amy said wistfully. \"But to be a member of the Society, to have a place. I\u0027m not very independent, I guess. I needed to belong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do now?\" Allen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Maybe in the fall I\u0027ll go back to school. Finish my dissertation in astrophysics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstrophysics?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until then I suppose I\u0027ll bum around,\" Amy said. \"I\u0027ll take the tram to the train station. Catch the express to Vienna. It\u0027ll be nice to be an ordinary tourist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny offered her hand, and they shook. \"I know we didn\u0027t hit it off at first, but I hope we see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy smiled. \"I\u0027d like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tram pulled up to the stop, and Amy climbed aboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly jumped off, grabbed Allen\u0027s face, and planted a hard kiss right on his lips. Allen stood speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy flashed a devilish grin at Penny. \"I know he\u0027s all yours. But he sure is cute, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hopped back aboard the tram as it pulled out, and they watched Amy wave from the back window. The tram rounded a corner and trundled out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny and Allen strolled the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just occurred to me,\" Allen said. \"I don\u0027t have to research a chapter on Kafka for Professor Evergreen anymore. Looks like I have a whole summer and nothing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny\u0027s hand found his, and their fingers laced. \"Well, I just don\u0027t know what you\u0027re going to do. I hear Prague\u0027s kind of a dull town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen\u0027s face grew somber. \"I think there\u0027s something I need to tell you, Penny. Something about me and Cassandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" she said. \"Amy told me all about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t say I\u0027m thrilled,\" she admitted, \"but it wasn\u0027t your fault.\" She stopped him, stood in front of him, head tilted up. \"Besides, you\u0027re mine. I earned you. So try to be worth it, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like I know what I\u0027m doing this summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her long and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch better than a Bront\u0026amp;euml; novel. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-27.html","bookId":2600,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM"}
