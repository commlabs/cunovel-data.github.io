The two riders plodded along, taking care to stay on the trail. They made good time, despite the foul weather, with Wulfgar driving them hard. Soon they came to a region of scattered farmhouses and stone cottages. Now the storm proved to be their ally, for few curious faces showed in the heavily curtained windows, and through the snow, wrapped in thick skins, the pair were hardly recognizable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon after, Wulfgar waited in a sheltered overhang along the foothills, while Morik, Lord Brandeburg of Waterdeep, rode down into the village. The day turned late, the storm continued, but Morik didn\u0027t return. Wulfgar left his shelter to move to a vantage point that would afford him a view of Castle Auck. He wondered if Morik had been discovered. If so, should he rush down to find some way to aid his friend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar gave a chuckle. It was more likely that Morik had stayed on at the castle for a fine meal and was warming himself before the hearth at that very moment. The barbarian retreated again to his shelter to brush down his horse, telling himself to be patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Morik did return, wearing a grim expression indeed. \"I was not met with friendly hugs,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your disguise did not hold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that,\" said the rogue. \"They thought me Lord Brandeburg, but just as I feared they considered it a bit odd that I disappeared at the same time you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar nodded. They had discussed that very possibility. \"Why did they let you leave if they were suspicious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I convinced them it was but a coincidence,\" he reported, \"else why would I return to Auckney? Of course, I had to share a large meal to persuade them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Wulfgar agreed archly, his tone dry. \"What of Lady Meralda and her child? Did you see her?\" the barbarian prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik pulled the saddle from his horse and began brushing his own beast down, as if preparing again for the road. \"It is time for us to be gone,\" he replied flatly. \"Far from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What news?\" Wulfgar pressed, now truly concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no allies here, and no acquaintances even, in any mood to entertain visitors,\" Morik replied. \"Better for all that Wulfgar, Morik, and Lord Brandeburg, put this wretched little pretend fiefdom far behind their horses\u0027 tails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar leaned over and grabbed the rogue\u0027s shoulder, roughly turning him from his work on the horse. \"The Lady Meralda?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She birthed a child late last night,\" Morik admitted reluctantly. Wulfgar\u0027s eyes grew wide with trepidation. \"Both survived,\" Morik quickly added, \"for now.\" Pulling away, the rogue went back to his work with renewed vigor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling Wulfgar\u0027s eyes on him expectantly, Morik sighed and turned back. \"Look, she told them that you had ravished her,\" he reminded his friend. \"It seems likely that she was covering an affair,\" Morik reasoned. \"She lied, condemning you, to hide her own betrayal of the young lord.\" Again, the knowing nod, for this was no news to Wulfgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik looked at him hard, surprised that he was not shaken somewhat by the blunt expression of all that had occurred, surprised that he was showing no anger at all despite the fact that, because of the woman, he had been beaten and nearly brutally executed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now there is doubt concerning the heritage of the child,\" Morik explained. \"The birth was too soon, considering our encounter with the girl on the road, and there are those within the village and castle who do not believe her tale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar gave a profound sigh. \"I suspected as much would happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard some talk of a young man who fell to his death on the day of the wedding between Lord Feringal and Meralda, a man who died crying out for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord Feringal believes he\u0027s the one who cuckolded him?\" Wulfgar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not specifically,\" Morik replied. \"Since the child was surely conceived before the wedding-even if it had been your child, that would have been so-but he knows, of course, that his wife once lay with another, and now he may be thinking that it was of her own volition and not something forced upon her on a wild road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ravished woman is without blame,\" Wulfgar put in, for it all made sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While a cheating woman. . . .\" Morik added ominously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar gave another sigh and walked out of the shelter, staring again at the castle. \"What will happen to her?\" he called back to Morik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The marriage will be declared invalid, surely,\" Morik answered, having lived in human cities long enough to understand such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the Lady Meralda will be sent from the castle,\" the barbarian said hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she\u0027s fortunate, she\u0027ll be banished from Feringal Auck\u0027s domain with neither money nor title,\" Morik replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if she\u0027s unfortunate?\" Wulfgar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik winced. \"Noblemen\u0027s wives have been put to death for such offenses,\" the worldly rogue replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What of the child?\" an increasingly agitated Wulfgar demanded. The images of his own horrible past experiences began edging in at the corners of his consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If fortunate, banished,\" Morik replied, \"though I fear such an action will take more good fortune than the banishment of the woman. It is very complicated. The child is a threat to Auck\u0027s domain, but also to his pride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They would kill a child, a helpless babe?\" Wulfgar asked, his teeth clenched tightly as those awful memories began to creep ever closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rage of a betrayed lord cannot be underestimated,\" Morik answered grimly. \"Lord Feringal cannot show weakness, else risk the loss of the respect of his people and the loss of his lands. Complicated and unpleasant business, all. Now let us be gone from this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar was indeed gone, storming out from under the overhang and stalking down the trails. Morik was quick to catch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will you do?\" the rogue demanded, recognizing Wulfgar\u0027s resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027ve got to do something,\" Wulfgar said, increasing his pace with the level of his agitation while Morik struggled to keep up. As they entered the village, the storm again proved an ally, for no peasants were about. Wulfgar\u0027s eyes were set on the bridge leading to Castle Auck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give the child away, as you planned,\" Steward Temigast suggested to the pacing Lord Feringal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is different now,\" the young man stammered, slapping his fists helplessly at his sides. He glanced over at Priscilla. His sister was sitting comfortably, her smug smile a reminder that she\u0027d warned him against marrying a peasant in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know that anything has changed,\" Temigast said, always the voice of reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePriscilla snorted. \"Can you not count?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The child could be early,\" Temigast protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As well-formed a babe as ever I\u0027ve seen,\" said Priscilla. \"She was not early, Temigast, and you know it.\" Priscilla looked straight at her brother, reiterating the talk that had been buzzing about Castle Auck all day. \"The child was conceived mid-summer,\" she said, \"before the supposed attack on the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I know for sure?\" Lord Feringal wailed. His hands tore at the sides of his pants, an accurate reflection of the rending going on inside his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you not know?\" Priscilla shot back. \"You\u0027ve been made a fool to the mirth of all the village. Will you compound that now with weakness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still love her,\" Steward Temigast cut in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I?\" Lord Feringal said, so obviously torn and confused. \"I don\u0027t know anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send her away, then,\" the steward offered. \"Banish her with the child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would make the villagers laugh all the harder,\" Priscilla observed sourly. \"Do you want the child to return in a score of years and take your kingdom from you? How many times have we heard of such tales?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemigast glared at the woman. Such things had occurred, but they were far from common.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I to do, then?\" Lord Feringal demanded of his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A trial of treason for the whore,\" Priscilla answered matter-of-factly, \"and a swift and just removal of the result of her infidelity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Removal?\" Feringal echoed skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants you to kill the child,\" Temigast explained archly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Throw it to the waves,\" Priscilla supplied feverishly, coming right out of her chair. \"If you show no weakness now, the folk will still respect you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will hate you more if you murder an innocent child,\" Temigast said angrily, more to Priscilla than Lord Feringal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Innocent?\" Priscilla balked as if the notion were preposterous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let them hate you,\" she said to Lord Feringal, moving her face to within an inch of his. \"Better that than to laugh at you. Would you suffer the bastard to live? A reminder, then, of he who lay with Meralda before you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut your mouth!\" Lord Feringal demanded, pushing her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePriscilla didn\u0027t back down. \"Oh, but how she purred in the arms of Jaka Sculi,\" she said, and her brother was trembling so much that he couldn\u0027t even speak through his grinding teeth. \"I\u0027ll wager she arched that pretty back of hers for him,\" Priscilla finished lewdly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeral, sputtering sounds escaped the young lord. He grabbed his sister by the shoulders with both hands and flung her aside. She was smiling the whole time, satisfied, for the enraged lord shoved past Temigast and ran for the stairs. The stairs that led to Meralda and her bastard child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s guarded, you know,\" Morik reminded him, yelling though his voice sounded thin in the howling wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar wouldn\u0027t have heeded the warning anyway. His eyes were set on Castle Auck, and his line to the bridge didn\u0027t waver. He pictured the mounds of snow as the Spine of the World, as that barrier between the man he had been and the victim he had become. Now, his mind free at last of all influence of potent liquor, his strength of will granting him armor against those awful images of his imprisonment, Wulfgar saw the choices clearly before him. He could turn back to the life he had found or he could press on, could cross that emotional barrier, could fight and claw his way back to the man he once was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barbarian growled and pressed on against the storm. He even picked up speed as he reached the bridge, a fast walk, a trot, then a full run as he picked his course, veering to the right, where the snow had drifted along the railing and the castle\u0027s front wall. Up the drift Wulfgar went, crunching into snow past his knees, but growling and plowing on, maintaining his momentum. He leaped from the top of the drift, reaching with an outstretched arm to hook his hammer\u0027s head atop the wall. Wulfgar heard a startled call from above as it caught loudly against the stone, but he hardly slowed, great muscles cording and tugging, propelling him upward, where he rolled around, slipping right over the crenelated barrier. He landed nimbly on his feet on the parapet within, right between two dumbfounded guards, neither of them holding a weapon as they tried to keep their hands warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik rushed up the same path as Wulfgar, using agile moves to scale the wall nearly as fast as his friend had done with brute strength. Still, by the time he got to the parapet Wulfgar was already down in the courtyard, storming for the main keep. Both guards were down, too, lying on the ground and groaning, one holding his jaw, the other curled up and clutching his belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secure the door!\" one of the guards managed to cry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main door cracked open then, a man peeking out. Seeing Wulfgar bearing in, he tried to close it fast. Wulfgar got there just before it slammed, pushing back with all his strength. He heard the man calling frantically for help, felt the greater push as another guard joined the first, both leaning heavily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming, too,\" Morik called, \"though only the gods know why!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thoughts far away, in a dark and smoky place where his child\u0027s last terrified cry rent the air, Wulfgar didn\u0027t hear his friend, didn\u0027t need him. Bellowing, he shoved with all his strength until the door flew in, tossing the two guards like children against the back wall of the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she?\" Wulfgar demanded, and even as he spoke the foyer\u0027s other door swung open. Liam Woodgate appeared, rushing in with sword in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you pay, dog!\" the coachman cried, coming in fast and hard, stabbing, a feint. Pulling the blade back in, he sent it into a sudden twirl, then feigned a sidelong slice, turning it over again and coming straight in with a deadly thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam was good, the best fighter in all of Auckney, and he knew it. That\u0027s why it was difficult to understand how Wulfgar\u0027s hammer came out so fast to hook over Liam\u0027s blade and take it safely wide of the mark. How could the huge barbarian turn so nimbly on his feet to get within reach of Liam\u0027s sword? How was he able to come around perfectly, sending his thick arm spiking up under Liam\u0027s sword arm? Liam knew his own skill, and so it was even harder for him to understand how his clever attack had been turned against him so completely. Liam knew only that his face was suddenly pressed against the stone wall, his arms pulled tight behind his back, and the snarling barbarian\u0027s breath was on his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady Meralda and the child,\" Wulfgar asked. \"Where are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d die afore I\u0027d tell you!\" Liam declared. Wulfgar pressed in. The poor old gnome thought he surely would die, but Liam held his determined tongue and growled against the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar spun him around and slammed him once, then slammed him again when he managed somehow to hold his feet, launching him over to the floor. Liam nearly tripped up Morik, who skipped right on by through the other door and into the castle proper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar was right behind him. They heard voices, and Morik led the way, crashing through a set of double doors and into a comfortable sitting room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord Brandeburg?\" Lady Priscilla asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squealed in fright and fell back in her chair as Wulfgar followed the rogue into the room. \"Where is Lady Meralda and the child?\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you caused enough harm?\" Steward Temigast demanded, moving to stand boldly before the huge man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar looked him right in the eye. \"Too much,\" he admitted, \"but none here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat set Temigast back on his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they?\" Wulfgar demanded, rushing up to Priscilla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thieves! Murderers!\" Priscilla cried, swooning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar locked stares with Temigast. To Wulfgar\u0027s surprise, the old steward nodded and motioned toward the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he did, Priscilla Auck ran full-out up the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea what you\u0027ve done to me?\" Feringal asked Meralda, standing by the edge of her bed, the infant girl lying warm beside her. \"To us? To Auckney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg you to try to understand, my lord,\" the woman pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeringal winced, pounding his fists into his eyes. His visage steeled, and he reached down and plucked the babe from her side. Meralda started up toward him, but she hadn\u0027t the strength and fell back on the bed. \"What\u0027re you about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeringal strode over to the window and pulled the curtain aside. \"My sister says I should toss it to the waves upon the rocks,\" he said through teeth locked in a tight grimace, \"to rid myself of the evidence of your betrayal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Feringal, do not-\" Meralda began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what they\u0027re all saying, you know,\" Feringal said as if she hadn\u0027t spoken. He blinked his eyes and wiped his nose with his sleeve. \"The child of Jaka Sculi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lord!\" she cried, her red-rimmed eyes fearful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you?\" Feringal yelled, then looked from the baby in his hands to the open window. Meralda started to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cuckold, and now the murderer,\" Feringal muttered to himself as he moved closer to the window. \"You have damned me, Meralda!\" he cursed. Holding out his arms, he moved the crying baby to the opening, then he looked down at the innocent little girl and pulled her back close, his tears mixing with the baby\u0027s. \"Damned me, I say!\" he cried, and the breath came in labored, forced gasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the door to the room flew open, and Lady Priscilla burst in. She slammed it shut and secured the bolt behind her. Surveying the scene quickly, she ran to her brother, her voice shrill. \"Give it to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Feringal rolled his shoulder between the child and Priscilla\u0027s grasping hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give it to me!\" the woman shrieked again, and a tussle for the baby ensued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar went in fast pursuit, taking the curving staircase four steps at a stride. He came to a long hallway lined with rich tapestries where he ran into yet another bumbling castle guard. The barbarian slapped the prone man\u0027s sword away, caught him by the throat, and lifted him into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorik skittered past him, going from door to door, ear cocked, then he stopped abruptly at one. \"They\u0027re in here,\" he announced. He grabbed the handle only to find it locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The key?\" Wulfgar demanded, giving the guard a shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man grabbed the barbarian\u0027s iron arm. \"No key,\" he gasped breathlessly. Wulfgar looked about to strangle him, but the thief intervened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bother, I\u0027ll pick the lock,\" he said, going fast to his belt pouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bother, I have a key,\" Wulfgar cried. Morik looked up to see the barbarian bearing down on him, the guard still dangling at the end of one arm. Seeing his intent, Morik skittered out of the way as Wulfgar hurled the hapless man through the wooden door. \"A key,\" the barbarian explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well thrown,\" Morik commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have had practice,\" explained Wulfgar, thundering past the dazed guard to leap into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeralda sat up on the bed, sobbing, while Lord Feringal and his sister stood by the open window, the babe in Feringal\u0027s arms. He was leaning toward the opening as if he meant to throw the child out. Both siblings and Meralda turned stunned expressions Wulfgar\u0027s way, and their eyes widened even more when Morik crashed in behind the barbarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord Brandeburg!\" Feringal cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Priscilla shouted at her brother, \"Do it now, before they ruin every-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The child is mine!\" Wulfgar declared. Priscilla bit off the end of her sentence in surprise. Feringal froze as if turned to stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" the young lord gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Lady Priscilla gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" gasped Morik, at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" gasped Meralda, quietly, and she coughed quickly to cover her surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The child is mine,\" Wulfgar repeated firmly, \"and if you throw her out the window, then you shall follow so quickly that you\u0027ll pass her by and your broken body will pad her fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so eloquent in emergencies,\" Morik remarked. To Lord Feringal, he added, \"The window is small, yes, but I\u0027ll wager that my big friend can squeeze you through it. And your plump sister, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be the father,\" Lord Feringal declared, trembling so violently that it seemed as if his legs would just buckle beneath him. He looked to Priscilla for an answer, to his sister who was always hovering above him with all of the answers. \"What trick is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give it to me!\" Priscilla demanded. Taking advantage of her brother\u0027s paralyzing confusion, she moved quickly and tore the child from Feringal\u0027s grasp. Meralda cried out, the baby cried, and Wulfgar started forward, knowing that he could never get there in time, knowing that the innocent was surely doomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Priscilla turned for the window, her brother leaped before her and slugged her in the face. Stunned, she staggered back a step. Feringal snatched the child from her arms and shoved her again, sending his sister stumbling to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar eyed the man for a long and telling moment, understanding then beyond any doubt that despite his obvious anger and revulsion, Feringal would not hurt the child. The barbarian strode across the room, secure in his observations, confident that the young man would take no action against the babe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The child is mine,\" the barbarian said with a growl, reaching over to gently pull the wailing baby from Feringal\u0027s weakening grasp. \"I meant to wait another month before returning,\" he explained, turning to face Meralda. \"But it\u0027s good you delivered early. A child of mine come to full term would likely have killed you in birthing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wulfgar!\" Morik cried suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Feringal, apparently recovering some of his nerve and most of his rage, produced a dagger from his belt and came in hard at the barbarian. Morik needn\u0027t have worried, though, for Wulfgar heard the movement. Lifting the babe high with one arm to keep her from harm\u0027s way, he spun and slapped the dagger aside with his free hand. As Feringal came in close, Wulfgar brought his knee up hard into the man\u0027s groin. Down Lord Feringal went, curling into a mewling heap on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think my large friend can make it so that you never have children of your own,\" Morik remarked with a wink to Meralda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeralda didn\u0027t even hear the words, staring dumbfounded at Wulfgar, at the child he had proclaimed as his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For my actions on the road, I truly apologize, Lady Meralda,\" the barbarian said, and he was playing to a full audience now, as Liam Woodgate, Steward Temigast and the remaining half dozen castle guards appeared at the door, staring in wide-eyed disbelief. On the floor before Wulfgar, Lady Priscilla looked up at him, confusion and unbridled anger simmering in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the bottle and your beauty that took me,\" Wulfgar explained. He turned his attention to the child, his smile wide as he lifted the infant girl into the air for his sparkling blue eyes to behold. \"But I\u0027ll not apologize for the result of that crime,\" he said. \"Never that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will kill you,\" Lord Feringal growled, struggling to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar reached down with one hand and grabbed him by the collar. Helping him up with a powerful jerk, he spun the lord around into a choke hold. \"You will forget me, and the child,\" Wulfgar whispered into his ear. \"Else the combined tribes of Icewind Dale will sack you and your wretched little village.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar pushed the young lord, spinning him into Morik\u0027s waiting grasp. Staring at Liam and the other dangerous guards, the rogue wasted no time in putting a sharp dagger to the man\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secure us supplies for the road,\" Wulfgar instructed. \"We need wrappings and food for the babe.\" Everyone in the room, save Wulfgar and the baby, wore incredulous expressions. \"Do it!\" the barbarian roared. Frowning, Morik pushed toward the door with Lord Feringal, waving a scrambling Priscilla out ahead of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fetch!\" the rogue instructed Liam and Priscilla. He glanced back and saw Wulfgar moving toward Meralda then, so he pushed out even further, backing them all away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What made you do such a thing?\" Meralda asked when she was alone with Wulfgar and the child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your problem was not hard to discern,\" Wulfgar explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I falsely accused you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understandably so,\" Wulfgar replied. \"You were trapped and scared, but in the end you risked everything to free me from prison. I could not let that deed go unpaid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeralda shook her head, too overwhelmed to even begin to sort this out. So many thoughts and emotions whirled in her mind. She had seen the look of despair on Feringal\u0027s face, had thought he would, indeed, drop the baby to the rocks. Yet, in the end he hadn\u0027t been able to do it, hadn\u0027t let his sister do it. She did love this man-how could she not? And yet, she could hardly deny her unexpected feelings for her child, though she knew that never, ever, could she keep her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am taking the babe far from here,\" Wulfgar said determinedly, as if he had read her mind. \"You are welcome to come with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeralda laughed softly, without humor, because she knew she would be crying soon enough. \"I can\u0027t,\" she explained, her voice a whisper. \"I\u0027ve a duty to my husband, if he\u0027ll still have me, and to my family. My folks would be branded if I went with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duty? Is that the only reason you\u0027re staying?\" Wulfgar asked her, apparently sensing something more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love him, you know,\" Meralda replied, tears streaming down her beautiful face. \"I know what you must think of me, but truly, the babe was made before I ever-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar held up his hand. \"You owe me no explanation,\" he said, \"for I am hardly in a position to judge you or anyone else. I came to understand your . . . problem, and so I returned to repay your generosity, that is all.\" He looked to the door through which Morik held Lord Feringal. \"He does love you,\" he said. \"His eyes and the depth of his pain showed that clearly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027m right in staying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar shrugged, again refusing to offer any judgments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t leave him,\" Meralda said, and she reached up and tenderly stroked the child\u0027s face, \"but I cannot keep her, either. Feringal would never accept her,\" she admitted, her tone empty and hollow, for she realized her time with her daughter was nearing its end. \"But perhaps he\u0027d give her over to another family in Auckney now that he\u0027s thinking I didn\u0027t betray him,\" she suggested faintly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A reminder to him of his pain, and to you of your lie,\" Wulfgar said softly, not accusing the woman, but surely reminding her of the truth. \"And within the reach of his shrewish sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeralda lowered her gaze and accepted the bitter truth. The baby was not safe in Auckney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who better to raise her than me?\" Wulfgar asked suddenly, resolve in his voice. He looked down at the little girl, and his mouth turned up into a warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar nodded. \"Happily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d keep her safe?\" Meralda pressed. \"Tell her of her ma?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar nodded. \"I don\u0027t know where my road now leads,\" he explained, \"but I suspect I\u0027ll not venture too far from here. Perhaps someday I will return, or at least she will, to glimpse her ma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeralda was shaking with sobs, her face gleaming with tears. Wulfgar glanced to the doorway to make sure that he was not being watched, then bent down and kissed her on the cheek. \"I think it best,\" he said quietly. \"Do you agree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she studied the man for a moment, this man who had risked everything to save her and her child though they had done nothing to deserve his heroism, Meralda nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears continued to flow freely. Wulfgar could appreciate the pain she was feeling, the depth of her sacrifice. He leaned in, allowing Meralda to stroke and kiss her baby girl one last time, but when she moved to take her away, Wulfgar pulled back. Meralda\u0027s smile of understanding was bittersweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fairwell, little one,\" she said through her sobs and looked away. Wulfgar bowed to Meralda one last time, then, with the baby cradled in his big arms, he turned and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found Morik in the hallway, barking commands for plenty of food and clothing-and gold, for they\u0027d need gold to properly situate the child in warm and comfortable inns. Barbarian, baby, and thief, made their way through the castle, and no one made a move to stop them. It seemed as if Lord Feringal had cleared their path, wanting the two thieves and the bastard child out of his castle and out of his life as swiftly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePriscilla, however, was a different issue. They ran into her on the first floor, where she came up to Wulfgar and tried to take the baby, glaring at him defiantly all the while. The barbarian held her at bay, his expression making it clear that he would break her in half if she tried to harm the child. Priscilla huffed her disgust, threw a thick wool wrap at him, and with a final growl of protest, turned on her heel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid cow,\" Morik muttered under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling, Wulfgar tenderly wrapped the baby in the warm blanket, finally silencing her crying. Outside, the daylight was fast on the wane, but the storm had faded, the last clouds breaking apart and rushing across the sky on swift winds. The gate was lowered. Across the bridge they saw Steward Temigast waiting for them with a pair of horses, Lord Feringal at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeringal stood staring at Wulfgar and the baby for a long moment. \"If you ever come back . . .\" he started to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I?\" the barbarian interrupted. \"I have my child now, and she will grow up to be a queen in Icewind Dale. Entertain no thoughts of coming after me, Lord Feringal, to the ruin of all your world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I?\" Feringal returned in the same grim tone, facing up to Wulfgar boldly. \"I have my wife, my beautiful wife. My innocent wife, who gives herself to me willingly. I do not have to force myself upon her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last statement, a recapture of some measure of manly pride, told Wulfgar that Feringal had forgiven Meralda, or that he soon enough would. Wulfgar\u0027s desperate, unconsidered and purely improvised plan had somehow, miraculously, worked. He bit back any semblance of a chuckle at the ridiculousness of it all, let Feringal have his needed moment. He didn\u0027t even blink as the lord of Auckney composed himself, squared his shoulders, and walked back across the bridge through the lowered gate to his home and his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteward Temigast handed the reins to the pair. \"She isn\u0027t yours,\" the steward said unexpectedly. Starting to pull himself and the babe up into the saddle, Wulfgar pretended not to hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fear not, for I\u0027ll not tell, nor will Meralda, whose life you have truly saved this day,\" the steward went on. \"You are a fine man, Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, of the Tribe of the Elk of Icewind Dale.\" Wulfgar blinked in amazement, both at the compliment and at the simple fact that the man knew so much of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wizard who caught you told him,\" Morik reasoned. \"I hate wizards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will be no pursuit,\" said Temigast. \"On my word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that word held true, for Morik and Wulfgar rode without incident back to the overhang, where they retrieved their own horses, then continued down the east road and out of Auckney for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Wulfgar asked Morik later that night, seeing the rogue\u0027s amused expression. They were huddled about a blazing fire, keeping the child warm. Morik smiled and held up a pair of bottles, one with warm goat\u0027s milk for the child, the other with their favored potent drink. Wulfgar took the one with the goat\u0027s milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will never understand you, my friend,\" Morik remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar smiled, but did not respond. Morik could never truly know of Wulfgar\u0027s past, of the good times with Drizzt and the others, and of the very worst times with Errtu and the offspring of his stolen seed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are easier ways to make gold,\" Morik remarked, and that brought Wulfgar\u0027s steely gaze over him. \"You mean to sell the child, of course,\" Morik reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fine price,\" Morik argued, taking a healthy swig from the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not fine enough,\" said Wulfgar, turning back to the babe. The little girl wriggled and cooed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot plan to keep her!\" Morik argued. \"What place has she with us? With you, wherever you plan to go? Have you lost all sensibility?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScowling, Wulfgar spun on him, slapped the bottle from his hands, then shoved him back to the ground, as determined an answer as Morik the Rogue had ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not even yours!\" Morik reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rogue could not have been more wrong. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-spine-of-the-world-paths-of-darkness-2/page-26.html","bookId":2132,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:30 PM"}
