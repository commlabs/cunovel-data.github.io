There’s that new place in Yarmouth I’ve been dying to try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ooh, I heard that place was divine.” Mrs. Kahn slid the pool cues back into the rack. “I’m in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could go for that,” Eric said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi made a face. “Gelato is, like, pure fat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I no like things that are cold—only hot,” Klaudia said, making sexy eyes at Eric, who ignored her. Apparently he’d gotten the message that Klaudia was loony, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel glanced at Aria apologetically, probably thinking she wanted to get out of there, but Aria just shrugged. She didn’t have time to go to the movies with Noel, anyway—she was meeting Emily at the Bakers’ open house in about an hour and a half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think gelato would be great,” she said to Mr. Kahn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fantastic.” Mr. Kahn was already halfway up the stairs. “I’ll go pick it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The weather is so dreary, though.” Mrs. Kahn peered through the door of the walk-out basement at the rain pounding on the brick patio. “I’d hate for you to drive all the way to Yarmouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t mind,” Mr. Kahn called over his shoulder. “Why doesn’t everyone give me their orders?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel, Aria, Eric, and Mrs. Kahn climbed the stairs behind Mr. Kahn and waited as he dug the menu out of a leather file in the cabinet drawer. They selected their flavors, and Mr. Kahn made the call. As he was slipping on his rain jacket, Mrs. Kahn touched his arm. “Want me to go with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Kahn kissed her lightly on the lips. “There’s no use for us both to get soaked. I won’t be long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut the front door, and his car engine roared. Mrs. Kahn and Eric disappeared into the den, and Noel excused himself to the bathroom, leaving Aria all alone in the cavernous kitchen. The huge house was suddenly very still and overwhelming, the only sound the pounding rain against the roof. Suddenly thunder crackled, and the room went dark. Aria screamed. “Noel?” she called out, feeling along the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the distance, someone—Naomi, maybe—giggled. Another clap of thunder sounded, shaking the pots and pans hanging over the island. Lightning lit up the room. For a split second, Aria was sure she saw a pair of eyes staring at her from outside the back window. She screamed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the lights snapped back on with a spark. The refrigerator hummed calmly, the recessed lights cast a peaceful yellow glow over the room, and the eyes at the window were gone. When Aria looked down, she saw that her cell phone, which was nestled in her pocket, was blinking. She grabbed it and swallowed hard. One new text message from Anonymous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed READ, dreading what she might see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a picture of a blond-haired woman applying cherry-red lipstick in the front seat of a car. The woman wore a blue oxford shirt and an expensive gold watch—the same ones Mr. Kahn had worn during the pool game. Add in his telltale bushy eyebrows and straight mouth, and anyone would know it was him. The clock on the dashboard of his car said 1:35—three minutes ago. The tall, iron eagle on the post in the corner of the picture was the eagle at the Kahns’ front gate. He’d put on the wig before he’d even left the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria ran to the window, certain she’d see someone lurking at the end of the driveway, but there was no one there. Sweat beaded on her forehead. No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aria?” Noel called from the hall. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria dropped the curtain and whipped around. Noel was walking toward her. She fumbled for the ERASE button on her phone, not wanting Noel to see the picture, but her finger bumped the right arrow instead, bringing up a note that went with the picture. As Aria read it, her heart stopped dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecrets are such a drag. Break up with your loving boyfriend, or this pic goes public. —A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE HOME OF HER DREAMS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome to the open house!” a cheery realtor with a stiff black hair-helmet said as she ushered Emily and Aria through the open door of 204 Ship Lane. She thrust a square business card into each of their hands. “My name is Sandra. Have a look around!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily turned the card over. Let me find you the home of your dreams, Sandra’s slogan read. “Actually, I was wondering—” she started, but Sandra was already attending to a new couple who had come in after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking out her umbrella and pushing back the hood of her raincoat, Emily stepped into the foyer of the house she’d obsessed over for the past seven months. It was empty, and only a few hints of the Bakers remained. The air smelled like a peppermint candle and Windex. The walls were painted a cheerful blue, and in the open closet was a blue plastic wrapper for the Philadelphia Sentinel. There were tiny scratches in the golden wooden floor from dog toenails, and someone had left a God’s-eye string ornament hanging over the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stared at the brass strip that separated the tiled foyer from the wooden living room floor, afraid to step any further into the house. Was she really ready to see this place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria turned to Emily, as if sensing her apprehension. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh huh,” Emily said woozily. “Thanks for meeting me here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem.” An uneasy look swept over Aria’s face, but when she noticed Emily looking at her, she quickly smiled again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” Emily asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s jaw trembled. “I don’t want to bother you with it. You’ve got enough going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily rolled her eyes. “Come on. What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment’s hesitation, Aria leaned in closer, her feather earrings brushing against Emily’s cheek. “Well, okay. I got a note from A about an hour ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s mouth dropped open. “What did it say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria pressed her glossy lips together. “It doesn’t matter. Just some stupid stuff. But I was at Noel’s house, and A took a picture of something at the end of Noel’s driveway. A was so close, and I missed seeing who it was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver snaked up Emily’s spine. “Remember the note I got on my car at the covered bridge? The one with the picture of me and Tabitha? A was close then, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria skirted out of the way of two more people who had come through the front door. “How is it that we keep missing A? And how does A always know where we are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali would always know where we were,” Emily said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s shoulders lowered. “Em, A isn’t Ali. There’s no way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shut her eyes. She was so sick of having the same argument over and over. But she couldn’t explain why she was convinced Ali wasn’t dead—she’d have to confess that she’d left open the door in the burning house in the Poconos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stepped into the living room. The blue carpet had deep indentations from where the furniture had stood. “A is definitely Gayle, Em. Remember how weird she was that day at the café? She’s totally capable of stalking us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it makes no sense.” Emily glanced over her shoulder to make sure an elderly couple in matching argyle sweaters wasn’t listening. “Gayle has no connection to Jamaica. How could she know what we did?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure you didn’t say anything to anyone?” Aria asked. “What about that friend of yours, Derrick? He worked for Gayle, right? Are you sure you didn’t slip and tell him anything about Tabitha?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily whirled around and glared at Aria. “Of course not! How could you even think that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria held up her hands in surrender. “I’m sorry. I’m just trying to cover all the bases.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra’s voice rang out in the other room, telling a potential buyer about the square footage and the kitchen upgrades. Emily tried to swallow her annoyance, knowing Aria wasn’t trying to accuse her of anything. She wandered out of the living room and up the stairs to the second floor. The master bedroom was the first room on the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was painted a dusty gray and had wooden blinds on the windows. Emily could picture a bed on one wall, a dresser on another. But she couldn’t picture the Bakers living within these walls. Were they late sleepers or early risers? Did they snack on cookies and potato chips in bed, leaving crumbs in the sheets? How many tears had they shed over not being able to have a child?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of the first things the Bakers had told Emily when she’d met them—they’d been trying for over four years to no avail. “We both work with kids all day, and we’d love to have some of our own,” Mrs. Baker had said earnestly. “We’ve always wanted to be parents.” Mr. Baker’s fingers gripped his wife’s hand hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Emily walked the perimeter of the room, touching the light switch, tracing a tiny crack in the wall, and poking her head into an empty closet. She could only imagine how overjoyed the Bakers had been when they’d found out she had chosen them as her baby’s adoptive parents. They’d probably lain in bed at night, dreaming of their child, fantasizing about swimming lessons, vacations, and the first day of school. Then she imagined the Bakers’ shock when they found out Emily had changed her mind. She’d asked Rebecca, the adoption coordinator, to pass on the message—she’d been too chicken to tell the Bakers herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca had been confused. “So . . . you’re keeping the baby?” she’d sounded out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, I’ve just come up with another option,” Emily said evasively, not wanting to admit that she’d found another adoptive parent—or that Gayle had offered her a lot of money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coordinator called back a little later and told Emily that the Bakers had been very gracious with her decision. “They want your baby to have the best home possible, and if you think that’s somewhere else, they understand,” Rebecca said. In some ways, it disappointed Emily: She would have rather they’d been furious at her. It was what she deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily had thought about the Bakers a lot after she made the decision to give the baby to Gayle, especially after Gayle started calling Emily nonstop. Every time Emily’s phone rang, it was Gayle, checking in. At first, Emily indulged her, rationalizing Gayle’s rapid speech, her shaky laugh, her nervous questions. She was just excited, right? She tried to justify why she hadn’t met Gayle’s husband, the potential father, yet—Gayle said he was really busy, but he was one hundred percent on board. When her phone started ringing every hour, Emily let the calls go to voicemail, the uneasiness growing sharper and more acrid inside her. Something wasn’t right. She began looking for ways to get out of the deal. She dreaded the day she’d have to give the baby up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final straw came two weeks before Emily’s scheduled C-section. Derrick had asked Emily to pick him up at Gayle’s house after work one Saturday; they were going to go to the Camden Aquarium. Emily hadn’t told Gayle she was coming; she was too tired to deal with her. After parking the car in the long driveway, she’d walked up to the front door and looked through the window. Gayle was standing in the foyer with her back to Emily, talking on the phone. “Yes, it’s true,” she was saying into the receiver. “I’m having a baby. I know, I know, I’ve barely gained any weight, but I guess I’m one of those lucky pregnant people.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stunning-pretty-little-liars-11/page-18.html","bookId":2387,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM"}
