If I hadn\u0027t seen similar menacing, fanged grins through the eyes of people I\u0027d been psychically linked to, I would have been pants-pissing terrified, but a jaded part of me simply acknowledged him for what he was: evil. And I was no stranger to evil, much as I wished otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she\u0027s the real deal like we heard, it could give us the edge we\u0027ve been looking for,\" his brunet companion muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re right,\" Auburn Hair drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to die, but there were some things I wouldn\u0027t do even if it cost me my life. \"Ask me to help you kidnap children, and you may as well start in on my neck now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuburn Hair laughed. \"I can do that on my own,\" he assured me, making my stomach lurch with revulsion. \"What I want from you is more . . . complicated. If I bring you objects to touch, can you tell me about their owner? Such as what he\u0027s doing, where he is, and most importantly, where he will be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to do anything to help this disgusting, murderous group, but my choices were grim. If I refused, I\u0027d get mesmerized into doing it anyway, or get tortured into doing it, or die choking on my own blood because I was of no use to them. Maybe this was my chance to change the fate they intended for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do you want to? a dark inner voice whispered. Aren\u0027t you sick of drowning in other people\u0027s sins? Isn\u0027t death your only way out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my wrist, the faint scars that had nothing to do with my electrocution marking my skin. Once, I\u0027d listened to that despairing inner voice, and I\u0027d be lying if I didn\u0027t admit part of me was still tempted by it. Then I thought of Marty, how I hadn\u0027t told my dad I loved him the last time we spoke, how I hadn\u0027t talked to my sister in months, and finally, how I didn\u0027t want to give these bastards the satisfaction of killing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head came up and I met the leader\u0027s gaze. \"My abilities are tied to my emotions. Abuse me mentally or physically, and you\u0027ll have better luck calling a psychic hotline to find out what you want to know. That means no murdering anyone while I\u0027m getting information for you, and no touching me at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last part I said because of the lustful look the scraggly brunet had been giving me. My skintight body suit and boxer shorts didn\u0027t leave much to the imagination, but it was what I trained in. I hadn\u0027t expected to be kidnapped today or I\u0027d have worn something more conservative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think you can mesmerize me into forgetting whatever you do, either,\" I added, waving my right hand. \"Psychic impressions, remember? I\u0027ll touch you or an object nearby and find out, and then your human crystal ball will be broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the above was bullshit. They could do anything they wanted and I\u0027d still pull impressions from whatever my right hand touched, but I\u0027d used my most convincing tone while praying that, for once, I\u0027d prove to be a good liar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuburn Hair flashed his fangs at me in another scary smile. \"We can manage that, if you deliver what you say you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back with nothing close to humor. \"Oh, I can deliver, all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I glanced at the light socket behind him. And that\u0027s not all I can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAuburn Hair\u0027s name was Jackal, according to what his friends called him. Their names sounded equally made up, so I mentally referred to them as Pervert, Psycho, and Twitchy since the last couldn\u0027t seem to stay still. Twitchy and Pervert had gone out over an hour ago to get some things for me to touch. I\u0027d spent that time sitting on the edge of the hotel\u0027s lumpy mattress, listening to Jackal talk on his cell phone in a language I didn\u0027t recognize. I was getting chilly in my leotard, but I didn\u0027t pull the covers over me. All my instincts were urging me to stay still and not attract any attention to myself, as if that mattered. The predators in this room were very aware of me even if they didn\u0027t glance in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Pervert and Twitchy came back, I looked at the duffel bag they carried with a mixture of dread and optimism. What was inside might lead to more grisly images blasting across my mind, but it would also ensure my survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put the objects in a row on the bed,\" I directed Twitchy, ignoring the startled look he gave me. If I acted like a pitiful damsel in distress, then that\u0027s how they\u0027d treat me. But if I acted like a vital tool in their search for whomever they wanted these objects to lead them to, I upped my chances for survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, I hoped I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it,\" Jackal said, folding his arms across his chest. His stare felt like weights dropping onto me, but I took in several deep breaths and tried to ignore him. Seeing what Twitchy took out of the duffel bag helped with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA charred piece of fabric, a partially melted watch, a ring, something that looked like a belt, and a knife that shone with a distinct silvery gleam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last item made my heart skip a beat, something I hoped the others chalked up to nervousness instead of what it was. Excitement. The movies had it all wrong when it came to vampires. Wooden stakes wouldn\u0027t harm them, nor would sunlight, crosses, or holy water. But silver through the heart meant the party was over, and now I had a silver knife within grabbing distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet, I warned myself. I\u0027d wait until they were so convinced I was helpless that they wouldn\u0027t think twice about leaving a silver knife within easy reach. Or until at least two of them left again, whichever came first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Frankie,\" Jackal said, snapping my gaze back to him. He nodded at the objects. \"Do your thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentally braced myself and then picked up the charred piece of fabric first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoke was everywhere. Twin beams of light cut through it, landing on where I was half concealed by the forklift. Terror flooded me as I realized I\u0027d been spotted. My attempt to run was stopped short, and rough hands hauled me back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-4.html","bookId":2011,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM"}
