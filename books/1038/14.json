Such actions are inevitable; when crossing the top, men carry very little, for too much weight is apt to hamper their movements.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Transports coming along new roads are[166] liable to delay, and in many cases they get blown out of existence altogether. When rations arrive, if they arrive, they are not up to the usual standard, and men would go hungry if death did not come in and help them. As it happens, however, soldiers feed well after a charge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bill lit a candle in the German dug-out, applied a match to a brazier and placed his mess-tin on the flames. The dug-out with its flickering taper gave me an idea of cosiness, coming in as I did from the shell-scarred village and its bleak cobbled streets. To sit down here on a sandbag (Bill had used the wooden seats for a fire) where men had to accommodate themselves on a pigmy scale, was very comfortable and reassuring. The light of the candle and brazier cast a spell of subtle witchery on the black walls and the bayonets gleaming against the roof, but despite this, innumerable shadows lurked in the corners, holding some dark council.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ha!\" said Bill, red in the face from his exertions over the fire. \"There\u0027s the water singin\u0027 in the mess-tin; it\u0027ll soon be dancin\u0027.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The water began to splutter merrily as he spoke, and he emptied the tea on the tin which he lifted from the brazier with his bayonet. From his pack he brought forth a loaf and cut it into good thick slices.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now some sardines, and we\u0027re as comfy[167] as kings,\" he muttered. \"We\u0027ll \u0027ave a meal fit for a gentleman, any gentleman in the land.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What sort of meal is fit for a gentleman?\" I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! a real good proper feed,\" said Bill. \"Suthin\u0027 that fills the guts.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The meal was fit for a gentleman indeed; in turn we drank the tea from the mess-tin and lifted the sardines from the tin with our fingers; we had lost our forks as well as most of our equipment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What are you goin\u0027 to do now?\" asked Bill, when we had finished.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know that there\u0027s anything to be done in my job,\" I said. \"All the wounded have been taken in from here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s no water to be got,\" said Bill. \"There\u0027s a pump in the street, but nobody knows whether it\u0027s poisoned or not. The nearest well that\u0027s safe to drink from is at Maroc.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is there a jar about?\" I asked Bill, and he unearthed one from the corner of his jacket. \"I\u0027ll go to Maroc and bring up a jar of water,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll get back by midnight, if I\u0027m not strafed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I went out on the road. The night had cleared and was now breezy; the moon rode high amongst scurrying clouds, the trees in the fields were harassed by a tossing motion[168] and leant towards the village as if seeking to get there. The grasses shivered, agitated and helpless, and behind the Twin Towers of Loos the star-shells burst into many-coloured flames and showed like a summer flower-garden against the sky. A windmill, with one wing intact, stood out, a ghostly phantom, on a rise overlooking Hulluch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The road to Maroc was very quiet and almost deserted; the nightly traffic had not yet begun, and the nightly cannonade was as yet merely fumbling for an opening. The wrecks of the previous days were still lying there; long-eared mules immobile in the shafts of shattered limbers, dead Highlanders with their white legs showing wan in the moonlight, boys in khaki with their faces pressed tightly against the cobblestones, broken wagons, discarded stretchers, and derelict mailbags with their rain-sodden parcels and letters from home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Many wounded were still lying out in the fields. I could hear them calling for help and groaning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How long had they lain there?\" I asked myself. \"Two days, probably. Poor devils!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I walked along, the water jar knocking against my legs. My heart was filled with gloom. \"What is the meaning of all this?\" I queried. \"This wastage, this hell?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [169]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A white face peered up at me from a ditch by the roadside, and a weak voice whispered, \"Matey!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it, chummy?\" I queried, coming close to the wounded man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you get me in?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ve been out for—oh! I don\u0027t know how long,\" he moaned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are you wounded?\" I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I got a dose of shrapnel, matey,\" he said. \"One bullet caught me in the heel, another in the shoulder.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Has anybody dressed the wounds?\" I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aye, aye,\" he answered. \"Somebody did, then went off and left me here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think you could grip me tightly round the shoulders if I put you on my back?\" I said. \"I\u0027ll try and carry you in.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll give it a trial,\" said the man in a glad voice, and I flung the jar aside and hoisted him on my back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Already I was worn out with having had no sleep for two nights, and the man on my back was heavy. For awhile I tried to walk upright, but gradually my head came nearer the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can\u0027t go any further,\" I said at last, coming to a bank on the roadside and resting my burden. \"I feel played out. I\u0027ll see if I can get any help. There\u0027s a party of[170] men working over there. I\u0027ll try and get a few to assist me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The man lay back on the grass and did not answer. Probably he had lost consciousness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Scotch regiment was at work in the field, digging trenches; I approached an officer, a dark, low set man with a heavy black moustache.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Could you give me some men to assist me to carry in wounded?\" I asked. \"On each side of the road there are dozens——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can\u0027t spare any men,\" said the officer. \"Haven\u0027t enough for the work here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Many of your own countrymen are out there,\" I said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can\u0027t help it,\" said the man. \"We all have plenty of work here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I glanced at the man\u0027s shoulder and saw that he belonged to \"The Lone Star Crush\"; he was a second-lieutenant. Second-lieutenants fight well, but lack initiative.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A captain was directing work near at hand, and I went up to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m a stretcher-bearer,\" I said. \"The fields round here are crowded with wounded who have been lying out for ever so long. I should like to take them into the dressing-station. Could you give me some men to help me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [171]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you come from the Highlands?\" asked the captain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I come from Ireland,\" I said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh!\" said the officer; then inquired: \"How many men do you want?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As many as you can spare.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will twenty do?\" I was asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I went down the road in charge of twenty men, stalwart Highlanders, massive of shoulder and thew, and set about collecting the wounded. Two doors, a barrow and a light cart were procured, and we helped the stricken men on these conveyances. Some men were taken away across the Highlanders\u0027 shoulders, and some who were not too badly hurt limped in with one man to help each case. The fellow whom I left lying by the roadside was placed on a door and borne away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I approached another officer, a major this time, and twelve men were handed over to my care; again six men were found and finally eight who set about their work like Trojans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My first twenty returned with wheeled and hand stretchers, and scoured the fields near Loos. By dawn fifty-three wounded soldiers were taken in by the men whom I got to assist me, and I made my way back to the trench with a jar full of water. Wild, vague, and fragmentary thoughts rioted through[172] my mind, and I was conscious of a wonderful exhilaration. I was so pleased with myself that I could dance along the road and sing with pure joy. Whether the mood was brought about by my success in obtaining men or saving wounded I could not determine. Anyhow, I did not attempt to analyse the mood; I was happy and I was alive, with warm blood palpitating joyously through my veins.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I found a full pack lying in the road beside a dead mule which lay between the shafts of a limber. The animal\u0027s ears stuck perkily up like birds on a fence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the pack I found an overcoat, a dozen bars of chocolate, and a piece of sultana cake.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I crossed the field. The darkness hung heavy as yet, and it was difficult to pick one\u0027s way. Now I dropped into a shell-hole and fell flat on my face, and again my feet got entangled in lines of treacherous trip-wire, and I went headlong.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Halt!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I uttered an exclamation of surprise and fear, and stopped short a few inches from the point of a bayonet. Staring into the darkness I discerned the man who had ordered me to halt. One knee was on the ground, and a white hand clutched the rifle barrel. I could hear him breathing heavily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [173]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s wrong with you, man?\" I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Oo are yer?\" inquired the sentry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A London Irish stretcher-bearer,\" I said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why are yer comin\u0027 through our lines?\" asked the sentry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m just going back to the trench,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve been taking a wounded man down to Maroc.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To where?\" asked the man with the bayonet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! it seems as if you don\u0027t know this place,\" I said. \"Are you new to this part of the world?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The man made no answer, he merely shoved his bayonet nearer my breast and whistled softly. As if in reply to this signal, two forms took shape in the darkness and approached the sentry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s wrong?\" asked one of the newcomers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This \u0027ere bloke comes up just now,\" said the sentry, pointing the bayonet at my face. \"\u0027E began to ask me questions and I \u0027ad my suspicions, so I whistled.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s right,\" said one of the newcomers, rubbing a thoughtful hand over the bayonet which he carried; then he turned to me. \"Come along wiv us,\" he said, and, escorted by the two soldiers, I made my way across the field towards a ruined building which was raked at intervals by the German artillery.[174] The field, was peopled with soldiers lying flat on waterproof sheets, and many of the men were asleep. None had been there in the early part of the night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An officer, an elderly man with a white moustache, sat under the shade of the building holding an electric lamp in one hand and writing in a notebook with the other. We came to a halt opposite him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What have you here?\" he asked, looking at one of my captors.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We found this man inquiring what regiment was here and if it had just come,\" said the soldier on my right who, by the stripes on his sleeve, I perceived was a corporal. \"He aroused our suspicions and we took him prisoner.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is your name?\" asked the officer, turning to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I told him. As I spoke a German shell whizzed over our heads and burst about three hundred yards to rear. The escort and the officer went flop to earth and lay there for the space of a second.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t need to duck,\" I said. \"That shell burst half a mile away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that so?\" asked the officer, getting to his feet. \"I thought it——Oh! what\u0027s your name?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I told him my name the second time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s your real name?\" he queried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [175]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I assured him that it was, but my assurance was lost, for a second shell rioted overhead, and the escort and officer went again flop to the cold ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That shell has gone further than the last,\" I said to the prostrate figures. \"The Germans are shelling the road on the right; it\u0027s a pastime of theirs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that so?\" asked the officer, getting to his feet again. Then, hurriedly, \"What\u0027s your regiment?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before I had time to reply, three more prisoners were taken in under escort; I recognised Pryor as one of them. He carried a jar of water in his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who are these?\" asked the officer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They came up to the sentry and asked questions about the regiment,\" said the fresh escort. \"The sentry\u0027s suspicions were aroused and he signalled to us, and we came forward and arrested these three persons.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The officer looked at the prisoners.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What are your names, your regiments?\" he asked. \"Answer quickly. I\u0027ve no time to waste.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"May I answer, sir?\" I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What have you to say?\" inquired the officer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hundreds of men cross this field nightly,\" I said. \"Working-parties, ration-fatigues, stretcher-bearers and innumerable others cross[176] here. They\u0027re going up and down all night. By the way you duck when a shell passes high above you, I judge that you have just come out here. If you spend your time taking prisoners all who break through your line\" (two fresh prisoners were brought in as I spoke) \"you\u0027ll be busy asking English soldiers questions till dawn. I hope I don\u0027t offend you in telling you this.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The officer was deep in thought for a moment; then he said to me, \"Thanks very much, you can return to your battalion.\" I walked away. As I went off I heard the officer speak to the escorts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027d better release these men,\" he said. \"I find this field is a sort of public thoroughfare.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A brigade was camped in the field, I discovered. The next regiment I encountered took me prisoner also; but a few shells dropped near at hand and took up the attention of my captor for a moment. This was an opportunity not to be missed; I simply walked away from bondage and sought the refuge of my own trench.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank goodness,\" I said, as I slid over the parapet. \"I\u0027ll have a few hours\u0027 sleep now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there was no rest for me. A few of our men, weary of the monotony of the dug-out, had crept up to the German trench,[177] where they amused themselves by flinging bombs on the enemy. As if they had not had enough fighting!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On my return they were coming back in certain stages of demolition. One with a bullet in his foot, another with a shell-splinter in his cheek, and a third without a thumb.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These had to be dressed and taken into Maroc before dawn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A stretcher-bearer at the front has little of the excitement of war, and weary hours of dull work come his way when the excitement is over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1819/52822.html","bookId":1038,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:35:04 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:35:04 AM"}
