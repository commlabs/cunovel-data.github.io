Just how long had the woman been toiling in the kitchen without thanks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully bristled. “Wait a minute. My food’s not that bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura gave a gusty sigh. “We love your cooking, Sully. You know what I mean. Sometimes a teenage girl wants soup and a salad instead of cheesy chili fries.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can cook.” Sorrow stood tall, and Billy felt a spurt of pride. “People like my cooking, Dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear scowled. “So everyone tells me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who else has told you?” she asked, sounding genuinely curious. The girl was too modest for her own good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Him, for one.” Bear pointed his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly gaped. “What?” The attention flustered him, and he was at an utter loss for words. “I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorrow got the cutest perplexed smile on her face. “You told my dad I could cook?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way she’d asked tugged at something in his chest. He tried to formulate something cool and collected to say, but Sorrow’s father didn’t give him a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear turned on her. “Girl, I don’t know what you fed our sheriff, but he’s been crowing about…I don’t know…bread or something. All that time in the city, maybe he forgot how to eat meat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly laughed. “I love meat. For the record.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully added, “Sorrow does do a fine brisket, sir. Her secret is to add Coca-Cola, if you can believe that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, fine.” Her father waved impatiently. “Sorrow can cook. One night a week. Tuesdays, how about. We’ll call it Ladies’ Night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ladies’ Night?” She rolled her eyes. “Should I feel insulted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly couldn’t help it—he couldn’t keep his hands to himself anymore. “Hey.” He squeezed her shoulders, telling her in a quiet voice, “This is a good thing. He’s saying you can cook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You start tonight.” Bear walked to the window and shoved aside the lace curtain. “And you better get a move on. Jack Jessup’s truck just pulled into the lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene stole a peek into the kitchen and knew a surprising wash of relief to see Sully. She didn’t know why she was being so silly. After all, the man was always there. It was only that she wanted him to talk to her grandson, Craig, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a brief second, she wondered what it was Sully did when he left the tavern, driving away on that noisy motorcycle of his. Where did he go? Was there a woman waiting for him at home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow was it she could know positively nothing about a man she’d seen and said hello to for over two decades now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was some to-do in the kitchen, and she dallied, remaining standing to spy as she touched up her hair. She pulled off her scarf and cupped a hand along the bottom of her do, making sure her bob was still curling under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like the Baileys were having some sort of appliance trouble. Bear had his usual crotchety face on, though for once his girls weren’t at each other’s throats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door that led between kitchen and dining room swung open, and she hopped aside, letting out a little “Oh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura stopped short before running into her. The girl put a startled hand at her chest and did a quick side step. “Sorry, Marlene. Gotta run get some ingredients from the house kitchen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door flapped shut, and as the girl ran off, Marlene stole a glimpse through it. Sorrow and their new sheriff were exchanging words. Quiet words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit back a smile, pleased that she’d insisted her family dine at the tavern tonight. If there was something afoot, she’d not miss a second of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the table to join her son Jack and his family. Her daughter-in-law, Tina, was wearing that sourpuss face she always had on—she’d wanted to go somewhere else for dinner, naturally. If Marlene said tomato, Tina would say tomahto. They never seemed to see eye to eye on anything. Especially money. Tina had a taste for the fancy restaurants in Silver City, and though Marlene’s boys Jack and Eddie made a good living running Jessup Brothers Construction, Tina clearly had yet to understand that money didn’t grow on trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stood to scoot her chair in, and she gave her son a warm smile. “Thank you, dear.” Her ex-husband might be a son of a bitch, but they sure had raised themselves some lovely gentlemen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go grab us some menus,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No need for that,” Bear said as he burst into the dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully was on his heels. “Freezer’s down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene made herself not look at the cook, focusing instead on unfurling and smoothing her napkin in her lap. She’d raised four gentlemen, and she, too, would be genteel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stopped, midstride, a handful of menus in his hand. “Want me to take a look?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No need,” Bear said. “They’re both down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene finally looked at Sully, and his eyes were already on her, riveted, like he might be able to see straight through her. She cleared her throat. “So, you’re not cooking then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorrow’s trying her hand at it tonight,” Sully said, and his expression softened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gave Marlene pause. What else made his expression warm like that? Was there a woman in his life who got to see that face? She felt a twinge, like loss, and brushed it off as foolish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorrow’s cooking?” asked Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina added under her breath, “And pigs must be flying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene shot her daughter-in-law a look. The girl could be short on manners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear shrugged. “She’s cooking up some putanleska pasta. You don’t have to eat it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” Marlene exclaimed, delighted. “A puttanesca. That sounds wonderful. Of course we’ll eat it, Bear. Good heavens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt Sully walk over and wished she had a drink to sip on. There wasn’t much more she could do to arrange the napkin in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was she feeling this way? Lord, but the divorce had thrown her. What had happened to her confidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Evening,” Sully told the table. “How are you folks doing? It’s Craig, right? I didn’t recognize you at first. Kid’s growing like a weed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgetting herself for the moment, Marlene looked up at him. When it came to her grandson, she was 100 percent focused. “Yes, this is my grandson, Craig. And I think you already know my son Jack, his wife, Tina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack scrunched his face at her. “Come on, Mom. Of course I know Sully. Join us,” he said, gesturing to the chair next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’d be an honor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene watched, mesmerized, at this different side of him. She’d seen the man for much of her life, but somehow she’d never really noticed him. Something was different tonight. First off, he wasn’t wearing that apron. Instead, he wore a pair of khakis and a snug navy blue polo. Goodness, his eyes were dark blue…deep, almost purple, like lapis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his attention to Craig. “I hear you want to join the service, son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grandson beamed. “Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a notable silence. Tina’s eyes turned to frost, glaring from Marlene, to Sully, to Craig. She told her son, “I thought this discussion was over. My son is doing no such thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed suddenly that Sully was a million miles away, separated from them by a gulf of cold wariness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it a mistake to have asked him to talk to Craig? Had she crossed a line? But she knew…the boy would be eighteen soon, and then he could make his own decisions. He was almost a man now, and pretending otherwise was the worst they could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone needed to say something, and it fell to her. “I thought Tom…you know, Sully…could tell Craig about the service.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was probably making an enemy of Tina, but this wasn’t about her daughter-in-law. Craig was stubborn, and she wanted to make sure he was informed and thoughtful about the very life-changing choices he was facing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t want him to go,” Tina said, shutting her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack’s hand snaked across the table, finding his wife’s. He nodded his agreement. “The boy’s too young, Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell her son was trying, and she appreciated it. But she had the wisdom of her years to tell her, the boy would do what the boy would do. And all they could do was love him and guide him as best they could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doubled her resolve and turned to Sully. “How old were you? When you enlisted, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t enlist. I was a West Point man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were?” Marlene felt her eyes widen. It sounded so…masculine. Like something from a movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully looked amused. “Yes, ma’am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene put a hand on his arm to interrupt. The gesture surprised both of them. “Good God, do not call me ma’am. You make me feel positively elderly.” She felt his arm tense. Hard ropes beneath wiry muscle. Tom Sullivan stayed in shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled her hand back and touched it to her temple. Why did Bear insist on keeping the tavern so warm?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. Marlene.” He gave her one of his rare smiles, and it was like the sun broke out and warmed something in her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was wrong with her? She hadn’t had a hot flash in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully turned his attention back to Craig. “Have you thought about college? It’s a good way to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy slumped back in his chair and scowled at his folks. “Not if there’s no money, I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First thing you’ll learn in the service is not to talk to your parents that way.” Sully’s tone was one Marlene didn’t often hear. It was more than simply strict, it was commanding, and yet he hadn’t needed to raise his voice to get there. It was an officer’s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraig’s eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll sit up like a gentleman, too,” Sully added quietly. “Elbows off the table.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamned if the boy didn’t sit bolt upright and put his hands in his lap. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sierra-falls-sierra-falls-1/page-22.html","bookId":1913,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:27 PM"}
