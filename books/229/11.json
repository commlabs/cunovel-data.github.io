{"id":7060,"no":11,"title":"The Third Tuesday We Talk About Regrets","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe next Tuesday, I arrived with the normal bags of food-pasta with corn, potato salad, apple cobbler--and something else: a Sony tape recorder.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI want to remember what we talk about, I told Morrie. I want to have your voice so I can listen to it . . . later.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"When I\u0027m dead.\" Don\u0027t say that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Mitch, I\u0027m going to die. And sooner, not later.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe regarded the new machine. \"So big,\" he said. I felt intrusive, as reporters often do, and I began to think that a tape machine between two people who were supposedly friends was a foreign object, an artificial ear. With all the people clamoring for his time, perhaps I was trying to take too much away from these Tuesdays.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eListen, I said, picking up the recorder. We don\u0027t have to use this. If it makes you uncomfortable\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped me, wagged a finger, then hooked his glasses off his nose, letting them dangle on the string around his neck. He looked me square in the eye. \"Put it down,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI put it down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch,\" he continued, softly now, \"you don\u0027t understand. I want to tell you about my life. I want to tell you before I can\u0027t tell you anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis voice dropped to a whisper. \"I want someone to hear my story. Will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe sat quietly for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he said, \"is it turned on?\"\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eBut it was also becoming clear to me -through his courage, his humor, his patience, and his openness-that Morrie was looking at life from some very different place than anyone else I knew. A healthier place. A more sensible place. And he was about to die.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf some mystical clarity of thought came when you looked death in the eye, then I knew Morrie wanted to share it. And I wanted to remember it for as long as I could.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eWhen I mentioned this to Morrie, he nodded. \"It\u0027s what everyone worries about, isn\u0027t it? What if today were my last day on earth?\" He studied my face, and perhaps he saw an ambivalence about my own choices. I had this vision of me keeling over at my desk one day, halfway through a story, my editors snatching the copy even as the medics carried my body away.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch?\" Morrie said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and said nothing. But Morrie picked up on my hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch,\" he said, \"the culture doesn\u0027t encourage you to think about such things until you\u0027re about to die. We\u0027re so wrapped up with egotistical things, career, family, having enough money, meeting the mortgage, getting a new car, fixing the radiator when it breaks-we\u0027re involved in trillions of little acts just to keep going. So we don\u0027t get into the habit of standing back and looking at our lives and saying, Is this all? Is this all I want? Is something missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe paused.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You need someone to probe you in that direction. It won\u0027t just happen automatically.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI knew what he was saying. We all need teachers in our lives.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd mine was sitting in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eOn the plane ride home that day, I made a small list on a yellow legal pad, issues and questions that we all grapple with, from happiness to aging to having children to death. Of course, there were a million self-help books on these subjects, and plenty of cable TV shows, and $9oper-hour consultation sessions. America had become a Persian bazaar of self-help.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut there still seemed to be no clear answers. Do you take care of others or take care of your \"inner child\"? Return to traditional values or reject tradition as useless? Seek success or seek simplicity? Just Say No or just Do It? All I knew was this: Morrie, my old professor, wasn\u0027t in the self-help business. He was standing on the tracks, listening to death\u0027s locomotive whistle, and he was very clear about the important things in life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI wanted that clarity. Every confused and tortured soul I knew wanted that clarity.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask me anything,\" Morrie always said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo I wrote this list:\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eThe list was in my bag when I returned to West Newton for the fourth time, a Tuesday in late August when the air-conditioning at the Logan Airport terminal was not working, and people fanned themselves and wiped sweat angrily from their foreheads, and every face I saw looked ready to kill somebody.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eMe? I ask. What would I write about?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What interests you?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe bat it back and forth, until we finally settle on, of all things, sports. I begin a year-long project on how football in America has become ritualistic, almost a religion, an opiate for the masses. I have no idea that this is training for my future career. I only know it gives me another once-a-week session with Morrie.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd, with his help, by spring I have a 112 page thesis, researched, footnoted, documented, and neatly bound in black leather. I show it to Morrie with the pride of a Little Leaguer rounding the bases on his first home run.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations,\" Morrie says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI grin as he leafs through it, and I glance around his office. The shelves of books, the hardwood floor, the throw rug, the couch. I think to myself that I have sat just about everywhere there is to sit in this room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Mitch,\" Morrie muses, adjusting his glasses as he reads, \"with work like this, we may have to get you back here for grad school.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYeah, right, I say.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI snicker, but the idea is momentarily appealing. Part of me is scared of leaving school. Part of me wants to go desperately. Tension of opposites. I watch Morrie as he reads my thesis, and wonder what the big world will be like out there.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/260/2462.html","bookId":229,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:24:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:24:14 AM"}
