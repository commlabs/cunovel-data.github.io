{"id":111943,"no":89,"title":"Page 89","content":"\u003cp\u003eJack found the home of the Thomas Mulliner Excavating and Land Clearing Service at the end of a dark, twisty path in the woods off Carranza Road. His headlights picked up a clearing with a leaning shed, scattered backhoes and earth movers, and the Dodge pickup truck he\u0027d seen earlier. He saw no sign of a house nearby, so he backed the little Pontiac around until the headlights were centered on the pickup, and left them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left his car running and approached the pickup with fingers figuratively crossed. The draped object leaning in the bed was the right size. If only ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the rear bumper as a step, he hopped up into the bed and yanked the tarp free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe broken sigil gleamed in the headlights. He leaned in for another look at the glyphs carved into the black surface. Before leaving Weezy earlier, he\u0027d asked her to draw him a duplicate of the glyphs she\u0027d copied. He pulled it out and checked it again against the originals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA perfect copy. So why wasn\u0027t he satisfied? Why - ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow moved into the edge of the light cone from the headlights and a voice said, \"Hold it right there!\" before Jack could move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did a slow turn and saw a guy standing about ten feet away pointing a shotgun at his midsection. More than a silhouette - he stood far enough off to the side for the lights to reveal some features. Jack recognized Tommy Mulliner, holding what looked like a Mossberg over-under twelve gauge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fuck you think you\u0027re doing here? Get your ass off my truck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just looking,\" Jack said as he sifted through ways to play this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027d seen anyone around, I would\u0027ve asked, but the place was deserted, so - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you. I seen you at the Lodge. You was trespassing there and now you\u0027re trespassing here. Get down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack thought about that. The sigil was too important and he wasn\u0027t through with it. He couldn\u0027t go for his Glock without the Mossberg tearing a hole in him, so ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the following seconds of stunned silence, he turned back to the sigil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Tommy finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027s a simple word. Also known as uh-uh, non, nein, nyet, and that\u0027s a negatory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll blow your fucking head off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, go ahead, Tommy. I\u0027m here only to look, not steal, but you go ahead and do what you think you have to do. By the way, you related to Luke Mulliner, the guy who used to run the canoes at Quaker Lake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause - Tommy probably hadn\u0027t expected a question about his family right after a death threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. My uncle. What about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack knelt beside the sigil and ran his hand over the glyphs. Again that feeling of something not right, but he had to keep Tommy talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knew him when I was a kid living in Johnson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know he had brothers named Matthew, Mark, and John. Their mother was into the Gospels. And you\u0027re Thomas. Another apostle. Doubting Thomas. You still doubting me, Tommy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doubting you\u0027ve got your head on straight. Get off my truck or I shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your family\u0027s related to Joe Mulliner, the Robin Hood of the Pines, right? Would old Joe approve of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his fingers over the glyphs, outlining their shapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old Joe was hung in the seventeen hundreds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it hit Jack like a sucker punch to the gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose and turned toward Tommy. He didn\u0027t want that itchy trigger finger to twitch so he gave him a preview of what he was going to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting off your truck and going to my car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack jumped to the ground and pulled open the passenger door. He found the pen Weezy had given him on the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now I\u0027m going back to the truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you ain\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy made the mistake of stepping in and trying to club Jack with the barrel. He wasn\u0027t experienced in this sort of thing and, before he knew it, the shotgun had changed hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy raised his arms and cringed back as Jack pointed it his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, no! Don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack lowered the weapon, saying, \"Not here to hurt anyone or anything. I need about two minutes with that crazy black thing and then I\u0027ll be on my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the shotgun with him when he climbed back into the truck bed. He took out Weezy\u0027s drawing and laid the sheet over the glyphs, then began rubbing the pen over it. Gradually the writing began to appear. When he was finished he held the sheet up to the light. He leaped to his feet when his worst suspicions were confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit-shit-shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same glyphs but in a different order. An optical illusion. The visible glyphs weren\u0027t the same as the carved glyphs. A different name. Rasalom had hidden his true Other Name. Had all of the Seven done that, so that even if someone outside their circle found their sigils, he still wouldn\u0027t know their Other Names? Over five thousand fake variations remained, after all. Or had Rasalom been the only one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn\u0027t matter. What did was the Lady using the wrong name in the Ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to tell them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the Mossberg\u0027s breech and pulled out the two shells, tossed them over his shoulder, then closed it. He laid it at the foot of the sigil and hopped down to the ground again. Without a word, he jumped into the car and slammed it into reverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the fuck\u0027s going on?\" Tommy shouted as Jack backed around. Jack heard him repeating, \"What the fuck?\" two or three times as he roared down the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWTF, indeed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-89.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
