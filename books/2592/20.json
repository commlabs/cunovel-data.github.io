The Yamaha Y2F-RI. A hundred and fifty-two horsepower. Top speed: a hairsbreadth under a hundred and seventy miles per hour,” I purred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only ten grand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well spent. What happened to the Ducati?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Had to sell it. Jayne thought it was giving Robby bad ideas. And my argument that the kid doesn’t care about anything proved totally useless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like father, like—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Start panting with eagerness and just do the f**king coke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay did a bump and then paused, grimacing. A moment passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the matter?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, this baking powder is cut with way too much laxative.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oops, wrong stuff.” I took the heavily cut junk from Jay, refolded the packet and handed him a proper gram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s your guy, your dealer?” he asked, still grimacing, licking his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, back at the college. Why?” I asked. “And please don’t take a dump in our garage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So your refund for that shit is unlikely?” he asked, opening the fresh packet. “Suck-ah!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That crap’s for wastoids who can’t tell the difference—I just gave you the real stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so cheap,” he muttered. He did two bumps and flung his head back and then smiled slowly and said, “Now, that’s much better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything for a bud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, really, how is married life?” he asked, lighting a Marlboro and easing into coke chat. “The wife, the kids, the posh suburbs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, the tragedy’s complete, huh?” I laughed hollowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, really.” Jay seemed mildly interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marriage is great,” I said, opening my own packet again. “Unlimited sex. Laughs. Oh yeah, and continuous companionship. I think I’ve got this down to a science.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the ubiquitous student in the bathroom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just part of the package here at Casa Ellis.” I did another bump and then bummed a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, seriously—who is she?” he asked, lighting it. “I hear today’s college women are ‘prodigious.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Prodigious? Is that really what you heard?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I read it in a magazine. It was something I wanted to believe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Jayster. Always a dreamer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am so relieved. I knew the whole suburban scene was a great idea for you. By the way,” he said, gesturing at a plastic skeleton hanging from a rafter, “is this how the house normally looks?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Jayne loves it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. “And you’re still sleeping on the couch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a guest bedroom and it’s just a phase—but, wait, how did you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just inhaled on his cigarette, debating whether to tell me something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jay?” I asked. “Why do you think I’m sleeping in the guest bedroom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Helen told me that Jayne said something about you having bad dreams.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved to have an out, I said, “I’m not having any dreams at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay’s expression led me to believe that this was not all he’d been told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, we’re in couples counseling,” I admitted. “It helps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay took this in. “You’re in couples counseling.” He considered this as I nodded. “After three months of marriage? That does not bode well, my friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, earth to Jayster! We’ve known each other for almost twelve years, man. It’s not like we met last July and just decided to elope.” I paused. “And how in the hell did you know I’m sleeping in the guest room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, Bretster, Jayne called up Helen.” He stopped, did another bump. “Just thought I’d warn you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Jesus, why would Jayne call up your wife?” I tried to toss off this question casually but shuddered with coke-induced paranoia instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s worried that you’re using again, and I guess”—Jay made a gesture—“she’s wrong . . . right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haven’t we outgrown all this tired irony? Weren’t we supposed to give up acting twenty-two forever?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you’re wearing a marijuana T-shirt at your own Halloween party, where you just were making out with a coed in the bathroom, so the answer to that, my friend, is a definite nope.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-20.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
