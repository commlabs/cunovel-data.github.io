So he added, \"Literally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat at least elicited a smile from Abel Voss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer had invited the usual crew - Voss, Portero, and Ellis - to his office to discuss the matter. He had his agenda for the meeting posted in a corner of the computer monitor embedded in the ebony expanse of his desk while his custom news service scrolled items tailored to his topics of interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Postmortem ain\u0027t back yet,\" Voss said, \"but the M-E\u0027s on notice to copy us immediately with any and all results.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m told the bodies appear to have been in the river about a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoss nodded. \"All three of them shackled together and weighted down. But the Hudson\u0027s gotta way of returning some of the gifts it gets. Looks like these SLA boys took \u0027em for a ride that very night, shot them in the head, then dumped them before sunup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not before torturing them,\" Ellis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer glanced at his brother. Ellis hadn\u0027t missed a meeting in months now. Maybe his latest anti- depressant cocktail was working. Mercer knew he should be glad about that but he wasn\u0027t. The closer Ellis was to catatonia, the easier he was to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep, I heard that too,\" Voss said. \"Cigarette burns, fingernails tore off.\" He grimaced. \"Ugly stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were globulin farmers, Abel,\" Mercer said, unable to keep the scorn from his tone. \"Somebody improved the gene pool by removing them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get me wrong, son. I ain\u0027t no fan of their sort. Riddin the world of their kind is all fine and good. But torture? Ain\u0027t no call to torture no one, son. No one. I think we\u0027re dealin with some real sick puppies here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which segues very neatly into the reason for our meeting: the \u0027sick puppies\u0027 who call themselves the Sim Liberation Army. It\u0027s been a week since they raided that globulin farm and no one knows any more about them today than they did then. And where are the sims they supposedly wanted to free?\" He turned to his chief of security who had yet to say a word. \"Mr. Portero, if the NYPD is at a loss, surely your people have the resources to pick up the slack, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero shrugged. \"We\u0027re looking into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This needs more than mere looking into, Mr. Portero. We need to track them down. It\u0027s vitally important that SimGen be recognized as the true guardians and protectors of sims, not some group of murderous radicals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero said, \"The longer they go undetected, the lower the odds of finding them. And so far they seem to have pulled off a perfect disappearing act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That they\u0027re probably professionals - well-funded professionals. Which makes me wonder if they might not be connected to that lawyer Patrick Sullivan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why on earth would you think that?\" Ellis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a stretch. A quarter of a million dollars appeared out of the blue to keep his unionization case going just when it was ready to fall apart. And I saw him and the Cadman woman outside the globulin farm the morning after this SLA demolished it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadman? Mercer thought. Didn\u0027t I just see that name? He\u0027d been about to switch the topic to the annual stockholders\u0027 meeting less than two weeks away, but instead he reversed the scroll on his newsclips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the contrary, Portero,\" Ellis said. \"It\u0027squite a stretch. People who try to use the legal system to seek a solution don\u0027t suddenly leap to murder and arson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero\u0027s face remained impassive as he replied. \"Perhaps Sullivan became a bit testy after his clients were put down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllis stared at him. \"You lousy piece of - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentlemen, gentlemen,\" Voss said, shifting his considerable bulk in his seat and raising his hands. \"We\u0027re not the enemy here. The enemy is outthere .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Ellis said. \"Sometimes I wonder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadman...Mercer kept searching his screen. There. Found it. A suit against Manassas. He smiled. He\u0027d long ago embraced his anal-completist nature because it so often paid unexpected dividends. Like now: Years ago, when he\u0027d begun using the service, he\u0027d entered \u0027Manassas Ventures\u0027 as a search string; this was the first hit he\u0027d ever seen. He clicked on the abstract to bring up the full article; he felt a sweat break as he skimmed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to this,\" Mercer said. \"Someone is suing Manassas Ventures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noticed a slight stiffening of Portero\u0027s parade-rest stance. \"Is that so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Manassas is in your people\u0027s bailiwick. Why don\u0027t you know about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have lawyers for legal problems. What\u0027s the suit about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see...no dollar amount given, just \u0027unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean the reason for the suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of things. Here\u0027s just a sample: \u0027physical injury, pain, suffering, mental anguish and trauma, unpleasant mental reactions including fright, horror, worry, disgrace, embarrassment, indignity, ridicule, grief, shame, humiliation, anger, and outrage.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero snorted. \"Probably a stubbed toe. They\u0027ll put a check in front of him and he\u0027ll go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it. It\u0027s not a him. It\u0027s a her named Cadman. Romilda Cadman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero\u0027s smug reptile mask dropped and, just for a second, Mercer caught a flash of uncertainty. Portero...unsettled? The possibility turned his stomach sour, like curdled milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The OPRR inspector lady?\" Voss said. \"The one who funded Sullivan\u0027s sim case? What thehell ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Care to guess what attorney is representing her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have to,\" Voss said. \"Gotta be Sullivan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer noted that Portero\u0027s dumbfounded look had surrendered to tightlipped anger. He glanced at Ellis, expecting some sort of comment, but his brother remained silent, his expression unreadable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Mercer said. \"Patrick Sullivan again. I don\u0027t like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This makes no sense.\" Portero\u0027s voice was even softer than usual. \"What can they possibly hope to gain? Are they that desperate for cash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I doubt money\u0027s got a thing to do with this,\" Voss said. \"It will take them years to get a decision, and even if they win, more years before they ever see a dime. No, instead of thinking about money, we should be asking why the man who harassed SimGen about unionizing sims is now harassing the venture capital company that helped put SimGen in business. I find that real disturbin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question disturbed Mercer as well. \"You\u0027re the lawyer,\" he told Voss. \"Have you got an answer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m bettin he wants to use the discovery procedures of a civil action to dissect Manassas Ventures\u0027 workings - its board of directors, its assets and liabilities, the whole tamale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer\u0027s gnawing sense of malignant forces converging on him had receded after the withdrawal of the sim unionization suit, but now it returned with a gut-roiling vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why Manassas? Beyond owning a bundle of SimGen stock, it has no direct link to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore, but it used to. Obviously he\u0027s sniffed out something and he\u0027s going after it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s just a fishing expedition,\" Mercer said, but he didn\u0027t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be, but why in that particular pond? And let\u0027s face it, Manassas is such a well-stocked pond, he just might hook something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one spoke then. The idea that anyone would want to lift the Manassas Ventures rock and inspect what was crawling around beneath it had never occurred to Mercer. He\u0027d been assured that Manassas was a dead end. But what if wasn\u0027t? What if someone found a trail that led from Manassas to SIRG?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had to be stopped. Now. Before it went any further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Portero. \"Your people can handle this, can\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute, wait a minute,\" Voss said, holding up a hand before Portero could reply. \"Before we start talking about stuff I don\u0027t want to hear, why don\u0027t you just buy her off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePortero stared at him. \"Buy her off? You don\u0027t know this woman. I spent days with her during the OPRR inspection and let me tell you, she is not for sale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoss grinned. \"Sure she is, son. I\u0027ve waded through truckloads of bullshit in my day, but I\u0027ve learned one thing always holds true: Everybody\u0027s got a price tag. Some hide it better\u0027n others, but you look hard enough, you\u0027ll find it. Your folks\u0027ve got pockets deep as a well to China. You have them tell her to name a price, and then you meet it. And that\u0027ll be it. You\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Portero was shaking his head. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s enough money in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer was surprised by something in his tone. It sounded like admiration. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-43.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
