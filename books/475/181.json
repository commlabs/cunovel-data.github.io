It was an old mediaeval message, and it had but one thought--that God was waiting in the depths of my being to talk to me if I would only get still enough to hear His voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI thought this would be a very easy matter, and so began to get still. But I had no sooner commenced than a perfect pandemonium of voices reached my ears, a thousand clamoring notes from without and within, until I could hear nothing but their noise and din.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome were my own voices, my own questions, some my very prayers. Others were suggestions of the tempter and the voices from the world\u0027s turmoil.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn every direction I was pulled and pushed and greeted with noisy acclamations and unspeakable unrest. It seemed necessary for me to listen to some of them and to answer some of them; but God said,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Be still, and know that I am God.\" Then came the conflict of thoughts for tomorrow, and its duties and cares; but God said, \"Be still.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd as I listened, and slowly learned to obey, and shut my ears to every sound, I found after a while that when the other voices ceased, or I ceased to hear them, there was a still small voice in the depths of my being that began to speak with an inexpressible tenderness, power and comfort.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs I listened, it became to me the voice of prayer, the voice of wisdom, the voice of duty, and I did not need to think so hard, or pray so hard, or trust so hard; but that \"still small voice\" of the Holy Spirit in my heart was God\u0027s prayer in my secret soul, was God\u0027s answer to all my questions, was God\u0027s life and strength for soul and body, and became the substance of all knowledge, and all prayer and all blessing: for it was the living GOD Himself as my life, my all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is thus that our spirit drinks in the life of our risen Lord, and we go forth to life\u0027s conflicts and duties like a flower that has drunk in, through the shades of night, the cool and crystal drops of dew. But as dew never falls on a stormy night, so the dews of His grace never come to the restless soul. --A. B.
