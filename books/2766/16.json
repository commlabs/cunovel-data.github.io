I head to the barracks with my hand over George and sneak past Jess. Lifting my makeup case, I pull out my trusty cover-up. But as I pat it on and examine it in my small travel mirror, the cover-up looks like caked-on silly putty. Besides, when I sweat the stuff is going to come right off. So I do the next best thing: I pull out my travel first-aid kit and cover George up with one of those round Band-Aids. \"When George is hidden from the world, I head to the courtyard to wait for Ronit to order us into formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan is outside, his tongue fully recovered from the bee incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell happened to your forehead?\" Nathan asks with a grimace. I swear he says it so loud everyone within a mile can hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I say, hoping against all hope he\u0027ll drop the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got two theories,\" he says. \"Either you cut yourself shaving your monobrow, or you\u0027re covering up a huge zit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up or I\u0027ll make you eat another bee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Nathan,\" Miranda says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess what\u0027s for breakfast,\" Jessica says as she walks up to us. \"Ant-encrusted toast, hard-boiled eggs, and delicious bee-jam.\" Her voice trails off after a glance at my forehead. I\u0027m trying to look the other way, but she grabs my arm. \"Amy, please tell me you didn\u0027t touch it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t touch it,\" I say roughly. I\u0027m not lying. I didn\u0027t touch it, I mutilated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan pretends to cough, but I know he\u0027s laughing. \"She\u0027s got a big zit she\u0027s covering up but is too embarrassed to admit it. Come on, Amy, fess up,\" he says, then reaches over to pull the Band-Aid off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slap his hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How big is it?\" Miranda asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you to leave it alone,\" Jess scolds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay everyone!\" I yell, then pull the Band-Aid off and point to my forehead. \"Everyone, meet George.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan pretends to gag. \"That looks so nasty, Amy. \"What the hell did you do to it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You named your zit?\" Miranda asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured since George and I are going to be together for a while, he might as well have a name,\" I tell her, ignoring Nathan. Jess is still staring at my forehead as if she\u0027s not quite sure how I managed to turn tiny George into big, red, angry George.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan is laughing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it look really bad?\" I ask my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan gives me a resounding \"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda shrugs and nods at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess says, \"They might make you go to the infirmary for fear it\u0027s something contagious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slap my hand over my forehead and run back to the barracks. Unfortunately, Tori is still in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re supposed to be outside in less than a minute,\" Tori says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So leave.\" I pull out my mirror and look up at Tori. \"Do you mind? I need some privacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story that has to do with a big zit I named George.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI examine George in the mirror. Unfortunately, Tori sees him too. Her lips curl up in disgust. \"Eww.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. You want to call me a spaz again because I have a zit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But you better go out there before you get in trouble for being late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge looks nastier than before. \"What am I gonna do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTori shrugs. \"Put on a hat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even know where mine is. Besides, George might get infected from rubbing against the material.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could cut you some bangs, if you want,\" Tori says. \"My mom\u0027s a hairdresser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really. Your face structure would actually look good with bangs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d really cut me bangs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything to get you to stop looking at yourself in the mirror.\" She pulls out scissors from her duffle and slides my hair through her fingers. \"Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe has no clue how hard that is for me, but Rabbi Glassman says that sometimes it helps to make people feel needed. \"I trust you,\" I tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for sharing your story about your parents when we had kitchen duty,\" she says as she snips away. \"I see you with all the stuff you have, and I think you have the perfect life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my parents\u0027 way of making up for their shortcomings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There. I\u0027m done.\" She puts the scissors down and holds up the mirror so I can inspect my new do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never really wanted bangs. I was six years old the last time I had bangs, and they feel weird brushing up against my forehead. I have to admit they don\u0027t look half bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, sure enough, everyone is in formation. Tori and I come sauntering out. Sergeant B-S isn\u0027t here, thank goodness. But Avi is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes turn to Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you late?\" he asks us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault, not Tori\u0027s,\" I tell him. \"It was a medical issue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sick?\" he asks, his voice laced with concern that makes my knees weak. He cocks his head and inspects me, looking for a wound or weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a fever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my horror, he picks his hand up and is about to feel my forehead. I jump back, afraid he\u0027ll find George. \"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, my patience is wearing thin. Fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell. \"Its not a fever. Tori was cutting my hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since when is cutting hair a medical issue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi looks up to the sky, probably asking God for the strength to deal with me. I don\u0027t blame him. Truth is, I am aspaz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tori, get back in formation. Amy, give me twenty push-ups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I do girlie ones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t do guy\u0027s ones. I don\u0027t have enough upper arm strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do.\" He points to the ground. \"Stop stalling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretch out on the ground. Thankfully we\u0027re on a paved sidewalk so I don\u0027t have little pebbles sticking into my palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my hands on either side of my shoulders and the tips of my toes on the pavement, I straighten my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up, and stare straight into Avis eyes. He\u0027s squatting right in front of me. For him, pushups are no big deal. For me, on the other hand...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop thinking and just do them,\" he says softly so no one else can hear. \"Pretend your body is a piece of wood and your elbows are hinges.\" He gets in position and demonstrates it for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bend my elbows a tiny bit and straighten them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not a pushup, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go down farther.\" He demonstrates it again, reminding me of when I did them in front of Sergeant B-S my first night here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look into his eyes, which have determination written all over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t ask you to do something you couldn\u0027t do,\" he says. \"Push yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing is, I want to make Avi proud of me. And if he says I can do it, maybe I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bend my elbows again, all the while trying to keep the rest of my body straight. My boobs are almost touching the ground when I straighten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it. Nineteen more,\" Avi says, doing them right along with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do two more, my arms shaking and struggling each time. Going down isn\u0027t the problem; it\u0027s the pushing up part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventeen more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath. My arms are tired. I\u0027m not mad at Avi for punishing me. It\u0027s my own fault for being so vain. I look up, wishing everyone wasn\u0027t watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have faith in you,\" Avi says softly. \"No matter what, I always have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I want to cry, because he probably has more faith in me than I have in myself. As I lower my body again, Avis determination makes me do more pushups. Every time I think I\u0027m going to collapse, I look up into his beautiful milk-chocolate eyes for strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat is dripping off my forehead. My shirt is wet from sweat and I probably smell, but I finish my twenty pushups and stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be a great soldier if you didn\u0027t complain all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"And you\u0027d be a great boyfriend if you didn\u0027t kiss other girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning should be saved for times when you\u0027re being chased\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we sit through another classroom session on rifle safety and have dinner, we\u0027re informed that we\u0027ll be going on a night run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like aTaco Bell run?\" I ask. \"Fun.\" Although I\u0027ve never seen aTaco Bell in Israel, I\u0027ve seen a few McDonald\u0027s. I had a McKebab at one last summer, with cheeps on the side (which is really just French fries).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonit and Liron look at each other in confusion. \"What\u0027s aTaco Bell run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know... a food run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiron laughs. \"We weren\u0027t talking about a food run. We mean night run literally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where you run at night,\" Ronit adds, just in case I don\u0027t get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0027m to be completely honest, the last thing I want to do at nine p.m. is run. In fact, the last thing I ever want to do is run, period. I\u0027d hate running if it was at nine at night or nine in the morning (or three in the afternoon, for that matter).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt nine on the dot, just when the sun has almost left us, we congregate in a big, open area right outside the base. I spot Nathan and pull him aside. \"Nathan, don\u0027t you think Miranda\u0027s awesome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just wondering if you, you know, would ever consider her as more than a friend. You know, like girlfriend material.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She\u0027s too serious. And too nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice is a good trait, Nathan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, in a friend. I like Miranda as a friend. Get it? I need a raunchy and inappropriate girl... you know, someone I consider a challenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got it.\" Tori\u0027s the one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan shrugs. \"Truth is, I know Miranda\u0027s had a crush on me for months. I tried thinking of her that way, but it didn\u0027t work. The yin/yang thing just isn\u0027t there. I feel bad about it, if that makes you feel any better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, knowing that pairing my two friends isn\u0027t going to work. \"Well, as long as you feel bad about it, I guess you\u0027re off the hook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you wearing on your head?\" Sergeant B-S asks me, cutting my conversation with Nathan short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach up and feel the hot-pink headlight my mom bought me for the trip. At the time I thought it was lame to wear a flashlight strapped to your forehead, but when I got ready for the night run that has nothing to do with food or Taco Bell, I put it on. \"A flashlight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you to put it on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody. I thought of it all by myself. It\u0027ll help me see where I\u0027m going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant B-S takes the flashlight off my head. \"A flashlight in a real military operation would give away your location.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a real military operation,\" I say, stating the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re simulating one. No flashlights. Use the moon as your light.\" He hands my flashlight back to me and faces the rest of the unit. \"In a real operation, troops move at night. Since there are only a few hours of darkness, you have to move fast so the enemy is taken by surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour guys are chosen to carry a stretcher while they run, with four more guys as backup stretcher-holders. Nathan is one of the backups. Two other guys are assigned to carry what they call \"jerry cans,\" which are water-filled jugs, on their backs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-16.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
