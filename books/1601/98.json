They would kill those closest to them, lashing out first at people they should have loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol knew that madness. He knew it was inside of him, too. That is a mistake, Taim, he thought. You use our own friends against us, but we know them better than you do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvin struck at Abors. It came in a burst of the One Power. A second later, Androl’s shield dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol embraced the Source. He was not very strong, but he had enough Power to burn away a few ropes. He rolled free of his bindings, hands bloodied, and took stock of the room. He hadn’t been able to see it before, not entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was bigger than he’d assumed, the size of a small throne room. A wide circular dais dominated the far end, topped by a double ring of Myrddraal and women. He shivered as he saw the Fades. Light, but that eyeless gaze was awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaim’s exhausted men stood by the far wall, the Asha’man who had failed to Turn Logain. He sat on the dais, slouching and tied to a chair in the center of the double ring. Like a throne. Logain’s head rolled to the side, his eyes closed. He appeared to be whispering something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaim had spun, furious, toward Evin, who fought with Mishraile beside Abors’ smoking corpse. Evin and Mishraile each held the One Power, wrestling on the floor, a knife in Evin’s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol scrambled toward Emarin, then nearly fell on his face as his legs gave out. Light! He was weak, but he did manage to burn away Emarin’s bonds, then Pevara’s. She shook her head, trying to clear it. Emarin nodded in gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you weave?\" Androl whispered. Taim’s attention was on Evin’s fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmarin shook his head. \"The drink they gave us . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol clung to the One Power. Shadows began to lengthen around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! he thought. No, not now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gateway. He needed a gateway! Androl sucked in the One Power, forming the weave for Traveling. And yet, as before, he hit some kind of barrier—like a wall, preventing him from opening the gateway. Frustrated, he tried to make one to a closer destination. Perhaps distance mattered. Could he make a gateway to Canler’s store above them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled against that wall, fighting with everything he had. He strained, inching closer; he could almost do it . . . He felt as if something was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please\", he whispered. \"Please, open. We need to get out of here . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvin fell to Taim’s weave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" Taim bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t know\", Mishraile said. \"Evin attacked us! He had been talking to the pageboy, and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth spun toward Androl. Androl stopped trying to make the gateway, instead flinging a weave of fire in desperation toward Taim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaim smiled. By the time Androl’s tongue of fire reached him, it vanished into a weave of Air and Water that dissipated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a persistent one\", Taim said, slamming Androl against the wall with a weave of Air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol gasped in pain. Emarin stumbled dizzily to his feet, but a second weave of Air knocked him down. Dazed, Androl felt himself hoisted up and pulled across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ugly woman wearing black stepped out of the circle of Aes Sedai and walked up beside Taim. \"So, M’Hael\", she said. \"You are not nearly as in control of this place as you indicated\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have inferior tools\", Taim said. \"I should have been given more women earlier!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ran your Asha’man to exhaustion\", the woman replied. \"You squandered their strength. I will take charge here\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaim stood on the dais, beside Logain’s slumped form, the women and the Fades. He seemed to consider this woman, perhaps one of the Forsaken, a greater threat than anyone else in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that will work, do you?\" Taim asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the Nae’blis hears of how you are bungling—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Nae’blis? I care not for Moridin. I have already provided a gift to the Great Lord himself. Beware, I am in his favor. I hold the keys in my hands, Hessalam\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean . . . you actually did it? You stole them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaim smiled. He turned back to Androl, who hung in the air, struggling without success. He wasn’t shielded. He flung another weave at Taim, but the man blocked it indifferently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol wasn’t even worth shielding. Taim dropped him from the weaves of Air. Androl hit the ground hard. He grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you trained here, Androl?\" Taim asked. \"You shame me. That is the best you can do when trying to kill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol struggled to his knees. He felt pain and worry from Pevara behind, her mind clouded with forkroot. In front of him, Logain sat on his throne, locked in place, surrounded by the enemy. The man’s eyes were closed; he was barely conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are done here\", Taim said. \"Mishraile, kill these captives. We will take those above and carry them to Shayol Ghul. The Great Lord has promised me more resources for my work there\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaim’s lackeys approached. Androl looked up from his knees. The darkness grew all around, shapes moving in the shadows. The darkness . . . it terrified him. He had to let go of saidin, he had to. And yet, he could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to begin weaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaim glanced at him, then smiled and wove balefire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadows, all around!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol clung to the Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead, they come for me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wove by instinct, the best weave he knew. A gateway. He hit that wall, that blasted wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo tired. Shadows . . . Shadows will take me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA white-hot bar of light sprang from Taim’s fingers, pointed right at Androl. Androl shouted, straining, thrusting his hands forward and snapping his weave into place. He hit that wall and heaved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gateway the width of a coin opened in front of him. He caught the stream of balefire in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaim frowned, and the room grew still, stunned Asha’man pausing their weaves. At that moment, the door to the room exploded inward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCanler, holding the One Power, roared in. He was followed by the twenty or so Two Rivers boys who had come to train in the Black Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaim yelled, embracing the Source. \"We are attacked!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dome seemed to be centered on the building project he’d noted. That was bad; with those foundations and pits, Slayer would have plenty of places to hide and ambush him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they reached the village, Perrin pointed to a particularly large building. Two stories, built like an inn, with a solid wooden roof. \"I’m going to take you up there\", Perrin whispered. \"Ready your bow. Yell if you spot anyone trying to sneak u \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-98.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
