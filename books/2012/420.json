I will be fighting the power of their will. I will be preventing it from reaching my soldiers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But you gave up your damned sword, woman!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are residual effects to bearing such a weapon, Fist. In any case, none of that is your concern.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Except when you fail. When you fall.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Even then, Fist.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed on her. ‘That only works if you take them down with you. Is that the plan, Adjunct? One final sacrifice to defend an army that doesn’t even like you? That doesn’t want to be here? That doesn’t even know what it’s supposed to be fighting for? And then you expect me and the other Fists to hold them together? With you dead and gone?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked her head. ‘You are contradicting yourself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved a dismissive hand, the gesture chopping the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavore seemed to flinch slightly at that, but the tone of her next words belied the impression. ‘Maintain your line with the flanks, Fist.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re going to get cut to pieces.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning away, she reached for her leather gloves. ‘If so, Fist, just make sure you take a long time dying.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left without bothering to salute, walked with his helm dangling from one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree foiled attempts on my life? A corrupted Claw?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen who did the foiling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanaschar stood twenty paces away from her tent, motionless while figures moved in measured haste around him, wanting to be a heavy stone in the stream, a place to set a foot and find an instant or two of rest. But his was a lifeless island, until Lostara Yil found him, taking his arm in hers and pulling him round – Henar Vygulf grinning off to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What is this?’ Banaschar demanded, only vaguely resisting as she led him away – he’d just seen Blistig exit Tavore’s tent, his stride echoing that of a lifeless T’lan Imass, and he’d been considering going to the Adjunct again, to see what he could glean of what had taken place between her and the Fist. Instead, he was being pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there, ahead, stood a small group of officers. Skanarow. Ruthan Gudd, Raband and Faradan Sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanaschar sought to disengage his arm. ‘You keep forgetting, I’m not actually in this army.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Our last palaver,’ said Lostara. ‘Make it mocking, make it solemn, however you like it, Priest. But it will happen, and you will be in attendance.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d reached the others, and Banaschar saw the expectation in their faces and wanted to hide under a shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthan Gudd, fingers combing his beard, was the first to speak. ‘Priest. We’ve all been given our orders. Will you be at the Adjunct’s side through all of this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of what? The dying? ‘I don’t know. I doubt it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why?’ asked Faradan Sort, the word sharp, accusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. ‘I expect she will be fighting. Eventually.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara Yil cleared her throat in the silence that followed, and then said, ‘She has ordered me, Henar and Ruthan Gudd to attend to her at all times.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That makes sense,’ Banaschar said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s the Forkrul Assail, isn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Lostara’s question Banaschar simply shrugged again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She has surrendered her sword, somewhere,’ said Faradan Sort. ‘How does she expect to defend herself against the sorcery of the Assail?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaband voiced a raw curse and looked ready to leave, but Skanarow shook her head at him and he subsided, scowling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara caught Banaschar’s eye – he could see fear in hers. ‘Priest, I do not think I will again Shadow Dance. Not the way I did before. If she is expecting such a thing from me – perhaps against the Forkrul Assail—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Captain, I don’t know what she is expecting,’ said Banaschar quietly. ‘You and Ruthan Gudd, you have both shown exceptional abilities. Is that why she wants you close? I imagine that it is, and at the moment of greatest need, will she look to you two? Why wouldn’t she?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I can’t do it again!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanaschar glanced over at Ruthan Gudd. ‘And what of you, Captain? Besieged by the same uncertainties, are you? Or will the gift of the Stormriders reawaken to protect you?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-420.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
