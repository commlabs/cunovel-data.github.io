Lin Ming had obviously used the Concept of Wind a moment ago. Not only that, but he was able to faintly feel that Lin Ming’s Concept of Wind boundary was even higher than his own! It was as if he had touched upon the origin of all wind!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHow was this possible?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere was complete silence in the entire area for several breaths of time.

In the entire Seven Profound Valleys’ younger generation, the number of people that could understand a Concept could be counted on a single hand, and they had all did so in their later years when they had reached 19 or 20 years of age.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut as for Lin Ming, he was a mere 16 years old, and he also came from the pitiful background of the 36 countries.

You just said that we 36 countries’ disciples couldn’t comprehend the Concept of Wind, and look at that! Now what, huh!?” All of the 36 countries’ disciples that heard the bragging of the Sword Faction disciple suddenly felt extremely proud and glorious. Before, they had been talked down to like little country bumpkins who had wandered into a bustling major city, and their hearts had already lit with a simmering fire. Before, they didn’t know what a Concept of Wind was, nor that Lin Ming had also managed to understand it, so they could only shut up as others boasted around them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow, they could finally come back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha, a little pitiful Concept of Wind, even if the Seven Profound Valleys doesn’t have over 5 people that can comprehend it, it’s not anything to someone as cool and awesome as Lin Ming.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Maybe Lin Ming hadn’t even understood the Concept of Wind, but comprehended it after watching Jiang Lanjian display it.

In their minds, the Concept of Wind sounded very powerful, but to the omnipotent Lin Ming, it should be enough just tossing it a few thoughts, it was just absolutely nothing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHearing this idea spread through the crowd, the Seven Profound Valleys’ Sword Faction disciple could only force a smile, he was disinclined to argue with them.

Unfortunately, Lanjian’s Concept of Wind was his final trump card, but it’s too bad he’s only showing off his meager skill in front of a true expert.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShi Zongtian was silent. Jiang Lanjian was already considered a talent among talents, and the Concept of Wind was sufficiently powerful to be called one’s secret card.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat a pity it was that Jiang Lanjian’s match was against Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Mu Qinghong looked at the amazing expressions on these old elders’ faces, the smile that crossed hers was growing more and more. She felt that Lin Ming was simply an endless trove of treasure, he always brought new and wonderful surprises.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSomething like the Purple Flood Dragon Divine Thunder could be said to be obtained by luck or fortune. Individual cultivation could be enhanced by valuable materials or other rare medicines and treasure. But as for Lin Ming’s comprehension of the Concept of Wind, spear skills, and martial intent, all of those depended on his own heart of martial arts and monstrous perception. There was no fortuitous encounter that could ever help him with that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSpear path, Concept, martial intent, soul force; Lin Ming had made startling progress\u0026nbsp;in all four of these major aspects. Not only that, but his cultivation could also be considered at the pinnacle of his age, and he also had a high thunder origin energy\u0026nbsp;fusion compatibility. With his mere Bone Forging cultivation, he had managed to absorb the Purple Flood Dragon Divine Thunder, and his body seemed to contain the bloodline of some ancient beast.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s existence had already exceeded the limits of common sense.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Qinghong secretly thought, “Even Qianyu hadn’t completely understood Lin Ming, he is even more wonderful than she had imagined! My Divine Phoenix Island will never let go of a talent like this.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the martial stage, Jiang Lanjian heaved a heavy sigh. “Lin Ming, I, Jiang Lanjian have never witnessed someone of your talent in my life. I might have already lost this match, but until the final moment, I will not put down my sword!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJiang Lanjian brought his sword in front of him, directed straight at Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Good, I also want to enjoy a satisfying battle with you.” Lin Ming brightly laughed and then smiled at Jiang Lanjian. Jiang Lanjian’s words were just what he had hoped for, he also wanted to continue dueling with Jiang Lanjian and attain more inspirations about the Concept of Wind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Graceful Sword!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJiang Lanjian thrust his sword out again, and a strong wind howled around him. Lin Ming’s spear had also fused into the wind, and under the blessing of the Concept of Wind, his spear speed had reached a terrifying degree. One could listen to the sharp cries as the long spear broke through the wind; it seemed as if spear shadows covered the sky!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf there was a weakness in Lin Ming’s spearmanship, that would be that his attack speed was too slow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut in truth, this really could not be considered a shortcoming. A spear was originally a heavy weapon meant to be used against armies. It emphasized oppressing and overwhelming all opposition by brute strength; it was simply impossible for it to display such an extreme speed like a sword.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTherefore, when Lin Ming had been facing Jiang Lanjian’s sword light that seemed everywhere, he was only able to rely on his vibrating true essence to fend it off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, with the Concept of Wind behind his back, his spear wasn’t actually much slower than Jiang Lanjian’s sword!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDing ding ding ding ding ding ding ding!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a few breathes of time, it was unknown how many times Lin Ming and Jiang Lanjian’s spear and sword had exchanged blows.

They had thought that Lin Ming’s comprehension of the Concept of Wind was at a very high state, but they realized that even they had \u0026nbsp;underestimated him. As this match progressed, Lin Ming was becoming increasingly deft with the Concept of Wind; it was already far beyond anything Jiang Lanjian could hope to compare with.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I can’t imagine how he managed to contemplate this!” The Sword Faction’s Great Elder sighed with emotion. To have a 1200 jin Heavy Profound Soft Spear keep up with the speed of a longsword, Lin Ming’s comprehension of the Concept of Wind was simply inconceivable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I feel like… as Lin Ming continues to progress in this match, it seems that Lin Ming is imitating Lanjian’s moves!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs an elder casually spoke his thoughts, all of them became startled!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJiang Lanjian’s Graceful Sword was able to hide the sword blade in the wind.

He must have comprehended it a long time ago, but didn’t have a master to teach him. He was only able to rely on his heaven defying perception to comprehend the Concept of Wind, but didn’t understand just how to use it to attack. Now, he’s found inspiration in Lanjian’s sword, and his self-taught Concept of Wind has already surpassed Lanjian by many degrees.

But, because the Flame Essence was much weaker and thus imbalanced, Thunderfire Annihilation wouldn’t be much stronger than the Purple Flood Dragon Divine Thunder. Not only that, but the consumption of energy was tremendous and it took a long period of time to wind up. The Purple Flood Dragon Divine Thunder was currently a much more practical move.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘It looks like I underestimated the Seven Profound Valleys’ direct disciples.
