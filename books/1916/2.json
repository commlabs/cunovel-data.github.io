{"id":88658,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eRush\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a rule about this, bro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup,\" I say, staring at the top of Vincent\u0027s head, which is now sporting a green-tipped mohawk. The guy is worse than a chick when it comes to style and color up top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I think you\u0027re the knucklehead who came up with it,\" he continues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentally shrug. \"Could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent pulls back on the iron and flips his peepers up to meet mine. I notice he\u0027s added a second piercing to his eyebrow. \"So, what gives, man? And don\u0027t tell me it\u0027s the loooovvvve that\u0027s brought your ass to my chair-because I\u0027ve seen you turn away rock royalty when they wanted the name of some chick inked onto their skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscussing my private shit with anyone makes my balls shrink, so I point at my hand, aka V\u0027s work in progress. \"Can you finish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t get it, bro,\" he continues like the deaf numbnuts he is. \"Breaking the rules for a hot piece of ass has never been your-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyebrows jack up and I send him a look. \"Hey. Watch yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t talk like that. You know, not if you want to keep your blood inside your body and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, bro. So hostile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Addison\u0027s my girl, dickhead,\" I growl. \"Not a hot piece of ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dunno, man.\" Vincent starts back in on me, moving up my thumb with his signature shade of black. \"Addison has a pretty hot ass. I mean, I\u0027ve never seen it without denim or anything, but I can imagine-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear to motherfucking god-\" I start between teeth so tightly clenched my jaw protests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent chuckles. \"Don\u0027t move. Or this \u0027I\u0027 is going to be busted. Damn, she has a long name. Good thing you got the room. Big hands.\" His mouth curls into a Hollywood grin. \"Addison likes that, I bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe urge to send the heel of my boot into his junk is crazy strong. But you know, I don\u0027t want to bleed out from the needle he\u0027s using on me. Not when I\u0027m going to see my baby tomorrow. \"I think I need to fire your ass when we\u0027re done here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That what you think?\" He laughs. \"Shit, Merrick. You know you need me. Besides my obvious skills with an iron, I\u0027m the only testosterone you got around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s my turn to laugh. \"Get serious, man. Janie\u0027s got more T than the both of us combined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunts. \"Heh, heh. True that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust sitting in the guy\u0027s dungeon-inspired room, watching him do his thing, that motherfucking perfect line work, I close up shop on the banter that just ends in me wanting to knock him into Sunday, and go silent for awhile. Which I guess opens me up to thoughts I\u0027ve been trying to tamp down lately. Like maybe why it is I\u0027ve broken my rule. The rule that states crystal fucking clear: No Names Inked Onto Skin. I mean, shit...it\u0027s like the kiss of death. Total jinx. An omen. A relationship killer. In my biz, I\u0027ve seen it a hundred times. So what am I doing? Testing? Teasing? Seeing how strong we got it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe...fuck me...maybe I want her to know how deep it runs for her, you know? Like she\u0027s in my goddamn blood. She\u0027s mine. Maybe I want her to see it tomorrow and say to me, Baby, put your name on my body, too. Somewhere real visible. Because I want every guy who takes a look and thinks he\u0027s got a chance with me to think again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, idiot,\" Vincent says, setting his iron down and mopping me up. \"You\u0027re done. She\u0027s on you forever. So basically you got a week or two before this thing crashes and burns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dick.\" I look down at my thumb. Her name scripted in black. My eyes follow the lines, from A to N, and my dick goes hard. I close my eyes and breathe deep. The tent popping isn\u0027t something I want V to witness. Dude has zero filter, and I\u0027m kinda itching to knock him in the back of the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your girl coming this weekend?\" Vincent asks me, spreading some goop over Addison\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing? Fuck yeah she is. Over and over until she\u0027s hoarse, and my neighbors a mile away call to complain. But I know that ain\u0027t what V means, so I just nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bringing her to the shop?\" he asks as he wraps up my thumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Course.\" I\u0027m bringing her everywhere with me. Stuck to my side and my front and my mouth like super glue. It\u0027s been ten days since I\u0027ve touched her. And guess what? I know how many hours and minutes it\u0027s been too-I\u0027m just not that big of a douche to acknowledge it out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\" V asks, ripping off his gloves and pushing back toward the trash can in his roller chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friday night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not tomorrow night.\" My whole body gets kind of hot and bothered. Tomorrow night is my night to ask her the big question. Tomorrow night\u0027s the night I tell her she\u0027s gonna move in with me after grad. That she\u0027s gonna move to Vegas permanently, and let me take care of her because, fuck, I can\u0027t keep waking up without her. And I sure as hell can\u0027t keep imagining her back in Cali, looking all sweet and sexy, getting hit on by a bunch of beach ballers-especially those vanilla beach ballers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Saturday?\" Vincent continues. \"She coming in Saturday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, what the fuck is this about?\" I stand up and give him a quick sneer. \"You crushing on my girl or is this about that Lisa chick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eV goes kinda red, which makes me snicker a little in spite of my irritation with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns away, shrugs. \"Don\u0027t know anyone named Lisa, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. \"You ever gonna tell me what happened there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know what you\u0027re yammering about, brother, and don\u0027t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFine. I don\u0027t need to know. As long as it doesn\u0027t involve Addison, I don\u0027t give a shit what or who V does. \"Then why do you keep pressing me about bringing my girl into the shop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent turns back, the red face thing gone. He\u0027s got one of those shit-eating grins the ladies seem to like, but I don\u0027t get it. \"I just want to witness the meet and greet, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Riddler, I\u0027m so glad you didn\u0027t ink my fuck off finger.\" I flip him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forgot, didn\u0027t you?\" When I stare blankly at him, he chuckles. \"Oh, you stupid bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flip him off again and head for the door. \"Thanks for the ink, asswipe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our guest, Rush,\" he calls after me. \"Or technically, your guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA foot from the door, I slow up. My brows slam together and I glance over my shoulder. Vincent is leaning back in his chair, hands behind his head, showing off his most prized possession, his Banksy t-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wicked Ink welcomes Erica Day this weekend,\" he says. \"That ring a bell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cock twitches and not because it\u0027s excited. How the hell hadn\u0027t I remembered this? \"Fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent flashes me the pearlies, his black eyes going all wicked jackass-ness. \"The old girlfriend gets to meet the new girlfriend. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-2/page-2.html","bookId":1916,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:23 PM"}
