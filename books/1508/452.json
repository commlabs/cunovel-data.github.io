If a peak Houtian martial artist could safely make his way through the swirling vortex of energy, then they would naturally have an easier time in doing so.

Even if he was able to resist this terrifying suction, he feared that he wouldn’t be able to escape. Not just that, but there were changes in the energy vortex that were occurring; it was impossible to know what would happen next. Thinking this, Lin Ming grit his teeth, pushed his true essence to the limit and flew towards the swirling vortex of energy…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHundreds of miles away, at the point between Blood Demon Island and Dark Moon Island, 10 black-robed people were suspended high in the air.

Despite the surging waves that were swallowed by the vortex, there wasn’t any noise. But this strange feeling was instead much more profoundly terrifying, and the reason was that this swirling vortex swallowed all, even the sound of the sea…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithout a doubt, the tearing strength of this pitch black vortex was several times more horrifying than the one at South Aurora Island!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What a terrifying space storm! If we go down we’ll die!” A black-robed Elder said, frowning.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA moment ago, those 10 late Xiantian large fellows that had opened the seals, because they were too near to the entrance when it had opened, were torn apart by the vortex of energy. They had been pulled into the space storm and ripped into a bloody fog before completely decomposing into fine dust; there wasn’t even any residue left over.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“We’ve made an error in judgement!

If we enter, we will encounter layers upon layers of dangers. \u0026nbsp;This world can collapse at any moment. If we are inside when it does, we will be annihilated along with the world!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter a world collapsed, the space storm it produced in the void would be extremely terrifying; even an Emperor powerhouse wouldn’t necessarily be able to resist it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMoreover, as they looked at the situation of this entrance, they realized they couldn’t enter.

We don’t even have the ability to access the inside. Our South Sea Demon Region’s plans have come to nothing!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAccording to this letter of the Demon Emperor, the small world contained in this ancient battlefield had many different Laws. If a martial artist could practice within, they could be exposed to origins of all sorts of energies. If one had excellent perception, they might even be able to comprehend these origin Laws!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf the South Sea Demon Region could have moved into this ancient battlefield world and then blocked the entrance with a secret skill written in the Demon Emperor’s letter, the ancient Demon Region would be able to obtain a surpassingly good stronghold. Not just that, but they would obtain the massive amount of treasures that the Demon Emperor had left behind. Once all these treasures were obtained, being able to raise an Emperor level powerhouse would no longer be a fantasy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThus, as long as they had several hundred years, the ancient Demon Region would be able to become a Holy Land! When that time arrived, they would dominate the entire South Horizon Region. They would be able to reproduce the grand majesty and brilliance of the Silent Demon Emperor City from 3000 years ago!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, this plan was nothing but a dream that was popped like a bubble.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“We can’t use this world, but this world still has treasures left over from the Demon Emperor and the ancient battlefield. If we can take some of it, our efforts wouldn’t have been in vain!” The one who spoke was a woman with a veil covering her face and who wore a long black robe. Although she covered her face, she couldn’t cover up her impressively buxom figure; she was the Demon Region’s Western Faction Sovereign.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“We cannot go through the main entrance. Even this old man’s third stage Life Destruction won’t be able to pass this terrifying space storm. If we want to enter… we can only go through other entrances.” As the man spoke, he glanced around. At the edges of this main vortex, there were also 36 small vortices; the vortex that had appeared at South Aurora Island was one of these.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That’s useless. Those are just broken spaces that are separated from the main world. If we go into one, we still won’t be able to enter the main world unless we can shatter the barriers of space!” The Demon Region Sovereign vacantly said. When a world first began to collapse, it would split into fragments first. These 36 smaller vortexes all corresponded with a splinter of the main world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf they entered into small worlds, they would at most be able to obtain some treasures left behind on the ancient battlefield. Although these might be high quality treasures, they didn’t hold much appeal to the South Sea Demon Region Elders. What they longed for were the treasures within the Demon Emperor Palace!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, wasting their time to go treasure hunting in a small splintered world was ridiculous.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The situation is worsening. If this continues, we’ll be discovered soon; even Supreme Elders from the South Horizon Region and Five Element Region might show up. If Life Destruction masters or Emperor level powerhouses show up, there won’t be anything left for us.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter hearing these words, all the Elders fell silent. They had thought they would be able to open the seal and obtain an independent world. Then they could follow the techniques written on the Demon Emperor’s letter and open and close the entrance of the world as they pleased, obtaining all the treasures within.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWho knew that the situation would turn out like this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeveral hundred miles away, at South Aurora Island’s gray vortex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming smashed into the ground.

He kept his eyes closed and diffused his perception outwards, sensing everywhere around him. First, he had to scout his surroundings.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe was in a vast and desolate land, surrounded by groups of martial artists who had fallen down with him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere were no plants on the ground, and the dirt was a dark red color, as if it had been stained by blood. There were countless crushed large and small stones suspended in the air, as if there was no gravity here.

At this time, more and more martial artists began to crawl up. There were Demon Region martial artists and also Wartime Alliance martial artists. Nearly everyone that survived were Xiantian realm martial artists, with peak Houtian masters being in the minority. Not just that, but all of them had extremely pale complexions; they had obviously consumed a great deal of energy to survive.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming also quietly stood up.
