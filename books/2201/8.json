There\u0027s always the smell: a mixture of chalk, school lunches, floor wax, books. The echo of children\u0027s voices, the louder voices of teachers. The \"art\" on the walls and the decorations on each room\u0027s door. The little Red Ditch kindergarten was no different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held Hunter\u0027s hand while Remy trailed behind us. Every time I saw Hunter, he seemed to look a bit more like my cousin Hadley, his dead mother. He had her dark eyes and hair, and his face was losing its baby roundness and growing more oval, like hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Hadley. She\u0027d had a tough life, mostly of her own making. In the end she\u0027d found true love, become a vampire, and been killed for jealousy\u0027s sake. Hadley\u0027s life had been eventful, but short. That was why I was standing in for her, and for a moment I wondered how she\u0027d have felt about that. This should be her job, taking her son to his first school, the kindergarten he\u0027d be attending in the fall. The purpose of the visit was to help the incoming kindergartners become a little familiar with the idea of school, with the look of the rooms and the desks and the teachers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the little people going through the building were looking around with curiosity, not fear. Some of them were silent and wide-eyed. That was the way my \"nephew\" Hunter would look to other people--but in my head Hunter was chattering away. Hunter was telepathic, as I was. This was the most closely guarded secret I held. I wanted Hunter to grow up as normally as possible. The more supes who knew about Hunter, the higher the likelihood someone would snatch him away because telepaths were useful. There was sure to be someone ruthless enough to take such a terrible action. I don\u0027t think Remy, his father, had even considered that yet. Remy was worried about Hunter\u0027s acceptance among the humans around him. And that was a big deal, too. Kids could be incredibly cruel when they sensed you were different. I knew that all too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s kind of obvious when people are having a mind-to-mind conversation, if you know the cues. Their faces change expression when they look at other, much as they would if the conversation were out loud. So I was looking away from the child frequently and keeping my smile steady. Hunter was too little to learn how to conceal our communication, so I\u0027d have to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill all these kids fit in one room? he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out loud,\" I reminded him quietly. \"No, you\u0027ll be divided into groups, and then you\u0027ll hang out with one group all day, Hunter.\" I didn\u0027t know if the Red Ditch kindergarten had the same schedule as the higher grades, but I was sure it would last past lunch, anyway. \"Your dad will bring you in the morning, and someone will come get you in the afternoon.\" Who? I wondered, and then remembered Hunter was listening to me. \"Your dad will fix that,\" I said. \"Look. This room is the Seal Room. See the big picture of the seal? And that room is the Pony Room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a pony?\" Hunter was an optimist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so, but I bet there are lots of pictures of ponies in the room.\" All the doors were open, and the teachers were inside, smiling at the children and their parents, doing their best to seem welcoming and warm. Some of them, of course, had more of a struggle doing this than others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pony Room teacher, Mrs. Gristede, was a nice enough woman, or at least that was what my quick look told me. Hunter nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ventured into the Puppy Room and met with Miss O\u0027Fallon. We were back in the hall after three minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the Puppy Room,\" I told Remy, speaking very quietly. \"You can designate, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we can. Once. I can say one room I definitely don\u0027t want my kid to be in,\" he said. \"Most people use that option in case the teacher is too close to the family, like a relative, or if the families have had some quarrel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the Puppy Room,\" Hunter said, looking scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss O\u0027Fallon looked pretty on the outside, but she was rotten on the inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" Remy asked, his voice also on a confidential level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell you later,\" I murmured. \"Let\u0027s go see something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrailed by Remy, we made visits to the other three rooms. All the other teachers seemed okay, though Mrs. Boyle seemed a little burned-out. Her thoughts were brisk and had an edge of impatience, and her smile was just a bit brittle. I didn\u0027t say anything to Remy. If he could turn down only one teacher, Miss O\u0027Fallon was the most dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went back to Mrs. Gristede\u0027s room because Hunter definitely liked the ponies. There were two other parents there, both towing little girls. I squeezed Hunter\u0027s hand gently to remind him of the rules. He looked up at me, and I nodded, trying to encourage the boy. He let go of my hand and went over to a reading area, picking up one of the books and turning the pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like to read, Hunter?\" Mrs. Gristede asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like books. I can\u0027t read yet.\" Hunter put the book back where it belonged, and I gave him a mental pat on the back. He smiled to himself and picked up another book, this one a Dr. Seuss about dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can tell Hunter\u0027s been read to,\" the teacher said, smiling at Remy and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy introduced himself. \"I\u0027m Hunter\u0027s dad, and this is Hunter\u0027s cousin,\" he said, inclining his head toward me. \"Sookie\u0027s standing in for Hunter\u0027s mom tonight, since she\u0027s passed away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Gristede absorbed that. \"Well, I\u0027m glad to see both of you,\" she said. \"Hunter seems like a bright little boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed the girls were approaching him. They were longtime friends, I could tell, and their parents went to church together. I made a mental note to advise Remy to pick a church and start attending. Hunter was going to need all the backup he could get. The girls began picking up books, too. Hunter smiled at the girl with the dark Dutchboy bob, giving her that sideways look shy children use to evaluate potential playmates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I like this one,\" and pointed to Where the Wild Things Are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never read it,\" Hunter said doubtfully. It looked a little scary to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you play with blocks?\" the girl with the light brown ponytail asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Hunter walked over to the carpeted play area that was for construction, I decided, because there were all sizes of blocks and puzzles around it. In a minute the three were building something that took on life in their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy smiled. He was hoping this was the way every day would go. Of course, it wouldn\u0027t. Even now, Hunter was glancing dubiously at the ponytail girl because she was getting angry about the brunette\u0027s grabbing all the alphabet blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other parents looked at me with some curiosity, and one of the mothers said, \"You don\u0027t live here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"I live over in Bon Temps. But Hunter wanted me to go around with him today, and he\u0027s my favorite little cousin.\" I\u0027d almost called him my nephew, because he called me \"Aunt Sookie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remy,\" the same woman said. \"You\u0027re Hank Savoy\u0027s great-nephew, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy nodded. \"Yeah, we came up here after Katrina, and we stayed,\" he said. He shrugged. Nothing you could do about losing everything to Katrina. She was a bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lot of headshaking, and I felt the sympathy roll over Remy. Maybe that goodwill would extend to Hunter. While they were all bonding, I drifted back to Miss O\u0027Fallon\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman was smiling at two children who were wandering around her brightly decorated classroom. One set of parents was staying right beside their little one. Maybe they were picking up on the vibe, or maybe they were just protective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drifted close to Miss O\u0027Fallon, and I opened my mouth to speak. I would have said, \"You keep those fantasies to yourself. Don\u0027t even think of such things when you\u0027re in the same room with kids.\" But I had a second thought. She knew I\u0027d come with Hunter. Would he become a target for her evil imagination if I threatened her? I couldn\u0027t be around to protect him. I couldn\u0027t stop her. I couldn\u0027t think of a way to take her out of the equation. She hadn\u0027t yet done anything wrong in the eyes of the law or morality . . . yet. So what if she imagined taping children\u0027s mouths shut? She hadn\u0027t done it. Haven\u0027t all of us fantasized about awful things we haven\u0027t done? she asked herself, because the answer made her feel that she was still . . . okay. She didn\u0027t know I could hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I any better than Miss O\u0027Fallon? That awful question ran through my mind more quickly than it takes to write the sentences. I thought, Yeah, I\u0027m not as scary because I\u0027m not in charge of kids. The people I want to hurt are adults and they\u0027re killers themselves. That didn\u0027t make me any better--but it made O\u0027Fallon a lot worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been staring at her long enough to spook her. \"Did you want to ask something about the curriculum?\" she asked finally, a little edge to her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you become a teacher?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it would be a wonderful thing to teach little ones the first things they needed to know to get along in the world,\" she said, as if she\u0027d pressed the button on a recording. She meant, I had a teacher who tortured me when no one was looking, and I like the small and helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm,\" I murmured. The other visitors left the room, and we were alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need therapy,\" I said, quietly and quickly. \"If you act on what you see in your head, you\u0027ll hate yourself. And you\u0027ll ruin the lives of other people just the same way yours was ruined. Don\u0027t let her win. Get help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gaped at me. \"I don\u0027t know . . . What on earth . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so serious,\" I said, answering her next unspoken question. \"I\u0027m so serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it,\" she said, as if the words were ripped from her mouth. \"I swear, I\u0027ll do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be better off,\" I said. I gave her some more eye-to-eye. Then I left the Puppy Room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I\u0027d frightened her enough, or jolted her enough, that she\u0027d actually do what she\u0027d promised. If not, well, I\u0027d have to think of another tactic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My job here is done, Grasshopper,\" I said to myself, earning a nervous look from a very young father. I smiled at him, and after a bit of hesitation, he smiled back. I rejoined Remy and Hunter, and we completed our kindergarten tour without any further incident. Hunter gave me a questioning look, a very anxious look, and I nodded. I took care of her, I said, and I prayed that was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was really too early for supper, but Remy suggested we go to Dairy Queen and treat Hunter to some ice cream, and I agreed. Hunter was half- anxious, half-excited after the school expedition. I tried calming him with a little head-to-head conversation. Can you take me to school the first day, Aunt Sookie? he asked, and I had to steel myself to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Hunter, that\u0027s your daddy\u0027s job, I told him. But when that day comes, you call me when you get home and tell me all about it, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter gave me a big-eyed soulful look. But I\u0027m scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him Skeptical. You may be nervous, but everyone else will feel the same way. This is your chance to make friends, so remember to keep your mouth closed until you\u0027ve gotten everything straight in your head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr they won\u0027t like me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! I said, wanting to be absolutely clear. They won\u0027t understand you. There\u0027s a big difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou like me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You little rascal, you know I like you,\" I said, smiling at him and brushing his hair back. I glanced over at Remy, standing in line at the counter to order our Blizzards. He waved to me and made a face at Hunter. Remy was making a huge effort to take all this in stride. He was growing into his role as father of an exceptional child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured he might get to relax in twelve years, give or take a few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know your dad loves you, and you know he wants what\u0027s best for you, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants me to be like all the other kids, Hunter said, half-sad, halfresentful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants you to be happy. And he knows that the more people who know about this gift you have, the chances are you won\u0027t be happy. I know it\u0027s not fair to tell you that you have to keep a secret. But this is the only secret you have to keep. If anyone talks to you about it, tell your dad or call me. If you think someone\u0027s weird, you tell your dad. If someone tries to bad-touch you, you tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d just scared him now. But he swallowed and said, I know about bad touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re a smart boy, and you\u0027re going to have lots of friends. This is just a thing about you they don\u0027t need to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it\u0027s bad? Hunter\u0027s face looked pinched and desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeck, no! I said, outraged. Nothing wrong with you, buddy. But you know what we are is different, and people don\u0027t always understand different. End of lecture. I gave him a kiss on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hunter, you get us some napkins,\" I said in the regular way, as Remy picked up the plastic tray with our Blizzards. I\u0027d gotten a chocolate chip one, and my mouth was watering when we\u0027d distributed the napkins and dug into our separate cups of sinful goodness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young woman with chin-length black hair came into the restaurant, spotted us, and waved in an uncertain way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Sport, it\u0027s Erin,\" Remy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Erin!\" Hunter waved back enthusiastically, his hand moving like a little metronome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin came over, still looking as though she weren\u0027t sure of her welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she said, looking around the table. \"Mr. Hunter, sir, it\u0027s good to see you this fine afternoon!\" Hunter beamed back at her. He liked being called \"Mr. Hunter.\" Erin had cute round cheeks, and her almond eyes were a rich brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my Aunt Sookie!\" Hunter said with pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sookie, this is Erin,\" Remy said. I could tell from his thoughts that he liked the young woman more than a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erin, I\u0027ve heard so much about you,\" I said. \"It\u0027s nice to put a face with the name. Hunter wanted me to come over to go around the kindergarten rooms with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did that go?\" Erin asked, genuinely interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter started to tell her all about it, and Remy jumped up to pull over a chair for Erin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had a good time after that. Hunter seemed to be really fond of Erin, and Erin returned the feeling. Erin was also quite interested in Hunter\u0027s dad, and Remy was on the verge of being nuts about her. All in all, it wasn\u0027t a bad afternoon to be able to read minds, I figured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter said, \"Miss Erin, Aunt Sookie says she can\u0027t go with me to the first day of school. Would you?\" Erin was both startled and pleased. \"If your dad says it\u0027s okay, and if I can get off work,\" she said, careful to put some conditions on it in case Remy had some objection . . . or they\u0027d quit dating by late August. \"You\u0027re so sweet to ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Remy took Hunter to the men\u0027s room, Erin and I were left to regard each other with curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you and Remy been seeing each other?\" I asked. That seemed safe enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a month,\" she said. \"I like Remy, and I think we might have something, but it\u0027s too soon to tell. I don\u0027t want Hunter to start depending on me in case it doesn\u0027t work out. Plus . . .\" She hesitated for a long minute. \"I understand that Kristen Duchesne thought there was something wrong with Hunter. She told everyone that. But I really care about that little boy.\" The question was clear in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s different,\" I said, \"but there\u0027s nothing wrong with him. He\u0027s not mentally ill, he doesn\u0027t have a learning disability, and he\u0027s not possessed by the devil.\" I was smiling, just a little, when I got to the end of the sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d never seen any signs of that,\" she agreed. She was smiling, too. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen the whole picture, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t about to tell Hunter\u0027s secret. \"He needs special love and care,\" I said. \"He\u0027s never really had a mom, and I\u0027m sure having someone stable in his life, filling that role, would help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s not going to be you.\" She said that as if she were half asking a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, relieved to get a chance to set the record straight. \"That\u0027s not going to be me. Remy seems like a nice guy, but I\u0027m seeing someone else.\" I scraped up one more spoonful of chocolate and sugar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin looked down at her glass of Pepsi, thinking her own thoughts. Of course, I was thinking them right along with her. She\u0027d never liked Kristen and didn\u0027t think much of her mental ability. She did like Remy, more and more. And she loved Hunter. \"Okay,\" she said, having reached an inner conclusion. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at me and nodded. I nodded right back. It seemed we\u0027d arrived at an understanding. When the menfolk came back from their trip to the restroom, I said good-bye to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, wait, Remy, can you step outside for a minute with me, if Erin wouldn\u0027t mind keeping an eye on Hunter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to,\" she said. I hugged Hunter again and gave him a pat and a smile as I moved toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy followed me, an apprehensive expression on his face. We stood a little away from the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know Hadley left the rest of her estate to me,\" I said. This had been weighing on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lawyer told me.\" Remy\u0027s face wasn\u0027t giving anything away, but of course I have other methods. He was calm through and through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t mad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t want nothing of Hadley\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But for Hunter . . . his college. There wasn\u0027t much cash, but there was some good jewelry, and I could sell it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a college fund started for him,\" Remy said. \"One of my great-aunts says she\u0027s going to leave what she\u0027s got to him since she doesn\u0027t have any kids of her own. Hadley put me through hell, and she didn\u0027t even care enough about Hunter to plan for him. I don\u0027t want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In all fairness, she didn\u0027t expect to die young. . . . In fact, she didn\u0027t expect to die ever,\" I said. \"It\u0027s my belief she didn\u0027t put Hunter in her will because she didn\u0027t want anyone to know about him and come looking for him to use him as a hostage for her good behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope that\u0027s the case,\" Remy said. \"I mean, I hope she thought about him. But taking her money, knowing how she turned out, how she earned it . . . that would make me feel sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I said. \"If you think it over and change your mind, call me by tomorrow night! You never know when I might go on a spending spree or put that jewelry down on the table at one of the casinos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, just a little. \"You\u0027re a good woman,\" he said, and returned to his girlfriend and his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started the drive home with a clear conscience and a happier heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d worked half of the early shift that day (Holly had taken my half and her own shift), so I was free. I thought of brooding over Gran\u0027s letter a little more. Mr. Cataliades\u0027s visit to us when we were babies, the cluviel dor, the deceptions Gran\u0027s lover had practiced on her . . . Because surely when Gran had thought she smelled Fintan when she was seeing her husband, she was seeing Fintan in disguise. It was hard to absorb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia and Bob were busy casting spells when I got back. They were walking around the perimeter of the house in opposite directions, chanting and swinging incense like the priests in the Catholic Church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome days I realized it was all to the good that I lived out in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to break their concentration, so I wandered off into the woods. I wondered where the portal was, if I could recognize it. \"A thin place,\" Dermot had called it. Could I spot a thin place? At least I knew the general direction, and I started east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a warm afternoon, and I began sweating the minute I started to make my way through the woods. The sun broke through the branches in a thousand patterns, and the birds and the bugs made the thousand noises that left the woods anything but silent. It wouldn\u0027t be long until evening closed in and the light would fracture and slant, making the footing uncertain. The birds would fall silent, and the night creatures would make their own harmony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked my way through the undergrowth, thinking of the night before. I wondered if Judith had packed all her things and left, as she\u0027d said she would. I wondered if Bill felt lonely now that she was gone. I assumed nothing and no one had popped up in my yard the night before, since I\u0027d slept through the hours of the dark and into the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen all I had left to wonder about was when Sandra Pelt would try to kill me again. Just as I began to suspect that being alone in the woods wasn\u0027t a good idea, I stepped into a tiny clearing about a quarter of a mile, or less, slightly southeast of my back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pretty sure this was the thin place, this little clearing. For one thing, there was no reason for it to be clear that I could see. There were wild grasses growing thickly, but there were no bushes, nothing above calf-high. No vines stretched across the area, no branches drooped over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I stepped out of the trees, I gave the ground a very careful examination. The last thing I needed was to be caught in some kind of fairy booby trap. But I couldn\u0027t see anything extraordinary, except perhaps . . . a slight wavering in the air. Right in the middle of the clearing. The odd spot--if I was even seeing it right--hovered at the height of my knees. It was the shape of a small and irregular circle, perhaps fifteen inches in diameter. And in just that spot, the air seemed to distort, a little like a heat illusion. Was it actually hot? I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt in the weeds about an arm\u0027s length from the wobbly air. I plucked a long blade of grass and very nervously poked it into the distorted area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let go of it, and it vanished. I snatched my fingers back and yipped with surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d established something. I wasn\u0027t sure what. If I\u0027d doubted Claude\u0027s word, here was verification he\u0027d been telling me the truth. Very carefully, I moved a little closer to the wavery patch. \"Hi, Niall,\" I said. \"If you\u0027re listening, if you\u0027re there. I miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there came no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a lot of troubles, but I expect you do, too,\" I said, not wanting to sound whiny. \"I don\u0027t know how Faery fits into this world. Are you all walking around us, but invisible? Or do you have a whole\u0027nother world, like Atlantis?\" This was a pretty weak and one-sided conversation. \"Well, I better go back to the house before it gets dark. If you need me, come see me. I do miss you,\" I said again. Nothing continued to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling both pleased that I\u0027d found the thin spot and disappointed that nothing had changed as a result, I made my way back through the woods to the house. Bob and Amelia had finished their magical doings in the yard, and Bob had fired up the grill. He and Amelia were going to cook steaks. Though I\u0027d had ice cream with Remy and Hunter, I couldn\u0027t turn down grilled steak rubbed with Bob\u0027s secret seasoning. Amelia was cutting up potatoes to wrap in foil to go on the grill, too. I was pleased as punch. I volunteered to cook some crookneck squash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house felt happier. And safer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we ate, Amelia told us funny stories about working in the Genuine Magic Shop, and Bob unbent enough to imitate some of his odder colleagues in the unisex hair salon where he worked. The hairdresser Bob replaced had become so discouraged by the complications of life in post-Katrina New Orleans that she\u0027d loaded up her car and left for Miami. Bob had gotten the job by being the first qualified person to walk in the door after the previous one had walked out. In answer to my question about whether that had been sheer coincidence, Bob just smiled. Every now and then, I saw a flash of what fascinated Amelia about Bob, who otherwise looked like a skinny, rough-haired encyclopedia salesman. I told him about Immanuel and my emergency haircut, and he said Immanuel had done a wonderful job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, the work on the wards is all done?\" I asked anxiously, trying to sound casual about the change of topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet,\" Amelia said, looking proud. She cut another bite of steak. \"They\u0027re even better now. A dragon couldn\u0027t get through \u0027em. No one who means you harm will make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So if a dragon was friendly . . .\" I said, half teasing, and she swatted me with her fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No such thing, the way I hear tell,\" Amelia said. \"Of course, I\u0027ve never seen one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" I didn\u0027t know whether to feel curious or relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob said, \"Amelia\u0027s got a surprise for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" I tried to sound more relaxed than I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found the cure,\" she said, half-proudly and half-shyly. \"I mean, you did ask me to when I left. I kept looking for a way to break the blood bond. I found it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" I scrambled to conceal how flustered I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First I asked Octavia. She didn\u0027t know, because she doesn\u0027t specialize in vampire magic, but she e-mailed a couple of her older friends in other covens, and they scouted around. It all took time, and there were some dead ends, but eventually I came up with a spell that doesn\u0027t end in the death of one of the . . . bondees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m stunned,\" I said, which was the absolute truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I cast it tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean . . . right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, after supper.\" Amelia looked slightly less happy because she wasn\u0027t getting the response she\u0027d anticipated. Bob was looking from Amelia to me, and he, too, looked doubtful. He\u0027d assumed I\u0027d be both delighted and effusive, and that wasn\u0027t the reaction he was seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" I put my fork down. \"It wouldn\u0027t hurt Eric?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if anything can hurt a vampire that old,\" she said. \"Honestly, Sook, why you\u0027re worrying about him . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love him,\" I said. They both stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For real?\" Amelia said in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you that before you left, Amelia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I just didn\u0027t want to believe you. You sure you\u0027ll feel that way when the bond is dissolved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I want to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"You need to know. And you need to be free of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun had just set, and I could feel Eric rising. His presence was with me like a shadow: familiar, irritating, reassuring, intrusive. All those things at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re ready, do it now,\" I said. \"Before I lose all courage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is actually a good time of day to do it,\" she said. \"Sunset. End of the day. Endings, in general. It makes sense.\" Amelia hurried to the bedroom. She returned in a couple of minutes with an envelope and three little jars: jelly jars in a chrome rack, like the kind a waitress in a diner puts on the table at breakfast. The jars were half-full of a mixture of herbs. Amelia was now wearing an apron. I could see that there were objects in one of the pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" she said, and handed the envelope to Bob, who extracted the paper and scanned it quickly, a frown on his narrow face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out in the yard,\" he suggested, and we three left the kitchen, crossed the back porch, and went down into the yard, smelling the steak all over again as we passed my old grill. Amelia positioned me in one spot, Bob in another, and then positioned the jelly jars, too. Bob and I each had one on the ground behind us, and there was one at the spot where she would stand. We\u0027d form a triangle. I didn\u0027t ask any questions. I probably wouldn\u0027t have believed the answers, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a book of matches and handed one to Bob, too. She kept a third for herself. \"When I tell you, set fire to your herbs. Then walk counterclockwise around your jar three times,\" she said. \"Stop at your station again after the third time. Then we\u0027ll say some words--Bob, you got \u0027em in your head? Sookie\u0027ll need the paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob looked at the words again, nodded, and passed me the paper. I could just read the script by the security light, because the evening was closing in fast now that the sun was down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\" Amelia asked sharply. She looked older and colder in the twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, wondering if I was being truthful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob said, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then turn and light your fire,\" Amelia said, and like a robot I did as I was told. I was scared to death, and I wasn\u0027t sure why. This was what I needed to do. My match struck and I dropped it in the jelly jar. The herbs flared up with a sharp smell, and then we three were upright again and moving counterclockwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this a bad thing for a Christian to be doing? Probably. On the other hand, it had never occurred to me to ask the Methodist minister if he had a ritual in place to sever a blood bond between a woman and a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when we\u0027d been around three times and stopped again, Amelia pulled a ball of red yarn from her apron. She held one end and passed the ball to Bob. He measured out some and took hold and then passed the ball to me. I did the same and returned the ball to Amelia, because that seemed to be the program. I held the yarn with one hand and gripped the paper with the other. This was busier than I had counted on. Amelia also had a pair of shears, and she extracted those from a pocket, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia, who had been chanting the whole time, pointed at me and then at Bob, to indicate that we should join in. I peered down at the paper, picked my way through the words that made no sense to me, and then it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood in silence, and the little flames in the jars died out, and the night had set in hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut,\" Amelia said, handing me the shears. \"And mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling a little ridiculous and a lot scared, but sure that I needed to do this, I snipped the red yarn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I lost Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia rolled up the cut yarn and handed it to me. To my surprise, she was smiling; she looked fierce and triumphant. I took the length of yarn automatically from her hand, all my senses stretching out to seek Eric. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a rush of panic. It wasn\u0027t entirely pure: There was some relief mixed in, which I had expected. And there was grief. As soon as I was sure he was okay, that he hadn\u0027t been hurt, I knew I would relax and feel the full measure of the success of the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the house, my phone rang, and I sprinted for the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you there?\" he said. \"Are you there, are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric,\" I said, my breath coming out in a great ripping sigh. \"Oh, I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re all right! You are, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amelia found a way to break the bond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. Before, I would have known if Eric was anxious, furious, or thoughtful. Now, I couldn\u0027t imagine. Finally, he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sookie, the marriage gives you some protection, but the bond is what is important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard me. I am so angry with you.\" He really meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. If I see Amelia, I\u0027ll break her neck.\" He meant that, too. \"She\u0027s always wanted you to get rid of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . .\" I began, not knowing how to end the sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you when I\u0027ve got control of myself,\" he said. And he hung up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-reckoning-sookie-stackhouse-11/page-8.html","bookId":2201,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:26 PM"}
