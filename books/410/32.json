CRIMES OF HIGH TREASON.","content":"\u0026nbsp;The first class of crimes—that is, the worst, because they are the most injurious to society—are those known as crimes of high treason.

Every crime, be it ever so private, injures society; but every crime does not aim at its immediate destruction. Moral, like physical actions, have their limited sphere of activity, and are differently circumscribed, like all the movements of nature, by time and space; and therefore only a sophistical interpretation, which is generally the philosophy of slavery, can confound what eternal truth has distinguished by immutable differences. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2814/77795.html","bookId":410,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:49:45 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:49:45 AM"}
