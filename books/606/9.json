THE ENEMY\u0027S COUNTRY.","content":"It must have been at least five minutes before those exhausted men moved again; when at last they managed to rise to their feet it was to find themselves in the midst of absolute darkness, with the wild sea on one side of them and on the other no one knew what.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The faint point of light which they had seen had now disappeared: but they took it to mean that there were Spaniards in the neighborhood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And they did not fail to recognize the peril in which they were. The firing had probably been heard and the wreck of the merchantman seen. If so, the Americans could not be in a much worse place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We may be right in front of a battery,\" whispered Clif.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The first thing the sailors did was to see to their revolvers and cutlasses. And after that they started silently down the shore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We won\u0027t try to go far,\" Clif said, \"but we must find a hiding-place.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But in that darkness the hiding-places were themselves hidden; the best the Americans could do was to stumble down the shore for a hundred yards or so, being careful to walk where the waves would wash out their footprints.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then they were a short distance from the wreck and felt a trifle safer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We may as well strike back in the country now,\" said the leader, \"at least until we can find some bushes or something to conceal us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was a rather more ticklish task, and the men crouched and stole along in silence. They had no idea what they might meet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was fortunate for them that they were quiet. Otherwise they would have gotten into very serious trouble indeed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They stole up the sandy beach a short ways, feeling their way along and getting further and further away from the sea. They were struggling through soft dry sand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And suddenly Clif, who was in front, saw something loom up before him, a dark line. And he put out his hand to touch it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He found that the sand rose gradually into a sort of drift or bank. It was high, and seemed to reach for some distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sailors stopped abruptly, and Clif crept softly forward, feeling along with his hands; suddenly the men heard him mutter a startled exclamation under his breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Men,\" he whispered, \"we\u0027re in a terrible fix; I ran into a gun!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A gun!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes—a big one. We\u0027ve struck a Spanish battery, and we must be near some town!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sailors stared at him aghast; and then suddenly came a startling interruption—one that fairly made their blood grow chill.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who goes there?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a loud, stern hail in Spanish, and it seemed to come from almost beside them!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Quick as a flash the Americans dropped, crouching close together in the darkness. They could hear the beating of each others\u0027 hearts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were several moments of agonizing suspense; the Spaniard who had shouted out was evidently awaiting a reply. And then suddenly he repeated his challenge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who goes there?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And a moment later came a sound of hurrying footsteps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the matter?\" Clif heard a voice demand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was the only one in the party who understood Spanish, and knew what was said. But it was plain to the rest that it was a conversation between a sentry and an officer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I heard a footstep, senor capitan!\" cried the man. \"Quidada! Take care! It\u0027s very near.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a moment\u0027s pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You must be mistaken,\" said the officer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am not mistaken,\" repeated the man firmly. \"Santa Maria, my ears do not deceive me. You said to be watchful, for you have heard firing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To that the Americans had listened in trembling silence; but the next made them jump. \"I will light this lantern,\" said the officer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the instant they heard it Clif rose silently to his feet; the men did likewise, and began to creep softly off to one side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But careful as they were they could not help the grinding sound of their footsteps in the sand, and it caught the quick ear of the Spaniard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hear it!\" he cried. \"Por dios, again! Somebody is stealing upon us!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And an instant later the air was rent by a sharp crack of a rifle—the sentry had fired!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was wild confusion at once, and the unfortunate castaways were aghast. For an instant Clif thought of charging the battery—with four men. But he realized the folly of that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Quick!\" he cried, \"let us hide. Forward!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lights were flashing and men shouting and running about behind the sand wall just in front of them, but the sailors were still unseen. They broke into a run and fairly flew down the shore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They fancied the whole Spanish company was at their heels; but after they had run for some distance they found that they had not been pursued.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the enemy were so taken by surprise at the sudden alarm that they were if possible more frightened than the Americans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And so the men stopped for breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They stared at each other, as if hardly able to realize the peril into which they had so suddenly been plunged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think that was the quickest adventure I ever had in my life,\" muttered Clif.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The suddenness of it made him laugh; they had almost walked into a Spanish fort.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it was no laughing matter, certainly; it was a confounded piece of ill-luck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"For they\u0027ll be watching for us now!\" muttered Clif. \"I\u0027m afraid that will settle us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027ll follow our footsteps!\" exclaimed one of the sailors.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was so, and it was an unpleasant prospect; it was plain that if the Americans wished to find any safety they must get some distance away from that battery.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll make one more effort to get back into the country,\" muttered Clif.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And amid silence and anxious suspense they once more started up the sloping seashore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They crept along as it seemed by inches. But fortunately they did not run across any more \"guns.\" When they came across an embankment it was of solid earth and marked the end of the beach.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And there were some trees and bushes there, so the Americans began to feel more comfortable. For all they knew they might in the darkness have been strolling into a town.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But they were apparently out in the open country, there seemed to be no people and no houses near. So they started boldly forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was then late at night, a dark and damp and windy night; so they were not likely to find many people wandering about.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What we want to do,\" Clif said, \"is to get back in the country a while where we can hide until morning. Then if we can find some Cubans we\u0027ll be all right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif was about tired to death. He had done far more work that day than any of those sailors. But there was no time for resting then.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He gritted his teeth and started; they took their bearings from the sea, and then went straight on, watching and listening carefully, but meeting with no trouble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At first their walk led through what had evidently once been a cultivated country, for it was level and had but few trees upon it. At present, however, it was overgrown with weeds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once they almost ran into a house, which it may readily be believed gave them a start. It was creepy business, anyhow, this stumbling along through the enemy\u0027s country without being able to see ten yards in front.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the house seemed to be empty. In fact, it could hardly be called a house any more, for it was half burned down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Americans thought that it was empty, for Clif had stumbled and fallen with a crash over a pile of dry sticks and rubbish. But when he rose to his feet to listen anxiously there was no movement or sign that anybody had heard him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It probably belonged to some of the reconcentrados,\" he muttered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was about to turn and give the word to proceed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then suddenly a new idea occurred to him, and he gave a pleased exclamation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is lucky!\" he whispered. \"Men, what is the matter with hiding there?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was a rather startling proposition; for they could not be at all sure but some one lived there after all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Clif had come several miles by that time, and he was disposed to be a trifle desperate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A person can get so tired that he will be anxious to enter even a Spanish dungeon in order to get a chance to rest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We will search the house,\" he said. \"If we find anybody we\u0027ll hold them up and make them prisoners; and if we don\u0027t, we\u0027ll spend the night there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then without another word he started silently forward. The sailors were right behind him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What was evidently the front of the house was the part that had been burned. Clif picked his way over the ruins and into the rear, where there was a roof still remaining.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a door there, half shut; one may readily believe that in pushing it open Clif was rather nervous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But nothing occurred to startle him, and so they went forward once more. The place about him seemed deserted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then suddenly Clif did a startling thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He took a deep breath and called aloud.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Anybody here?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then for at least a minute or two the little party stood waiting in silence; but no answer was heard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guess it\u0027s deserted,\" Clif said. \"Scatter and search it thoroughly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And that was quickly done. To their relief the Americans found that the place was not inhabited and that there was no one near. That once made sure it may be believed that they wasted no more time in delay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think it will be necessary for us to keep watch,\" he said. \"Our safety lies in our hiding.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They made their way into one of the smaller rooms of the little building, one which had a key to the door. And having secured themselves as best they could from danger of discovery, the wearied men sank down upon the floor.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3248/89005.html","bookId":606,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM"}
