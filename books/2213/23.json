I mean, I wouldn\u0027t give up anything just yet, not my torn shoe, nothing. Keep away your combs, your towels, your comfort. I clung to the secret inside my coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shroud, that\u0027s what I asked for, some heavy thing to wrap about myself. They found it, a blanket, soft, woolen, didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was almost empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been steadily moving Roger\u0027s treasures south. They told me. Mortal agents had been entrusted with this task, and most of the statues and the icons were gone down to the orphanage in New Orleans, and housed there in the empty chapel I had seen, where only the Crucified Christ had been. Some omen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had not quite finished these tasks. A few precious things remained, a trunk or two, boxes of papers. Files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been gone the space of three days. The news was filled with tales of Roger\u0027s death. Though they would not tell me how it had been discovered. The scramble for power in the world of the dark, criminal drug cartels was well under way. The reporters had stopped calling the TV station about Dora. No one knew about this place. No one knew she was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFew knew about the big orphanage to which she planned to return, when all Roger\u0027s relics had been moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cable network had canceled her show. The gangster\u0027s daughter preached no more. She had not seen or spoken to her followers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn newspaper columns and in bites on television, she learnt that the scandal had made her vaguely mysterious. But in the main, she was considered a dead end, a small-time television evangelist with no knowledge of her father\u0027s doings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the company of David and Armand, she had lost all contact with her former world, living here in New York, as the worst winter in fifty years came down, a snow from Heaven\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;living here among the relics and listening to them, their soft comfort, their wondrous tales, uncertain of what she meant to do, believing still in God....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that was the latest news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the blanket from them and walked, one shoe gone, through the flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into the small room. I wrapped the blanket around me. The window here was covered. No sun would come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t come near me,\" I said. \"I need to sleep a mortal\u0027s sleep. I need to sleep the night through and the day and then I\u0027ll tell you everything. Don\u0027t touch me, don\u0027t come near me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I sleep in your arms?\" Dora asked, a white and vibrant blood-filled thing standing in the doorway, her vampiric angels behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was dark. Only a chest was left with some relics in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were statues still in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Once the sun rises, my body will do whatever it will to protect itself from any mortal intrusion. You can\u0027t come with me into that sleep. It\u0027s not possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me lie with you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two stared over her shoulders at my empty left eyelids fluttering painfully against each other. There must have been blood.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But our blood is staunched fast. The eye had been torn out by the root. What was its root? I could still smell the soft delicious blood I had from her. It laid on my lips, her blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me sleep,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI locked the door and lay on the floor, knees drawn up, warm and safe in the thick folds of the blanket, smelling the pine needles and the soil that clung to my clothes, and the smoke, and the bits and pieces of dried excrement, and the blood, of course, the human blood, blood from battlefields, and blood from Hagia Sophia when the dead infant had fallen on me, and the smell of the horse manure, and the smell of the marl of Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of it was wrapped up with me in this blanket, my hand on the bulk of the unfolded veil against my bare chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t come near me!\" I whispered one more time for the ears of the immortals outside, who were so confounded and confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet rest. Sweet darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould that death were like this. Would that one would sleep and sleep and sleep forever. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-23.html","bookId":2213,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:37 PM"}
