Accustomed now to its bite, she gulped the whisky back and this time actually enjoyed the feel of its smoky fingers wending their way through her veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe merely stared silently at her. “I\u0027ve never seen a lass able to stomach whisky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” she managed, “\u0027they do say it\u0027s \u0027spunkier than tea,\u0027 right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do they, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, like the song.” She felt loose now. Not yet drunk, but pleasantly tipsy. She poured another dram into the cup, and, holding it aloft, she sang a line from her father\u0027s favorite Irish drinking tune. “You\u0027re sweeter, stronger, decenter, you\u0027re spunkier than tea.” She let it rip, her Irish brogue blooming round and thick in imitation of her dad. “Ohh whisky you\u0027re me darlin\u0027 drunk or sohhh -ber.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again, and she laughed too, from deep in her belly, then instantly clutched her hands to her torso in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Och, easy lass.” MacColla shot to his feet. He looked unsure what to do, and took up the decante r to pour more into her glass. “More of this might help the pain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, aye, lass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uhh… ” Her tipsy good cheer was suddenly replaced by a searing melancholy. “It\u0027s not helping.” The reason she wanted to get drunk in the first place slamme d into her gut, as great a shock to her system as her torn muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trapped, somehow sent back to the seventeenth century. Alone but for this man, famous for his vicious feats in battle. Alone, and with no way to get back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come.” His voice was so low, she wasn\u0027t entirely certain he\u0027d spoken. And then she felt his hands. He\u0027d moved to stand behind her, to massage the bruised muscles of her back and sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d studied those hands earlier, could picture them now in her mind\u0027s eye. The fingers, long and strong, and his palms, wide, coarse. Those huge hands spanned her back easily. Moved up and down, gently probing the tender spots between ribs until he found the source of her pain. Haley had never considered herself a small woman - she wasn\u0027t a small woman - and yet she felt almost delicate in that broad, muscular grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I… ” She attempted to speak, but couldn\u0027t. She had to get a hold of herself. This was entirely unexpected. Alasdair MacColla. Giving her a back massage? It was too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperate to regain the upper hand, her voice cracked,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What can you tell me of James Graham?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stilled for a just a moment, then continued. “I think the question is, lass, what can you tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That he was captured.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An… and… ” His thumb grazed a knot. She gasped, and MacColla kneaded it slowly, tenderly. She hadn\u0027t realized how clenched her muscles had been until his fingers found the knot, released it, loosening a warm rush of blood through her torso. Her rib cage opened, and she took her first deep inhale since her injury. Oh God, pure heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. Concentrate. “And then… then he was paraded through the countryside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked her eyes for a moment, gathering her wits. The sudden openness in her chest made her light-headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And… hanged?” she ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So they say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmhm.” So they say. That\u0027s just it, she thought. Fact? Or hearsay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley was about to probe more, when MacColla\u0027s thumb grazed the underside of her breast. It seemed innocent enough. He was intent on massaging her tight muscles. The brush was accidental. And yet, even as her muscles released, her breasts beaded tight. Her breath came short, despite the newfound openness of her lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But… but did anyone see… ” Her breath hitched. A quick, sharp inhalation. His fingers now, rubbing along the sensitive slope just underneath her nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See what, Fitzpatrick?” His tone was no -nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimply mild curiosity. He seemed not to have any suspicion of what she asked, or of what his touch was doing to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See… ” Oh God. She turned slightly. Purposefully. Angling toward him. She had to know if his touch was deliberate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod help her, she hoped it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye?” His voice was ragged, low. Did she hear an echo of her own desire there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA throat cleared, and MacColla was instantly apart from her. It was Scrymgeour, standing in the doorway, watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought we could retire to my sitting room, MacColla.” Scrymgeour\u0027s eyes scanned the room, and Haley wasn\u0027t sure if what she read there was judgment, curiosity, surprise, or a little of all three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye.” MacColla\u0027s nod was curt. “If… if you\u0027ll excuse me,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcuse him. Were his words loaded? Had he meant to touch her just then? Had she sensed his intent, or was she simply imagining it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she replied. “Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he left, she shuddered an exhale. The movement caused a fresh twinge, sharp along her side. But with it came focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so this time, Haley welcomed her pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you trying to kill me?” Haley pulled the blanket over her face, turning her back to MacColla\u0027s sister. A drumbeat pounded in her head, and daylight brought it to a crescendo that she thought would cleave her skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyeballs hurt, her throat was dry, her brain was scrambled, and, whatever that home -distilled whisky was, it had given her a hangover so painful she imagined surely that, if Jean only listened hard enough, she\u0027d be able to discern the thumping in Haley\u0027s head with her ears alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was the whole issue of safety. She tried not to consider the various technologies employed by modern distillers that made liquor fit for consumption. The concept of pasteurization had occurred to her more than once, each time bringing with it a fresh throbbing that reverberated all the way down her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean made a small, exasperated sound, and Haley peeked tentatively out from beneath the blanket. The girl was still there, standing stricken, bearing the cup she\u0027d brought. The white viscous liquid wavered in her trembling hand, and Haley added nausea to her list of ailments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really. Jean,” she croaked, “I\u0027m grateful, but… ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It always helps my brothers, aye?” She took a step closer to Haley\u0027s bed. “They call it their Morning Glory. Though I dare say, you missed the morning by a fair piece.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored the sharp pang at the memory of her own brothers, shining bright in her mind\u0027s eye. How long had she been gone? Would they think her dead by now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh guys… forgive me. Then quick on the heels of that came a bright light, an idea like a cartoon bulb flashing over her head. Brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley hadn\u0027t considered it before, but the best source of information could be standing right in front of her. Of course MacColla would\u0027ve had brothers. She\u0027d known of his father, knew vaguely of an older brother, but that was the extent of her knowledge. If she ingratiated herself with his sister, she might be able to learn more about the man. And in so doing, perhaps gain some insight into the fate of James Graham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley grudgingly took the glass, and the smile that bloomed onto the girl\u0027s face was startling. She was downright pretty when she wasn\u0027t pulling her meek act, and the realization made it almost worthwhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil she smelled the stuff in the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShuddering, she quickly foisted it back in Jean\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl merely smiled and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” Haley conceded, “but can I at least hear what\u0027s in it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drink it first. Once you see it down, then I\u0027ll tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley scowled. Was that a smile on Jean\u0027s face? She sniffed the liquid again. A little foul and a little sweet. The worst combination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley held it up to the light. Opaque, grayish white. She shrugged. What could it hurt? Her current hangover had to be about as low as a human could go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bottoms up,” she said, and tossed the glass back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer stomach clenched in revolt. The shivers she\u0027d experienced drinking MacColla\u0027s whisky were nothing compared to the revulsion that crawled up her body now, convulsing her muscles and turning her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh God.” Haley wiped the tears from her eyes. “What… ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eggs. Sugar. Cream. And a dram of whisky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh God, you are trying to kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s what my brothers say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnreasonable hatred swelled in Haley. “You\u0027re enjoying this.” She mustered every evil look she could and shot them all in Jean\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, and they say that too.” His sister smiled again, and Haley didn\u0027t know what to make of this new side of her. Jean took the glass back and wiped Haley\u0027s mouth with a rag. And Haley was so stunned, she allowed it. Jean added saucily. “And they always manage to survive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley had to chuckle then, at the unexpected verve. She hadn\u0027t known MacColla\u0027s sister had it in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose you make them drink it too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, aye. they\u0027d not tell me no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I… ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t believe me.” It was a statement, and Haley realized it was true. She\u0027d discounted Jean, and the girl had known it. She tucked the rag at her waist and added, “Well, not all can act as you do. Just because I don\u0027t swagger around ”-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t swagger-” Haley protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I don\u0027t swagger about like a man, doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t get a man to listen to me. I dare say, my brothers mind me more than they do each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why aren\u0027t you married?” The question struck Haley suddenly. Surely Jean was old by seventeenth-century standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was.” Though her tone brooked no questions, the pain that flickered momentarily across Jean\u0027s features was impossible to miss. “He died. I\u0027m a widow.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-19.html","bookId":1617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM"}
