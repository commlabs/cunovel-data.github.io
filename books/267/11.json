He looked away — I looked at him — and I noticed that the hair stood up and curled above his forehead in a peculiar way, which, so I have heard from an army doctor who had had a great many wounded pass through his hands, is always a symptom of intense overheating of the brain. . . . The thought struck me again that fate really had laid a heavy hand on this man and that his comrades were right in seeing something “fatal” in him. And yet inwardly I blamed him. “A working-class girl!” I thought, “a fine sort of aristocrat you are yourself!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Perhaps you blame me, Ridel,” Tyeglev began suddenly, as though guessing what I was thinking. “I am very . . . unhappy myself. But what to do? What to do?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He leaned his chin on his hand and began biting the broad flat nails of his short, red fingers, hard as iron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What I think, Ilya Stepanitch, is that you ought first to make certain whether your suppositions are correct. . . . Perhaps your lady love is alive and well.” (“Shall I tell him the real explanation of the taps?” flashed through my mind. “No — later.”)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “She has not written to me since we have been in camp,” observed Tyeglev.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That proves nothing, Ilya Stepanitch.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tyeglev waved me off. “No! she is certainly not in this world. She called me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He suddenly turned to the window. “Someone is knocking again!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I could not help laughing. “No, excuse me, Ilya Stepanitch! This time it is your nerves. You see, it is getting light. In ten minutes the sun will be up — it is past three o’clock — and ghosts have no power in the day.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tyeglev cast a gloomy glance at me and muttering through his teeth “good-bye,” lay down on the bench and turned his back on me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I lay down, too, and before I fell asleep I remember I wondered why Tyeglev was always hinting at . . . suicide. What nonsense! What humbug! Of his own free will he had refused to marry her, had cast her off . . . and now he wanted to kill himself! There was no sense in it! He could not resist posing!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With these thoughts I fell into a sound sleep and when I opened my eyes the sun was already high in the sky — and Tyeglev was not in the hut.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had, so his servant said, gone to the town.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/972/29358.html","bookId":267,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:13:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:13:47 AM"}
