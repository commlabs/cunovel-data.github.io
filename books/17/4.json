Bridge heard the boy behind him move impulsively forward and saw him kneel on the bed beside the girl. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are not badly hurt,” volunteered The Oskaloosa Kid. “Bridge couldn\u0027t find a mark on you—the bullet must have missed you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He was holding me over the edge of the car when he fired.” The girl\u0027s voice reflected the physical shudder which ran through her frame at the recollection. “Then he threw me out almost simultaneously. I suppose he thought that he could not miss at such close range.” For a time she was silent again, sitting stiffly erect. Bridge could feel rather than see wide, tense eyes staring out through the darkness upon scenes, horrible perhaps, that were invisible to him and the Kid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Suddenly the girl turned and threw herself face downward upon the bed. “O, God!” she moaned. “Father! Father! It will kill you—no one will believe me—they will think that I am bad. I didn\u0027t do it! I didn\u0027t do it! I\u0027ve been a silly little fool; but I have never been a bad girl—and—-and—I had nothing to do with that awful thing that happened to-night.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bridge and the boy realized that she was not talking to them—that for the moment she had lost sight of their presence—she was talking to that father whose heart would be breaking with the breaking of the new day, trying to convince him that his little girl had done no wrong.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Again she sat up, and when she spoke there was no tremor in her voice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I may die,” she said. “I want to die. I do not see how I can go on living after last night; but if I do die I want my father to know that I had nothing to do with it and that they tried to kill me because I wouldn\u0027t promise to keep still. It was the little one who murdered him—the one they called \u0027Jimmie\u0027 and \u0027The Oskaloosa Kid.\u0027 The big one drove the car—his name was \u0027Terry.\u0027 After they killed him I tried to jump out—I had been sitting in front with Terry—and then they dragged me over into the tonneau and later—the Oskaloosa Kid tried to kill me too, and threw me out.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bridge heard the boy at his side gulp. The girl went on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To-morrow you will know about the murder—everyone will know about it; and I will be missed; and there will be people who saw me in the car with them, for someone must have seen me. Oh, I can\u0027t face it! I want to die. I will die! I come of a good family. My father is a prominent man. I can\u0027t go back and stand the disgrace and see him suffer, as he will suffer, for I was all he had—his only child. I can\u0027t bear to tell you my name—you will know it soon enough—but please find some way to let my father know all that I have told you—I swear that it is the truth—by the memory of my dead mother, I swear it!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bridge laid a hand upon the girl\u0027s shoulder. “If you are telling us the truth,” he said, “you have only a silly escapade with strange men upon your conscience. You must not talk of dying now—your duty is to your father. If you take your own life it will be a tacit admission of guilt and will only serve to double the burden of sorrow and ignominy which your father is bound to feel when this thing becomes public, as it certainly must if a murder has been done. The only way in which you can atone for your error is to go back and face the consequences with him—do not throw it all upon him; that would be cowardly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The girl did not reply; but that the man\u0027s words had impressed her seemed evident. For a while each was occupied with his own thoughts; which were presently disturbed by the sound of footsteps upon the floor below—the muffled scraping of many feet followed a moment later by an exclamation and an oath, the words coming distinctly through the loose and splintered flooring.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Pipe the stiff,” exclaimed a voice which The Oskaloosa Kid recognized immediately as that of Soup Face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The Kid musta croaked him,” said another.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A laugh followed this evidently witty sally.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The guy probably lamped the swag an\u0027 died of heart failure,” suggested another.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The men were still laughing when the sound of a clanking chain echoed dismally from the cellar. Instantly silence fell upon the newcomers upon the first floor, followed by a—“Wotinel\u0027s that?” Two of the men had approached the staircase and started to ascend it. Slowly the uncanny clanking drew closer to the first floor. The girl on the bed turned toward Bridge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is it?” she gasped.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We don\u0027t know,” replied the man. “It followed us up here, or rather it chased us up; and then went down again just before you regained consciousness. I imagine we shall hear some interesting developments from below.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s The Sky Pilot and his gang,” whispered The Oskaloosa Kid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s The Oskaloosa Kid,” came a voice from below.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But wot was that light upstairs then?” queried another.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “An\u0027 wot croaked this guy here?” asked a third. “It wasn\u0027t nothin\u0027 nice—did you get the expression on his mug an\u0027 the red foam on his lips? I tell youse there\u0027s something in this house beside human bein\u0027s. I know the joint—it\u0027s hanted—they\u0027s spooks in it. Gawd! there it is now,” as the clanking rose to the head of the cellar stairs; and those above heard a sudden rush of footsteps as the men broke for the open air—all but the two upon the stairway. They had remained too long and now, their retreat cut off, they scrambled, cursing and screaming, to the second floor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Along the hallway they rushed to the closed door at the end—the door of the room in which the three listened breathlessly—hurling themselves against it in violent effort to gain admission.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who are you and what do you want?” cried Bridge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let us in! Let us in!” screamed two voices. “Fer God\u0027s sake let us in. Can\u0027t you hear IT? It\u0027ll be comin\u0027 up here in a minute.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sound of the dragging chain could be heard at intervals upon the floor below. It seemed to the tense listeners above to pause beside the dead man as though hovering in gloating exultation above its gruesome prey and then it moved again, this time toward the stairway where they all heard it ascending with a creepy slowness which wrought more terribly upon tense nerves than would a sudden rush.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The mills of the Gods grind slowly,” quoted Bridge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, don\u0027t!” pleaded The Oskaloosa Kid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let us in,” screamed the men without. “Fer the luv o\u0027 Mike have a heart! Don\u0027t leave us out here! IT\u0027s comin\u0027! IT\u0027s comin\u0027!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, let the poor things in,” pleaded the girl on the bed. She was, herself, trembling with terror.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No funny business, now, if I let you in,” commanded Bridge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “On the square,” came the quick and earnest reply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The THING had reached the head of the stairs when Bridge dragged the bed aside and drew the bolt. Instantly two figures hurled themselves into the room but turned immediately to help Bridge resecure the doorway.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just as it had done before, when Bridge and The Oskaloosa Kid had taken refuge there with the girl, the THING moved down the hallway to the closed door. The dragging chain marked each foot of its advance. If it made other sounds they were drowned by the clanking of the links over the time roughened flooring.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Within the room the five were frozen into utter silence, and beyond the door an equal quiet prevailed for a long minute; then a great force made the door creak and a weird scratching sounded high up upon the old fashioned panelling. Bridge heard a smothered gasp from the boy beside him, followed instantly by a flash of flame and the crack of a small caliber automatic; The Oskaloosa Kid had fired through the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bridge seized the boy\u0027s arm and wrenched the weapon from him. “Be careful!” he cried. “You\u0027ll hurt someone. You didn\u0027t miss the girl much that time—she\u0027s on the bed right in front of the door.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Oskaloosa Kid pressed closer to the man as though he sought protection from the unknown menace without. The girl sprang from the bed and crossed to the opposite side of the room. A flash of lightning illuminated the chamber for an instant and the roof of the verandah without. The girl noted the latter and the open window.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Look!” she cried. “Suppose it went out of another window upon this porch. It could get us so easily that way!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shut up, you fool!” whispered one of the two newcomers. “It might hear you.” The girl subsided into silence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was no sound from the hallway.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I reckon you croaked IT,” suggested the second newcomer, hopefully; but, as though the THING without had heard and understood, the clanking of the chain recommenced at once; but now it was retreating along the hallway, and soon they heard it descending the stairs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sighs of relief escaped more than a single pair of lips. “IT didn\u0027t hear me,” whispered the girl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bridge laughed. “We\u0027re a nice lot of babies seeing things at night,” he scoffed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you\u0027re so nervy why don\u0027t you go down an\u0027 see wot it is?” asked one of the late arrivals.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I believe I shall,” replied Bridge and pulled the bed away from the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Instantly a chorus of protests arose, the girl and The Oskaloosa Kid being most insistent. What was the use? What good could he accomplish? It might be nothing; yet on the other hand what had brought death so horribly to the cold clay on the floor below? At last their pleas prevailed and Bridge replaced the bed before the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For two hours the five sat about the room waiting for daylight. There could be no sleep for any of them. Occasionally they spoke, usually advancing and refuting suggestions as to the identity of the nocturnal prowler below-stairs. The THING seemed to have retreated again to the cellar, leaving the upper floor to the five strangely assorted prisoners and the first floor to the dead man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n During the brief intervals of conversation the girl repeated snatches of her story and once she mentioned The Oskaloosa Kid as the murderer of the unnamed victim. The two men who had come last pricked up their ears at this and Bridge felt the boy\u0027s hand just touch his arm as though in mute appeal for belief and protection. The man half smiled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We seen The Oskaloosa Kid this evenin\u0027,” volunteered one of the newcomers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You did?” exclaimed the girl. “Where?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He\u0027d just pulled off a job in Oakdale an\u0027 had his pockets bulgin\u0027 wid sparklers an\u0027 kale. We was follerin\u0027 him an\u0027 when we seen your light up here we t\u0027ought it was him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Oskaloosa Kid shrank closer to Bridge. At last he recognized the voice of the speaker. While he had known that the two were of The Sky Pilot\u0027s band he had not been sure of the identity of either; but now it was borne in upon him that at least one of them was the last person on earth he cared to be cooped up in a small, unlighted room with, and a moment later when one of the two rolled a \u0027smoke\u0027 and lighted it he saw in the flare of the flame the features of both Dopey Charlie and The General. The Oskaloosa Kid gasped once more for the thousandth time that night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It had been Dopey Charlie who lighted the cigaret and in the brief illumination his friend The General had grasped the opportunity to scan the features of the other members of the party. Schooled by long years of repression he betrayed none of the surprise or elation he felt when he recognized the features of The Oskaloosa Kid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If The General was elated The Oskaloosa Kid was at once relieved and terrified. Relieved by ocular proof that he was not a murderer and terrified by the immediate presence of the two who had sought his life.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His cigaret drawing well Dopey Charlie resumed: “This Oskaloosa Kid\u0027s a bad actor,” he volunteered. “The little shrimp tried to croak me; but he only creased my ribs. I\u0027d like to lay my mits on him. I\u0027ll bet there won\u0027t be no more Oskaloosa Kid when I get done wit him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The boy drew Bridge\u0027s ear down toward his own lips. “Let\u0027s go,” he said. “I don\u0027t hear anything more downstairs, or maybe we could get out on this roof and slide down the porch pillars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bridge laid a strong, warm hand on the small, cold one of his new friend.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t worry, Kid,” he said. “I\u0027m for you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two other men turned quickly in the direction of the speaker.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is de Kid here?” asked Dopey Charlie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is, my degenerate friend,” replied Bridge; “and furthermore he\u0027s going to stay here and be perfectly safe. Do you grasp me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who are you?” asked The General.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is a long story,” replied Bridge; “but if you chance to recall Dink and Crumb you may also be able to visualize one Billy Burke and Billy Byrne and his side partner, Bridge. Yes? Well, I am the side partner.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before the yeggman could make reply the girl spoke up quickly. “This man cannot be The Oskaloosa Kid,” she said. “It was The Oskaloosa Kid who threw me from the car.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How do you know he ain\u0027t?” queried The General. “Youse was knocked out when these guys picks you up. It\u0027s so dark in here you couldn\u0027t reco\u0027nize no one. How do you know this here bird ain\u0027t The Oskaloosa Kid, eh?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have heard both these men speak,” replied the girl; “their voices were not those of any men I have known. If one of them is The Oskaloosa Kid then there must be two men called that. Strike a match and you will see that you are mistaken.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The General fumbled in an inside pocket for a package of matches carefully wrapped against possible damage by rain. Presently he struck one and held the light in the direction of The Kid\u0027s face while he and the girl and Dopey Charlie leaned forward to scrutinize the youth\u0027s features.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s him all right,” said Dopey Charlie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You bet it is,” seconded The General.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why he\u0027s only a boy,” ejaculated the girl. “The one who threw me from the machine was a man.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, this one said he was The Oskaloosa Kid,” persisted The General.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “An\u0027 he shot me up,” growled Dopey Charlie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s too bad he didn\u0027t kill you,” remarked Bridge pleasantly. “You\u0027re a thief and probably a murderer into the bargain—you tried to kill this boy just before he shot you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well wot\u0027s he?” demanded Dopey Charlie. “He\u0027s a thief—he said he was—look in his pockets—they\u0027re crammed wid swag, an\u0027 he\u0027s a gun-man, too, or he wouldn\u0027t be packin\u0027 a gat. I guess he ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 on me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The darkness hid the scarlet flush which mounted to the boy\u0027s cheeks—so hot that he thought it must surely glow redly through the night. He waited in dumb misery for Bridge to demand the proof of his guilt. Earlier in the evening he had flaunted the evidence of his crime in the faces of the six hobos; but now he suddenly felt a great shame that his new found friend should believe him a house-breaker.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Bridge did not ask for any substantiation of Charlie\u0027s charges, he merely warned the two yeggmen that they would have to leave the boy alone and in the morning, when the storm had passed and daylight had lessened the unknown danger which lurked below-stairs, betake themselves upon their way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And while we\u0027re here together in this room you two must sit over near the window,” he concluded. “You\u0027ve tried to kill the boy once to-night; but you\u0027re not going to try it again—I\u0027m taking care of him now.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You gotta crust, bo,” observed Dopey Charlie, belligerently. “I guess me an\u0027 The General\u0027ll sit where we damn please, an\u0027 youse can take it from me on the side that we\u0027re goin\u0027 to have ours out of The Kid\u0027s haul. If you tink you\u0027re goin\u0027 to cop the whole cheese you got another tink comin\u0027.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are banking,” replied Bridge, “on the well known fact that I never carry a gun; but you fail to perceive, owing to the Stygian gloom which surrounds us, that I have the Kid\u0027s automatic in my gun hand and that the business end of it is carefully aiming in your direction.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Cheese it,” The General advised his companion; and the two removed themselves to the opposite side of the apartment, where they whispered, grumblingly, to one another.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2928/80500.html","bookId":17,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:24:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:24:20 AM"}
