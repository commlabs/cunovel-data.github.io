For a while, there was silence, no jolting, which meant the spaceships were fighting at astronomical distance in a duel of energy blasts and powerful force-field defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that could have only one end. Their Earth ship was only an armed merchantman and his glimpse of the Kloro enemy just before he had been cleared off deck by the crew was sufficient to show it to be a light cruiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in less than half an hour, there came those hard little shocks he was waiting for. The passengers swayed back and forth as the ship pitched and veered, as though it were an ocean liner in a storm. But space was calm and silent as ever. It was their pilot sending desperate bursts of steam through the steam-tubes, so that by reaction the ship would be sent rolling and tumbling. It could only mean that the inevitable had occurred. The Earth ship\u0027s screens had been drained and it no longer dared withstand a direct hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Windham tried to steady himself with his aluminum cane. He was thinking that he was an old man; that he had spent his life in the militia and had never seen a battle; that now, with a battle going on around him, he was old and fat and lame and had no men under his command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would be boarding soon, those Kloro monsters. It was their way of fighting. They would be handicapped by spacesuits and their casualties would be high, but they wanted the Earth ship. Windham considered the passengers. For a moment, he thought, if they were armed and I could lead them-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe abandoned the thought. Porter was in an obvious state of funk and the young boy, Leblanc, was hardly better. The Polyorketes brothers-dash it, he couldn \u0027t tell them apart-huddled in a corner speaking only to one another. Mullen was a different matter. He sat perfectly erect, with no signs of fear or any other emotion in his face. But the man was just about five feet tall and had undoubtedly never held a gun of any sort in his hands in all his life. He could do nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was Stuart, with his frozen half-smile and the high-pitched sarcasm which saturated all he said. Windham looked sidelong at Stuart now as Stuart sat there, pushing his dead-white hands through his sandy hair. With those artificial hands he was useless, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham felt the shuddering vibration of ship-to-ship contact; and in five minutes, there was the noise of the fight through the corridors. One of the Polyorketes brothers screamed and dashed for the door. The other called, \"Aristides! Wait!\" and hurried after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happened so quickly. Aristides was out the door and into the corridor, running in brainless panic. A carbonizer glowed briefly and there was never even a scream. Windham, from the doorway, turned in horror at the blackened stump of what was left. Strange-a lifetime in uniform and he had never before seen a man killed in violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took the combined force of the rest to carry the other brother back struggling into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise of battle subsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"That\u0027s it. They\u0027ll put a prize crew of two aboard and take us to one of their home planets. We\u0027re prisoners of war, naturally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only two of the Kloros will stay aboard?\" asked Windham, astonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"It is their custom. Why do you ask, Colonel? Thinking of leading a gallant raid to retake the ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham flushed. \"Simply a point of information, dash it.\" But the dignity and tone of authority he tried to assume failed him, he knew. He was simply an old man with a limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Stuart was probably right. He had lived among the Kloros and knew their ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Stuart had claimed from the beginning that the Kloros were gentlemen. Twenty-four hours of imprisonment had passed, and now he repeated the statement as he flexed the fingers of his hands and watched the crinkles come and go in the soft artiplasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe enjoyed the unpleasant reaction it aroused in the others. People were made to be punctured; windy bladders, all of them. And they had hands of the same stuff as their bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was Anthony Windham, in particular. Colonel Windham, he called himself, and Stuart was willing to believe it. A retired colonel who had probably drilled a home guard militia on a village green, forty years ago, with such lack of distinction that he was not called back to service in any capacity, even during the emergency of Earth\u0027s first interstellar war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dashed unpleasant thing to be saying about the enemy, Stuart. Don\u0027t know that I like your attitude.\" Windham seemed to push the words through his clipped mustache. His head had been shaven, too, in imitation of the current military style, but now a gray stubble was beginning to show about a centered bald patch. His flabby cheeks dragged downward. That and the fine red lines on his thick nose gave him a somewhat undone appearance, as though he had been wakened too suddenly and too early in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"Nonsense. Just reverse the present situation. Suppose an Earth warship had taken a Kloro liner. What do you think would have happened to any Kloro civilians aboard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure the Earth fleet would observe all the interstellar rules of war,\" Windham said stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except that there aren\u0027t any. If we landed a prize crew on one of their ships, do you think we\u0027d take the trouble to maintain a chlorine atmosphere for the benefit of the survivors; allow them to keep their non-contraband possessions; give them the use of the most comfortable stateroom, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen Porter said, \"Oh, shut up, for God\u0027s sake. If I hear your etcetera, etcetera once again, I\u0027ll go nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"Sorry!\" He wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter was scarcely responsible. His thin face and beaky nose glistened with perspiration, and he kept biting the inside of his cheek until he suddenly winced. He put his tongue against the sore spot, which made him look even more clownish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart was growing weary of baiting them. Windham was too flabby a target and Porter could do nothing but writhe. The rest were silent. Deme-trios Polyorketes was off in a world of silent internal grief for the moment. He had not slept the night before, most probably. At least, whenever Stuart woke to change his position-he himself had been rather restless-there had been Poryorketes\u0027 thick mumble from the next cot. It said many things, but the moan to which it returned over and over again was, \"Oh, my brother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat dumbly on his cot now, his red eyes rolling at the other prisoners out of his broad swarthy, unshaven face. As Stuart watched, his face sank into calloused palms so that only his mop of crisp and curly black hair could be seen. He rocked gently, but now that they were all awake, he made no sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaude Leblanc was trying very unsuccessfully, to read a letter. He was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe youngest of the six, scarcely out of college, returning to Earth to get married. Stuart had found him that morning weeping quietly, his pink and white face flushed and blotched as though it were a heartbroken child\u0027s. He was very fair, with almost a girl\u0027s beauty about his large blue eyes and full lips. Stuart wondered what kind of girl it was who had promised to be his wife. He had seen her picture. Who on the ship had not? She had the characterless prettiness that makes all pictures of fiancees indistinguishable. It seemed to Stuart that if he were a girl, however, he would want someone a little more pronouncedly masculine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat left only Randolph Mullen. Stuart frankly did not have the least idea what to make of him. He was the only one of the six that had been on the Arcturian worlds for any length of time. Stuart, himself, for instance, had been there only long enough to give a series of lectures on astronautical engineering at the provincial engineering institute. Colonel Windham had been on a Cook\u0027s tour; Porter was trying to buy concentrated alien vegetables for his canneries on Earth; and the Polyorketes brothers had attempted to establish themselves in Arcturus as truck farmers and, after two growing seasons, gave it up, had somehow unloaded at a profit, and were returning to Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandolph Mullen, however, had been in the Arcturian system for seventeen years. How did voyagers discover so much about one another so quickly? As far as Stuart knew, the little man had scarcely spoken aboard ship. He was unfailingly polite, always stepped to one side to allow another to pass, but his entire vocabulary appeared to consist only of \"Thank you\" and \"Pardon me.\" Yet the word had gone around that this was his first trip to Earth in seventeen yeais.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a little man, very precise, almost irritatingly so. Upon awaking that morning, he had made his cot neatly, shaved, bathed and dressed. The habit of years seemed not in the least disturbed by the fact that he was a prisoner of the Kloros now. He was unobtrusive about it, it had to be admitted, and gave no impression of disapproving of the sloppiness of the others. He simply sat there, almost apologetic, trussed in his overconserva-tive clothing, and hands loosely clasped in his lap. The thin line of hair on his upper lip, far from adding character to his face, absurdly increased its primness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like someone\u0027s idea of a caricature of a bookkeeper. And the queer thing about it all, Stuart thought, was that that was exactly what he was. He had noticed it on the registry-Randolph Fluellen Mullen; occupation, bookkeeper; employers, Prime Paper Box Co.; 27 Tobias Avenue, New Warsaw, Arcturus II.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Stuart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart looked up. It was Leblanc, his lower lip trembling slightly. Stuart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etried to remember how one went about being gentle. He said, \"What is it, Leblanc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, when will they let us go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How should I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone says you lived on a Kloro planet, and just now you said they were gentlemen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes. But even gentlemen fight wars in order to win. Probably, we\u0027ll be interned for the duration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that could be years! Margaret is waiting. She\u0027ll think I\u0027m dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose they\u0027ll allow messages to be sent through once we\u0027re on their planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter\u0027s hoarse voice sounded in agitation. \"Look here, if you know so much about these devils, what will they do to us while we\u0027re interned? What will they feed us? Where will they get oxygen for us? They\u0027ll kill us, I tell you.\" And as an afterthought, \"I\u0027ve got a wife waiting for me, too,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Stuart had heard him speaking of his wife in the days before the attack. He wasn\u0027t impressed. Porter\u0027s nail-bitten fingers were pulling and plucking at Stuart\u0027s sleeve. Stuart drew away in sharp revulsion. He couldn\u0027t stand those ugly hands. It angered him to desperation that such monstrosities should be real while his own white and perfectly shaped hands were only mocking imitations grown out of an alien latex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"They won\u0027t kill us. If they were going to, they would have done it before now. Look, we capture Kloros too, you know, and it\u0027s just a matter of common sense to treat your prisoners decently if you want the other side to be decent to your men. They\u0027ll do their best. The food may not be very good, but they\u0027re better chemists than we are. It\u0027s what they\u0027re best at. They\u0027ll know exactly what food factors we\u0027ll need and how many calories. We\u0027ll live. They\u0027ll see to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham rumbled, \"You sound more and more like a blasted greenie sympathizer, Stuart. It turns my stomach to hear an Earthman speak well of the green fellas the way you\u0027ve been doing. Burn it, man, where\u0027s your loyalty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My loyalty\u0027s where it belongs. With honesty and decency, regardless of the shape of the being it appears in.\" Stuart held up his hands. \"See these? Kloros made them. I lived on one of their planets for six months. My hands were mangled in the conditioning machinery of my own quarters. I thought the oxygen supply they gave me was a little poor-it wasn\u0027t, by the way- and I tried making the adjustments on my own. It was my fault. You should never trust yourself with the machines of another culture. By the time someone among the Kloros could put on an atmosphere suit and get to me, it was too late to save my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They grew these artiplasm things for me and operated. You know what that meant? It meant designing equipment and nutrient solutions that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould work in oxygen atmosphere. It meant that their surgeons had to perform a delicate operation while dressed in atmosphere suits. And now I\u0027ve got hands again.\" He laughed harshly, and clenched them into weak fists. \"Hands-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham said, \"And you\u0027d sell your loyalty to Earth for that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sell my loyalty? You\u0027re mad. For years, I hated the Kloros for this. I was a master pilot on the Trans-Galactic Spacelines before it happened. Now? Desk job. Or an occasional lecture. It took me a long time to pin the fault on myself and to realize that the only role played by the Kloros was a decent one. They have their code of ethics, and it\u0027s as good as ours. If it weren\u0027t for the stupidity of some of their people-and, by God, of some of ours-we wouldn\u0027t be at war. And after it\u0027s over-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes was on his feet. His thick fingers curved inward before him and his dark eyes glittered. \"I don\u0027t like what you say, mister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you talk too nice about these damned green bastards. The Kloros were good to you, eh? Well, they weren\u0027t good to my brother. They killed him. I think maybe I kill you, you damned greenie spy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart barely had time to raise his arms to meet the infuriated farmer. He gasped out, \"What the hell-\" as he caught one wrist and heaved a shoulder to block the other which groped toward his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis artiplasm hand gave way. Polyorketes wrenched free with scarcely an effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham was bellowing incoherently, and Leblanc was calling out in his reedy voice, \"Stop it! Stop it!\" But it was little Mulkn who threw his arms about the farmer\u0027s neck from behind and pulled with all his might. He was not very effective; Polyorketes seemed scarcely aware of the little man\u0027s weight upon his back. Mullen\u0027s feet left the floor so that he tossed helplessly to right and left. But he held his grip and it hampered Polyorketes sufficiently to allow Stuart to break free long enough to grasp Windham\u0027s aluminum cane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Stay away, Polyorketes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was gasping for breath and fearful of another rush. The hollow aluminum cylinder was scarcely heavy enough to accomplish much, but it was better than having only his weak hands to defend himself with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen had loosed his hold and was now circling cautiously, his breathing roughened and his jacket in disarray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes, for a moment, did not move. He stood there, his shaggy head bent low. Then he said, \"It is no use. I must kill Kloros. Just watch your tongue, Stuart. If it keeps on rattling too much, you\u0027re liable to get hurt. Really hurt, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart passed a forearm over his forehead and thrust the cane back at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham, who seized it with his left hand, while mopping his bald pate vigorously with a handkerchief in his right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham said, \"Gentlemen, we must avoid this. It lowers our prestige. We must remember the common enemy. We are Earthmen and we must act what we are-the ruling race of the Galaxy. We dare not demean ourselves before the lesser breeds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Colonel,\" said Stuart, wearily. \"Give us the rest of the speech tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Mullen, \"I want to say thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was uncomfortable about it, but he had to. The little accountant had surprised him completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mullen said, in a dry voice that scarcely raised above a whisper, \"Don\u0027t thank me, Mr. Stuart. It was the logical thing to do. If we are to be interned, we would need you as an interpreter, perhaps, one who would understand the Kloros.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart stiffened. It was, he thought, too much of the bookkeeper type of reasoning, too logical, too dry of juice. Present risk and ultimate advantage. The assets and debits balanced neatly. He would have liked Mullen to leap to his defense out of-well, out of what? Out of pure, unselfish decency?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart laughed silently at himself. He was beginning to expect idealism of human beings, rather than good, straight-forward, self-centered motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes was numb. His sorrow and rage were like acid inside him, but they had no words to get out. If he were Stuart, big-mouth, white-hands Stuart, he could talk and talk and maybe feel better. Instead, he had to sit there with half of him dead; with no brother, no Aristides-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had happened so quickly. If he could only go back and have one second more warning, so that he might snatch Aristides, hold him, save him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut mostly he hated the Kloros. Two months ago, he had hardly ever heard of them, and now he hated them so hard, he would be glad to die if he could kill a few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, without looking up, \"What happened to start this war, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was afraid Stuart\u0027s voice would answer. He hated Stuart\u0027s voice. But it was Windham, the bald one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham said, \"The immediate cause, sir, was a dispute over mining concessions in the Wyandotte system. The Kloros had poached on Earth property.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Room for both, Colonel!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes looked up at that, snarling. Stuart could not be kept quiet for long. He was speaking again; the cripple-hand, wiseguy, Kloros-lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart was saying, \"Is that anything to fight over, Colonel? We can\u0027t use one another\u0027s worlds. Their chlorine planets are useless to us and our oxygen ones are useless to them. Chlorine is deadly to us and oxygen is deadly to them. There\u0027s no way we could maintain permanent hostility. Our races just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t coincide. Is there reason to fight then because both races want to dig iron out of the same airless planetoids when there are millions like them in the Galaxy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham said, \"There is the question of planetary honor-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Planetary fertilizer. How can it excuse a ridiculous war like this one? It can only be fought on outposts. It has to come down to a series of holding actions and eventually be settled by negotiations that might just as easily have been worked out in the first place. Neither we nor the Kloros will gain a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrudgingly, Polyorketes found that he agreed with Stuart. What did he and Aristides care where Earth or the Kloros got their iron?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that something for Aristides to die over?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little warning buzzer sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes\u0027 head shot up and he rose slowly, his lips drawing back. Only one thing could be at the door. He waited, arms tense, fists balled. Stuart was edging toward him. Polyorketes saw that and laughed to himself. Let the Kloro come in, and Stuart, along with all the rest, could not stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, Aristides, wait just a moment, and a fraction of revenge will be paid back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and a figure entered, completely swathed in a shapeless, billowing travesty of a spacesuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn odd, unnatural, but not entirely unpleasant voice began, \"It is with some misgivings, Earthmen, that my companion and myself-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt ended abruptly as Polyorketes, with a roar, charged once again. There was no science in the lunge. It was sheer bull-momentum. Dark head low, burly arms spread out with the hair-tufted fingers in choking position, he clumped on. Stuart was whirled to one side before he had a chance to intervene, and was spun tumbling across a cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kloro might have, without undue exertion, straight-armed Polyorketes to a halt, or stepped aside, allowing the whirlwind to pass. He did neither. With a rapid movement, a hand-weapon was up and a gentle pinkish line of radiance connected it with the plunging Earthman. Polyorketes stumbled and crashed down, his body maintaining its last curved position, one foot raised, as though a lightning paralysis had taken place. It toppled to one side and he lay there, eyes all alive and wild with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kloro said, \"He is not permanently hurt.\" He seemed not to resent the offered violence. Then he began again, \"It is with some misgiving, Earthmen, that my companion and myself were made aware of a certain commotion in this room. Are you in any need which we can satisfy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart was angrily nursing his knee which he had scraped in colliding with the cot. He said, \"No, thank you, Kloro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, look here,\" puffed Windham, \"this is a dashed outrage. We demand that our release be arranged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kloro\u0027s tiny, insectlike head turned in the fat old man\u0027s direction. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas not a pleasant sight to anyone unused to him. He was about the height of an Earthman, but the top of him consisted of a thin stalk of a neck with a head that was the merest swelling. It consisted of a blunt triangular proboscis in front and two bulging eyes on either side. That was all. There was no brain pan and no brain. What corresponded to the brain in a Kloro was located in what would be an Earthly abdomen, leaving the head as a mere sensory organ. The Kloro\u0027s spacesuit followed the outlines of the head more or less faithfully, the two eyes being exposed by two clear semicircles of glass, which looked faintly green because of the chlorine atmosphere inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the eyes was now cocked squarely at Windham, who quivered uncomfortably under the glance, but insisted, \"You have no right to hold us prisoner. We are noncombatants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kloro\u0027s voice, sounding thoroughly artificial, came from a small attachment of chromium mesh on what served as its chest. The voice box was manipulated by compressed air under the control of one or two of the many delicate, forked tendrils that radiated from two circles about its upper body and were, mercifully enough, hidden by the suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice said, \"Are you serious, Earthman? Surely you have heard of war and rules of war and prisoners of war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked about, shifting eyes with quick jerks of its head, staring at a particular object first with one, then with another. It was Stuart\u0027s understanding that each eye transferred a separate message to the abdominal brain, which had to coordinate the two to obtain full information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham had nothing to say. No one had. The Kloro, its four main limbs, roughly arms and legs in pairs, had a vaguely human appearance under the masking of the suit, if you looked no higher than its chest, but there was no way of telling what it felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched it turn and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter coughed and said in a strangled voice, \"God, smell that chlorine. If they don\u0027t do something, we\u0027ll all die of rotted lungs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"Shut up. There isn\u0027t enough chlorine in the air to make a mosquito sneeze, and what there is will be swept out in two minutes. Besides, a little chlorine is good for you. It may kill your cold virus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham coughed and said, \"Stuart, I feel that you might have said something to your Kloro friend about releasing us. You are scarcely as bold in their presence, dash it, as you are once they are gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard what the creature said, Colonel. We\u0027re prisoners of war, and prisoner exchanges are negotiated by diplomats. We\u0027ll just have to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc, who had turned pasty white at the entrance of the Kloro, rose and hurried into the privy. There was the sound of retching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn uncomfortable silence fell while Stuart tried to think of something to say to cover the unpleasant sound. Mullen filled in. He had rummaged through a little box he had taken from under his pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Perhaps Mr. Leblanc had better take a sedative before retiring. I have a few. I\u0027d be glad to give him one.\" He explained his generosity immediately, \"Otherwise he may keep the rest of us awake, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very logical,\" said Stuart, dryly. \"You\u0027d better save one for Sir Launcelot here; save half a dozen.\" He walked to where Polyorketes still sprawled and knelt at his side. \"Comfortable, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham said, \"Deuced poor taste speaking like that, Stuart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you\u0027re so concerned about him, why don\u0027t you and Porter hoist him onto his cot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped them do so. Polyorketes\u0027 arms were trembling erratically now. From what Stuart knew of the Kloro\u0027s nerve weapons, the man should be in an agony of pins and needles about now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"And don\u0027t be too gentle with him, either. The damned fool might have gotten us all killed. And for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed Polyorketes\u0027 stiff carcass to one side and sat at the edge of the cot. He said, \"Can you hear me, Polyorketes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes\u0027 eyes gleamed. An arm lifted abortively and fell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay then, listen. Don\u0027t try anything like that again. The next time it may be the finish for all of us. If you had been a Kloro and he had been an Earthman, we\u0027d be dead now. So just get one thing through your skull. We\u0027re sorry about your brother and it\u0027s a rotten shame, but it was his own fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes tried to heave and Stuart pushed him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you keep on listening,\" he said. \"Maybe this is the only time I\u0027ll get to talk to you when you have to listen. Your brother had no right leaving passenger\u0027s quarters. There was no place for him to go. He just got in the way of our own men. We don\u0027t even know for certain that it was a Kloro gun that killed him. It might have been one of our own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I say, Stuart,\" objected Windham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart whirled at him. \"Do you have proof it wasn\u0027t? Did you see the shot? Could you tell from what was left of the body whether it was Kloro energy or Earth energy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes found his voice, driving his unwilling tongue into a fuzzy verbal snarl. \"Damned stinking greenie bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" said Stuart. \"I know what\u0027s going on in your mind, Polyorketes. You think that1 when the paralysis wears off, you\u0027ll ease your feelings by slamming me around. Well, if you do, it will probably be curtains for all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose, put his back against the wall. For the moment, he was fighting all of them. \"None of you know the Kloros the way I do. The physical differences you see are not important. The differences in their temperament are. They don\u0027t understand our views on sex, for instance. To them, it\u0027s just a biological reflex like breathing. They attach no importance to it. But they do attach importance to social groupings. Remember, their evolutionary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eancestors had lots in common with our insects. They always assume that any group of Earthmen they find together makes up a social unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That means just about everything to them. I don\u0027t understand exactly what it means. No Earthman can. But the result is that they never break up a group, just as we don\u0027t separate a mother and her children if we can help it. One of the reasons they may be treating us with kid gloves right now is that they imagine we\u0027re all broken up over the fact that they killed one of us, and they feel guilt about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is what you\u0027ll have to remember. We\u0027re going to be interned together and kept together for duration. I don\u0027t like the thought. I wouldn\u0027t have picked any of you for co-internees and I\u0027m pretty sure none of you would have picked me. But there it is. The Kloros could never understand that our being together on the ship is only accidental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That means we\u0027ve got to get along somehow. That\u0027s not just goodie-goodie talk about birds in their little nest agreeing. What do you think would have happened if the Kloros had come in earlier and found Poly-orketes and myself trying to kill each other? You don\u0027t know? Well, what do you suppose you would think of a mother you caught trying to kill her children?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, then. They would have killed every one of us as a bunch of Kloro-type perverts and monsters. Got that? How about you, Polyorketes? Have you got it? So let\u0027s call names if we have to, but let\u0027s keep our hands to ourselves. And now, if none of you mind, I\u0027ll massage my hands back into shape-these synthetic hands that I got from the Kloros and that one of my own kind tried to mangle again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Claude Leblanc, the worst was over. He had been sick enough; sick with many things; but sick most of all over having ever left Earth. It had been a great thing to go to college off Earth. It had been an adventure and had taken him away from his mother. Somehow, he had been sneakingly glad to make that escape after the first month of frightened adjustment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then on the summer holidays, he had been no longer Claude, the shy-spoken scholar, but Leblanc, space traveler. He had swaggered the fact for all it was worth. It made him feel such a man to talk of stars and Jumps and the customs and environments of other worlds; it had given him corkage with Margaret. She had loved him for the dangers he had undergone-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that this had been the first one, really, and he had not done so well. He knew it and was ashamed and wished he were like Stuart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used the excuse of mealtime to approach. He said, \"Mr. Stuart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart looked up and said shortly, \"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc felt himself blush. He blushed easily and the effort not to blush only made it worse. He said, \"Much better, thank you. We are eating. I thought I\u0027d bring you your ration,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart took the offered can, It was standard space ration; thoroughly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esynthetic, concentrated, nourishing and, somehow, unsatisfying. It heated automatically when the can was opened, but could be eaten cold, if necessary. Though a combined fork-spoon utensil was enclosed, the ration was of a consistency that made the use of fingers practical and not particularly messy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"Did you hear my little speech?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. I want you to know you can count on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, good. Now go and eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I eat here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suit yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, they ate in silence, and then Leblanc burst out, \"You are so sure of yourself, Mr. Stuart! It must be very wonderful to be like that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure of myself? Thanks, but there\u0027s your self-assured one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc followed the direction of the nod in surprise. \"Mr. Mullen? That little man? Oh, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think he\u0027s self-assured?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc shook his head. He looked at Stuart intently to see if he could detect humor in his expression. \"That one is just cold. He has no emotion in him. He\u0027s like a little machine. I find him repulsive. You\u0027re different, Mr. Stuart. You have it all inside, but you control it. I would like to be like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as though attracted by the magnetism of the mention, even though unheard, of his name, Mullen joined them. His can of ration was barely touched. It was still steaming gently as he squatted opposite them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice had its usual quality of furtively rustling underbrush. \"How long, Mr. Stuart, do you think the trip will take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t say, Mullen. They\u0027ll undoubtedly be avoiding the usual trade routes and they\u0027ll be making more Jumps through hyper-space than usual to throw off possible pursuit. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it took as long as a week. Why do you ask? I presume you have a very practical and logical reason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, yes. Certainly.\" He seemed quite shellbacked to sarcasm. He said, \"It occurred to me that it might be wise to ration the rations, so to speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got enough food and water for a month. I checked on that first thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. In that case, I will finish the can.\" He did, using the all-purpose utensil daintily and patting a handkerchief against his unstained lips from time to time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes struggled to his feet some two hours later. He swayed a bit, looking like the Spirit of Hangover. He did not try to come closer to Stuart, but spoke from where he stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You stinking greenie spy, you watch yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard what I said before, Polyorketes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard. But I also heard what you said about Aristides. I won\u0027t bother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith you, because you\u0027re a bag of nothing but noisy air. But wait, someday you\u0027ll blow your air in one face too many and it will be let out of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait,\" said Stuart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham hobbled over, leaning heavily on his cane. \"Now, now,\" he called with a wheezing joviality that overkid his sweating anxiety so thinly as to emphasize it. \"We\u0027re all Earthmen, dash it. Got to remember that; keep it as a glowing light of inspiration. Never let down before the blasted Kloros. We\u0027ve got to forget private feuds and remember only that we are Earthmen united against alien blighters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart\u0027s comment was unprintable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter was right behind Windham. He had been in a close conference with the shaven-headed colonel for an hour, and now he said with indignation, \"It doesn\u0027t help to be a wiseguy, Stuart. You listen to the colonel. We\u0027ve been doing some hard thinking about the situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had washed some of the grease off his face, wet his hair and slicked it back. It did not remove the little tic on his right cheek just at the point where his lips ended, or make his hangnail hands more attractive in appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Colonel,\" said Stuart. \"What\u0027s on your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham said, \"I\u0027d prefer to have all the men together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, call them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc hurried over; Mullen approached with greater deliberation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"You want that fellow?\" He jerked his head at Polyorketes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, yes. Mr. Polyorketes, may we have you, old fella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, leave me alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" said Stuart, \"leave him alone. I don\u0027t want him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" said Windham. \"This is a matter for all Earthmen. Mr. Polyorketes, we must have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes rolled off one side of his cot. \"I\u0027m close enough, I can hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham said to Stuart, \"Would they-the Kloros, I mean-have this room wired?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Stuart. \"Why should they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m sure. They didn\u0027t know what happened when Polyorketes jumped me. They just heard the thumping when it started rattling the ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they were trying to give us the impression the room wasn\u0027t wired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Colonel, I\u0027ve never known a Kloro to tell a deliberate lie-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes interrupted calmly, \"That lump of noise just loves the Kloros.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham said hastily, \"Let\u0027s not begin that. Look, Stuart, Porter and I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave been discussing matters and we have decided that you know the Kloros well enough to think of some way of getting us back to Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happens that you\u0027re wrong. I can\u0027t think of any way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe there is some way we can take the ship back from the blasted green fellas,\" suggested Windham. \"Some weakness they may have. Dash it, you know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, Colonel, what are you after? Your own skin or Earth\u0027s welfare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I resent that question. I\u0027ll have you know that while I\u0027m as careful of my own life as anyone has a right to be, I\u0027m thinking of Earth primarily. And I think that\u0027s true of all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right,\" said Porter, instantly. Leblanc looked anxious, Polyorketes resentful; and Mullen had no expression at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" said Stuart. \"Of course, I don\u0027t think we can take the ship. They\u0027re armed and we aren\u0027t. But there\u0027s this. You know why the Kloros took this ship intact. It\u0027s because they need ships. They may be better chemists than Earthmen are, but Earthmen are better astronautical engineers. We have bigger, better and more ships. In fact, if our crew had had a proper respect for military axioms in the first place, they would have blown the ship up as soon as it looked as though the Kloros were going to board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc looked horrified. \"And kill the passengers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? You heard what the good colonel said. Every one of us puts his own lousy little life after Earth\u0027s interests. What good are we to Earth alive right now? None at all. What harm will this ship do in Kloro hands? A hell of a lot, probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just why,\" asked Mullen, \"did our men refuse to blow up the ship? They must have had a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did. It\u0027s the firmest tradition of Earth\u0027s military men that there must never be an unfavorable ratio of casualties. If we had blown ourselves up, twenty fighting men and seven civilians of Earth would be dead as compared with an enemy casualty total of zero. So what happens? We let them board, kill twenty-eight-I\u0027m sure we killed at least that many-and let them have the ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk, talk, talk,\" jeered Polyorketes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a moral to this,\" said Stuart. \"We can\u0027t take the ship away from the Kloros. We might be able to rush them, though, and keep them busy long enough to allow one of us enough time to short the engines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" yelled Porter, and Windham shushed him in fright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Short the engines,\" Stuart repeated. \"That would destroy the ship, of course, which is what we want to do, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc\u0027s lips were white. \"I don\u0027t think that would work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t be sure till we try. But what have we to lose by trying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our lives, damn it!\" cried Porter. \"You insane maniac, you\u0027re crazy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m a maniac,\" said Stuart, \"and insane to boot, then naturally I\u0027m crazy. But just remember that if we lose our lives, which is overwhelmingly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprobable, we lose nothing of value to Earth; whereas if we destroy the ship, as we just barely might, we do Earth a lot of good. What patriot would hesitate? Who here would put himself ahead of his world?\" He looked about in the silence. \"Surely not you, Colonel Windham.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham coughed tremendously. \"My dear man, that is not the question. There must be a way to save the ship for Earth without losing our lives, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. You name it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s all think about it. Now there are only two of the Kloros aboard ship. If one of us could sneak up on them and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How? The rest of the ship\u0027s all filled with chlorine. We\u0027d have to wear a spacesuit. Gravity in their part of the ship is hopped up to Kloro level, so whoever is patsy in the deal would be clumping around, metal on metal, slow and heavy. Oh, he could sneak up on them, sure-like a skunk trying to sneak downwind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll drop it all,\" Porter\u0027s voice shook. \"Listen, Windham, there\u0027s not going to be any destroying the ship. My life means plenty to me and if any of you try anything like that, I\u0027ll call the Kloros. I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Stuart, \"there\u0027s hero number one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc said, \"I want to go back to Earth, but I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen interrupted, \"I don\u0027t think our chances of destroying the ship are good enough unless-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heroes number two and three. What about you, Polyorketes, You would have the chance of killing two Kloros.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to kill them with my bare hands,\" growled the farmer, his heavy fists writhing. \"On their planet, I will kill dozens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a nice safe promise for now. What about you, Colonel? Don\u0027t you want to march to death and glory with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your attitude is very cynical and unbecoming, Stuart. It\u0027s obvious that if the rest are unwilling, then your plan will fall through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless I do it myself, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t, do you hear?\" said Porter, instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn right I won\u0027t,\" agreed Stuart. \"I don\u0027t claim to be a hero. I\u0027m just an average patriot, perfectly willing to head for any planet they take me to and sit out the war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen said, thoughtfully, \"Of course, there is a way we could surprise the Kloros.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statement would have dropped flat except for Polyorketes. He pointed a black-nailed, stubby forefinger and laughed harshly. \"Mr. Bookkeeper!\" he said. \"Mr. Bookkeeper is a big shot talker like this damned greenie spy, Stuart. All right, Mr. Bookkeeper, go ahead. You make big speeches also. Let the words roll like an empty barrel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Stuart and repeated venomously, \"Empty barrel! Cripple-hand empty barrel. No good for anything but talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen\u0027s soft voice could make no headway until Polyorketes was through, but then he said, speaking directly to Stuart, \"We might be able to reach them from outside. This room has a C-chute I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a C-chute?\" asked Leblanc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-\" began Mullen, and then stopped, at a loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, mockingly, \"It\u0027s a euphemism, my boy. Its full name is \u0027casualty chute.\u0027 It doesn\u0027t get talked about, but the main rooms on any ship would have them. They\u0027re just little airlocks down which you slide a corpse. Burial at space. Always lots of sentiment and bowed heads, with the captain making a rolling speech of the type Polyorketes here wouldn\u0027t like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc\u0027s face twisted. \"Use that to leave the ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Superstitious? -Go on, Mullen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little man had waited patiently. He said, \"Once outside, one could re-enter the ship by the steam-tubes. It can be done-with luck. And then you would be an unexpected visitor in the control room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart stared at him curiously. \"How do you figure this out? What do you know about steam-tubes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen coughed. \"You mean because I\u0027m in the paper-box business? Well-\" He grew pink, waited a moment, then made a new start in a colorless, unemotional voice. \"My company, which manufactures fancy paper boxes and novelty containers, made a line of spaceship candy boxes for the juvenile trade some years ago. It was designed so that if a string were pulled, small pressure containers were punctured and jets of compressed air shot out through the mock steam-tubes, sailing the box across the room and scattering candy as it went. The sales theory was that the youngsters would find it exciting to play with the ship and fun to scramble for the candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, it was a complete failure. The ship would break dishes and sometimes hit another child in the eye. Worse still, the children would not only scramble for the candy but would fight over it. It was almost our worst failure. We lost thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still, while the boxes were being designed, the entire office was extremely interested. It was like a game, very bad for efficiency and office morale. For a while, we all became steam-tube experts. I read quite a few books on ship construction. On my own time, however, not the company\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart was intrigued. He said, \"You know it\u0027s a video sort of idea, but it might work if we had a hero to spare. Have we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\" demanded Porter, indignantly. \"You go around sneering at us with your cheap wisecracks. I don\u0027t notice you volunteering for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because I\u0027m no hero, Porter. I admit it. My object is to stay alive, and shinnying down steam-tubes is no way to go about staying alive. But the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erest of you are noble patriots. The colonel says so. What about you, Colonel? You\u0027re the senior hero here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindham said, \"If I were younger, blast it, and if you had your hands, I would take pleasure, sir, in trouncing you soundly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve no doubt of it, but that\u0027s no answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know very well that at my time of life and with my leg-\" he brought the flat of his hand down upon his stiff knee- \"I am in no position to do anything of the sort, however much I should wish to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes,\" said Stuart, \"and I, myself, am crippled in the hands, as Pory-orketes tells me. That saves us. And what unfortunate deformities do the rest of us have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" cried Porter, \"I want to know what this is all about. How can anyone go down the steam-tubes? What if the Kloros use them while one of us is inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Porter, that\u0027s part of the sporting chance. It\u0027s where the excitement comes in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027d be boiled in the shell like a lobster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pretty image, but inaccurate. The steam wouldn\u0027t be on for more than a very short time, maybe a second or two, and the suit insulation would hold that long. Besides, the jet comes scooting out at several hundred miles a minute, so that you would be blown clear of the ship before the steam could even warm you. In fact, you\u0027d be blown quite a few miles out into space, and after that you would be quite safe from the Kloros. Of course, you couldn\u0027t get back to the ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter was sweating freely. \"You don\u0027t scare me for one minute, Stuart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t? Then you\u0027re offering to go? Are you sure you\u0027ve thought out what being stranded in space means? You\u0027re all alone, you know; really all alone. The steam-jet will probably leave you turning or tumbling pretty rapidly. You won\u0027t feel that. You\u0027ll seem to be motionless. But all the stars will be going around and around so that they\u0027re just streaks in the sky. They won\u0027t ever stop. They won\u0027f even slow up. Then your heater will go off, your oxygen will give out, and you will die very slowly. You\u0027ll have lots of time to think. Or, if you are in a hurry, you could open your suit. That wouldn\u0027t be pleasant, either. I\u0027ve seen faces of men who had a torn suit happen to them accidentally, and it\u0027s pretty awful. But it would be quicker. Then-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter turned and walked unsteadily away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, lightly, \"Another failure. One act of heroism still ready to be knocked down to the highest bidder with nothing offered yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes spoke up and his harsh voice roughed the words. \"You keep on talking, Mr. Big Mouth. You just keep banging that empty barrel. Pretty soon, we\u0027ll kick your teeth in. There\u0027s one boy I think would be willing to do it now, eh, Mr. Porter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter\u0027s look at Stuart confirmed the truth of Polyorketes\u0027 remarks, but he said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"Then what about you, Polyorketes? You\u0027re the barehand man with guts. Want me to help you into a suit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll ask you when I want help.\" 1 \"What about you, Leblanc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man shrank away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even to get back to Margaret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Leblanc could only shake his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mullen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-I\u0027ll try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said, yes, I\u0027ll try. After all, it\u0027s my idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart looked stunned. \"You\u0027re serious? How come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen\u0027s prim mouth pursed. \"Because no one else will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s no reason. Especially for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a thump of a cane behind Stuart. Windham brushed past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Do you really intend to go, Mullen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Colonel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, dash it, let me shake your hand. I like you. You\u0027re an-an Earthman, by heaven. Do this, and win or die, I\u0027ll bear witness for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen withdrew his hand awkwardly from the deep and vibrating grasp of the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Stuart just stood there. He was in a very unusual position. He was, in fact, in the particular position of all positions in which he most rarely found himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had nothing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quality of tension had changed. The gloom and frustration had lifted a bit, and the excitement of conspiracy had replaced it. Even Polyorketes was fingering the spacesuits and commenting briefly and hoarsely on which he considered preferable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen was having a certain amount of trouble. The suit hung rather limply upon him even though the adjustable joints had been tightened nearly to minimum. He stood there now with only the helmet to be screwed on. He wiggled his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart was holding the helmet with an effort. It was heavy, and his ar-tiplasmic hands did not grip it well. He said, \"Better scratch your nose if it itches. It\u0027s your last chance for a while.\" He didn\u0027t add, \"Maybe forever,\" but he thought it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen said, tonelessly, \"I think perhaps I had better have a spare oxygen cylinder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a reducing valve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart nodded. \"I see what you\u0027re thinking of. If you do get blown clear\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the ship, you could try to blow yourself back by using the cylinder as an action-reaction motor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey clamped on the headpiece and buckled the spare cylinder to Mul-len\u0027s waist. Polyorketes and Leblanc lifted him up to the yawning opening of the C-tube. It was ominously dark inside, the metal lining of the interior having been painted a mournful black. Stuart thought he could detect a musty odor about it, but that, he knew, was only imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped the proceedings when Mullen was half within the tube. He tapped upon the little man\u0027s faceplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin, there was a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Air coming through all right? No last-minute troubles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen lifted his armored arm in a gesture of reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then remember, don\u0027t use the suit-radio out there. The Kloros might pick up the signals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, he stepped away. Polyorketes\u0027 brawny hands lowered Mullen until they could hear the thumping sound made by the steel-shod feet against the outer valve. The inner valve then swung shut with a dreadful finality, its beveled silicone gasket making a slight soughing noise as it crushed hard. They clamped it into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart stood at the toggle-switch that controlled the outer valve. He threw it and the gauge that marked the air pressure within the tube fell to zero. A little pinpoint of red light warned that the outer valve was open. Then the light disappeared, the valve closed, and the gauge climbed slowly to fifteen pounds again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey opened the inner valve again and found the tube empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes spoke first. He said, \"The little son-of-a-gun. He went!\" He looked wonderingly at the others. \"A little fellow with guts like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"Look, we\u0027d better get ready in here. There\u0027s just a chance that the Kloros may have detected the valves opening and closing. If so, they\u0027ll be here to investigate and we\u0027ll have to cover up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" asked Windham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t see Mullen anywhere around. We\u0027ll say he\u0027s in the head. The Kloros know that it\u0027s one of the peculiar characteristics of Earthmen that they resent intrusion on their privacy in lavatories, and they\u0027ll make no effort to check. If we can hold them off-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if they wait, or if they check the spacesuits?\" asked Porter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart shrugged. \"Let\u0027s hope they don\u0027t. And listen, Polyorketes, don\u0027t make any fuss when they come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes grunted, \"With that little guy out there? What do you think I am?\" He stared at Stuart without animosity, then scratched his curly hair vigorously. \"You know, I laughed at him. I thought he was an old woman. It makes me ashamed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart cleared his throat. He said, \"Look, I\u0027ve been saying some things\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat maybe weren\u0027t too funny after all, now that I come to think of it. I\u0027d like to say I\u0027m sorry if I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away morosely and walked toward his cot. He heard the steps behind him, felt the touch on his sleeve. He turned; it was Leblanc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youngster said softly, \"I keep thinking that Mr. Mullen is an old man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027s not a kid. He\u0027s about forty-five or fifty, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeblanc said, \"Do you think, Mr. Stuart, that / should have gone, instead? I\u0027m the youngest here. I don\u0027t like the thought of having let an old man go in my place. It makes me feel like the devil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. If he dies, it will be too bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he volunteered. We didn\u0027t make him, did we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t try to dodge responsibility, Leblanc. It won\u0027t make you feel better. There isn\u0027t one of us without a stronger motive to run the risk than he had.\" And Stuart sat there silently, thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen felt the obstruction beneath his feet yield and the walls about him slip away quickly, too quickly. He knew it was the puff of air escaping, carrying him with it, and he dug arms and legs frantically against the wall to brake himself. Corpses were supposed to be flung well clear of the ship, but he was no corpse-for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis feet swung free and threshed. He heard the clunk of one magnetic boot against the hull just as the rest of his body puffed out like a tight cork under air pressure. He teetered dangerously at the lip of the hole in the ship -he had changed orientation suddenly and was looking down on it-then took a step backward as its lid came down of itself and fitted smoothly against the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA feeling of unreality overwhelmed him. Surely, it wasn\u0027t he standing on the outer surface of a ship. Not Randolph F. Mullen. So few human beings could ever say they had, even those who traveled in space constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was only gradually aware that he was in pain. Popping out of that hole with one foot clamped to the hull had nearly bent him in two. He tried moving, cautiously, and found his motions to be erratic and almost impossible to control. He thought nothing was broken, though the muscles of his left side were badly wrenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he came to himself and noticed that the wrist-lights of his suit were on. It was by their light that he had stared into the blackness of the C-chute. He stirred with the nervous thought that from within, the Kloros might see the twin spots of moving light just outside the hull. He flicked the switch upon the suit\u0027s midsection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen had never imagined that, standing on a ship, he would fail to see its hull. But it was dark, as dark below as above. There were the stars, hard and bright little non-dimensional dots. Nothing more. Nothing more anywhere. Under his feet, not even the stars-not even his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent back to look at the stars. His head swam. They were moving slowly. Or, rather, they were standing still and the ship was rotating, but he could not tell his eyes that. They moved. His eyes followed-down and behind the ship. New stars up and above from the other side. A black horizon. The ship existed only as a region where there were no stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo stars? Why, there was one almost at his feet. He nearly reached for it; then he realized that it was only a glittering reflection in the mirroring metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were moving thousands of miles an hour. The stars were. The ship was. He was. But it meant nothing. To his senses, there was only silence and darkness and that slow wheeling of the stars. His eyes followed the wheeling-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his head in its helmet hit the ship\u0027s hull with a soft bell-like ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt about in panic with his thick, insensitive, spun-silicate gloves. His feet were still firmly magnetized to the hull, that was true, but the rest of his body bent backward at the knees in a right angle. There was no gravity outside the ship. If he bent back, there was nothing to pull the upper part of his body down and tell his joints they were bending. His body stayed as he put it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed wildly against the hull and his torso shot upward and refused to stop when upright. He fell forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried more slowly, balancing with both hands against the hull, until he squatted evenly. Then upward. Very slowly. Straight up. Arms out to balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was straight now, aware of his nausea and lightheadedness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked about. My God, where were the steam-tubes? He couldn\u0027t see them. They were black on black, nothing on nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly, he turned on the wrist-lights. In space, there were no beams, only elliptical, sharply defined spots of blue steel, winking light back at him. Where they struck a rivet, a shadow was cast, knife-sharp and as black as space, the lighted region illuminated abruptly and without diffusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved his arms, his body swaying gently in the opposite direction; action and reaction. The vision of a steam-tube with its smooth cylindrical sides sprang at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to move toward it. His foot held firmly to the hull. He pulled and it slogged upward, straining against quicksand that eased quickly. Three inches up and it had almost sucked free; six inches up and he thought it would fly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe advanced it and let it down, felt it enter the quicksand. When the sole was within two inches of the hull, it snapped down; out of control, hitting the hull ringingly. His spacesuit carried the vibrations, amplifying them in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped in absolute terror. The dehydrators that dried the atmosphere\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewithin his suit could not handle the sudden gush of perspiration that drenched his forehead and armpits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, then tried lifting his foot again-a bare inch, holding it there by main force and moving it horizontally. Horizontal motion involved no effort at all; it was motion perpendicular to the lines of magnetic force. But he had to keep the foot from snapping down as he did so, and then lower it slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puffed with the effort. Each step was agony. The tendons of his knees were cracking, and there were knives in his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen stopped to let the perspiration dry. It wouldn\u0027t do to steam up the inside of his faceplate. He flashed his wrist-lights, and the steam-cylinder was right ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship had four of them, at ninety degree intervals, thrusting out at an angle from the midgirdle. They were the \"fine adjustment\" of the ship\u0027s course. The coarse adjustment was the powerful thrusters back and front which fixed final velocity by their accelerative and the decelerative force, and the hyperatomics that took care of the space-swallowing Jumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut occasionally the direction of flight had to be adjusted slightly and then the steam-cylinders took over. Singly, they could drive the ship up, down, right, left. By twos, in appropriate ratios of thrust, the ship could be turned in any desired direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe device had been unimproved in centuries, being too simple to improve. The atomic pile heated the water content of a closed container into steam, driving it, in less than a second, up to temperatures where it would have broken down into a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, and then into a mixture of electrons and ions. Perhaps the breakdown actually took place. No one ever bothered testing; it worked, so there was no need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the critical point, a needle valve gave way and the steam thrust madly out in a short but incredible blast. And the ship, inevitably and majestically, moved in the opposite direction, veering about its own center of gravity. When the degrees of turn were sufficient, an equal and opposite blast would take place and the turning would be canceled. The ship would be moving at its original velocity, but in a new direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen had dragged himself out to the lip of the steam-cylinder. He had a picture of himself-3 small speck teetering at the extreme end of a structure thrusting out of an ovoid that was tearing through space at ten thousand miles an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no air-stream to whip him off the hull, and his magnetic soles held him more firmly than he liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith lights on, he bent down to peer into the tube and the ship dropped down precipitously as his orientation changed. He reached out to steady himself, but he was not falling. There was no up or down in space except for what his confused mind chose to consider up or down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cylinder was just large enough to hold a man, so that it might be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eentered for repair purposes. His light caught the rungs almost directly opposite his position at the lip. He puffed a sigh of relief with what breath he could muster. Some ships didn\u0027t have ladders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made his way to it, the ship appearing to slip and twist beneath him as he moved. He lifted an arm over the lip of the tube, feeling for the rung, loosened each foot, and drew himself within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knot in his stomach that had been there from the first was a convulsed agony now. If they should choose to manipulate the ship, if the steam should whistle out now-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would never hear it; never know it. One instant he would be holding a rung, feeling slowly for the next with a groping arm. The next moment he would be alone in space, the ship a dark, dark nothingness lost forever among the stars. There would be, perhaps, a brief glory of swirling ice crystals drifting with him, shining in his wrist-lights and slowly approaching and rotating about him, attracted by his mass like infinitesimal planets to an absurdly tiny Sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was trickling sweat again, and now he was also conscious of thirst. He put it out of his mind. There would be no drinking until he was out of his suit-if ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp a rung; up another; and another. How many were there? His hand slipped and he stared in disbelief at the glitter that showed under his light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIce?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not? The steam, incredibly hot as it was, would strike metal that was at nearly absolute zero. In the few split-seconds of thrust, there would not be time for the metal to warm above the freezing point of water. A sheet of ice would condense that would sublime slowly into the vacuum. It was the speed of all that happened that prevented the fusion of the tubes and of the original water-container itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis groping hand reached the end. Again the wrist-lights. He stared with crawling horror at the steam nozzle, half an inch in diameter. It looked dead, harmless. But it always would, right up to the micro-second before-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround it was the outer steam lock. It pivoted on a central hub that was springed on the portion toward space, screwed on the part toward the ship. The springs allowed it to give under the first wild thrust of steam pressure before the ship\u0027s mighty inertia could be overcome. The steam was bled into the inner chamber, breaking the force of the thrust, leaving the total energy unchanged, but spreading it over time so that the hull itself was in that much less danger of being staved in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen braced himself firmly against a rung and pressed against the outer lock so that it gave a little. It was stiff, but it didn\u0027t have to give much, just enough to catch on the screw. He felt it catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strained against it and turned it, feeling his body twist in the opposite direction. It held tight, the screw taking up the strain as he carefully ad-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejusted the small control switch that allowed the springs to fall free. How well he remembered the books he had read!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in the interlock space now, which was large enough to hold a man comfortably, again for convenience in repairs. He could no longer be blown away from the ship. If the steam blast were turned on now, it would merely drive him against the inner lock-hard enough to crush him to a pulp. A quick death he would never feel, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he unhooked his spare oxygen cylinder. There was only an inner lock between himself and the control room now. This lock opened outward into space so that the steam blast could only close it tighter, rather than blow it open. And it fitted tightly and smoothly. There was absolutely no way to open it from without.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted himself above the lock, forcing his bent back against the inner surface of the interlock area. It made breathing difficult. The spare oxygen cylinder dangled at a queer angle. He held its metal-mesh hose and straightened it, forcing it against the inner lock so that vibration thudded. Again- again-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would have to attract the attention of the Kloros. They would have to investigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have no way of telling when they were about to do so. Ordinarily, they would first let air into the interlock to force the outer lock shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now the outer lock was on the central screw, well away from its rim. Air would suck about it ineffectually, dragging out into space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen kept on thumping. Would the Kloros look at the air-gauge, note that it scarcely lifted from zero, or would they take its proper working for granted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter said, \"He\u0027s been gone an hour and a half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" said Stuart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all restless, jumpy, but the tension among themselves had disappeared. It was as though all the threads of emotion extended to the hull of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter was bothered. His philosophy of life had always been simple-take care of yourself because no one will take care of you for you. It upset him to see it shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Do you suppose they\u0027ve caught him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they had, we\u0027d hear about it,\" replied Stuart, briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter felt, with a miserable twinge, that there was little interest on the part of the others in speaking to him. He could understand it; he had not exactly earned their respect. For the moment, a torrent of self-excuse poured through his mind. The others had been frightened, too. A man had a right to be afraid. No one likes to die. At least, he hadn\u0027t broken like Aristides Polyorketes. He hadn\u0027t wept like Leblanc. He- But there was Mullen, out there on the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" he cried, \"why did he do it?\" They turned to look at him, not understanding, but Porter didn\u0027t care. It bothered him to the point where it had to come out. \"I want to know why Mullen is risking his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man,\" said Windham, \"is a patriot-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, none of that!\" Porter was almost hysterical. \"That little fellow has no emotions at all. He just has reasons and I want to know what those reasons are, because-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t finish the sentence. Could he say that if those reasons applied to a little middle-aged bookkeeper, they might apply even more forcibly to himself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolyorketes said, \"He\u0027s one brave damn little fellow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter got to his feet. \"Listen,\", he said, \"he may be stuck out there. Whatever he\u0027s doing, he may not be able to finish it alone. I-I volunteer to go out after him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shaking as he said it and he waited in fear for the sarcastic lash of Stuart\u0027s tongue. Stuart was staring at him, probably with surprise, but Porter dared not meet his eyes to make certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, mildly, \"Let\u0027s give him another half-hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorter looked up, startled. There was no sneer on Stuart\u0027s face. It was even friendly. They all looked friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"And then-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then all those who do volunteer will draw straws or something equally democratic. Who volunteers, besides Porter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all raised their hands; Stuart did, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Porter was happy. He had volunteered first. He was anxious for the half-hour to pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt caught Mullen by surprise. The outer lock flew open and the long, thin, snakelike, almost headless neck of a Kloro sucked out, unable to fight the blast of escaping air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen\u0027s cylinder flew away, almost tore free. After one wild moment of frozen panic, he fought for it, dragging it above the airstream, waiting as long as he dared to let the first fury die down as the air of the control room thinned out, then bringing it down with force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt caught the sinewy neck squarely, crushing it. Mullen, curled above the lock, almost entirely protected from the stream, raised the cylinder again and plunging it down again striking the head, mashing the staring eyes to liquid ruin. In the near-vacuum, green blood was pumping out of what was left of the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen dared not vomit, but he wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith eyes averted, he backed away, caught the outer lock with one hand and imparted a whirl. For several seconds, it maintained that whirl. At the end of the screw, the springs engaged automatically and pulled it shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was left of the atmosphere tightened it and the laboring pumps could now begin to fill the control room once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen crawled over the mangled Kloro and into the room. It was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had barely time to notice that when he found himself on his knees. He rose with difficulty. The transition from non-gravity to gravity had taken him entirely by surprise. It was Klorian gravity, too, which meant that with this suit, he carried a fifty percent overload for his small frame. At least, though, his heavy metal clogs no longer clung so exasperatingly to the metal underneath. Within the ship, floors and wall were of cork-covered aluminum alloy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe circled slowly. The neckless Kloro had collapsed and lay with only an occasional twitch to show it had once been a living organism. He stepped over it, distastefully, and drew the steam-tube lock shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room had a depressing bilious cast and the lights shone yellow-green. It was the Kloro atmosphere, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen felt a twinge of surprise and reluctant admiration. The Kloros obviously had some way of treating materials so that they were impervious to the oxidizing effect of chlorine. Even the map of Earth on the wall, printed on glossy plastic-backed paper, seemed fresh and untouched. He approached, drawn by the familiar outlines of the continents-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a flash of motion caught in the corner of his eyes. As quickly as he could in his heavy suit, he turned, then screamed. The Kloro he had thought dead was rising to its feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts neck hung limp, an oozing mass of tissue mash, but its arms reached out blindly, and the tentacles about its chest vibrated rapidly like innumerable snakes\u0027 tongues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was blind, of course. The destruction of its neck-stalk had deprived it of all sensory equipment, and partial asphyxiation had disorganized it. But the brain remained whole and safe in the abdomen. It still lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen backed away. He circled, trying clumsily and unsuccessfully to tiptoe, though he knew that what was left of the Kloro was also deaf. It blundered on its way, struck a wall, felt to the base and began sidling along it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen cast about desperately for a weapon, found nothing. There was the Kloro\u0027s holster, but he dared not reach for it. Why hadn\u0027t he snatched it at the very first? Fool!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the control room opened. It made almost no noise. Mullen turned, quivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Kloro entered, unharmed, entire. It stood in the doorway for a moment, chest-tendrils stiff and unmoving; its neck-stalk stretched forward; its horrible eyes flickering first at him and then at its nearly dead comrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then its hand moved quickly to its side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen, without awareness, moved as quickly in pure reflex. He stretched out the hose of the spare oxygen-cylinder, which, since entering the control\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eroom, he had replaced in its suit-clamp, and cracked the valve. He didn\u0027t bother reducing the pressure. He let it gush out unchecked so that he nearly staggered under the backward push.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see the oxygen stream. It was a pale puff, billowing out amid the chlorine-green. It caught the Kloro with one hand on the weapon\u0027s holster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kloro threw its hands up. The little beak on its head-nodule opened alarmingly but noiselessly. It staggered and fell, writhed for a moment, then lay still. Mullen approached and played the oxygen-stream upon its body as though he were extinguishing a fire. And then he raised his heavy foot and brought it down upon the center of the neck-stalk and crushed it on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to the first. It was sprawled, rigid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole room was pale with oxygen, enough to kill whole legions of Kloros, and his cylinder was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen stepped over the dead Kloro, out of the control room and along the main corridor toward the prisoners\u0027 room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaction had set in. He was whimpering in blind, incoherent fright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart was tired. False hands and all, he was at the controls of a ship once again. Two light cruisers of Earth were on the way. For better than twenty-four hours he had handled the controls virtually alone. He had discarded the chlorinating equipment, rerigged the old atmospherics, located the ship\u0027s position in space, tried to plot a course, and sent out carefully guarded signals-which had worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when the door of the control room opened, he was a little annoyed. He was too tired to play conversational handball. Then he turned, and it was Mullen stepping inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"For God\u0027s sake, get back into bed, Mullen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen said, \"I\u0027m tired of sleeping, even though I never thought I would be a while ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m stiff all over. Especially my side.\" He grimaced and stared involuntarily around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look for the Kloros,\" Stuart said. \"We dumped the poor devils.\" He shook his head. \"I was sorry for them. To themselves, they\u0027re the human beings, you know, and we\u0027re the aliens. Not that I\u0027d rather they\u0027d killed you, you understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart turned a sidelong glance upon the little man who sat looking at the map of Earth and went on, \"I owe you a particular and personal apology, Mullen. I didn\u0027t think much of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was your privilege,\" said Mullen in his dry voice, There was no feeling in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it wasn\u0027t. It is no one\u0027s privilege to despise another. It is only a hard-won right after long experience.\" ,.\u0027 \"Have you been thinking about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, all day. Maybe I can\u0027t explain. It\u0027s these hands.\" He held them up before him, spread out. \"It was hard knowing that other people had hands of their own. I had to hate them for it. I always had to do my best to investigate and belittle their motives, point up their deficiencies, expose their stupidities. I had to do anything that would prove to myself that they weren\u0027t worth envying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen moved restlessly. \"This explanation is not necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is. It is!\" Stuart felt his thoughts intently, strained to put them into words. \"For years I\u0027ve abandoned hope of finding any decency in human beings. Then you climbed into the C-chute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had better understand,\" said Mullen, \"that I was motivated by practical and selfish considerations. I will not have you present me to myself as a hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t intending to. I know that you would do nothing without a reason. It was what your action did to the rest of us. It turned a collection of phonies and fools into decent people. And not by magic either. They were decent all along. It was just that they needed something to live up to and you supplied it. And-I\u0027m one of them. I\u0027ll have to live up to you, too. For the rest of my life, probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen turned away uncomfortably. His hand straightened his sleeves, which were not in the least twisted. His finger rested on the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I was born in Richmond, Virginia, you know. Here it is. I\u0027ll be going there first. Where were you born?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toronto,\" said Stuart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right here. Not very far apart on the map, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"Would you tell me something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just why did you go out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen\u0027s precise mouth pursed. He said, dryly, \"Wouldn\u0027t my rather prosaic reason ruin the inspirational effect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call it intellectual curiosity. Each of the rest of us had such obvious motives. Porter was scared to death of being interned; Leblanc wanted to get back to his sweetheart; Polyorketes wanted to kill Kloros; and Windham was a patriot according to his lights. As for me, I thought of myself as a noble idealist, I\u0027m afraid. Yet in none of us was the motivation strong enough to get us into a spacesuit and out the C-chute. Then what made you do it, you, of all people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the phrase, \u0027of all people\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be offended, but you seem devoid of all emotion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I?\" Mullen\u0027s voice did not change. It remained precise and soft, yet somehow a tightness had entered it. \"That\u0027s only training, Mr. Stuart, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eself-discipline; not nature. A small man can have no respectable emotions. Is there anything more ridiculous than a man like myself in a state of rage? I\u0027m five feet and one-half inch tall, and one hundred and two pounds in weight, if you care for exact figures. I insist on the half inch and the two pounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I be dignified? Proud? Draw myself to my full height without inducing laughter? Where can I meet a woman who will not dismiss me instantly with a giggle? Naturally, I\u0027ve had to learn to dispense with external display of emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talk about deformities. No one would notice your hands or know they were different, if you weren\u0027t so eager to tell people all about it the instant you meet them. Do you think that the eight inches of height I do not have can be hidden? That it is not the first and, in most cases, the only thing about me that a person will notice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart was ashamed. He had invaded a privacy he ought not have. He said, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should not have forced you to speak of this. I should have seen for myself that you-that you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I what? Tried to prove myself? Tried to show that while I might be small in body, I held within it a giant\u0027s heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 would not have put it mockingly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? It\u0027s a foolish idea, and nothing like it is the reason I did what I did. What would I have accomplished if that\u0027s what was in my mind? Will they take me to Earth now and put me up before the television cameras- pitching them low, of course, to catch my face, or standing me on a chair- and pin medals on me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are quite likely to do exactly that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what good would it do me? They would say, \u0027Gee, and he\u0027s such a little guy.\u0027 And afterward, what? Shall I tell each man I meet, \u0027You know, I\u0027m the fellow they decorated for incredible valor last month?\u0027 How many medals, Mr. Stuart, do you suppose it would take to put eight inches and sixty pounds on me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart said, \"Put that way, I see your point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMullen was speaking a trifle more quickly now; a controlled heat had entered his words, warming them to just a tepid room temperature. \"There were days when I thought I would show them, the mysterious \u0027them\u0027 that includes all the world. I was going to leave Earth and carve out worlds for myself. I would be a new and even smaller Napoleon. So I left Earth and went to Arcturus. And what could I do on Arcturus that I could not have done on Earth? Nothing. I balance books. So I am past the vanity, Mr. Stuart, of trying to stand on tiptoe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I left Earth when I was twenty-eight and came to the Arcturian System. I\u0027ve been there ever since. This trip was to be my first vacation, my first visit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback to Earth in all that time. I was going to stay on Earth for six months. The Kloros instead captured us and would have kept us interned indefinitely. But I couldn\u0027t-I couldn \u0027t let them stop me from traveling to Earth. No matter what the risk, I had to prevent their interference. It wasn\u0027t love of woman, or fear, or hate, or idealism of any sort. It was stronger than any of those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped, and stretched out a hand as though to caress the map on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Stuart,\" Mullen asked quietly, \"haven\u0027t you ever been homesick?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-32.html","bookId":1734,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM"}
