CHAPTER I.","content":"As in a theatre, after the overture is played, the first thing shown to the audience is the scene in which the action of the drama commences, so let our first words be devoted to the locality in which the story opens.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I doubt whether the pretty shrub from which Rosemary Lane derived its name was ever seen in the locality, or whether, being seen, it would have been recognised as a familiar sign. Rosemary has a peculiarly sweet odour; Rosemary Lane had not. In one sense there was fitness in the name; for as the flower of rosemary has frequently been used as an emblem of constancy and fidelity, so in Rosemary Lane, poor and humble as it was, might be found living proofs of the existence of those qualities.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was in this locality that our heroine was reared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where she came from, whether she had a relative in the world, and what was her real name, were sealed mysteries to the inhabitants of Rosemary Lane.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As to where she came from, the hazard of a kind gossip, who said that the child dropped as it might be from heaven among them, was accepted, in lieu of a hazard more reasonable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She must have had at some time, a mother, but whether that mother was alive or dead, was not known, and there were no means of ascertaining. Her father, we will, for the present, leave out of the question--as fathers are frequently willing, and occasionally grateful, to be left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As to her real name, it mattered little. One was found for her in Rosemary Lane.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What little else was known concerning her shall be briefly told.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1679/49477.html","bookId":1173,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 1:53:38 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 1:53:38 AM"}
