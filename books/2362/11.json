From the moment he had seen the newspaper report of Frederick Stavros\u0027s hit-and-run death, he had been haunted by it. The priest had heard thousands of confessions since he had been ordained, but the dramatic confession of Frederick Stavros, followed by his death, had left an indelible impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, what\u0027s bothering you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Konstantinou turned to look at the beautiful young man lying naked in bed beside him. \"Nothing, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t I make you happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know you do, Georgios.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s the problem? You\u0027re acting like I\u0027m not here, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t use profanity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like being ignored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, darling. It\u0027s just that...one of my parishioners was killed in an automobile accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all have to go sometime, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course. But this was a very troubled man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean he was sick in the head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He had a terrible secret, and it was too large a burden for him to carry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest stroked the young man\u0027s thigh. \"You know I can\u0027t discuss that. It was told to me in the confessional.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we didn\u0027t have no secrets from each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t, Georgios, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gamoto! We either do, or we don\u0027t. Anyway, you said the guy\u0027s dead. What difference can it make now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None, I suppose, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgios Lato wrapped his arms around his bed partner, and whispered in his ear, \"I\u0027m curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re tickling my ear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLato began to stroke Father Konstantinou\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...don\u0027t stop...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well. I suppose it can\u0027t really do any harm now...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgios Lato had come up in the world. He was born in the slums of Athens, and when he was twelve years old he became a male prostitute. In the beginning Lato had walked the streets, picking up a few dollars for servicing drunks in alleys and tourists in their hotel rooms. He was gifted with dark good looks and a strong, firm body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was sixteen, a pimp said to him: \"You\u0027re a poulaki, Georgios. You\u0027re giving it away. I can set you up to make a lot of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he kept his promise. From that moment on Georgios Lato serviced only important, wealthy men, and he was handsomely rewarded for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lato met Nikos Veritos, the personal assistant to the great tycoon Spyros Lambrou, Lato\u0027s life changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in love with you,\" Nikos Veritos told the young boy. \"I want you to stop whoring around. You belong to me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Niki. I love you too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeritos was constantly pampering the boy with gifts. He bought his clothes, paid for a small apartment for him, and gave him spending money. But he fretted about what Lato was doing when he was away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeritos solved the problem one day by announcing, \"I\u0027ve gotten you a job with Spyros Lambrou\u0027s company, where I work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you can keep a fucking eye on me? I won\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course that\u0027s not it, sweetheart. I just like to have you near me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgios Lato had protested at first, but he finally gave in. He found that he actually enjoyed working for the company. He worked in the mail room and as a delivery boy, and that gave him the freedom to pick up extra money outside, from appreciative clients like Father Konstantinou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Georgios Lato left Father Konstantinou\u0027s bed that afternoon, his mind was in a turmoil. The secret that the priest had confided to him was a stunning piece of news, and Georgios Lato\u0027s mind immediately turned to how he could make money out of it. He could have confided it to Nikos Veritos, but he had bigger plans. I\u0027m going right to the big boss with this, Lato told himself. That\u0027s where the real payoff will be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Lato walked into Spyros Lambrou\u0027s reception office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secretary behind the desk looked up. \"Oh. The mail\u0027s early today, Georgios.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgios Lato shook his head. \"No, ma\u0027am. I have to see Mr. Lambrou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Really? What do you want to see him about? Do you have a business proposition for him?\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLato said seriously, \"No, it\u0027s nothing like that. I just got word that my mother is dying, and I...I have to go back home. I just wanted to thank Mr. Lambrou for giving me a job here. It would only take a minute, but if he\u0027s too busy...\" He started to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. I\u0027m sure he won\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, Georgios Lato was standing in Spyros Lambrou\u0027s office. He had never been inside before, and the opulence overwhelmed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, young man. I\u0027m sorry to hear your mother is dying. Perhaps a small bonus would...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, sir. But that\u0027s not really why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLambrou frowned at him. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Lambrou, I have some important information that I think might be valuable to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see the skepticism on Lambrou\u0027s face. \"Oh, really? I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m rather busy, so if you\u0027ll...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about Constantin Demiris.\" The words tumbled out. \"I have a good friend who\u0027s a priest. He heard a confession from a man who was killed right afterward in a car accident, and what the man told him is about Constantin Demiris. Mr. Demiris did an awful thing. Really awful. He could go to prison for it. But if you\u0027re not interested...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpyros Lambrou suddenly found himself very interested. \"Sit down...what\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lato, sir. Georgios Lato.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Lato. Suppose you start at the beginning...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marriage of Constantin Demiris and Melina had been disintegrating for years, but there had never been any physical violence until recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had started in the middle of a heated argument over an affair Constantin Demiris was having with Melina\u0027s closest friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You turn every woman into a whore,\" she screamed. \"Everything you touch turns to dirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skaseh! Shut your fucking mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t make me,\" Melina said defiantly. \"I\u0027m going to tell the whole world what a pousti you are. My brother was right. You\u0027re a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemiris raised his arm and slapped Melina hard across the face. She ran from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following week they had another argument, and Constantin struck her again. Melina packed her bags and took a plane to Atticos, the private island owned by her brother. She stayed there for a week, miserable and lonely. She missed her husband, and she began to make excuses for what he had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my fault, Melina thought. I shouldn\u0027t have antagonized Costa. And: He didn\u0027t mean to hit me. He just lost his temper and didn\u0027t know what he was doing. And: If Costa didn\u0027t care so much about me, he wouldn\u0027t have hit me, would he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the end, Melina knew they were simply excuses because she could not bear to dissolve her marriage. The following Sunday she returned home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemiris was in the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up as Melina entered. \"So you decided to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my home, Costa. You\u0027re my husband, and I love you. But I want to tell you something. If you ever touch me again, I will kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he looked into her eyes and knew that she meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an odd way, their marriage seemed to improve after that episode. For a long time after that, Constantin was careful never to lose his temper with Melina. He continued to have his affairs, and Melina was too proud to plead with him to stop. One day he\u0027ll get tired of all his whores, Melina thought, and he\u0027ll realize that he needs only me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a Saturday evening, Constantin Demiris was putting on a dinner jacket, preparing to go out. Melina came into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have an engagement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you forgotten? We\u0027re having dinner at Spyros\u0027s tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t forgotten. Something more important has come up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina stood there watching him, furious. \"And I know what it is - your poulaki! And you\u0027re going to one of your whores to satisfy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should watch your tongue. You\u0027re becoming a fishwife, Melina.\" Demiris examined himself in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t let you do this!\" What he was doing to her was bad enough, but to insult her brother deliberately on top of everything that had gone before was too much. She had to find a way to hurt him, and there was only one way she knew. \"We both really should stay home tonight,\" Melina said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really?\" he asked indifferently. \"And why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you know what today is?\" she taunted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the anniversary of the day I killed your son, Costa. I had an abortion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood stock-still, and she could see the pupils of his eyes darken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told the doctors to fix it so I could never have another one of your children,\" she lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe completely lost control. \"Skaseh!\" And he punched her in the face and kept hitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina screamed and turned and ran down the hall, Constantin right behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her at the head of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll kill you for that,\" he roared. As he hit her again, Melina lost her balance and fell, crashing down the long staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay at the bottom, whimpering in pain. \"Oh, God. Help me. I\u0027ve broken something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemiris stood there, staring down at her, his eyes cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have one of the maids call a doctor. I don\u0027t want to be late for my engagement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone call came shortly before dinnertime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Lambrou? This is Dr. Metaxis. Your sister asked me to call you. She\u0027s here in my private hospital. I\u0027m afraid she\u0027s been in an accident...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Spyros Lambrou walked into Melina\u0027s hospital room, he walked over to her bed and stared down at her, appalled. Melina had a broken arm, a concussion, and her face was badly swollen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpyros Lambrou said one word, \"Constantin.\" His voice was trembling with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelina\u0027s eyes filled with tears. \"He didn\u0027t mean it,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to destroy him. I swear it on my life.\" Spyros Lambrou had never felt such rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not bear the thought of what Constantin Demiris was doing to Melina. There had to be a way to stop him, but how? There had to be some way. He was at a loss. He needed advice. As he had so often in the past, Spyros Lambrou decided to consult Madame Piris. Perhaps there was some way in which she would be able to help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way to see her, Lambrou thought wryly, My friends would laugh at me if they thought I was consulting a psychic. But the fact was that in the past, Madame Piris had told him some extraordinary things that had come to pass. She\u0027s got to help me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were seated at a table in a dark corner of the dimly lit cafe. She seemed older than when he had last seen her. She sat there, her eyes fastened on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need some help, Madame Piris,\" Lambrou said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere to start? \"There was a murder trial about a year and a half ago. A woman named Catherine Douglas was...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression on Madame Piris\u0027s face changed. \"No,\" she moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpyros Lambrou stared at her, puzzled. \"She was murdered by...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Piris rose. \"No! The spirits told me she would die!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpyros Lambrou was confused. \"She did die,\" he said. \"She was killed by...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s alive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was completely bewildered. \"She can\u0027t be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was here. She came to see me three months ago. They kept her at the convent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her stock-still. And suddenly all the pieces fell into place. They kept her at the convent. One of Demiris\u0027s favorite charitable acts was to give money to the convent at Ioannina, the town where Catherine Douglas was supposed to have been murdered. The information Spyros had received from Georgios Lato fitted in perfectly. Demiris had sent two innocent people to their deaths for Catherine\u0027s murder while she had been very much alive, hidden away by the nuns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lambrou knew how he was going to destroy Constantin Demiris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony Rizzoli. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-11.html","bookId":2362,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM"}
