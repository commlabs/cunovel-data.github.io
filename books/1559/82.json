Laughter, Fezzik thought, and then he thought giraffeter, because that’s all he was to them, some huge funny thing that couldn’t make much noise. Laughter, giraffeter, from now to hereafter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFezzik huddled up in his cave and tried looking on the bright side. At least they weren’t throwing things at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestley awoke chained in a giant cage. His shoulder was beginning to fester from the gnawing and digging that the R.O.U.S.s had done into his flesh. He ignored his discomfort, momentarily, to try and adjust to his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was certainly underground. It was not the lack of windows that made that sure; more the dankness. From somewhere above him now, he could hear animal sounds: an occasional lion roar, the yelp of the cheetah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly after his return to consciousness, the albino appeared, bloodless, with skin as pale as dying birch. The candlelight that served to illuminate the cage made the albino seem totally like a creature who had never seen the sun. The albino held a tray which carried many things, bandages and food, healing powders and brandy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are we?” from Westley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shrug from the albino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was almost the entire extent of the fellow’s conversation. Westley asked question after question while the albino tended and redressed his wound, then fed him food that was warm and surprisingly good and plentiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who knows I’m here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lie, but tell me something—give an answer. Who knows I’m here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhispered: “I know. They know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Prince and the Count, you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that is all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I was brought in I was half conscious. The Count was giving the orders, but three soldiers were carrying me. They know too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShake. Whispered: “Knew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re dead, that’s what you’re saying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I to die then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestley lay back on the floor of the giant underground cage watching as the albino silently reloaded the tray, glided from sight. If the soldiers were dead, surely it was not unreasonable to assume that he would eventually follow. But if they wanted his erasure, surely it was also not unreasonable to assume that they had not the least intention of doing it immediately, else why tend his wounds, why return his strength with good warm food? No, his death would be a while yet. But in the meantime, considering the personalities of his captors, it was finally not unreasonable to assume that they would do their best to make him suffer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestley closed his eyes. There was pain coming and he had to be ready for it. He had to prepare his brain, he had to get his mind controlled and safe from their efforts, so that they could not break him. He would not let them break him. He would hold together against anything and all. If only they gave him sufficient time to make ready, he knew he could defeat pain. It turned out they gave him sufficient time (it was months before the Machine was ready).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they broke him anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the thirtieth day of festivities, with sixty days more of partying to enjoy, Buttercup was genuinely concerned that she might lack the strength to endure. Smile, smile, hold hands, bow and thank, over and over. She was simply exhausted from one month; how was she to survive twice that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turned out, because of the King’s health, to be both easy and sad. For with fifty-five days to go, Lotharon began to weaken terribly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-82.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
