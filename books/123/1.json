{"id":3197,"no":1,"title":"A CAVIL ON CHRONOLOGY","content":"It has been a while between books, I know. So a reminder may be in order.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The book you hold in your hands is the fifth volume of A Song of Ice and Fire. The fourth volume was A Feast for Crows. However, this volume does not follow that one in the traditional sense, so much as run in tandem with it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both Dance and Feast take up the story immediately after the events of the third volume in the series, A Storm of Swords. Whereas Feast focused on events in and around King’s Landing, on the Iron Islands, and down in Dorne, Dance takes us north to Castle Black and the Wall (and beyond), and across the narrow sea to Pentos and Slaver’s Bay, to pick up the tales of Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and all the other characters you did not see in the preceding volume. Rather than being sequential, the two books are parallel … divided geographically, rather than chronologically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But only up to a point.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Dance with Dragons is a longer book than A Feast for Crows, and covers a longer time period. In the latter half of this volume, you will notice certain of the viewpoint characters from A Feast for Crows popping up again. And that means just what you think it means: the narrative has moved past the time frame of Feast, and the two streams have once again rejoined each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Next up, The Winds of Winter. Wherein, I hope, everybody will be shivering together once again.…\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e —George R. R.
