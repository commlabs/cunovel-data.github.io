Meeting someone I really liked surprised me more than anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same here,\" he says to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but you told me not to wait for you. You didn\u0027t want to get involved, you didn\u0027t want a relationship... all you wanted was a summer fling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was awesome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. But then it was over. You went to the army and I came back home. When things go wrong with Jess, I can\u0027t call you. When things go wrong with friends at school or my family, you\u0027re not here to calm me down and tell me not to freak out or hold my hand in that familiar way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time he turns to me, his jaw clenched. \"So you replaced me with Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my index finger, I twirl it in circles to remind him to turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at the window again and repeats, \"So you replaced me with Nathan. I get it, Amy, you don\u0027t have to state the obvious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I admit it,\" I say quietly. \"I kissed Nathan. Twice. And he was a good kisser. Well, the first time he wasn\u0027t, but the second time was considerably better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to hear it,\" Avi says, his voice tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do. I don\u0027t want secrets between us, Avi. And I don\u0027t want you running away from me when things get tough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You left so fast I didn\u0027t have a chance to figure things out in my own head,\" I say, putting my hand on his thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to touch him, to make him realize how much I care. Will he know by my touch how much I want him back in my life, how there\u0027s a void in my heart only he can fill?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down at my hand. \"Did you figure it out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t kidnap you for nothing, you know. Stay with me, Avi. Stick with me through my mistakes and through my crap and through my crabbiness and through my doubts because...oh, God, I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m waiting for him to say it back to me, not that it even matters. My love won\u0027t waver. I can list one reason, or a hundred reasons, why I love him. There\u0027s a connection when we laugh, when we fight, and when we kiss... there\u0027s a restlessness that burns inside me for him when he\u0027s not with me. I\u0027m calmer when we\u0027re together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s in the Israeli army, I know. And I won\u0027t likely be seeing him for a long time. Maybe he\u0027ll get leave in the summer; maybe he won\u0027t. It doesn\u0027t even matter to me, as long as we take the time now to say whatever, whenever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at the small space in the front seat, the cup holders and arm rest between us. \"Um, where do you want me to go, Avi? There\u0027s not much room here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re smart. Figure it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t ask me how it is that my prisoner is giving me the orders now, but I\u0027m totally okay with it. I squeeze my way over the hump of the armrest and wiggle my way over to the passenger side, finally able to sit comfortably while straddling his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m selfish,\" Avi says, his dark chocolate eyes boring into mine. \"Because I don\u0027t want to share you.\" He bends his head down, says something in Hebrew to himself that sounds like a curse, and says, \"My ego took a beating when I found out you kissed Nathan. I left you because my damn ego was bruised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twist my head down so he can see my face. \"If you can forgive me, I can forgive you...and your ego,\" I say. \"I just want to spend every second together before you go back to Israel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after I go back, what\u0027s between us? I\u0027ve got three years in the army. Who knows what\u0027ll happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to break up, Avi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, either. How about a don\u0027t ask, don\u0027t tell relationship until I\u0027m out of the army?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t ask, don\u0027t tell. That sounds fair. \"Sababa. Does that mean I can call you my boyfriend instead of my non- boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe side of his mouth quirks up. \"Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have a contract drawn up? Do we shake on it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about we seal the deal with a kiss. No distractions this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both lean forward, meeting in the middle. Just as our lips are about to touch, my cell phone rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to get it? It might be your dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilting my head to the side and brushing my lips against his, I say, \"No distractions, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the persistent phone, we start kissing softly, the way it was the first time he ever touched me. Sweet and slow, with passion and hunger lurking behind as if waiting to be unleashed with a vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLips against lips, I caress his face before moving my hands down to the hard planes of his chest, exploring my way while he\u0027s still bound and we\u0027re still kissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One day we\u0027re going to do this somewhere else than in a car,\" he says, his voice and breath coming harder than before. Through his shirt I can feel his heart racing faster, too. I smile, knowing that I can bring him to feel this way, that he wants me as much as I want him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiggling closer to him and putting the seat into a reclining position, I realize I\u0027m playing with fire but it feels too good to stop. Groaning sounds fill the car. I\u0027m not even sure if they\u0027re coming from me or him. Avi nuzzles my neck with his lips, licking and kissing a path down to the V in my shirt while my fingers are wandering around his body giving caresses of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shift of his body, suddenly Avi\u0027s hands are on my waist, moving up my spine and cradling my head. His breathing is heavy and erratic and his eyes are so intense when he looks into mine it makes my breath hitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re free from the handcuffs?\" I whisper, feeling weak from his kisses and caresses and hands and words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween kissing me, he says, \"Yeah. There was a release button on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean back, separating our lips and bodies for a second. \"When did you find it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About ten seconds after you put them on me.\" His fingers brush stray strands of hair away from my face. \"The funny thing is, you don\u0027t need handcuffs to bind me to you. I\u0027m yours without them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull his head toward mine, and we kiss and continue exploring as we move in rhythm against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to forget how inexperienced you are,\" he groans the words into my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So teach me,\" I say. I bite my lower lip as I sit up and unbutton the top two buttons of my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at me?\" Avi asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I can see your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi\u0027s eyes are totally focused on my face and not my shirt as I move my hands lower and start unbuttoning the rest of the buttons. My hands are shaking. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s from the cold car or my trembling nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you listen when your dad had the sex talk? Didn\u0027t he tell you boys only want one thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you, Avi? Do you only want one thing?\" I say as I open my shirt and reveal my bra beneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To be honest, my body\u0027s only thinking about one thing right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. Aren\u0027t you going to take your shirt off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his hands reach for the hem of his shirt he says in a strained voice, \"Your dad\u0027s gonna kill me,\" then he lifts his shirt over his head and tosses it onto the drivers seat with his eyes never leaving me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrushing the tips of his fingers across my abdomen, my body tingles in response and I shiver. \"Are you okay with this?\" he asks, his face serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and give him a small smile. \"I\u0027ll let you know when I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I lean down to press our bodies against each other, his hands reach around under my open shirt and pull me toward him. \"Your body... so warm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands are like a fire, consuming my body with his touch. I lean my head on his chest, hearing his heart beating in the same erratic rhythm as my own while his hands move up and caress my hair, my bare back, and my breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reclaim his lips and my raw emotions and new wonderful feelings whirl in my consciousness. I\u0027m fully aware I\u0027m not ready to have sex, but I\u0027m ready to experience more... \"Avi,\" I say, letting my tone say more than my words. I want...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if he understands, Avi shifts again, this time moving our bodies so he\u0027s on top of me. \"Ow,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Did I do something to hurt him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just banged my head on the mirror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the seatbelt is digging into my back,\" I tell him. Or maybe it\u0027s the handcuffs digging into my back. Or both. All I know is that we\u0027re both uncomfortable right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his forehead against mine and groans in frustration as he attempts to stretch his legs out so they\u0027re not pinning mine under his. I think one of his legs is under the steering wheel, but I can\u0027t be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands are on his shoulders, my feet scrunched under the dashboard, and I think Avi\u0027s elbow is stuck in the cup holder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now my cell phone is ringing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t working, is it?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan our position, the awkwardness of it all. \"I guess you\u0027re right,\" I say, totally frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans into the back seat, retrieves the ringing phone, and hands it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlipping it open, I say, \"Hey, Aba.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi twists himself and ends up sitting in the driver\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" my dad barks on the other end of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" More than okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m going to kill you. Where are you? I\u0027ve been calling and calling. Why get you a cell phone if you won\u0027t answer it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t hear the phone,\" I lie, interrupting his tirade. \"I must have been in a bad cell area.\" That is such a lame answer, but I\u0027m not too good at coming up with lies on the fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you? I asked Nathan, but he\u0027s keeping his lips tighter than a submarine door. Are you in some kind of trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with Avi,\" I finally say while tossing the handcuffs into the back seat so they\u0027re not pressing into my back anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he went to stay with his friend at Northwestern. You told me it was over between you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was... but not anymore. He\u0027s coming back home to stay with us.\" I say the words, then look over at Avi hoping he\u0027ll agree to sleep at our condo tonight and every night until his plane leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you with him now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look out over the empty parking lot, the deserted beach, and the frozen Lake Michigan water glittering in the moonlight. \"Yes,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put Avi on the phone. Right. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aba, don\u0027t embarrass me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me tell you this much, Amy. If you don\u0027t put him on the phone, I\u0027m taking away your cell phone, your computer privileges, car privileges, and that boy is not allowed in my home. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad is a total buzz kill. I hold out the phone to Avi. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi takes the phone with all seriousness. \"Ken,\" he says. Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only hear Avi\u0027s part of the conversation, but it doesn\u0027t even matter because he\u0027s in full-blown Hebrew mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ani shomer aleha. Ken. He beseder. Ken, ani rotze lishmor al kol chelkay hagouf sheli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he saying?\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi holds his hand over the mouthpiece. \"He\u0027s going through a list of my body parts he\u0027ll rearrange if I \u0027compromise\u0027 you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slap my hand over my eyes. Seriously, my dad could drive any guy away from me, even a commando in the Israel Defense Forces. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-26.html","bookId":2765,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM"}
