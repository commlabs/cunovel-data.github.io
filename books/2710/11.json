But he\u0027s very, very ill. Poor Clarence.\" She lowered her voice to a whisper, as if her news were scandalous. \"He had a, you know, a growth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCancer, thought Natalie. How often she had heard the relatives of her father\u0027s patients refuse to say the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, he\u0027s much older than I am,\" Anna Talbot quickly pointed out, as if she were thereby eliminating the possibility of its happening to her. \"You know\"—and she was speaking in a semiwhisper again—\"there was a feeling, in the town, after Clarence\u0027s wife died two years ago, that perhaps he and I—well.\" She took a tiny pair of scissors from her knitting basket, snipped off her yarn, and held up a finished mitten. \"That was silly, of course. Clarence and I have been friends for years. He\u0027s a dear man. Perhaps I mentioned that already. But he\u0027s much older than I. I think he\u0027s at least eighty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s dreadful that he\u0027s all alone now. They lost their only child very young, and then Mary passed away—such a crowd at her funeral, dear. They were such loved people in this town. But he has no family left, and that\u0027s why I took it upon myself to send the plant. I wouldn\u0027t want you to think it was anything more than that, dear.\" Anna Talbot looked up shyly, and she was blushing. Natalie felt a surge of affection and pity for the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he, Mrs. Talbot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he\u0027s in the hospital, dear. The Simmons\u0027 Mills Community Hospital, just beyond the mill, on the river road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think I could see him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Talbot\u0027s face wrinkled into a frown. \"I couldn\u0027t say. I understand he\u0027s very bad now. Is it terribly important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie nodded. \"Yes,\" she said, \"it really is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me think,\" said Mrs. Talbot. \"I\u0027ll call Winnie Bailey if you like. She\u0027s one of the nurses at the hospital. She\u0027d know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, would you? Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Talbot picked up the phone on the table by her chair and dialed. Natalie poured more tea into both their cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winnie, dear? It\u0027s Anna Talbot. I hope I haven\u0027t taken you away from one of your programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll just be a minute. I wanted to ask how Clarence is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know, isn\u0027t it sad? Of course he\u0027s older than we are, Winnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you happen to know if he received the plant I sent over on Tuesday? No, well, there\u0027s no reason he would mention it, of course. I\u0027m sure he has scads of flowers. It is in an especially nice green pot, though, if you should happen to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I have a guest here, Winnie, who would like to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. No, she isn\u0027t related, I don\u0027t think. But she would just like to talk to him for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Talbot covered the receiver with one hand and whispered to Natalie. \"It wouldn\u0027t take long, would it, dear?\" Natalie shook her head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Winnie, I\u0027ll tell her that. Thank you. You go back to your television now, dear. Goodbye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Talbot was quiet for a minute, and then she sighed. \"It\u0027s as I thought. He\u0027s doing very poorly. Poor Clarence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can see him for a minute?\" asked Natalie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re to go over around eleven in the morning, dear. Ask for Winnie Bailey, and she\u0027ll take you in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie finished her tea and suddenly she was over-whelmingly exhausted. She stood up. \"Mrs. Talbot, I can\u0027t thank you enough. You\u0027ve been such a help to me. Now I have to get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, dear. If you want an extra blanket, they\u0027re in the chest in your room. And I wonder, dear, if you would do one small favor for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you see Clarence, would you point out to him the coleus in the green pot? And tell him that it\u0027s from Anna Talbot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFRIDAY WAS CLEAR and cloudless over Simmons\u0027 Mills, with a sky so blue it could have been colored in by a child who had saved his very best crayon for the effect. Natalie left her car at Mrs. Talbot\u0027s and walked to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe town, brightened by the sun in morning, seemed less gray than it had the night before. The buildings on the main street were old ones, but the wood was painted, the bricks were clean, and there were people entering and leaving the few stores, the bank, the library, and the post office. At night, it had seemed a movie-set town, left behind after the actors had gone away; in the daytime, Natalie realized, walking toward the mill that dominated the north edge of the town with its silhouette, it was simply an ordinary small town, one in which lives were being lived, it appeared, with contentment and a kind of quiet charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother walked here, she thought, waiting for me to be born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hospital was new: modern, stark, and efficient, with the vaguely antiseptic smell that bright-figured draperies and Matisse prints never seem to dispel in hospitals. Entering by the front door, Natalie saw in the lobby a young doctor, bearded, and smiled. Imagine being examined by a man with a beard, Mrs. Talbot had said. He smiled at her with interest in return, but she turned away, to the woman behind the information desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for someone named Winnie Bailey,\" she said. \"A nurse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman nodded. \"Second floor,\" she said, pointing to a flight of stairs. \"Up there and to your left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinnie Bailey was behind the nursing station on the second floor, and she looked up and nodded when Natalie appeared. \"You\u0027re the one Anna called about,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. My name is Natalie Armstrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, Dr. Therrian is very ill,\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hasn\u0027t been allowed visitors. But he\u0027s been feeling a little better for the past two days, and I\u0027ve checked with his doctors. It\u0027s all right if you see him, but only briefly. Of course you won\u0027t be upsetting him, will you? You haven\u0027t brought bad news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t think so,\" said Natalie. \"I just need a little information that I think he has, about someone who was a patient of his a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinnie Bailey wrinkled her forehead. \"Goodness. That might be a problem. He\u0027s feeling pretty well this morning, but of course he\u0027s on a lot of medication, and his mind does wander. You may find that he won\u0027t be able to understand what it is you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, he has to, thought Natalie. He must. \"I\u0027ll just have to try,\" she said. \"It\u0027s so important to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to go in with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" said Natalie. \"It will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, it\u0027s room 234, just down the hall there. I wouldn\u0027t stay more than fifteen minutes.\" Winnie Bailey smiled and picked up some folders and her pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to room 234 was partially open, and hung with signs, no visitors, no smoking. Natalie pushed it gently with her hand and looked inside to where on old man lay alone. His eyes were closed, his face pale against the pillow, and a bottle of glucose dangled from its rack beside his bed, attached to his left arm by the narrow plastic tube that dripped the solution in measured drops into his vein. There were vases of flowers on the wide windowsill, and among them was the green pot of coleus. Natalie smiled. She went closer to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Therrian?\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his head and blinked his eyes. He stared at her for a moment, and then looked around the room as if he had lost his bearings, as if he were reassessing where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to wake you,\" Natalie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man turned to her again, looked at her carefully, looked at her hair, at her face, moved his eyes along her blue sweater, back to her face again. Then he reached out his hand, and took hers, and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julie?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIS IS SO HARD, thought Natalie. How can I torment this old, tired, sick man with my questions? He can\u0027t even understand what\u0027s going on. His mind is wandering. He thinks I\u0027m someone else. He\u0027s probably in pain. I should just leave him alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I have come all this way. And he\u0027s the only one who can help me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said gently, \"Dr. Therrian. My name is Natalie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julie?\" he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she answered. \"I\u0027m not Julie. My name is Natalie. I\u0027ve come a long way to see you. Can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stay long because the nurse said that you need to rest. So I\u0027ll try to explain this quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was watching her intently, and his hand was still in hers. It was cold, and she held it tightly to warm it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You delivered me, Dr. Therrian. Seventeen years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Many,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you delivered many babies. Is that what you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was special, in a way, though, because for some reason my mother couldn\u0027t keep me.\" It was hard for her to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and nodded his head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember her, don\u0027t you, Dr. Therrian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blue eyes,\" the old man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatalie bit her lip. \"Yes. They said she had blue eyes and dark hair. Dr. Therrian, I want very much to find her now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was watching her again, and he didn\u0027t say anything. \"Would you tell me her name? Do you remember her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped her hand suddenly, and she realized from his face, as it drew tight and his eyes closed, that a spasm of pain had overwhelmed him. She waited, and felt pain herself, for this man who was so alone and so close to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he relaxed. \"Dr. Therrian,\" Natalie said, \"I\u0027m so sorry that I have to bother you like this. But there is no one else who knows; do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, and said softly, \"You look like her. I thought you were Julie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe short sentences had tired him, she could tell. He was breathing deeply, and he took his hand away from hers, as if he wanted to go to sleep. Natalie felt agony for him, and desperation for herself. She tried again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t talk. I\u0027ll just ask you questions, and you can nod your head yes or no. Maybe that will be easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do remember my mother,\" Natalie began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She came to you because she was going to have a baby. She had blue eyes. I look like her; that\u0027s why you called me Julie when I came in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is so much, Natalie thought, that I am not going to be able to ask him. What kind of woman was she? Did she work? Did she have other children? He doesn\u0027t have the strength to answer questions like that. I must find out from him who she is; then I can ask her those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You helped to arrange my adoption, with Foster Goodwin. Do you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about my father? Did you know him, too? Did he come with her to your office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man stared at her. His head didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it that the woman—Julie—wasn\u0027t married, Dr. Therrian? Is that why she had to give me away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to ask you to tell me one more thing, Dr. Ther-rian, so that I can find her. Can you tell me Julie\u0027s last name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an effort, she could tell, for him to speak. He was exhausted. But he said, \"Jeffries. Julie Jeffries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there it was. Her mother\u0027s name. I have come such a long way, thought Natalie, as she had thought before, and it was for those two words. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/find-a-stranger-say-goodbye/page-11.html","bookId":2710,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:19 AM"}
