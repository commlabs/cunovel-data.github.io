Now it was two o\u0027clock, and Rosalie was busy in the kitchen with her daughters, getting everything ready for dinner that evening. Richard and Ken sat with Harry in the family room, watching a football game on television. Two of the grandchildren would come later that afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was all the Christmas Harry needed. With his children and two of his four grandchildren close, he was at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising from his chair was difficult, and embarrassed by his need for it, Harry groped for the walker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need any help with that, Dad?\" Richard asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m fine. A little slow, but fine.\" A bit wobbly on his feet, he glanced over at the two men who\u0027d married his daughters. He loved them as much as he did Lorraine and Donna. They were the sons he\u0027d never had. It was through their children that Harry and Rosalie would live on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going, Dad?\" Lorraine asked, stepping out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a dish towel. Harry didn\u0027t know what they were cooking in there, but it sure smelled good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I\u0027d rest for a while before dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her arm around his waist and walked him down the hallway to the master bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the room, Harry sat on the edge of his bed and Lorraine placed the walker where he could reach it once he awoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m grateful to have this moment alone with you,\" he said to his oldest daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Dad?\" She sat on the bed beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After I\u0027m gone, I\u0027ll need you to look after your mother. You and Donna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know we will.\" Tears filled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry took her hand and squeezed it. \"I don\u0027t want there to be tears when I pass, understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Dad, of course there\u0027ll be tears. You have no idea how much you\u0027re loved. You\u0027re the very heart of our family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry sighed, knowing their sadness couldn\u0027t be avoided. Death for him, though, would be freeing. \"Donna will be here to help your mother with the move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kenny and I plan to come, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Harry wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d still be around by then. But everything had been set in motion, and that brought him a sense of peace. \"I think I\u0027d better rest for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea.\" When he lay down on the quilt, she kissed him on the cheek, then rearranged his pillows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d just closed his eyes when Rosalie came into the room. \"How are you feeling, sweetheart?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m tired, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the afghan at the foot of the bed and covered him gently. \"Rest now, and I\u0027ll wake you in time for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry nodded, and then, as his wife of sixty-six years was about to leave the room, he reached for her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie turned back expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always loved you, my Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled softly. \"I know, Harry. And you\u0027re the love of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This life and the next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie bent down to kiss his cheek, and Harry closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry,\" Mercy whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry Alderwood\u0027s eyes flickered open and he stared at her in astonishment. \"Am I dead? In Heaven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercy nodded. \"Look,\" she said, with a gesture that swept from his head to his feet. \"You\u0027re not old anymore. You\u0027re young again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rosalie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll see her soon,\" Mercy promised him. \"And when she gets here, she\u0027ll be the young woman you met all those years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you before,\" Harry said, pointing at Mercy. \"That night I forgot my walker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercy smiled. \"That was me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You helped me, and I\u0027m most appreciative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley, Goodness and Mercy surrounded Harry. \"Come with us,\" Mercy said. \"Your parents and your brother are waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom and Dad?\" he asked excitedly. \"And Ted, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercy smiled again. \"Everyone. All of Heaven has been waiting for your arrival. We\u0027re celebrating Christmas and you\u0027ll see - it\u0027s nothing like it is on Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel appeared before them. \"Harry Alderwood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry, young and handsome, nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome to Paradise,\" Gabriel said. \"I\u0027ll take over from here.\" The Archangel looked at the three Prayer Ambassadors, dismissing them. \"I\u0027ll be joining you shortly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley, Goodness and Mercy stood in the choir loft at Leavenworth First Christian Church for the seven o\u0027clock Christmas Eve service. Once they were finished here, they\u0027d join Beth and her family at Midnight Mass in Seattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the organ music swelled with the opening strains of \"O Holy Night,\" Goodness leaned over to her friends. \"Just wait until these humans hear the music in Heaven. Boy, are they in for a surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Harry,\" Mercy said. She\u0027d served God as a Prayer Ambassador but she\u0027d never assisted in the crossing before now. Watching as the frail body of Harry Alderwood was transformed into that of a young man had been a moving experience. His spirit had been set free from his weak and failing heart, free from his pain and free from the restraints of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Harry,\" Gabriel agreed, suddenly standing beside them. He focused his attention on Mercy. \"You did well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said humbly. \"I\u0027m glad I was there to escort him to Heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s his family doing?\" Mercy asked, concerned for Rosalie and Harry\u0027s daughters. She couldn\u0027t imagine what it must\u0027ve been like for Rosalie to come into the bedroom and find that her husband had died in his sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s never easy for those on Earth to lose a loved one,\" Gabriel told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t understand, do they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Gabriel said. \"For now, they\u0027re looking through a dim glass. Soon, each one will know, each one will have his or her own experience and understand that death is not just an end but a beginning. A true beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Rosalie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the moment, she\u0027s overwhelmed by grief. Her daughters are with her, though, and their love will sustain her. One or both of them will stay here until she\u0027s settled in Liberty Orchard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat reassured Mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music came to a halt and the minister, Pastor Williams, stepped over to the podium in the front of the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have two announcements to make before we proceed with the Christmas program,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve received word that Harry Alderwood passed away this afternoon. I ask that we keep Rosalie and her family in our prayers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHushed murmurs rippled through the congregation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also, as many of you know, the Jacksons lost their home in a fire last night. Fortunately, they have insurance. However, all their belongings have been destroyed. They\u0027re staying with relatives in Wenatchee right now, but if the people of our community could open their hearts to this young family, I know you will be blessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Carter\u0027s family,\" Shirley said, glancing at her friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes, Carter,\" Gabriel muttered, turning a suspicious look on Shirley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise you I didn\u0027t have anything to do with the house fire,\" she said, holding up her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know - because the three of you were out rearranging the street displays.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah...\" Mercy stared down at her feet. It was just a little thing, something they\u0027d done for enjoyment. Surely Gabriel wouldn\u0027t mind. The residents didn\u0027t seem to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew about the fire?\" Shirley asked the Archangel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Clearly, curiosity was getting the better of her. \"How did it start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel leaned against the railing in the choir loft. \"You remember that Christmas tree David Jackson found by the Dumpster?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a reason it\u0027d been thrown away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It shorted out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel nodded. \"Carter\u0027s mother didn\u0027t turn off the lights when they went to bed because she was afraid that once she did, they wouldn\u0027t come back on.\" He sighed. \"Foolishly they hadn\u0027t checked the batteries in their smoke alarm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fire, while devastating, will work out well for the family. The insurance will take care of replacing their earthly possessions. David, Carter\u0027s father, will soon be offered a new job at higher pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And his mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll get that job with the school district and the family will be able to afford Rusty without a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful news,\" Goodness said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Rusty?\" Shirley asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll live a good life and a long one. Rusty will be Carter\u0027s constant companion. They\u0027ll remain close until Rusty dies when he\u0027s sixteen human years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-h-h,\" all three of them breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carter will remember his dog for the rest of his life.\" Gabriel touched Shirley\u0027s arm. \"Well done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley beamed at his praise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us about Beth Fischer,\" Goodness said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes, Beth and Peter. They\u0027re going to step into church right now.\" In the blink of an eye, it was almost midnight. The three Prayer Ambassadors and Gabriel made the transition from Leavenworth First Christian to St. Al-phonsus Catholic Church in Seattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loft was crowded with members of the choir, resplendent in their long red robes. The music had just begun when Goodness saw Beth walking into the church with Peter at her side. A smile came over her as Beth and Peter entered the pew where the Fischer family was sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven from this distance, Goodness could see the surprise on Joyce Fischer\u0027s face as Beth gestured toward Peter. Soon Joyce and Peter were hugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027ll happen with them?\" Goodness asked. \"Do they remarry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel grinned. \"Yes, they\u0027ll wed just a few weeks from now. They\u0027ve both learned from their mistakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll have children, won\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three,\" Gabriel said. \"Two boys and a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me they won\u0027t name their children after their characters from World of Warcraft.\" Goodness grimaced and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel laughed. \"Don\u0027t worry. The oldest boy will be John, the daughter Mary and the youngest boy\u0027s going to be named Tim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Timixie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to ask them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can?\" Goodness squealed excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for many years but in time, yes, you\u0027ll have that opportunity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoodness couldn\u0027t possibly have looked more pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe we\u0027re late,\" Gabriel said, ushering the three toward Heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silent Night\" played softly at the church as Gabriel, along with Shirley, Goodness and Mercy, returned to Heaven, where the joyous celebration of the Savior\u0027s birth was about to take place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peace on Earth,\" Gabriel murmured as they ascended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And goodwill to all mankind,\" Shirley added. \"Dogs, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoodness and Mercy laughed as the gates of Heaven opened to bring them home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-angels-go-angels-everywhere-6/page-21.html","bookId":2630,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:07 PM"}
