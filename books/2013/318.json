Udinaas was studying them with the avidness he had displayed when examining the blind minnow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will have your secrets, slave. I will have those, and perhaps much, much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas could not help but see Silchas Ruin differently. In a new light, ha ha. The aggrieved son. One of them, anyway. Aggrieved sons, daughters, grandchildren, their children, on and on until the race of Shadow wars against that of Darkness. All on a careless word, an insult, the wrong look a hundred thousand years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, then, where are the children of Light?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, a good thing, maybe, that they weren’t around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough trouble brewing as it was, with Silchas Ruin and Clip on one side and Fear Sengar and-possibly-Scabandari on the other. But of course Fear Sengar is no Mortal Sword of Shadow. Although he probably wants to be, even believes himself to be. Oh, this will play badly indeed, won’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilent, they walked on. Across this blasted, lifeless landscape. But not quite! There are… minnows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quest was drawing to a close. Just as well. Nothing worse, as far as he was concerned, than those legends of old when the stalwart, noble adventurers simply went on and on, through one absurd episode after another, with each one serving some arcane function for at least one of the wide-eyed fools, as befitted the shining serrated back of morality that ran the length of the story, from head to tip of that long, sinuous tail. Legends that bite. Yes, they all do. That’s the point of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not this one, not this glorious quest of ours. No thunderous message driving home like a spike of lightning between the eyes. No tumbling cascade of fraught scenes ascending like some damned stairs to the magical tower perched on the mountain’s summit, where all truths were forged into the simple contest of hero against villain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at us! What heroes? We’re all villains, and that tower doesn’t even exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see blood dripping between the stones. Blood in its making. So much blood. You want that tower, Silchas Ruin? Fear Sengar? Clip? You want it that much? You will have to make it, and so you shall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFevers every night. Whatever sickness whispered in his veins preferred the darkness of the mind that was sleep. Revelations arrived in torn fragments, pieces hinting of some greater truth, something vast. But he did not trust any of that-those revelations, they were all lies. Someone’s lies. The Errant’s? Menandore’s? The fingers poking into his brain were legion. Too many contradictions, each vision warring with the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you all want of me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever it was, he wasn’t going to give it. He’d been a slave but he was a slave no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis realm had not been lived in for a long, long time. At least nowhere in this particular region. The trees were so long dead they had turned to brittle stone, right down to the thinnest twigs with their eternally frozen buds awaiting a season of life that never came. And that sun up there, somewhere behind the white veil, well, it too was a lie. Somehow. After all, Darkness should be dark, shouldn’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought to find ruins or something. Proof that the Tiste Andii had once thrived here, but he had not seen a single thing that had been shaped by an intelligent hand, guided by a sentient mind. No roads, no trails of any kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the hidden sun began its fade of light, Clip called a halt. Since arriving in this place, he had not once drawn out the chain and its two rings, the sole blessing to mark this part of their grand journey. There was nothing to feed a fire, so the dried remnants of smoked deer meat found no succulence in a stew and lent no warmth to their desultory repast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat passed for conversation was no better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac spoke. ‘Clip, why is there light here?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We walk a road,’ the young Tiste Andii replied. ‘Kurald Liosan, Father Light’s gift of long, long ago. As you can see, his proud garden didn’t last very long.’ He shrugged. ‘Silchas Ruin and myself, well, naturally we don’t need this, but leading you all by hand…’ His smile was cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thought you were doing that anyway,’ Udinaas said. The gloom was deepening, but he found that there was little effect on his vision, a detail he kept to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was being kind in not stating the obvious, Letherii. Alas, you lack such tact.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tact? Fuck tact, Clip.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile grew harder. ‘You are not needed, Udinaas. I trust you know that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wince tightened Seren Pedac’s face. ‘There’s no point in-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s all right, Acquitor,’ Udinaas said. ‘I was getting rather tired of the dissembling bullshit anyway. Clip, where does this road lead? When we step off it, where will we find ourselves?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-318.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
