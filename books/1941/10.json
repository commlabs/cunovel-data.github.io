No sooner had they settled in than Jack Griffin approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this seat taken?” he asked, looking at the empty space next to Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack!” She’d blurted his name before she had a chance to restrain her delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack Griffin? Is this Jack Griffin?” Charlotte was immediately on her feet. Before Olivia could even guess what her mother intended, she’d wrapped both arms around Jack and given him one of her enthusiastic hugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met Olivia’s gaze over Charlotte’s shoulder. She noted his surprise and amusement at such a vigorous greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been wanting to meet you,” Charlotte said, sitting down again—one seat over—and patting the empty space beside her. “That was such a wonderful column you wrote about Olivia. I made sure all my friends read it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack arched his brows—as though to suggest her mother might have been impressed but that hadn’t been the case with Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was so pleased with what you had to say about my daughter. She is a gutsy judge and an innovative thinker, too,” Charlotte continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia was mortified, but she knew better than to say anything, so she smiled blandly and felt the heat radiate from her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte had arranged it so Jack was now sitting between the two of them. Olivia hadn’t been quick enough to realize what was happening in order to avoid it. She was interested in spending time with Jack, but she’d prefer to do so without her mother present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, Jack and her mother were deeply engrossed in conversation. At one point Jack let out a hoot of laughter and abruptly turned to look at Olivia, still smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia could only wonder what was so funny; she was fairly sure it had to do with her. What could her mother have told him? No doubt it was something embarrassing from her teen years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother’s hilarious,” Jack said a moment later, leaning toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was true enough. Olivia merely nodded, and Jack soon turned back to Charlotte for entertainment. Meanwhile, Olivia studied the program. To Kill a Mockingbird was an ambitious project for so small a troupe, but those who’d seen it had raved about the performances. She assumed Jack had come to write a review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia happened to be looking idly around the theater when Justine strolled in. She wore black pants with a cropped cashmere sweater in a soft green, her long dark hair hanging loose to the middle of her back. Her arm was entwined with Warren Saget’s and she gazed up at the older man with wide, adoring eyes. Olivia immediately felt her hackles rise. She didn’t like Warren, never had, and hated the fact that her daughter was dating him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren had moved to Cedar Cove twenty years ago. He’d bought up large parcels of land and built row upon row of tract houses. The homes had been constructed of the cheapest possible materials and had quickly developed a host of problems. First, the roofs leaked and then the siding developed mold. Basements flooded, walls shifted, ceilings cracked. Lawsuit followed lawsuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia didn’t recall how it was all settled—her own life was undergoing a series of traumas at the time—but somehow Warren and his company had survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t only his business practices that distressed Olivia. Everyone knew that Warren had cheated on his wife—correction, wives. He’d flaunted his affairs until both women had filed for divorce and left town. The most recent Mrs. Saget had left five or so years ago, leaving Warren free to go through young women like a kid through a candy store. It hurt Olivia to see her own daughter fall victim to such an unscrupulous man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren apparently liked his women young. The younger the better. A woman like Justine—tall, classy and beautiful—enhanced his image. She looked good on his arm, and Warren knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia wondered whose idea it was to see the play. To Kill a Mockingbird wasn’t the sort of entertainment she suspected a man like Warren would choose. The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas seemed more his kind of show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently Justine hadn’t noticed Olivia. Or if she had, she’d chosen to ignore the fact that her mother and grandmother were seated in the front of the theater. Justine and Warren sat in the last row, where the shadows were darkest and they couldn’t easily be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis relationship had worried Olivia from the start and not solely because of Warren’s age and reputation. Over the years, Olivia had observed a pattern. Justine preferred older men and there’d been several, all quite similar to each other in situation and personality. Warren had lasted the longest. Olivia cringed every time she thought of her daughter marrying the likes of Warren Saget. But at twenty-eight, Justine had revealed no desire to marry. Olivia prayed Warren wouldn’t be the one to change her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart told Olivia that her daughter’s dating habits were linked to that fateful August day in 1986. Justine refused to risk the pain that real closeness could bring. She’d been with her twin brother when he died, and the love she felt for him had turned into agony. Caught up in her own grief, Olivia had failed to recognize the devastating effect his death had had on her daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia suspected that, deep down, Justine blamed herself. She’d been at the lake with Jordan and a whole slew of friends, not paying any attention to her twin. He’d been diving off a floating dock, joking and splashing, all of them laughing at their own antics. It’d been a hot lazy afternoon, and the world had seemed a beautiful place. Then within a matter of seconds all their lives were changed. Their capacity for innocent, uncomplicated pleasure was gone forever. Jordan, clowning around with his buddies, dove into the lake and didn’t surface. By the time his friends figured out it wasn’t a joke, it’d been too late. Jordan had broken his neck and drowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustine had swum out to the dock and sat with Jordan’s lifeless body until the paramedics arrived, but there was no hope. The poor girl hadn’t slept a full night for weeks afterward. She’d been lost and confused, believing she should’ve been able to do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia had her own share of regrets. If she’d been more focused on Justine’s grief, gotten her into counseling, spent time helping her deal with the tragedy…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’d been all Olivia could manage to make it from one day to the next. For the sake of her husband and her two other children, she’d tried to be strong. Each day had been filled with busywork so she wouldn’t have time to think. Pretending had failed miserably. Her marriage had collapsed, and her beautiful daughter had never recovered from the tragedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been meaning to phone you,” Jack said, breaking into Olivia’s thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was encouraging news. Olivia had been brought up to believe that girls shouldn’t phone boys—a bit of social conditioning she’d never shaken off. She’d dated since the divorce, but not much. Friends had attempted to matchmake, without notable success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack appeared to be waiting for a response from her, some indication that she would have welcomed his call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish you had.” There, she’d said it, and it was true. She liked Jack Griffin and had thoroughly enjoyed their impromptu meeting and the talk that followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stared at her as though he wasn’t sure he should believe her. He seemed about to say something when Bob Beldon stepped onto the middle of the compact stage. Bob and his wife, Peggy, ran Thyme and Tide, a local bed-and-breakfast. Bob was actively involved in the theater group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he had everyone’s attention, Bob made several safety announcements regarding the fire codes and pointed out the exits. When he’d finished, he introduced the play and the actors. Before he left the stage, he looked at Jack Griffin and Olivia—and then Bob did the oddest thing. He winked at Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that about?” Olivia asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bob’s a friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You knew him before moving to Cedar Cove?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded absently as he watched the actors take their places on stage. “It was Bob’s way of encouraging me,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To do what?” Olivia pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack squared his shoulders. “To ask you to dinner.” He glanced in her direction. “Are you game?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you game? was certainly an inventive invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you ask her yet?” Charlotte bent forward in order to get a better look at them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just did,” Jack answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ask her what?” Someone Olivia didn’t recognize called out from two rows back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortified, Olivia slid down in her chair and hunched her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack slid down, too. “Will you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. Well, why not? She’d already admitted that she was anxious to hear from Jack. Now he’d taken the next step. A dinner date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe intended to have a very good time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia woke Saturday morning feeling more than a little depressed. She hadn’t heard from Ian. She’d deluded herself, thinking he’d call. He might already be out to sea; she wasn’t sure whether the George Washington had left port, but then how would she know? She got her information from rumor and an occasional issue of The Chronicle. Nor had Ian mentioned being transferred from the submarine to the aircraft carrier. Apparently there was a lot he hadn’t told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia wished now that she’d made friends with other Navy wives. She’d tried early on, but had felt like an intruder. The women had already formed cliques and she was an outsider. Between her job and the pregnancy, she didn’t have the time or emotional reserves to socialize with them. She had declined the few invitations she’d received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Allison was born, no one had come to the hospital and after her daughter’s death, Cecilia had rejected all attempts—by the other wives, by Ian’s family in Georgia, by nurses and a Navy chaplain—to help her cope with the loss. As far as she was concerned, it was too little, too late. Her father hated anything to do with death and dying and avoided her entirely. Other than giving her the sympathy card, all he’d done was pat her on the back, mumbling a clichéd condolence or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ian…wasn’t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did no good to brood about Ian, the pending divorce and past hurts, so Cecilia showered and changed into a clean pair of jeans and a worn, comfortable sweatshirt. As always, Saturday was reserved for errands, but today she lacked the energy for it. Once she got to the grocery, her sole purchase was a big bouquet of flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cemetery was on the outskirts of town. A dense fog had rolled in; it was impossible to see across the street, let alone to the other side of the cove and the naval shipyard. Cecilia had purposely chosen this burial site because it overlooked the naval base. Maybe that didn’t make sense, but she’d wanted their daughter to be close to her father, and this was the only way Cecilia knew to make that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawn was spongy and damp, and her feet sank into the earth as she walked toward the grave. She squatted down and brushed a few dead leaves away from the small, flat headstone. The vase was too narrow to hold all the flowers, so she sorted through and removed the prettiest ones and arranged those inside. When she’d finished, she divided the remaining flowers among the other graves in the row. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/16-lighthouse-road-cedar-cove-1/page-10.html","bookId":1941,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:42 AM"}
