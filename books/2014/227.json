That we can actually travel between them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not know, but I know what my predecessors thought. They believed it.” She drew a finger over the pages of the old chronicle delicately, as if she feared it might dissolve at her touch. “That is why they recorded the stone circles here. They thought there was a pattern, hidden in plain sight if they could learn to read it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand bell rang, the call to prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What have you decided, Sister Rosvita? Will you counsel in favor of Lord Hugh’s plan, or against it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I must pray for God to give me counsel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosvita closed both books and left them on the lectern as she assisted Mother Obligatia to rise. She offered her arm to her, and although Obligatia braced herself on Rosvita’s elbow, her touch was so insubstantial that it seemed more like a memory than an actual presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Theophanu and Adelheid and their noble ladies in attendance, the chapel was crowded. Its walls curved up into a dome, laden with symbols painted onto the whitewashed wall: St. Ekatarina sits in the center, arms extended to either side, palms out in the gesture of an open heart and complete surrender to God in Unity; a pale crown composed of stars burns at her brow, the mark of a saint; above her, twin dragons twine through hoary clouds, engaged in the fiery battle that denotes the conflict inherent in a creation stained by darkness; beyond that, as if seen from the mountaintop, a palace gleams in the sky, no doubt meant to represent the Chamber of Light where all souls return when the robes of darkness have at last been lifted from their spirit after their ascension through the seven spheres after death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn deference to the several crippled or old sisters, railings had been set in rows so that, when they knelt, they might lean on wood. The dark grain was well polished, as if over the decades many of the nuns had needed a little such help at their prayers. After so many hours, Rosvita found herself exhausted. She, too, needed the compassionate support of the simple wood railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been ill for a long time and recovering for a much shorter one, and now she felt flashes of heat, sweat breaking on her forehead and down her spine. The hair at the nape of her neck was damp, and her palms slick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAi, Lady, she was tempted. Could Hugh bind the daimone? Could she see it done? She had never seen a daimone, of course, and the intense desire to see what she had never seen before and would likely never see again scalded her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sang from the Sayings of Queen Salomae the Wise, who had lived long before the birth of the blessed Daisan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not follow the path of evildoers. Turn aside. Avoid it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the evil man cannot sleep unless he has done wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evil woman cannot sleep unless she has caused someone’s downfall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet she and Theophanu would become accomplices to Hugh’s misdeeds and his terrible acts if they accepted help from him, if they allowed him to aid them with that same sorcery they had been so eager to condemn him for before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For although the lips of the sorcerer drip honey\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand his speech is smoother than oil,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyet in the end he is as bitter as wormwood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand as sharp as a two-edged sword.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould she stain her own hands, even for a good cause? Yet she knew herself no saint, willing to die rather than compromise her own honor. If Adelheid died rather than submit to Ironhead, then Aosta would suffer. If Theophanu surrendered, then she and everyone in her party would endure imprisonment and possibly death at Ironhead’s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely under these circumstances God would forgive them for setting foot briefly on the path known otherwise only to the wicked. Yet when did the end ever justify the means?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother Obligatia led the daily lesson in her frail voice. “Let us sing this day the hymn of creation, in honor of the feast day of St. Eulalia, she who was midwife to St. Edessia. Her hands brought forth that which is life to us, the blessed Daisan, who brought the Divine Word from heaven unto Earth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everything is placed upon nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way the universe came to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet something streamed out from the Father of Life\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand the Mother became pregnant in the shape of a fish\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand bore him; and he was called the Son of Life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his soul descended through the seven spheres\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe partook only of pure things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took into his spirit nothing impure as he descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we know this to be true, that the world is impure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe know this to be true,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat the impure world separated him from the Father and Mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein whom he once dwelled without separation.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-227.html","bookId":2014,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM"}
