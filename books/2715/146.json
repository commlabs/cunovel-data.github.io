What the fuck, man? How many different drugs are you high on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock ignored him as he pulled a knife from his pocket, flipped it open, and advanced on me. “You left us broke and starving...for that bitch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to put the knife down,” I said in a calm, level voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you need to shut the fuck up, Knox! I should’ve known you were nothing but a Bainbridge lover. But you want to know the real kicker in all this? I’m the one who started the fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked to a stop, unable to believe my ears. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But your goddamn precious Bainbridge family should’ve taken the blame for it. That’s how I planned it. But no…they always get away with everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You...” I stalked toward him. “You killed half our family?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, no. I didn’t know they were home. They were supposed to be in town. This is all those Bainbridge bastards’ fault. They were supposed to take the blame, and we were supposed to move away, to someplace better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growled, unable to believe what I was hearing. “How could you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flared with hatred. “How could you, you goddamn traitor? Crawling into bed with a fucking Bainbridge. You dishonor the Parker name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At least I still have the Parker name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not for long.” He launched himself at me, slashing his knife with a determined snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” City screamed, and about a dozen voices shouted a warning. But I was only focused on Rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodging and ducking, I whirled away, barely missing the blade as I felt it swish past my ear. He stumbled forward with the momentum from his swing, and I took advantage of the moment, chopping my forearm down over his, which made him lose his grip on the knife. It clattered to the floor, and I grabbed his throat, slamming his back into the closest wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oops,” I told him. “You missed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red haze fell over me as I thought of Bentley and my mother. He’d killed them; he’d killed them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted him to pay, to hurt, to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a familiar voice in my ear drew me back from the rage. City’s hand trembled against my back. I blinked and realized Rock’s face was going purple as I held his throat and his hands beat helplessly on my arms without any effect whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We all heard his confession, man, and we’ve already called the police. They’re on their way,” Pick was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleasing my brother’s throat, I backed away from him. City immediately curled into my side, so I wrapped my arm around her waist, tethering her to me as I kissed her hair. “Then we’ll let the authorities deal with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock looked up at me from the floor where he’d collapsed. His face was still red and strained as he coughed for more oxygen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hope prison treats you half as well as it treated me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Asher added. “And you’re kicked out of the band too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKissing my woman’s hair, I turned us away from my biological brother to a group of brothers I was slowly gaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey welcomed me, parting to let us into their circle as they made sure I was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and tried to brush them off, but City seemed to lead the concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned up and kissed my cheek. “Don’t lie. Are you really okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worry in her gaze had me immediately nodding, though fuck no, I wasn’t okay. I’d just found out my brother murdered half my family right before he tried to murder me too. Glancing to where Pick and Asher were keeping watch over him so he wouldn’t get away, I drew in a deep breath. “I’ll be fine.” Because I knew with my City around, I couldn’t help but eventually get over whatever life threw at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks like my sessions are actually paying off.” She rested her cheek on my shoulder as she hooked her arm through mine. “You got your control back and pulled away before really hurting him. I’m so proud of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at her, loving her with everything I had. “I think you’re the one who pulled me away. You drew me out of my black pit with all that brightness inside you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “No. I didn’t do any such thing. I think I was more like an annoying cattle prod with electrical ends poking at you, constantly badgering you until you remembered you already had your own brightness inside yourself.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-146.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
