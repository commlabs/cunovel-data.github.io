And that was just fucked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it worked in his favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he wanted her—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe job, he corrected. He wanted the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I’ll be in touch,” Felixe said as he rose to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Axe murmured to them both. “I think you will be. And I’ll give you my answer right now. I accept the position and I can start whenever you two are ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComplete. Chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the beast broke out of Rhage’s body, triggered by Bitty’s suffering, Mary covered the little girl on the exam table with her own body—although not from any fear that the dragon would hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParts of the ceiling were raining down, chunks of plaster falling from where the great dragon’s head had slammed into the panels. And then that barbed tail was slashing back and forth, splintering cabinets and scattering equipment, smashing into the sink and springing the pipes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a spray of hot water golf-sprinklered all around and lights flickered, Havers and his staff had the exact wrong idea. Instead of freezing, they made themselves targets by bolting around, trying to get to an exit that was blocked by something that might eat them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut come on. Like any of them had dealt with this before?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop! Don’t move!” Mary barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was when the beast roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary turned her head to try to get one of her ears protected, but she wasn’t going to use her hands. Bitty was so exposed—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the dragon, the door to the exam room broke open, Zsadist, V, and Lassiter crowding in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Close the door!” Mary yelled. “And stay out!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer best shot for this not turning into complete carnage was to make contact with the dragon, soothe it, and keep the thing trained on her and Bitty. As long as she could get and keep its attention, no one was going to get hurt—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon’s jaw snapped closed. And then the beast seemed to shudder as its reptilian eyes swung around and focused on Bitty. Chuffing noises came out of its throat, and it took a step forward, the clawed foot landing heavy as construction equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary slowly straightened, letting Rhage’s alter ego see the child. “She’s okay. Come on, investigate for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive head of the monster lowered slowly, as if it didn’t want to spook the little girl, and as Mary backed off, the muzzle snuffled over Bitty. Worried sounds of inquiry came out, part nervous purr, part aching chest rattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitty lifted her hand up and stroked the purple-scaled cheek. “I’m okay.…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was surprisingly strong, and then she smiled, as if the room wasn’t a wreck, and people weren’t scared to death, and she hadn’t been through torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary put her palm on the bulging neck of the beast, feeling the muscle and the power. “It’s all right … shh … that’s right, snuffle over her.…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout moving her head or even eyes, she whispered to Havers, “Tell me you got the bone reset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her peripheral vision, she saw the male straighten his hornrimmed glasses, which had gone cockeyed and a half. “I’m s-s-sorry—what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bone,” Mary repeated in the same quiet, even tone. “Did you do what you needed to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Y-y-yes, I believe … yes. I n-n-n-need an X-ray to confirm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, let’s not try to do that now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurses clutched together even tighter, as if they were afraid of their boss challenging that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I … no,” he said, “I agree it would not be advisable the now. Permit me to inquire—how long … ah, how long does he …?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It all depends. But we’re going nowhere until Rhage comes back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitty and the beast were still communicating with touch and sound, and as far as Mary was concerned, considering the distress that the girl had been in, the two of them could spend the next six hours together and the rest of the adults in the room were just going to have to suck it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn that note, Mary glanced around and winced. This was going to run into some money, she thought, as she checked out the ruined floor, the battered ceiling, the debris field of glass-front cabinets. But then she looked back at her hellren and her little girl. The beast was a big part of their non-linear, freaky family, and deserved to be counted—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened a crack, and then Lassiter, in his game gear, stepped inside the room. As he held something out, Mary couldn’t see what it was—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait a minute, was that a Snickers bar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” she blurted as he cautiously approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast snapped to attention, its jowls curling up in a snarl at the angel. But Lassiter was undaunted—so not a shocker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here,” he said. “Have a Snickers. You’re not yourself when you’re hangry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a heartbeat of a pause. And then she couldn’t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to start laughing. “Really. Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was funny, as Lassiter looked over at her, his expression behind the open grille of the hockey mask was goofy—yet his eyes were anything but. That pupil-less, glowing stare was dead serious, offering her a kind of lifeline through the painful reality that she loved a child who had been horribly mistreated and that was something she was going to have to deal with for the rest of her days. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-vow-black-dagger-legacy-2/page-29.html","bookId":1778,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:46 AM"}
