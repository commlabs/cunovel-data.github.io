He had been hoping the agent was lying about finding the car, but now Jud knew he was telling the truth. Damn his cousin. Eddie hadn\u0027t done what he\u0027d been told. He\u0027d promised to destroy the car, and Jud had given him a hundred dollars to do it quick. What a slacker, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam checked the time and turned to leave. Allison was at the Hamilton, and he needed to see her, to make certain she was all right. There were two agents with her, but he wouldn\u0027t stop worrying until she was by his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Book him,\" he ordered as he reached for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" In a panic, Jud blurted, \"I want a deal. For a lesser charge I\u0027ll give you the name of the man who hired me. Just charge me with a misdemeanor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam laughed. \"For attempted murder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t trying to kill her, I tell you. Going down the hill like that was an accident. I was only trying to get her to stop, but I hit her bumper too hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why were you trying to get her to stop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was supposed to steal her laptop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam put his hands flat on the table and leaned over. \"Who were you working for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have a deal?\" He looked from Liam to the other agent expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Depends,\" Liam said. \"What can you give us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJud persisted. \"I want a deal first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You help us out, we\u0027ll help you,\" Liam offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJud took a deep breath and said, \"Fred Stiles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Stiles?\" Liam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the guy who hired me. You see? I\u0027m cooperating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam knew Bronsky wasn\u0027t finished confessing. His body language said as much. He was squirming in his chair and couldn\u0027t look Liam in the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t an attempted murder,\" Jud insisted. \"I was just supposed to take her laptop and make her come with me.\" He dared a quick glance up and wished he hadn\u0027t. The agent looked as though his anger was ready to erupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you going to take her?\" Liam asked.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know. I was just supposed to get her and then call for a location to drop her off. The only thing I was told was that she was supposed to finish some program. I figured the less I knew, the better. I didn\u0027t want her to get hurt, and I would have gone down that hill to see if she was okay, honest, but I saw a car coming, and I had to get out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is Stiles now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t seen him since he gave me the job. Stiles can be a real badass if you don\u0027t come through for him. He always gets what he wants. I figure if I lie low for a while, he\u0027ll calm down. My guess is he\u0027s already got somebody else to do the job. One thing I know for sure about him, he won\u0027t give up. He\u0027ll send . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam was out the door before Jud finished his sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce behind the curtain, Allison let Peter carefully remove the gown. After dressing in her silk skirt and blouse, she sat in front of a mirror and unwound her braid. She brushed her hair and thought of Liam. She had actually expected to see him in the crowd. The longer he stayed on her mind, the angrier she became and the harder she brushed. A few minutes later, her hair was shiny and straight, and her anger had subsided. She finally came to the realization that she was being completely irrational. She just wanted to feel sorry for herself. How could she not? she justified. In the last few weeks she\u0027d been told she\u0027d ruined innumerable lives. She had ruined Will\u0027s life because she hadn\u0027t kept him out of prison. She\u0027d ruined her aunt\u0027s and uncle\u0027s lives because she wouldn\u0027t lie for them in court. And, oh yes, she had also ruined Brett\u0027s and Stiles\u0027s lives because she wouldn\u0027t let them steal her work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere they all crazy? Or was she? The question merited thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a cotton ball and some mineral oil and removed the eye shadow. She\u0027d wash off the rest of the makeup when she got home, she decided. The FBI agents would be waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe party had moved inside to the ballroom, where the air-conditioning cooled the guests, and food and beverages were in abundance. Giovanni was the star, as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was leaving the dressing room when Peter found her and handed her her purse. \"Your boyfriend is here,\" he said. \"He wanted me to remind you that you\u0027re supposed to wait for him in the garden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to tell him she didn\u0027t have a boyfriend, then changed her mind. \"What did he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many boyfriends do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many to count,\" she answered. \"Now, please tell me. What did he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s kind of tall, with blond tips in his hair, and to be honest, darling, I think you should tell him to stop using so much self-tanner.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-106.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
