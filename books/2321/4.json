{"id":97278,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m representing the Michael Litvak project.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that registered, Prager wasn\u0027t letting on. She conveyed his continued puzzlement. \"The Hit-and-Run Cooperative,\" I said. \"The Michael Litvak project. It\u0027s a confidential matter, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll want to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sure he wouldn\u0027t want to see me at all, actually, but she repeated my words and he couldn\u0027t really avoid it. \"He\u0027ll see you now,\" she said, and nodded her curly little head at a door marked PRIVATE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis office was spacious, the far wall all glass with a rather impressive view of a city that looks better the higher up you go. The decor was traditional, in sharp contrast to the harsh modern furnishings of the reception room. The walls were paneled in dark wood-individual boards, not the plywood stuff. The carpet was the color of tawny port wine. There were a lot of pictures on the walls, all of them seascapes, all unmistakably the work of Mrs. Henry Prager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had seen his picture in the papers I\u0027d scanned in the microfilm room at the library. Just head-and-shoulder shots, but they had prepared me for a larger man than the one who now stood up behind the broad leather-topped desk. And the face in the Bachrach photo had beamed with calm assurance. Now it was lined with apprehension pinned in place by caution. I approached the desk, and we stood looking each other over. He seemed to be considering whether or not to offer his hand. He decided against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Your name is Scudder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither was I. There was a red leather chair with wooden arms near the desk. I pulled it up and sat in it while he was still on his feet. He hesitated a moment, then seated himself. I waited for a few seconds on the off chance that he might have something to say. But he was pretty good at waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I mentioned a name before. Michael Litvak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know the name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll mention another. Jacob Jablon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that name, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you? Mr. Jablon was an associate of mine. We did some business together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of business would that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, a little of this, a little of that. Nothing as successful as your line of work, I\u0027m afraid. You\u0027re an architectural consultant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Large-scale projects. Housing developments, office buildings, that sort of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s hardly classified information, Mr. Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must pay well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, the phrase you just used. \u0027Classified information.\u0027 That\u0027s what I really wanted to talk to you about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My associate Mr. Jablon had to leave town abruptly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see how-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He retired,\" I said. \"He was a man who worked hard all his life, Mr. Prager, and he came into a sum of money, you see, and he retired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you could come to the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a silver dollar out of my pocket and gave it a spin, but, unlike Spinner, I kept my eyes on Prager\u0027s face instead of on the coin. He could have taken that face to any poker game in town and done just fine with it. Assuming he played his cards right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t see many of these,\" I said. \"I went into a bank a couple of hours ago and tried to buy one. They just stared at me and then told me to go see a coin dealer. I thought a dollar was a dollar, you know? That\u0027s the way it used to be. It seems the silver content alone in these things is worth two or three bucks, and the collector value is even higher. I had to pay seven dollars for this thing, believe it or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you want it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just for luck. Mr. Jablon has a coin just like this one. Or at least it looked the same to me. I\u0027m not a numismatist. That\u0027s a coin expert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what a numismatist is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I only found that out today, while I was finding out that a dollar\u0027s not a dollar any more. Mr. Jablon could have saved me seven bucks if he\u0027d left his dollar with me when he went out of town. But he left me something else that\u0027s probably worth a little more than seven dollars. See, he gave me this envelope full of papers and things. Some of them have your name on them. And your daughter\u0027s name, and some other names I mentioned. Michael Litvak, for example, but that\u0027s not a name you recognize, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dollar had stopped spinning. Spinner had always snatched it up when it started to wobble, but I just let it drop. It landed heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought since those papers had your name on them, along with those other names, I thought you might like to own them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t say anything, and I couldn\u0027t think of anything else to say. I picked up the silver dollar and gave it another spin. This time we both watched it. It stayed spinning for quite a while on the leather desk top. Then it glanced off a photograph in a silver frame, wobbled uncertainly, and landed heads again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrager picked up his desk phone and pushed a buzzer. He said, \"That\u0027s all for today, Shari. Just put the machine on and go ahead home.\" Then, after a pause: \"No, they can wait, I\u0027ll sign them tomorrow. You can head along home now. Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of us spoke until the door of the outer office opened and closed. Then Prager leaned back in his chair and folded his hands on his shirt front. He was a rather plump man, but there was no spare flesh on his hands. They were slender, with long fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I gather you want to take up where-what was his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jablon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where Jablon took off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a rich man, Mr. Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he agreed. \"I am not starving.\" He looked past me for a moment, probably at a seascape. He said, \"My daughter Stacy went through a difficult period in her life. In the course of it, she had a very unfortunate accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little boy died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little boy died. At the risk of sounding callous, I\u0027ll point out that that sort of thing happens all the time. Human beings-children, adults, what does it matter-people are killed accidentally every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Estrellita Rivera with a bullet in her eye. I don\u0027t know if anything showed in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stacy\u0027s situation-her culpability, if you want to call if that-stemmed not from the accident but from her response after the fact. She didn\u0027t stop. If she had stopped, it would not have helped the boy at all. He was killed instantly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes for a moment. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Is that pertinent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The accidentâ€¦ if she had stopped as she should have done, I\u0027m sure she would have been exonerated. The boy rode his tricycle right off the curb in front of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand she was on drugs at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want to call marijuana a drug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter what we call it, does it? Maybe she could have avoided the accident if she hadn\u0027t been stoned. Or maybe she would have had the judgment to stop once she hit the kid. Not that it matters any more. She was high, and she did hit the boy, and she didn\u0027t stop the car, and you managed to buy her off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was I wrong to do that, Scudder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have children?\" I hesitated, then nodded. \"What would you have done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about my sons. They weren\u0027t old enough to drive yet. Were they old enough to smoke marijuana? It was possible. And what would I do in Henry Prager\u0027s place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever I had to do,\" I said. \"To get them off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Any father would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must have cost you a lot of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than I could afford. But I couldn\u0027t have afforded not to, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up my silver dollar and looked at it. The date was 1878. It was a good deal older than I was, and had held up a lot better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it was over,\" he said. \"It was a nightmare, but I managed to straighten everything out. The people I dealt with, they realized that Stacy was not a criminal. She was a good girl from a good family who went through a difficult period in life. That\u0027s not uncommon, you know. They recognized that there was no reason to ruin a second life because a horrible accident had taken one life. And the experience-it\u0027s awful to say this, but it helped Stacy. She grew as a result of it. She matured. She stopped using drugs, of course. And her life took on more purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s she doing now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s in graduate school at Columbia. Psychology. She plans to work with mentally retarded children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s what, twenty-one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-two last month. She was nineteen at the time of the accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose she has an apartment here in town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No reason. She turned out all right, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All my children turned out well, Scudder. Stacy had a difficult year or two, that\u0027s all.\" His eyes sharpened their focus suddenly. \"And how long do I have to pay for that one mistake? That\u0027s what I\u0027d like to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How deep did Jablon have the hook in you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you paying him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he was your associate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a loose association. How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, then shrugged. \"The first time he came I gave him five thousand dollars. He gave the impression that one payment would be the end of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It never is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I understand. Then he came back a while later. He told me he needed more money. We finally put things on a business basis. So much a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two thousand dollars a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could afford that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all that easily.\" He managed a small smile. \"I was hoping I could find a way to deduct it, you know. Charge it to the business in some fashion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you find a way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Why are you asking all this? Trying to determine just how much you can squeeze out of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This whole conversation,\" he said suddenly. \"There\u0027s something wrong with it. You don\u0027t seem like a blackmailer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. That man was a weasel, he was calculating, slimy. You\u0027re calculating, but in a different way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It takes all kinds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up. \"I won\u0027t go on paying indefinitely,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t live with a sword hanging over me. Damn it, I shouldn\u0027t have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll work something out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want my daughter\u0027s life ruined. But I won\u0027t be bled to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the silver dollar and put it in my pocket. I couldn\u0027t make myself believe he had killed the Spinner, but at the same time I couldn\u0027t positively rule him out, and I was getting sick of the role I was playing. I pushed my chair back and got to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be in touch,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much is it going to cost me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pay you what I paid him. I won\u0027t pay any more than that.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2/page-4.html","bookId":2321,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:58 PM"}
