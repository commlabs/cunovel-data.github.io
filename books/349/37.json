A NARROW ESCAPE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Armed with the affidavits which were to restore to him the position in life of which his uncle had wickedly deprived him, Hector returned to San Francisco. He found Gregory unaffectedly glad to see him. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Glad to see you back, Hector,” he said; “I missed you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hector was glad to find that Gregory had not taken advantage of his absence to indulge in any of his old excesses. He began to hope that he had already turned over the new leaf which was so desirable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know what you are thinking of,” said Gregory, after Hector had returned his salutation. “You are wondering whether I ‘cut up’ any while you were gone.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don’t look as if you had,” said Hector, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; I have had enough of sowing wild oats. It doesn’t pay. Shall I tell you what I did last evening?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you like.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I attended a lecture illustrated with the stereopticon. I was in bed at ten.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Gregory,” said Hector, taking his hand, “you don’t know how glad I am to hear this. I am sure your uncle will be delighted when you return to him so changed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ve made a great fool of myself,” said Gregory, candidly. “Hereafter I am going to make you my model.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hector blushed deeply, for he was a modest boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You compliment me too much, Gregory,” he said. “Still, if you are in earnest, I will try to set you a good example.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You won’t have any trouble in doing that. You are one of the fellows that find it easy to be good.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am not sure of that, Gregory. Still, I mean to do my best.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the evening the two boys attended a theatrical performance. It was not till after eleven o’clock that they emerged from the theatre, and slowly, not by the most direct way, sauntered home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was no thought of danger in the mind of either, yet, as a fact, Hector had never in his life been exposed to peril so serious as that evening. Lurking behind in the shadow a shabby-looking man followed the two boys, keeping his eyes steadily on Hector. At a place specially favorable, our hero was startled by hearing a bullet whiz by his ear. He turned instantly, and so did Gregory. They saw a man running, and they pursued him. They might not have caught up with him, but that he stumbled and fell. Instantly they were upon him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well,” he said, sullenly, “you’ve caught me after all.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Were you the man who fired at me?” asked Hector, “or was it my friend here you sought to kill?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I was firing at you,” answered their captive, coolly. “Now, what are you going to do with me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Was this forced upon you by want? Did you wish to rob me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; I had another motive.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What was it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I tell you, will you let me go free?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hector hesitated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man proceeded, speaking with emphasis.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I tell you who put me up to this, and furnish you proofs so that you can bring it to him, will you let me go?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You will not renew the attempt?” asked Hector.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” answered the man; “it isn’t likely; I shall have no further motive.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, I agree.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Read that letter, then.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There isn’t light enough. Will you accompany me to the hotel, where I can read it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The three walked together to the hotel, where Hector and Gregory were staying. There Hector read the letter. He was astonished and horrified when he discovered that it was from his uncle to this man, with whom he seemed to have an acquaintance, describing Hector, and promising him a thousand dollars if he would put him out of the way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This is very important,” said Hector, gravely. “Are you ready to accompany me to New York and swear to this?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, if you will pay my expenses.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the next steamer Hector, Gregory and the stranger, who called himself Reuben Pearce, sailed for New York.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2974/81953.html","bookId":349,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:20:33 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:20:33 AM"}
