The accordion pump went up and down in its clear plastic tube, filling George\u0027s lungs and deflating them with dispassionate efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to bolt out of this room,\" Kelly whispered. \"Do you feel like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d changed into jeans and a man\u0027s white button-down, probably Uncle Ralph\u0027s. The sleeves were rolled up and I caught the mixed scents of Ralph\u0027s bay rum on the linen and chlorine from Kelly\u0027s skin and hair. I imagined she\u0027d made time this evening to visit the Alamo Heights pool, done a few hundred laps. Her hair was tied back in a pony tail and the roots were still slightly damp. She looked at me, her eyes soft and brown and gently pulling as Gulf Coast surf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put on a brave face,\" I said. \"Sound happy. Tell George he\u0027s looking good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looks terrible, Tres. It\u0027s like he isn\u0027t even in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not a corpse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. It\u0027s just... Sorry. I\u0027m talking like a wimp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at a photo someone had put on George\u0027s bedstand — a silver-framed picture of Berton, perhaps ten years younger, and a pretty woman that I decided was his wife Melissa. They were standing on a curve of granite overlooking the hill country — probably the summit of Enchanted Rock. I\u0027m sure the photo was meant as a nice \"get well\" gesture for George, but somehow the smile of that woman murdered so many years ago, the image of her with her arms around George, made me uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I looked again at Kelly, she was staring at my chin — maybe tracing the network of tiny cuts there I\u0027d received from my tumble into the drainage ditch last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a small, sad smile. \"It\u0027s nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, if you really want to leave—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. I\u0027m staying with Tio Ralph overnight. I should be glad to be out of the apartment. He\u0027s in a pretty black mood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh — some woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for a response. I didn\u0027t give her one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping Ralph had done himself a favor and forgotten this lady. Apparently they ran into each other today. You wouldn\u0027t think a woman could affect Ralph very much, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitor lights continued blinking green. I found myself watching the digital numbers of George\u0027s heart rate wavering between 51 and 52. Occasionally the beat faltered and the numbers blinked off completely, then came back on. After a few minutes of watching this, I had to look away. Kelly took something out of her pocket. \"Before I forget. Maybe this is nothing. We found it when we were sorting George\u0027s files.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed me a carbon copy of a While-you-were-out message from Erainya\u0027s phone record book, written in George Berton\u0027s immaculate cursive, dated Wednesday. The note said, Poco Mas. Brandon. Mami called back. \"Make any sense to you?\" Kelly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I\u0027ll follow up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly nodded. With what was obviously great force of will, she leaned toward the bed and touched George\u0027s forearm in the free space between the hospital wristband and his IV plug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, then withdrew her fingers, apparently satisfied that Berton was really there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think all George\u0027s friends balance out?\" she asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Against what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melissa. I was thinking about something Jenny told me — how different George was before he lost his wife. You didn\u0027t know him back then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently not many people did. Jenny made him sound like a completely different person — tender with Melissa but arrogant with everybody else. Very few friends. Heavy drinker. A hell-raiser. According to Jenny, George used to act like this air force hotshot and a lot of people hated him. Can you imagine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admitted that it didn\u0027t sound like the George I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he lost Melissa and it just — made him gentle. Charity work. New friends. Always time for anybody. Most thoughtful guy you\u0027d ever—\" Kelly stopped, exhaled a shaky breath. \"So do you think it balanced out, Tres? You think the friends ever made up for losing that one person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d guess it doesn\u0027t work that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of scary that one person can count for so much. I hear about a couple like George and Melissa and I don\u0027t know. Maybe I\u0027m jealous, or maybe I\u0027m scared as hell and thankful that I don\u0027t have somebody that important. Does that make sense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled sadly, examined my face some more, then reached up and rubbed her thumb against my lower lip, along the side of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thumb came away tinted red from Ana DeLeon\u0027s lipstick. Kelly wiped the color off on her jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stayed next to George until two of his friends from the Big Brother program came to relieve us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Poco Mas Cantina was a different place on Saturday morning. Only one battered pickup truck sat in the front lot, and the music coming from inside the bar was subdued, a soft instrumental corrido. In the daylight the bar\u0027s facade showed its age. Pastel stucco walls were bleached and cracked like a grandmother\u0027s makeup; the air-conditioner units whined asthmatically as they dripped condensation onto the gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, one customer, a muscle-bound Latino man in T-shirt and shorts, was sleeping at the center pink Formica table amid wadded-up dollar bills and empty beer bottles. The old bartender with the silver grease-mark hair was placing last night\u0027s dirty glasses into a washer rack. A younger assistant stood at the liquor display with a clipboard, doing inventory. At the back booth, where I\u0027d encountered Mary and the armed locos three nights before, a chubby, fiftyish Latina woman was counting money into a cash box. She was one of the women I\u0027d seen Wednesday evening, lap-hopping at the bookies\u0027 tables. She still wore the same uniform — tight red dress, red hose, smeared peach makeup, hair like a blowtorch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of the bartenders looked thrilled to see me. The older man reminded me about the new management, then told me the bar was closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for Mami,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis right eye developed a tic. He glanced nervously over at his assistant, then back at me. \"Closed. Eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No Mami?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Closed all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid one of my Erainya Manos Agency cards across the bar. \"When you see Mami, tell her I\u0027m a friend of the man she talked to earlier in the week — the man with the Panama hat. Tell her I need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man gave no sign of comprehension. He scooped his hand toward the door, like he was bailing water, then told me a few more times how new the management was and how closed the bar was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped outside into the graveled lot. Across the street, two women in sack dresses trudged down the sidewalk, lugging plastic La Feria bags. A man in a filthy butcher\u0027s apron smoked a cigarette in front of a little meat market. Down on the end of the block, the yellow-capped towers of Our Lady of the Mount rose up against the gray sky. The clouds moved just fast enough so that the iron Jesus seemed to be pushing through the gray like the masthead of a ship. I crossed the street and walked toward the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the steps of the main sanctuary, I looked back. The old bartender was a tiny figure in the cantina doorway. He was looking in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked inside the church entry hall, past marble columns, oil portraits of archbishops, and polished oak tables neatly stacked with bilingual Catholic newsletters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the lacquered interior doors, the sanctuary opened up into a cavern of gilt and air. Angels laced the domed ceiling. Candlelight glittered in every recess, and far up ahead the altar was bedecked for Sunday service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked up several pews and sat down, my eyes fixed on the distant central crucifix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know why I wanted to be in a Catholic church after an absence of over fifteen years. Maybe it was my visit to George Berton\u0027s bedside the night before. Maybe it was just something Kelly Arguello had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pew rack was a Bible, a folded program adorned with doodles by some bored child. A broken pencil. A single rosary bead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and the sanctuary doors sighed open behind me. Steps clicked down the aisle — two sets. The pew across from mine creaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over and saw the old bartender, kneeling stiffly. He crossed himself with a bony hand. Five rows back, the woman from the bar was settling into a pew. Her face was blotchy from new crying. She frowned straight ahead, then forced her eyes shut and started mumbling a silent prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the bartender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smudges of hair glowed like candle glass. He had leathery skin, deeply wrinkled. He looked frail — probably no more than a hundred pounds. His green slacks and black-striped shirt reminded me of something George Berton would wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are Catholic?\" he asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe broken English was gone, replaced by beautiful Castilian Spanish, the kind you rarely hear in Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to be,\" I answered, also in Spanish. \"I suppose I still am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid back from his knees onto the pew cushion. The effort made his leathery face tighten. He laced his hands over his belly as if holding in an appendix pain. \"That red car on the street. The man you mentioned... he was driving it Wednesday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a good memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a nice car. His name was Berton, si?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you speak to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old bartender gestured toward the woman behind us. \"I didn\u0027t say anything. He spoke with Mami.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at the middle-aged woman in red. She was still praying in a long, continuous whisper, her eyes and hands squeezed tight. The way the old bartender had spoken her name...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two are married?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender gave me a slight smile, like he was used to hearing that question, spoken with the same amount of disbelief. \"Ten years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Mami tell my friend George?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender winced. \"Mami is foolish enough to sit on the porch most afternoons — at the house, there behind the bar. She was an easy victim for conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe probed his belly gently with his fingers, trying to relocate the source of the pain. \"She wants to know if your friend is all right, you see. She heard he was shot, and she had told him things that might get him into that kind of trouble. She has a big heart, and is foolish about talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMami\u0027s plum-meat-colored lips kept moving to the Ave Maria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What things did she tell Mr. Berton?\" I asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the man Hector Mara met in the bar — two weeks ago. Rey Feo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRey Feo, the \"ugly king,\" was a title for one of the rulers of San Antonio\u0027s fiesta week, but I had a feeling that wasn\u0027t what the old man meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nickname,\" he explained. \"I don\u0027t know the man\u0027s real name. He only came to the bar that once. I asked Mr. Mara about him — Rey Feo is what he said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A heavyset Anglo,\" I guessed. \"Dark-haired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man shrugged. \"I only tell you all this because Mami already made the mistake of talking. Mami\u0027s got a big heart. There isn\u0027t much lying in her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she tell my friend anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender stared at the crucifix over the altar. The gilded-wood Christ looked centuries old, his face as stoic and emaciated as the Mission Indian who had probably carved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you understand how this could be bad, me talking to you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-36.html","bookId":2418,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
