If only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped into the car. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released the button and stepped back again. The doors closed and the elevator began its descent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately regretted my decision to share the car with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwareness of him prickled across my skin. He was a potent force in such a small enclosure, radiating a palpable energy and sexual magnetism that had me shifting restlessly on my feet. My breathing became as ragged as my heartbeat. I felt that inexplicable pull to him again, as if he exuded a silent demand that I was instinctively attuned to answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enjoy your first day?\" he asked, startling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice resonated, flowing over me in a seductive rhythm. How the hell did he know it was my first day?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, actually,\" I answered evenly. \"How was yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt his gaze slide over my profile, but I kept my attention trained on the brushed aluminum elevator doors. My heart was racing in my chest, my stomach quivering madly. I felt jumbled and off my game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it wasn\u0027t my first,\" he replied with a hint of amusement. \"But it was successful. And getting better as it progresses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and managed a smile, having no idea what that was supposed to mean. The car slowed on the twelfth floor and a friendly group of three got on, talking excitedly among themselves. I stepped back to make room for them, retreating into the opposite corner of the elevator from Dark and Dangerous. Except he sidestepped along with me. We were suddenly closer than we\u0027d been before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe adjusted his perfectly knotted tie, his arm brushing against mine as he did so. I sucked in a deep breath, trying to ignore my acute awareness of him by concentrating on the conversation taking place in front of us. It was impossible. He was just so there. Right there. All perfect and gorgeous and smelling divine. My thoughts ran away from me, fantasizing about how hard his body might be beneath the suit, how it might feel against me, how well-endowed - or not - he might be...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the car reached the lobby, I almost moaned in relief. I waited impatiently as the elevator emptied and the first chance I got, I took a step forward. His hand settled firmly at the small of my back and he walked out beside me, steering me. The sensation of his touch on such a vulnerable place rippled through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the turnstiles and his hand fell away, leaving me feeling oddly bereft. I glanced at him, trying to read him, but although he was looking at me, his face gave nothing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of Cary lounging casually against a marble column in the lobby shifted everything. He was wearing jeans that showcased his mile-long legs and an oversized sweater in soft green that emphasized his eyes. He easily drew the attention of everyone in the lobby. I slowed as I approached him and the sex god passed us, moving through the revolving door and sliding fluidly into the back of the chauffeured black Bentley SUV I\u0027d seen at the curb the evening before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary whistled as the car pulled away. \"Well, well. From the way you were looking at him, that was the guy you told me about, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah. That was definitely him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You work together?\" Linking arms with me, Cary tugged me out to the street through the stationary door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I stopped on the sidewalk to change into my walking flats, leaning into him as pedestrians flowed around us. \"I don\u0027t know who he is, but he asked me if I\u0027d had a good first day, so I better figure it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" He grinned and supported my elbow as I hopped awkwardly from one foot to the other. \"No idea how anyone could get any work done around him. My brain sort of fried for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s a universal effect.\" I straightened. \"Let\u0027s go. I need a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning arrived with a slight throbbing at the back of my skull that mocked me for having one too many glasses of wine. Still, as I rode the elevator up to the twentieth floor, I didn\u0027t regret the hangover as much as I should have. My choices were either too much alcohol or a whirl with my vibrator, and I was damned if I\u0027d have a battery-provided orgasm starring Dark and Dangerous. Not that he\u0027d know or even care that he made me so horny I couldn\u0027t see straight, but I\u0027d know and I didn\u0027t want to give the fantasy of him the satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped my stuff in the bottom drawer of my desk and when I saw that Mark wasn\u0027t in yet, I grabbed a cup of coffee and returned to my cubicle to catch up on my new favorite ad-biz blogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped when he appeared beside me, his grin a flash of white against his smooth dark skin. \"Good morning, Mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it ever. You\u0027re my lucky charm, I think. Come into my office. Bring your tablet. Can you work late tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him over, catching on to his excitement. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d hoped you\u0027d say that.\" He sank into his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the one I\u0027d sat in the day before and quickly opened a notepad program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he began, \"we\u0027ve received an RFP for Kingsman Vodka and they mentioned me by name. First time that\u0027s ever happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate that, but let\u0027s save them for when we\u0027ve actually landed the account. We\u0027ll still have to bid, if we get past the request for proposal stage, and they want to meet with me tomorrow evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. Is that timeline usual?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Usually they\u0027d wait until we had the RFP finished before meeting with us, but Cross Industries recently acquired Kingsman and C.I. has dozens of subsidiaries. That\u0027s good business if we can get it. They know it and they\u0027re making us jump through hoops, the first of which is meeting with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usually there would be a team, right?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-6.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
