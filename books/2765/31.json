{"id":85776,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\u003cp\u003eEveryone\u0027s eyes are on me now, analyzing my relationship with Nathan which is not good considering I just got back together with Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re just friends,\" I blurt out, then hook my finger into Avi\u0027s belt loop making it obvious we\u0027re a couple. I hold my breath and peek at Avi\u0027s reaction to all of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi takes his hands off me, saying, \"You don\u0027t have to defend yourself to me, Amy. I\u0027ll be at the bar while you work this out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he serious? He doesn\u0027t have any doubts or insecurities about my friendship with Nathan? \"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He smiles and gives me a reassuring nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch his retreating back as he weaves his way through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWes, the guy from the Jewish youth group who helped me get Nathan in the band, weaves his way through the crowd. \"Nate rocks, Amy. Thanks for bringing him by the other night. We\u0027re thinking of making him a permanent sub for Lickity Split.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool,\" I say, but I\u0027m not really paying attention to Wes or Bicky. Or Miranda, for that matter, even though she\u0027s in a deep conversation with a guy who I remember seeing at the youth group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan...\" I say, wanting to apologize for kissing him. I also want to tell him I\u0027m sorry he has to deal with a screwed-up girlfriend on his first night singing with the band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s cool, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can stay and help if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve helped enough, bitch, don\u0027t you think?\" Bicky slurs. I seriously think she wants to fight me, like in a physical fight. As I\u0027m contemplating who would win in a fight between me and Bicky, I wonder if they teach tae kwon do in rehab. Because the only physical fight I\u0027ve ever been in was with the sheep on the moshav last summer in Israel. And in the disco in Israel, but that was only because of the ear-licker--long story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBicky holds her hands out wide, \"You want some of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" I say. Is she joking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously not. My response really pisses her off, because now Nathan is trying to hold her back from charging me. I swear I\u0027m living in the Twilight Zone. This girl seriously wants to deck me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot knowing what else to do, I close my fingers tightly into fists and hold them up by my face. The crowd around me starts moving backward. I think they\u0027re chanting \"Chick Fight!\" but I\u0027m not sure. Whatever they\u0027re chanting, though, is fueling my bravery. Getting into the role, I start hopping around like boxers do. Maybe Bicky is too wasted and she\u0027ll fall to the ground on the first swing. It\u0027s wishful thinking, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I break a nail I swear the chick is paying for a new manicure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want some of this? Come and get me!\" I say, playing the role while psyching myself up. I can seriously get into this, acting all tough and crazy. Be afraid, everyone. Here comes the champion girl fighter of our time, Amy Nelson-Barak!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind me, an arm snakes around my side and pulls me backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m kicking whoever is holding me and punching at the arm, which is locked around me like a metal vice. Whoever it is drags me outside and sets me down on the sidewalk. I turn around and should have known nobody is as strong as my boyfriend who said he didn\u0027t want to deal with the drama, but ends up in the middle of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What. Do. You. Think. You. Were. Doing?\" Avi says each word slowly as if I\u0027m an imbecile. His eyes are intense and his hands are shaking. I\u0027ve never seen Avi shake before and it scares me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens his hands out wide. \"I leave you alone for two minutes and you\u0027re acting like a hellcat. How can I leave you for three years, Amy? I can\u0027t protect you while I\u0027m in Israel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point to the club. \"Bicky started it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you took the bait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, yeah. \"What was I supposed to do, back down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he says without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not me. Do you back down, Avi? Please tell me once in your life when you\u0027ve backed down,\" I say, getting really riled up now because adrenaline is rushing through my body and I\u0027m frightened because Avi\u0027s hands are still shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi stares at his hands in horror, curses, then shoves them into the front pockets of his jeans. He swallows, looks away from me, and says, \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stay where I am, unmoving from this spot on the sidewalk in front of Durty Nevin\u0027s because I finally figured it out. What\u0027s making Avi shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis emotions are running rampant and he\u0027s not used to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi is a guy who is always in control of his body and mind. Even when I kidnapped him, he was in total control of the situation the entire time. Adrenaline he can handle, emotions he can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were afraid I was going to get hurt. That\u0027s why you\u0027re shaking,\" I blurt out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops. His back is to me. \"I don\u0027t shake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then show me your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avi, it\u0027s okay to be emotional.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you, maybe. But not for me.\" I put my hand on his arm, knowing his pain about Micha\u0027s death is as raw in his chest now as it was when his brother first died. It has nothing to do with me and the fight. Avi can\u0027t let go of the pain of Micha\u0027s death, but still refuses to grieve. \"You\u0027re only eighteen. And I hate to break the news to you, but you\u0027re human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t lose you, Amy,\" he says, his voice tense even though I sense he\u0027s trying to control his tone. \"I came to America to prove to myself that I wasn\u0027t attached to you, that you weren\u0027t as important to me as my mind was telling me you were. I was wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You rode on a plane for twelve hours just to break up with me?\" I say, totally confused and insulted now. I mean, seriously, to come all this way to prove I\u0027m not worthy. \"If that isn\u0027t the stupidest, most ridiculous, asinine thing I\u0027ve ever heard,\" I say, then start walking across the street because I need space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A car is coming,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, I look behind me and a Honda Pilot is turning the corner and heads right to where I\u0027m standing. \"Aren\u0027t you going to save me?\" I yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks fast to the curb and is about to step onto the street when I tell him, \"If you take one step closer, it\u0027s over between us. I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That car is gonna hit you,\" he says seriously, his eyes blazing with intensity. But he does stop cold in his tracks at the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They see me,\" I assure him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi cocks his head to the side in confusion while his hands come out of his pockets. He\u0027s trying to look relaxed, but I can tell he\u0027s ready to pounce and save me at any second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll stop,\" I say again, trying to prove a point that I\u0027ll be okay whether he\u0027s here to save me or not. He\u0027s not always going to be around to play Superman. Just like he wasn\u0027t around to save his brother when that bomber decided to kill innocent Israelis. My boyfriend is human and for once needs to let go and realize it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi is looking at the car coming closer and then back at me. I can feel the struggle within him all the way over here. \"Maybe they don\u0027t care,\" he says frantically to me. \"Maybe they can\u0027t see you in the dark. Maybe the driver is drunk and--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I\u0027ll be okay, Avi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if you\u0027re not? What if you die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand out. When the car reaches me, it comes to a halt. \"Yo, chick, you gonna get out of the way?\" a guy yells out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone dies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you blame me for wanting to protect you, Amy? Now please get out of the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy in the car starts blowing his horn, really loud and it\u0027s hurting my already sensitive eardrums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to teach my boyfriend a lesson,\" I scream at the driver. \"Do you mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he yells back. \"Go teach him a lesson on Lower Wacker Drive where all the other wackos hang out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They give tickets for road rage in Chicago, you know,\" I say, then roll my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy...I\u0027m coming to get you in ten seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They give tickets for jaywalking in Chicago,\" the guy yells while intermittently beeping his horn. I get a little satisfaction he can\u0027t pass me because there\u0027s no room on the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have five more seconds to get your ta\u0027chat over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love me, Avi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Four seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you trust me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Two seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dude, if you don\u0027t get your crazy girlfriend out of my path I\u0027m gonna move her myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy,\" Avi says, closing his eyes tight and opening them again. Two seconds have come and gone. He has a pleading look in his eyes, eyes that are glassy with unshed tears. \" B\u0027vakasha. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I give in. Because I\u0027ve proven my point that I will be okay and Avi has proven that he can trust me. I walk over to him, my gaze never leaving his. The car screeches away. \"You see. I survived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms wrap around me, pulling me close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not shaking anymore,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too angry with you to be scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angry? Listen, you\u0027ve got to give up this superhuman theme going on in your life. Shit happens. Life happens, okay? You\u0027re leaving tomorrow and who knows what\u0027ll happen. Am I gonna sit around my room so nothing terrible can possibly happen to me? No. Are you going to sit in your army barracks and tell your commander you can\u0027t protect Israel because your crabby girlfriend will die if you get so much as a scratch on that perfect bod or face of yours? No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop talking so I can kiss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t shut me up with kisses, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanna bet?\" he says, smiling with those perfect white teeth while putting his perfect hands on my body as he lowers his perfect full lips to mine and proves to me he\u0027s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go back to your place,\" he says when we come up for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m holding on to his biceps for support because his kisses still make me feel drunk. \"My aba is there. If you even kiss me he\u0027ll probably kill you first and ask questions later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the apartment my dad is nowhere to be seen. I check the messages. There\u0027s one from him saying he has to stay late for an emergency meeting. Then he says to make sure Avi is listening to the message, too, and the rest of the message is all in Hebrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. \"Is he having another sex talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah. Big time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop the machine before the message finishes and give Avi a mischievous look. \"What are you thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which rooms your dad has strategically placed the hidden cameras.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. \"That\u0027s ridiculous. My dad doesn\u0027t have any hidden cameras in this house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sounded pretty convincing, but I have an idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get ready for bed, like a married couple except for the fact that we\u0027re just two trusting teenagers in complete love with each other. Avi\u0027s bed is still the couch in the living room, but this time I snuggle under the covers with him because my overprotective father isn\u0027t home watching our every move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like this,\" I say. \"So what\u0027s your idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi pulls the covers over our heads so we\u0027re cloaked in complete darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finger his stubble with my fingertips. \"This is your big idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was either under the blanket or inside the hall closet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all sababa\" I say, and Avi laughs. \"Yeah, it is.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-31.html","bookId":2765,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM"}
