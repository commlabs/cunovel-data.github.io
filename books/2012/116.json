Of the two, I will take the latter and hope for the former. As for how soon …’ He paused, and then pointed at Lightfall. ‘There, do you see that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange dull spot formed in the descending streams of light. It bled outward like a stain, reaching down to the very base, before the brighter edges began soaking back in. ‘What was that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Dragons, Withal.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ What? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Soletaken, or allies. The sorcery of the Eleint that some call their breath . They assail the barrier with that chaotic power, and with each breath the ancient wound thins, the skin weakens.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mael save us, Yedan – you mean to stand against dragons ? How?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When the wound opens, it will be at the base – to open the way for their foot soldiers. A beachhead will need to be established – we need to be driven back from the wound. For a dragon to physically come through the breach will take all of its power, and when it does it will be on the ground, not in the air. And when a dragon is on the ground, it is vulnerable.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But if the beachhead has driven you back—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We must in turn overrun them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To reach that first dragon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And kill it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ideally, halfway through the wound. And not killed, but dying. At that moment, my sister and the witches need to … pounce. To take that draconic life force—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And seal the breach.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan Derryg nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal stared at the man, his angled profile, his dark, calm eyes fixed so steadily upon Lightfall. Beru’s sweet piss, does nothing rattle him? Prince Yedan Derryg, your soldiers will look to you, and now at last I begin to see what they will see. You are their own wall, their own Lightfall .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut are you wounded, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yedan, can it be done? What you describe?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man shrugged. ‘My sister refuses to kneel before the First Shore. It is the act that sanctifies the queen of the Shake, and she will not do it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why ever not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth bared in a brief grin, Yedan said, ‘We are a contrary lot, us royals. A queen who defies sanctification, a prince who will never produce an heir, and what of Awakening Dawn? What of our Sister of Night? Gone, for ever gone. Yan Tovis and me, we are all that’s left. Have you ever been in a Letherii city, Withal?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Have you ever seen a Shake walk through a Letherii crowd?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, I don’t think so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They keep their eyes on the cobbles. They shift and slide from anyone in their path. They do not walk as would you, tall, filling the space you need.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I believe that has changed, Yedan – what you and your sister have done here—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And sticking a sword in their hand and telling them to stand here, to fight and to die without a single backward step, will turn mice into snarling leopards? We shall find out the answer to that soon enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal thought for a time on all that the prince had said, and then he shook his head. ‘Is it just your royal blood, then, that makes you and your sister the exceptions to the image you paint of the Shake? You are not mice.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We trained as officers in the Letherii military – we considered that a duty, not to the king of Lether, but to the Shake. To lead we must be seen to lead, but more than that we needed to learn how to lead. This was the Letherii military’s gift to us, but it was a dangerous one, for it very nearly swallowed up Yan Tovis – perhaps it has, given the reluctance she now displays.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If she does not kneel to the Shore,’ asked Withal, ‘can the witches alone seal the wound?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And if there were more of them?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan glanced over. ‘If I hadn’t murdered them, you mean?’ He seemed to find something left over in his mouth, worked it loose with his tongue, chewed and swallowed. ‘Hard to say. Possibly. Possibly not. Venal rivalries plagued them. It’s more likely they would have usurped my sister, or even killed her. And then they’d set about killing each other.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But couldn’t you have stopped them?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal was silent for a moment, and then he said, ‘Surely she understands the danger?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I imagine so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’ve not tried to persuade her?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In her own way, my sister is as stubborn as I am.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-116.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
