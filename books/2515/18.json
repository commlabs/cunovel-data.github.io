It was late, close to dawn, and he had been writing most of the night. For the last six months, in fact, he had worked almost every night without rest. But it didn\u0027t matter how much sleep he missed. He could always sleep during the day. Because he was very sick with AIDS, he no longer attended school, or even went out of the house. Indeed, his personal physician thought he wouldn\u0027t live out the year, and it was almost Christ?mas. Yet the tragedy of his early demise did not disturb him, at least not at the moment. Like his imagined heroine, he was happy in the end, to have even reached the end. He had just finished his story. Her story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout Alisa Perne, his Sita. The Last Vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour felt as if he had taken her everywhere she could go, but at the same time he knew that it was she who had led him on the adventures. Lifted him up to heights he could not have imagined if not for his serious illness. For him, the constant experi?ence of his waning mortality had been the greatest muse. She had never said who she was sending her thoughts out to, but it was to him, always to him. But he had made her immortal, and himself, so that he wouldn\u0027t have to be afraid of his own death. He knew, in the end, that she had not been afraid, and that her only regret had been that she had not been able to say goodbye to him. But at least he could say goodbye to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour leaned forward and turned off the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a noise outside his window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over. Quickly, he always did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was nothing. A cat, the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut such sounds, this late at night, always made him think of her. Ageless Sita coming through the window to give him her magical blood. To save him from his illness. But she had chosen the only destiny worthy of her. She had simply decided to vanish, to exist only in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour coughed weakly and brushed away a tear that came to his eye. He should be in a hospital. His lungs were half-filled with fluid, and he couldn\u0027t draw in a full breath without pain. Still, he thought, it was better to be at home with his computer and his story. He just wished his heart could beat for her forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour was going to miss her. Yeah. \"Goodbye, Sita,\" he said to the empty screen. He thought he would miss her forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE END \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/creatures-of-forever-the-last-vampire-6/page-18.html","bookId":2515,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:19:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:19:09 PM"}
