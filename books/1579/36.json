Be careful about her.” His eyes fl ick to me for the fi rst time. I expect to fi nd sternness in them, and it\u0027s there. But the hint of kindness, I did not. “You need to watch out. She\u0027s not who you think she is. Don\u0027t let her lead you astray.” And with that, he brushes open the door and disappears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreakin\u0027 weirdo, I think to myself. I grab a paper towel and am about to scrub my armpits when a party of four or fi ve come boisterously in. They\u0027re loud, unsteady, and clearly inebriated. I step out. I scan quickly for the paparazzi guy, but he\u0027s nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come with me.” It\u0027s Ashley June materializing out of nowhere, whispering at my side. “We\u0027ve done our due diligence. Everyone\u0027s so hammered, they won\u0027t notice we\u0027ve gone. Come,” she says, and I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leads me out of the hal , her slim fi gure weaving right through the dance fl oor, between dark moving shapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the banquet hal , the corridors are empty and the music grows dimmer the farther we walk away. I think we\u0027re heading to her room, but on the stairwel we walk past the third fl oor and continue heading up until there are no more fl ights of stairs to climb. At the very top, she pushes open a door on the landing, and a burst of starlight fal s on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve been up here a few times. Nobody ever comes,” she says softly. The Vast lies spread before us like a frozen sea, its plates calm and smooth. And above us a slew of stars, shimmering slightly, suggestive of an even deeper emptiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leads me to the center of the roof, the smal pebbles beneath our feet shifting as we step. She stops and faces me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am right behind her. Our shoulders touch as she turns, and she does not pul away. She is so close, I can feel her breath on my lips. When she looks up at me, I see the refl ection of the stars in her eyes, wet as with the eve ning dew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did your parents ever give you a designation?” she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “They did. But then they just stopped using it one day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember what it was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gene.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is silent for a few moments; I see her lips gently mouthing the word, as if trying it on for size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t remember,” she says quietly. “But we shouldn\u0027t be cal ing each other by our family designations anyway. We might get careless and inadvertently cal each other by our designations in front of others. It might draw unnecessary —”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Attention,” I fi nish for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, we suppress the smile spreading on both our faces, as if my lips and hers are two sides of the same mouth. We stop ourselves, as we always have, and start scratching our wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My father used to tel me that all the time. Don\u0027t draw unnecessary attention to yourself. all the time. Guess yours did, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, a sadness crossing her face. Together, we look out at the Vast, at the Dome sitting smal in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom below us, we hear a group of partyers heading out, probably to the Dome, their drunken voices slurred and garbled. Their voices grow dimmer, then fade out altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, let me show you something,” Ashley June says. “Can you do this funky thing? We need to sit down fi rst.” She then plants her right foot down on the bal s of her foot and starts bouncing her leg up and down in a quick, vibrating motion. “When I\u0027d get impatient or restless, I used to want to do this with my leg. My parents warned me against it, but I\u0027d still do it when alone. Once your leg gets going, it goes on autopi lot. Look, I\u0027m not even consciously thinking about it, it moves on its own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try. It doesn\u0027t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re overthinking this,” she says. “Just relax, don\u0027t think about it. Make quicker, shorter jerks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the fourth try, it happens. The leg just starts hopping on its own, a jackhammer bouncing away. “Whoa- ho!” I shout in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles the widest I\u0027ve seen; a smal sound escapes her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s called ‘laughter,\u0027 ” I tel her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. Although sometimes my parents called it ‘cracking up.\u0027 Ever heard that one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “It was just ‘laughter\u0027 for us. And we didn\u0027t do it much. My dad— he was always worried I\u0027d forget myself and slip up in public.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, mine too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every morning, he\u0027d remind me. Don\u0027t do this, don\u0027t do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo laughing, no smiling, no sneezing, no frowning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it got us here. Alive still , I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose.” I turn to her. “My dad had this one really odd saying. Maybe your parents used to say it to you as wel ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never forget who you are.\u0027 ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ ‘Never forget who you are\u0027? Never heard that one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dad would say it maybe once a year. I always thought it strange.” I stare down at my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did yours . . . you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My parents?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the eastern mountains. “My mother and my sister, years ago. I don\u0027t remember much about them. They just vanished one day. Then my father, about seven years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got bitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe fal into a silence after that, comforting and shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic from the banquet hal comes at us muted and indifferent, a thousand miles away. Eventual y, our eyes drift over to the Dome, tran-quil and sparkling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ignorance is bliss,” she whispers. “To night, asleep, blissful y unaware of what awaits them tomorrow. The end of their lives. Poor things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s something you should know,” I say after a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hepers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause. “When I got water from the pond, I wasn\u0027t like in and out. I actual y interacted with them. Spent time there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you know, they speak. They even read. They\u0027re not the savages I thought they were, not even close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They speak? And read?” She looks incredulously at the Dome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing moves inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They love to. They have books in the mud huts. Shelves of them. And they\u0027re creative: they draw, paint.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. “I don\u0027t understand. I thought they were raised like barn animals. Why were they domesticated and trained?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I know this is hard to grasp, but it\u0027s not even about them being domesticated or trained like circus animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re beyond that. They\u0027re, like, normal. They think, they\u0027re rational, they joke around. Like you and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frown creases her face. She is quiet, mul ing something over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you haven\u0027t told them about the Hunt,” she says matter- of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have no idea,” I answer. “Sometimes ignorance is bliss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you tel them about yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Scientist\u0027s replacement.” I hesitate. “It would have been too . . . awkward to say I was a heper hunter. Maybe I should have said something to them. Maybe I should have let them know about the Hunt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you did the right thing,” she says. “What good would it have done? They\u0027d still be as good as dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA zil ion mil ion thoughts plummet through my mind over the next few seconds. Then: “Think we should do something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns to me. “Pretty funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I mean, seriously. Instead of our plan, should we do something to help them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widen a smidge, then droop back down. “What do you mean?” she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shouldn\u0027t we . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do something to help them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t be ridiculous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m not. They\u0027re us. We\u0027re them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep surprise sets in her eyes. “No, they\u0027re not. They\u0027re way different from us. I don\u0027t care if they can speak, they\u0027re stil glorifi ed cattle.” She grips my hand tighter. “Gene, I don\u0027t mean to come off as coldhearted. But there\u0027s nothing we can do for them. They\u0027re going to die during the Hunt whether or not we use it to our advantage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could, I don\u0027t know, we could tel them not to leave the Dome. That the letter informing them about the Dome malfunctioning is all a hoax.” I run my hand through my hair, gripping it hard. “This is really hard, Ashley June.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she speaks again, her voice is softer. “If they die to night according to our plan, then at least their deaths give us a chance of a real life. But if we just sit on our hands, their deaths are not only meaningless, but will ensure our deaths. We can make their deaths meaningful, giving us a chance of a real life, Gene.” Her eyes are wide and pleading. “Our new life, Gene. Together. Is that so bad, to make something good come out of this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears start to wel in her eyes, and perhaps for the fi rst time in her life, she doesn\u0027t hold them back. They stream out and trail down her cheeks. I reach out with my arm, meaning to wipe them away with my sleeve; but she grabs my hand and places it on her cheek, palm pressed right atop the trail of tears. Her soft skin, the wetness of her tears, tingling my open palm. My heart, melting everywhere now, her tears intermingling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please?” she whispers, and the plea in her voice breaks me inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur shoulders touch. When I turn, she has already turned to face me. So close, I can see a tiny mole at the corner of her eye. I brush it lightly with my fi ngertips, back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s a mole. No amount of rubbing will wipe it away,” she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m not trying to wipe it away.” I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall I know is that my heart is bursting out and overfl owing, and I don\u0027t know what to do with myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifts her sleeveless arm slightly. Her eyes are wide, inviting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skin of her armpit is exposed, and she is waiting. She gazes at my elbow, then at me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-36.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
