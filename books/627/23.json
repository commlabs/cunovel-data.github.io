She was best friends with Rondi. Rondi had blonde hair, too, but she was missing her two front teeth. Allison had all of her teeth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Allison used to say that she knocked Rondi\u0027s teeth out. Allison was very pretty, so all the boys in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class teased her, especially Jason. But Allison said, \"Leave me alone or I\u0027ll knock your teeth out- like I did Rondi\u0027s.\" The boys didn\u0027t bother her after that.\n\u003cbr\u003e 86One day Allison brought a tangerine for lunch. She took the peel off in one piece.\n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Mush, the lunch teacher, walked up to her. \"Allison, may I have your tangerine?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Mush always gave food to the children. So Allison was happy to give her tangerine to Miss Mush.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Mush shoved it in her mouth and swallowed it in less than four seconds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Allison left the lunchroom and walked down to the library. The lunchroom was on the fifteenth story. The library was on the seventh. Allison already had her book. She just went to the library because it was nice and quiet there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The librarian walked up to Allison. \"What are you reading?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Allison told her the name of the book.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That sounds like a good book,\" said the librarian. \"I never read that one. May I borrow it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The librarian always lent books to the children. Allison was glad to be able to return the favor. She gave the librarian the book, then walked down the stairs, outside to the playground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All of Allison\u0027s friends were playing freeze tag. Allison didn\u0027t feel like playing. She reached into the pocket of her sky-blue windbreaker and took out a tennis ball. She bounced it a couple of times on the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis came up to her. \"Hi, Allison,\" he said. \"May I play with your tennis ball?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis always gave balls to the children. Allison happily gave her ball to Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis threw the ball all the way to the other side of the playground. Then he went chasing after it.\n\u003cbr\u003e 87Allison didn\u0027t feel like doing anything. Jason ran up and tagged her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re frozen,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get out of here before I knock your teeth out,\" said Allison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason shrugged his shoulders and left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Allison went back inside and up the thirty flights of stairs to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room. The lunch period wasn\u0027t over yet, but Allison didn\u0027t feel like doing anything else. She had given her food to the lunch teacher, her book to the librarian, and her ball to the yard teacher. She went inside her classroom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls was there. \"Oh, Allison, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027m having trouble with an arithmetic problem. Maybe you can help.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure,\" said Allison. Mrs. Jewls always helped the children with their problems. Allison was happy to help.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do you spellchair?\"asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"C-H-A-I-R,\" said Allison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, that\u0027s right,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I knew it wasn\u0027t C-H-A-R-E, but I couldn\u0027t remember what it was.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s not an arithmetic problem,\" said Allison. \"That\u0027s spelling.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, you are right again,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I always get the two mixed up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bell rang. The lunch period was over. Allison could hear the other children running up the stairs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Allison,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You learned a very important secret today, and I don\u0027t want you to tell any of the other children, not even Rondi.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e 88\"What was that?\" asked Allison. She didn\u0027t even know she had learned a secret. She loved secrets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You learned that children are really smarter than their teachers,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, that\u0027s no secret,\" said Allison. \"Everybody knows that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56829.html","bookId":627,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM"}
