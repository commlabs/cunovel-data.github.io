After fighting her way out of Brastov\u0027s lair, dragging Bond behind her, and enduring an anxious trudge back to the Via Eudosiana, Genevieve was not in a mood to deal gently with an uppity nosferatu nuisance like Penelope Churchward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate faltered, stepping back, allowing Penelope to hiss at Genevieve. The Englishwoman\u0027s blood was up, her fangs were out and her eyes were wide. She might have frightened an infant who has never seen Mummy pull a face, and was probably strong-willed enough to overwhelm her warm prey. But she didn\u0027t have the mettle to cow an elder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve didn\u0027t pop her claws or teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d fought enough during the night, and bled several of the Russians. She would not be frenzied, she would be purposeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope stepped forward, but Kate put a hand on her shoulder, holding her back. Kate nodded toward Charles, who was in his bath chair, barely alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first pink of dawn slipped into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Charles\u0027s face, Genevieve knew this was the last day. An icicle transfixed her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered her first sight of him, in a crowded room in 1888, at an inquest. He had seemed untouched by the squalor and violence all around, the only man in London prepared to do something, even at extreme cost, to make things better. Later, she learned he wasn\u0027t a Boy\u0027s Own Paper good-fellow, no muscular Christian hero, but a man who tried always to do the right thing even when there were no right things to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf men like him had stayed in fashion\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;if they\u0027d ever really been in fashion\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;this century would have been happier. Charles had refused to accept Dracula as his Lord, and had never let himself become like Dracula in his attempts to best the King Vampire. Edwin Winthrop and Hamish Bond, his successors, had learned too much from their enemy, had too much of Dracula in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was blood on Penelope\u0027s blouse. Her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She was trying...\u0027 Kate explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know what she was trying to do.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger in Penelope\u0027s eyes swirled and broke apart. She was frustrated and afraid, like everybody else. For a tiny moment, Genevieve wanted to hug her, not kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the idiot ruined it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He must be turned,\u0027 Penelope said. \u0027He is too far gone to be sensible about it. One of us must become his mother-in-darkness.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve went directly to Charles and knelt before him. His eyes were still open. She felt the ebb of him, dwindling, disappearing. But he was still thinking, still determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith great effort, he lifted a hand to her face and into her hair. She kissed his palm, her teeth against his flesh. She tasted him but did not break the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now, it wasn\u0027t too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even now, he wasn\u0027t afraid to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d often said he had nothing against vampires, but just didn\u0027t want to be one. Though she\u0027d long ago got over being ashamed of what she was, she understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve blamed the first dead woman in his life, the one who hadn\u0027t come back. Pamela.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought the offer into his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you want me to?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny, gracious, grateful shake of his head told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears started in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope and Kate came near, anger subsided, children again. At least there would be no cat-fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve swallowed her resentment of the intrusion. She had always had to share Charles, with duty, with memory, with others who had a better claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d lived four centuries before Charles. In that time, no one had come remotely as close to her heart, not her father-in-darkness, not those she had bled pale. She might live another four centuries, or more, after Charles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight spilled over the carpet, creeping toward them. She should warn Penelope, who was sensitive to the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve kissed Charles\u0027s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t blame his death on anyone, not Penelope, or Bond, or Brastov\u0027s goon, or Edwin Winthrop, or Prince Dracula. If they had disturbed his last days, then it was her fault for letting them near him, and his for not being able to concentrate on his own life to the exclusion of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had failed to persuade him to accept the Dark Kiss. But he let her know that she had not failed with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blood sang inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I love you forever,\u0027 he whispered, too soft for the others to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Forever?\u0027 she prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Forever,\u0027 he confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun rose up and bathed them all in stinging warmth. By the time it became unbearable, Charles was cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve knelt again, arranging his blanket around his legs, putting his hands into his lap, brushing back his hair, closing his eyes. It was like playing with a doll. Whatever Charles Beauregard had been was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood, walked away from Charles, and snapped a slap across Penelope\u0027s face, fetching the Englishwoman off balance, leaving an angry red mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s for what you did in 1899.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope didn\u0027t protest, didn\u0027t make fists. Something was gone out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was orange with dawnlight, and hazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them had to cry, so the others could comfort her, could cry themselves. Genevieve had thought it would be Kate, but it was her. From deep inside came sobs that racked her whole body. Penelope, the handprint fading fast, hesitated and stepped forward to embrace her, to whisper soothing nothings. They hugged and cried together, then broke apart and extended arms to Kate, who was more bewildered than bereft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate joined them, letting flow her own tears. They huddled together on a divan, blood and water on their faces, sobbing not for what was lost but for what must stay behind. The room was filled with light that made each random dust mote a spark. The dust danced around them all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-15.html","bookId":2295,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM"}
