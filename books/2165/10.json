As rude and ungrateful as it was, I was doing my best to ignore him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom, who\u0027d been on shift at the hospital when the ambulance brought me in with a police escort, kept randomly reaching over and stroking my arm or face - the good side at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if that motion reminded her that I was alive and breathing and only bruised. I hated myself for it, but it was starting to annoy me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was feeling the height of bitchiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head and back were aching something fierce, but the pain in my wrist and arm were the worst. After tons of poking, prodding, and half a dozen X-rays, nothing was broken. I had a sprained wrist and a torn tendon in my arm, in addition to numerous deep bruises and scratches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brace already encased my left hand and forearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was this elusive promise of pain medication that had yet to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police officers were kind, if a little too brusque. They asked every question imaginable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it was important I tell them everything I could remember, but the shock was beginning to wear off and the adrenaline had long since faded. All I wanted was to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey thought it was an attempted robbery gone wrong until I told them he hadn\u0027t asked for any money. After I\u0027d told them what the attacker had said, they believed he may have been ill or possibly a drug addict coming down from a high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the police were done asking me questions, they moved on to Daemon. They seemed to be on familiar terms with him. One even clapped him on the shoulder and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were buddies. How sweet. I didn\u0027t get a chance to listen to what he was telling them because my mom had taken over the interrogation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted them all to stop and go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Swartz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprised to hear my last name, I was pulled out of my own thoughts. One of the younger deputies was at my bed again. I couldn\u0027t remember his name, and I was too tired to even look for a name tag. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we are pretty much done for tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you remember anything else, please call us immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and wished I hadn\u0027t. I grimaced as pain shot through my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, are you okay?\" Mom asked, her tone pitched in worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My head, it hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood. \"I\u0027ll go find the doctor so we can get those meds in you.\" She smiled gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you won\u0027t feel a thing.\" That is what I needed, wanted - would love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deputy turned to leave but stopped. \"I don\u0027t think you have anything to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crackle of his radio interrupted anything else he was about say. The dispatcher\u0027s voice broke through the static. \"All available units, we have code 18 on Well Springs Road. Victim is a female, approximately sixteen to seventeen years of age. Possible DOA. EMT on the scene.\" Whoa. What were the odds that I\u0027d be attacked on the same night another teenage girl died in such a small town? It had to be a coincidence. I glanced at Daemon. His eyes were narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d heard it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" the deputy said, then clicked on his radio. \"Unit 414 leaving hospital and en route.\" He turned from the bed, still talking into the radio, and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the exception of Daemon lounging against the wall by the curtain, the room was empty. He raised a curious brow at me. I chewed on my lower lip and turned my head away, causing another ripple of pain to go from one temple to the other. I stayed like that until my mother came rushing back to my bed with the doctor in tow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, Dr. Michaels has good news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you already know, you have no broken bones and it also looks like you don\u0027t have a concussion. Once we can release you, you can go home and rest,\" he said, rubbing the area where speckles of gray peppered the hair near his temples. He glanced at Daemon before focusing on me again. \"Now, if you start experiencing dizziness or nausea, vision issues or loss of memory, we need you back here immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said, eyeing the pills. I\u0027d agree to anything at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the doctor left, Mom hovered as I took the small plastic cup and pills from her, swallowing them quickly. I didn\u0027t even care what they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the verge of tears again, I reached for my mom\u0027s hand, but was interrupted by an excited voice in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee rushed into the room, her face pale and worried. \"Oh no, Katy, are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Just a little banged up.\" I lifted my arm and gave a weak smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe this has happened.\" She turned to her brother. \"How could this have happened? I thought you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dee,\" Daemon warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe darted away from her brother, lingering on the other side of my bed. \"I\u0027m so sorry about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not your fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, but I could tell she was harboring guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom\u0027s name was called over the loudspeaker. Her face strained, she excused herself and promised to be back in a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you leave soon?\" Dee asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dragged my attention back to her. \"I guess so.\" I paused. \"As long as my mom comes back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Did...you see the guy who attacked you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, he said some crazy stuff.\" I closed my eyes, and it seemed to take longer than normal to reopen them. \"Something about finding \u0027them\u0027. I don\u0027t know.\" I shifted on the hard bed. The bruises didn\u0027t hurt as much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weird.\" Dee paled. \"I hope you can leave soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate hospitals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nose wrinkled. \"They have...such a strange smell to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve always told Mom, but she thinks I make it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee shook her head. \"No, it\u0027s not you. They have this...musty smell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyelids flickered open again and focused on Daemon. He had his eyes closed as he leaned his head against the wall but I knew he was listening to everything. Dee talked about taking me home if my mom couldn\u0027t leave. I was struck again by the twins. Daemon and Dee didn\u0027t belong here, but I did. I could blend easily with the whitewashed walls and pale green curtains. I was as plain as the linoleum, but these two seemed to light the room with their flawless beauty and demanding presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, the medication was kicking in. I was poetic. And high. Bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee shifted, and my view of Daemon was blocked. I immediately felt panic rising and struggled to move until I could see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pulse quieted the moment my gaze settled on his still form. He didn\u0027t fool me. He was trying to pretend he was relaxed, leaning against the wall like that with his eyes closed and all, but his jaw was clenched and I knew he was like a coiled spring, filled with vigilant energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re handling this well. I\u0027d be totally freaked out, rocking in the corner somewhere.\" Dee smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll freak out,\" I murmured. \"Give me time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure how much time passed before my mother returned with a bothered expression on her pretty face. \"Honey, I\u0027m sorry to disappear on you,\" she said in a rush. \"There was a bad accident, and they\u0027re bringing in multiple victims. You may have to stay here awhile. I have to stay, at least until we determine if we need to move them to a larger hospital. A bunch of nurses are off, and the hospital isn\u0027t staffed to handle this type of crisis.\" I stared at her dumbfounded. I felt my bitchiness gaining ground. Screw everyone else. I\u0027d nearly died tonight, and I wanted my mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Swartz, we can take her home,\" Dee said. \"I\u0027m sure she wants to go home. I know I would and it would be no problem for us to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI begged Mom with my eyes to take me home herself. \"I would feel better if she was here or with me, in case she does have a concussion and, well, I don\u0027t want anything else to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would never let anything happen.\" Dee\u0027s gaze was steady. \"We\u0027ll take her right home and stay with her. I promise.\" I could tell Mom was wrestling with the need to keep me close and her responsibility to those injured in the accident. I felt contrite for making her choose. Plus I knew seeing me in the hospital had to be a painful reminder of Dad. My eyes darted to Daemon, and the bitchiness eased from my shoulders. I gave my mom a weak smile. \"It\u0027s okay, Mom. I\u0027m feeling a lot better, and I\u0027m sure nothing else is wrong. I don\u0027t want to stay here.\" Mom sighed, wringing her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe this would happen on tonight of all nights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name was called over the loudspeaker once more. She did something very uncharacteristic and cussed. \"Dammit!\" Dee immediately jumped up. \"We can do it, Mrs. Swartz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom glanced at me and then the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, but if she seems in any way out of character,\" she turned to me, \"or if your head starts hurting more, call me immediately. No!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall 9-1-1.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" I reassured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned down and kissed me swiftly on the cheek. \"Get some rest, honey. I love you.\" Then she was off, rushing down the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee grinned impishly as I looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I said. \"But you don\u0027t have to stay with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"Yes, I will. No arguments.\" She dashed from my side. \"I\u0027ll go see what I can do to spring you from this place.\" I blinked and she was gone, but Daemon had inched closer. His expression was stoic as he stood at the foot of my bed. I closed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to insult me again? Because I\u0027m not up to...pear for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you meant par.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pear. Par. Whatever.\" I opened my eyes and found him staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m great.\" I yawned loudly. \"Your sister acts as if this is her fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t like it when people get hurt,\" he said softly. \"And people tend to get hurt around us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill snaked around my insides. Even though his expression was blank, his words were heavy with pain. \"What does that mean?\" He didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee came back then, a grin on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re good to go, with doctor\u0027s orders and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, let\u0027s get you home.\" Daemon moved to the side of my bed and, surprisingly, he helped me sit up and then stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumbled a few steps, having to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, I feel buzzed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s face was sympathetic. \"I think the pills are starting to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I...slurring yet?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\" Dee laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, exhausted to the point of almost falling over. My body was whisked up into the air and against Daemon\u0027s hard chest before being deposited gently into a wheelchair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hospital rules,\" Daemon explained, and wheeled me out, stopping only long enough for me to sign a couple of forms before steering me toward the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped me into Dee\u0027s backseat, mindful of the arm brace, by carrying me again and placing me into the rear. \"I can walk, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" He walked around and slid in next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to keep on my side of the car and my head up, because I doubted he\u0027d appreciate me lying on him, but once Daemon settled next to me, my head sort of fell to his chest. He stiffened for a moment and then placed an arm around my shoulder. The warmth of him quickly seeped into my bones. It felt right, at that moment, to be nestled against him. I felt safe, and it reminded me of the heat that had come off his hand earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuggled the good side of my face against the soft fabric of his T-shirt and thought his arm tightened around me, but that could\u0027ve been the pills. By the time the car started, I was already drifting away, one thought colliding into the next without any coherence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure if I was dreaming or not when I heard Dee speak, her voice sounding muted and far away. \"I told her not go. I could still see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" There was a pause. \"Don\u0027t worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not going to let anything happen this time. I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence followed by more hushed whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did something, didn\u0027t you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s stronger now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t...mean to.\" Daemon shifted slightly, smoothing the hair off my face. \"It just happened. Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral long moments passed, and I struggled to stay awake. But the events of the night were weighing too heavily on me, and finally I succumbed to the warmth of Daemon and the blissful silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened my eyes again, daylight peeked through the heavily curtained living room, catching small particles of dust that hung in a lazy pattern over the peaceful head of Dee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a few feet away, curled up on the recliner in a deep sleep. Her small hands were folded neatly under her cheek and lips slightly parted. She looked more like a china doll than a real person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and immediately winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spark of pain cleared the haze from my head and the fear from last night doused my veins in ice water. I lay there for several moments, taking deep, calming breaths as I tried to gain control of my spiraling emotions. I was alive - thanks to Daemon, who apparently was also my pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head was in his lap. One of his hands was resting on the curve of my hip. My heart sped up. He couldn\u0027t have been comfortable, sitting up all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stirred. \"You okay, Kitten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daemon?\" I whispered, trying to gain control of my spiraling emotions. \"I...sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to sleep on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay.\" He helped me sit up. The room spun a little. \"Are you okay?\" he asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You stayed here all night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" was all he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered Dee volunteering but not him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaking up with my head in his lap was the last thing I\u0027d expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember anything?\" he asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest squeezed tight. I nodded, expecting it to hurt more than it did. \"I was attacked last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone tried to mug you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that wasn\u0027t right. I remembered a man grabbing my purse, then falling down, but he hadn\u0027t wanted my money. \"He wasn\u0027t trying to mug me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kat - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I tried standing up, but his arm returned, forming a band of steel around me that I couldn\u0027t break. \"He didn\u0027t want my money, Daemon. He wanted them.\" Daemon stiffened. \"That doesn\u0027t make any sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit.\" I frowned as I moved my arm and found that the splint was heavy. \"But he kept asking about where they were and about a trace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guy was insane,\" he said, voice low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You realize that, right? That he wasn\u0027t right in the head. That nothing he said means anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. He didn\u0027t seem crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to beat the crap out of a girl isn\u0027t crazy enough for you?\" His brows rose. \"I\u0027m curious what you think is crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what did you mean?\" He shifted, careful not to jar me, which kind of surprised me. \"He was a random lunatic, but you\u0027re going to make it bigger than it is, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not making this anything.\" I took a steadying breath. \"Daemon, that wasn\u0027t a normal lunatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you\u0027re an expert in crazy people now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A month with you and I feel I have a master\u0027s degree in the subject,\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaring at him, I scooted away. My head swam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" He reached out, placing a hand on my good arm. \"Kat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook his hand off. \"Yeah, I\u0027m okay.\" Shoulders stiff, he stared straight ahead. \"I know you\u0027re probably messed up after what happened last night, but don\u0027t make this into something it\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daemon - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want Dee worried that there is an idiot out there attacking girls.\" His eyes were hard. Cold. \"Do you understand me?\" My lip trembled. Part of me wanted to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother part wanted to whale on him. So all his caring was about his sister? How silly of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes locked. There was such intensity in his, as if he were willing me to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee yawned loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked away, breaking contact first. Of course, score one for Daemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning!\" Dee chirped as one or both of her legs dropped to the ground, sounding surprisingly heavy for someone as slender as she was. \"Have you guys been awake long?\" Another sigh, much louder and more annoyed than the first pushed through Daemon\u0027s hard lips. \"No, Dee, we just woke up and were talking. You were snoring so loudly we couldn\u0027t stay asleep any longer.\" Dee snorted. \"I doubt that. Katy, are you feeling...okay this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027m a little sore and stiff, but overall okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled but her eyes were still hooded with guilt. Which made no sense. She tried to smooth down her curls, but they sprung back into disarray as soon as she removed her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m going to make you breakfast.\" Before I could respond, she dashed off to the kitchen and I heard numerous doors open and close, pots and pans clanging against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stood and stretched. The muscles of his back were taut under his shirt. I looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I care more about my sister than I do anything in this universe,\" he said quietly. Each word punctuated by truth. \"I\u0027d do anything for her, to make sure she\u0027s happy and she\u0027s safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease don\u0027t worry her with crazy stories.\" I felt infinitely small. \"You\u0027re a dick, but I won\u0027t say anything to her.\" When I looked up, I found it hard to concentrate when his eyes were as bright as they were. \"Okay? Happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flickered over his face. Anger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegret? \"Not really. Not at all.\" Neither of us looked away again. There was a heavy quality to the air, tangible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daemon!\" Dee called from the kitchen. \"I need your help!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should go see what she\u0027s doing before she destroys your kitchen.\" He rubbed his hands down his face. \"It\u0027s possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping quiet, I followed him out into the hallway, where the light spilled in from the open door. I winced at the abrupt brightness and suddenly remembered I hadn\u0027t brushed my hair or my teeth yet. I cringed away from Daemon. \"I think I need to...go.\" He raised an eyebrow at me. \"Go...where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my cheeks turn hot. \"Upstairs. I need a shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, he didn\u0027t fire back with the door I\u0027d left open. He nodded and disappeared into the kitchen. At the top of the stairs, my fingers mindlessly went to my lips and then another shiver rolled through me. How close to dying did I come last night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she really going to be okay?\" I heard Dee ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, she\u0027ll be fine,\" Daemon responded patiently. \"You have nothing to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing is happening. Everything was taken care of when I came back here.\" I crept closer to the landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look like that. Nothing will happen to you.\" Daemon sighed with real frustration this time. \"Or her, okay?\" Another gap of silence followed. \"We should\u0027ve expected something like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you?\" Dee asked, her voice rising sharply. \"Because I was trying not to, I was trying to hope that we could have a friend - a real one - without them getting...\" Their voices lowered, becoming unintelligible. Were they talking about me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to be, but that didn\u0027t make sense. I stood in absolute confusion, trying to figure out what they could be talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon\u0027s voice rose, \"Who knows, Dee?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will see how it plays out.\" He paused and then laughed. \"I think you are beating those eggs to death. Here, let me have them.\" I listened a few more moments as they bantered back and forth like normal before I peeled myself away from my spot. Without warning, another stolen conversation quickly resurfaced. The night before, as I coasted in and out of consciousness in the car, I\u0027d overheard both of them whispering worries that I couldn\u0027t comprehend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to shrug off the nagging feeling that they were hiding something. I hadn\u0027t forgotten Dee\u0027s weird aversion to me going to the library. Or the strange light I\u0027d seen outside the library that reminded me so much of the light in the woods, when I\u0027d seen the bear and passed out, something that I\u0027d never done before in my life. And then there was the day at the lake, when Daemon had turned into Aquaman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked numbly to my bathroom and flipped on the light, expecting to see my face busted up. I tilted my head to the side, a startled gasp escaping my throat. I knew my cheek had been scraped raw last night. The pain I remembered. And my eye swollen shut. But my eye was only slightly bruised, my cheek pink, as if new skin had already grown. My gaze drifted along my neck. The bruises there were faint, as if the attack had happened days ago and not last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the heck?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wounds were almost healed, with the exception of my encased arm...but that too barely ached. Another loose memory poked through, of Daemon leaning over me in the road, his hands warm. Had his hands...? No way. I shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I stared at myself, I couldn\u0027t shake the nagging feeling that something was going on here. The twins knew it. Things didn\u0027t add up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsidian-lux-1/page-10.html","bookId":2165,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:30 PM"}
