{"id":13586,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 5 Cheater","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"BELLA, WHY DON\u0027T YOU TAKE OFF,\" MIKE SUGGESTED, his eyes focused off to the side, notreally looking at me. I wondered how long that had been going on without me noticing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It was a slow afternoon at Newton\u0027s. At the moment there were only two patrons in the store, dedicatedbackpackers from the sound of their conversation. Mike had spent the last hour going through the prosand cons of two brands of lightweight packs with them. But they\u0027d taken a break from serious pricing toindulge in trying to one-up each other with their latest tales from the trail. Their distraction had given Mikea chance to escape.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I don\u0027t mind staying,\" I said. I still hadn\u0027t been able to sink back into my protective shell of numbness,and everything seemed oddly close and loud today, like I\u0027d taken cotton out of my ears. I tried to tuneout the laughing hikers without success.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I\u0027m telling you,\" said the thickset man with the orange beard that didn\u0027t match his dark brown hair. \"I\u0027veseen grizzlies pretty close up in Yellowstone, but they had nothing on this brute.\" His hair was matted,and his clothes looked like they\u0027d been on his back for more than a few days. Fresh from the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Not a chance. Black bears don\u0027t get that big. The grizzlies you saw were probably cubs.\" The secondman was tall and lean, his face tanned and wind-whipped into an impressive leathery crust.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Seriously, Bella, as soon as these two give up, I\u0027m closing the place down,\" Mike murmured.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 \"If you want me to go…\" I shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"On all fours it was taller than you,\" the bearded man insisted while I gathered my things together. \"Big asa house and pitch-black. I\u0027m going to report it to the ranger here. People ought to be warned—thiswasn\u0027t up on the mountain, mind you—this was only a few miles from the trailhead.\"Leather-face laughed and rolled his eyes. \"Let me guess—you were on your way in? Hadn\u0027t eaten realfood or slept off the ground in a week, right?\"\"Hey, uh, Mike, right?\" the bearded man called, looking toward us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"See you Monday,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Yes, sir,\" Mike replied, turning away.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Say, have there been any warnings around here recently—about black bears?\"\"No, sir. But it\u0027s always good to keep your distance and store your food correctly. Have you seen thenew bear-safe canisters? They only weigh two pounds…\"The doors slid open to let me out into the rain. I hunched over inside my jacket as I dashed for my truck.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The rain hammering against my hood sounded unusually loud, too, but soon the roar of the enginedrowned out everything else.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I didn\u0027t want to go back to Charlie\u0027s empty house. Last night had been particularly brutal, and I had nodesire to revisit the scene of the suffering. Even after the pain had subsided enough for me to sleep, itwasn\u0027t over. Like I\u0027d told Jessica after the movie, there was never any doubt that I would havenightmares.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I always had nightmares now, every night. Not nightmares really, not in the plural, because it was alwaysthe same nightmare. You\u0027d think I\u0027d get bored after so many months, grow immune to it. But the dreamnever failed to horrify me, and only ended when I woke myself with screaming. Charlie didn\u0027t come in tosee what was wrong anymore, to make sure there was no intruder strangling me or something likethat—he was used to it now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My nightmare probably wouldn\u0027t even frighten someone else. Nothing jumped out and screamed, \"Boo!\"There were no zombies, no ghosts, no psychopaths. There was nothing, really. Only nothing. Just theendless maze of moss-covered trees, so quiet that the silence was an uncomfortable pressure against myeardrums. It was dark, like dusk on a cloudy day, with only enough light to see that there was nothing tosee. I hurried through the gloom without a path, always searching, searching, searching, getting morefrantic as the time stretched on, trying to move faster, though the speed made me clumsy… Then therewould come the point in my dream—and I could feel it coming now, but could never seem to wakemyself up before it hit—when I couldn\u0027t remember what it was that I was searching for. When I realizedthat there was nothing to search for, and nothing to find. That there never had been anything more thanjust this empty, dreary wood, and there never would be anything more for me… nothing but nothing…That was usually about when the screaming started.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I wasn\u0027t paying attention to where I was driving—just wandering through empty, wet side roads as Iavoided the ways that would take me home—because I didn\u0027t have anywhere to go.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I wished I could feel numb again, but I couldn\u0027t remember how I\u0027d managed it before. The nightmare wasnagging at my mind and making me think about things that would cause me pain. I didn\u0027t want toremember the forest. Even as I shuddered away from the images, I felt my eyes fill with tears and the aching begin around the edges of the hole in my chest. I took one hand from the steering wheel andwrapped it around my torso to hold it in one piece.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It will be as if I\u0027d never existed. The words ran through my head, lacking the perfect clarity of myhallucination last night. They were just words, soundless, like print on a page. Just words, but they rippedthe hole wide open, and I stomped on the brake, knowing I should not drive while this incapacitated.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I curled over, pressing my face against the steering wheel and trying to breathe without lungs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I wondered how long this could last. Maybe someday, years from now—if the pain would just decreaseto the point where I could bear it—I would be able to look back on those few short months that wouldalways be the best of my life. And, if it were possible that the pain would ever soften enough to allow meto do that, I was sure that I would feel grateful for as much time as he\u0027d given me. More than I\u0027d askedfor, more than I\u0027d deserved. Maybe someday I\u0027d be able to see it that way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But what if this hole never got any better? If the raw edges never healed? If the damage was permanentand irreversible?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I held myself tightly together. As if he\u0027d never existed, I thought in despair. What a stupid andimpossible promise to make! He could steal my pictures and reclaim his gifts, but that didn\u0027t put thingsback the way they\u0027d been before I\u0027d met him. The physical evidence was the most insignificant part of theequation. I was changed, my insides altered almost past the point of recognition. Even my outsideslooked different—my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under myeyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that—if I were beautiful, and seen from adistance—I might even pass for a vampire now. But I was not beautiful, and I probably looked closer toa zombie.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As if he\u0027d never existed? That was insanity. It was a promise that he could never keep, a promise thatwas broken as soon as he\u0027d made it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I thumped my head against the steering wheel, trying to distract myself from the sharper pain.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It made me feel silly for ever worrying about keeping my promise. Where was the logic in sticking to anagreement that had already been violated by the other party? Who cared if I was reckless and stupid?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　There was no reason to avoid recklessness, no reason why I shouldn\u0027t get to be stupid.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I laughed humorlessly to myself, still gasping for air. Reckless in Forks—now there was a hopelessproposition.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The dark humor distracted me, and the distraction eased the pain. My breath came easier, and I wasable to lean back against the seat. Though it was cold today, my forehead was damp with sweat.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I concentrated on my hopeless proposition to keep from sliding back into the excruciating memories. Tobe reckless in Forks would take a lot of creativity—maybe more than I had. But I wished I could findsome way… I might feel better if I weren\u0027t holding fast, all alone, to a broken pact. If I were anoath-breaker, too. But how could I cheat on my side of the deal, here in this harmless little town? Ofcourse, Forks hadn\u0027t always been so harmless, but now it was exactly what it had always appeared tobe. It was dull, it was safe.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I stared out the windshield for a long moment, my thoughts moving sluggishly—I couldn\u0027t seem to makethose thoughts go anywhere. I cut the engine, which was groaning in a pitiful way after idling for so long,and stepped out into the drizzle.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 The cold rain dripped through my hair and then trickled across my cheeks like freshwater tears. It helpedto clear my head. I blinked the water from my eyes, staring blankly across the road.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　After a minute of staring, I recognized where I was. I\u0027d parked in the middle of the north lane of RussellAvenue. I was standing in front of the Cheneys\u0027 house—my truck was blocking their driveway—andacross the road lived the Markses. I knew I needed to move my truck, and that I ought to go home. Itwas wrong to wander the way I had, distracted and impaired, a menace on the roads of Forks. Besides,someone would notice me soon enough, and report me to Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As I took a deep breath in preparation to move, a sign in the Markses\u0027 yard caught my eye—it was just abig piece of cardboard leaning against their mailbox post, with black letters scrawled in caps across it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Sometimes, kismet happens.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Coincidence? Or was it meant to be? I didn\u0027t know, but it seemed kind of silly to think that it wassomehow fated, that the dilapidated motorcycles rusting in the Markses\u0027 front yard beside thehand-printed FOR SALE, AS IS sign were serving some higher purpose by existing there, right where Ineeded them to be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　So maybe it wasn\u0027t kismet. Maybe there were just all kinds of ways to be reckless, and I only now hadmy eyes open to them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Reckless and stupid. Those were Charlie\u0027s two very favorite words to apply to motorcycles.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Charlie\u0027s job didn\u0027t get a lot of action compared to cops in bigger towns, but he did get called in on trafficaccidents. With the long, wet stretches of freeway twisting and turning through the forest, blind cornerafter blind corner, there was no shortage of that kind of action. But even with all the huge log-haulersbarreling around the turns, mostly people walked away. The exceptions to that rule were often onmotorcycles, and Charlie had seen one too many victims, almost always kids, smeared on the highway.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He\u0027d made me promise before I was ten that I would never accept a ride on a motorcycle. Even at thatage, I didn\u0027t have to think twice before promising. Who would want to ride a motorcycle here? It wouldbe like taking a sixty-mile-per-hour bath.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　So many promises I kept…It clicked together for me then. I wanted to be stupid and reckless, and I wanted to break promises.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Why stop at one?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　That\u0027s as far as I thought it through. I sloshed through the rain to the Markses\u0027 front door and rang thebell.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　One of the Marks boys opened the door, the younger one, the freshman. I couldn\u0027t remember his name.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　His sandy hair only came up to my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He had no trouble remembering my name. \"Bella Swan?\" he asked in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"How much do you want for the bike?\" I panted, jerking my thumb over my shoulder toward the salesdisplay.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Are you serious?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Of course I am.\"\"They don\u0027t work.\" I sighed impatiently—this was something I\u0027d already inferred from the sign. \"How much?\"\"If you really want one, just take it. My mom made my dad move them down to the road so they\u0027d getpicked up with the garbage.\"I glanced at the bikes again and saw that they were resting on a pile of yard clippings and dead branches.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Are you positive about that?\"\"Sure, you want to ask her?\"It was probably better not to involve adults who might mention this to Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"No, I believe you.\"\"You want me to help you?\" he offered. \"They\u0027re not light.\"\"Okay, thanks. I only need one, though.\"\"Might as well take both,\" the boy said. \"Maybe you could scavenge some parts.\"He followed me out into the downpour and helped me load both of the heavy bikes into the back of mytruck. He seemed eager to be rid of them, so I didn\u0027t argue.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"What are you going to do with them, anyway?\" he asked. \"They haven\u0027t worked in years.\"\"I kind of guessed that,\" I said, shrugging. My spur-of-the-moment whim hadn\u0027t come with a plan intact.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Maybe I\u0027ll take them to Dowling\u0027s.\"He snorted. \"Dowling would charge more to fix them than they\u0027d be worth running.\"I couldn\u0027t argue with that. John Dowling had earned a reputation for his pricing; no one went to himexcept in an emergency. Most people preferred to make the drive up to Port Angeles, if their car wasable. I\u0027d been very lucky on that front—I\u0027d been worried, when Charlie first gifted me my ancient truck,that I wouldn\u0027t be able to afford to keep it running. But I\u0027d never had a single problem with it, other thanthe screaming-loud engine and the fifty-five-mile-per-hour maximum speed limit. Jacob Black had kept itin great shape when it had belonged to his father, Billy…Inspiration hit like a bolt of lightning—not unreasonable, considering the storm. \"You know what? That\u0027sokay. I know someone who builds cars.\"\"Oh. That\u0027s good.\" He smiled in relief.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He waved as I pulled away, still smiling. Friendly kid.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I drove quickly and purposefully now, in a hurry to get home before there was the slightest chance ofCharlie appearing, even in the highly unlikely event that he might knock off early. I dashed through thehouse to the phone, keys still in hand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Chief Swan, please,\" I said when the deputy answered. \"It\u0027s Bella.\"\"Oh, hey, Bella,\" Deputy Steve said affably. \"I\u0027ll go get him.\"I waited.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"What\u0027s wrong, Bella?\" Charlie demanded as soon as he picked up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 \"Can\u0027t I call you at work without there being an emergency?\"He was quiet for a minute. \"You never have before. Is there an emergency?\"\"No. I just wanted directions to the Blacks\u0027 place—I\u0027m not sure I can remember the way. I want to visitJacob. I haven\u0027t seen him in months.\"When Charlie spoke again, his voice was much happier. \"That\u0027s a great idea, Bells. Do you have a pen?\"The directions he gave me were very simple. I assured him that I would be back for dinner, though hetried to tell me not to hurry. He wanted to join me in La Push, and I wasn\u0027t having that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　So it was with a deadline that I drove too quickly through the storm-darkened streets out of town. Ihoped I could get Jacob alone. Billy would probably tell on me if he knew what I was up to.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　While I drove, I worried a little bit about Billy\u0027s reaction to seeing me. He would be too pleased. InBilly\u0027s mind, no doubt, this had all worked out better than he had dared to hope. His pleasure and reliefwould only remind me of the one I couldn\u0027t bear to be reminded of. Not again today, I pleaded silently.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was spent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The Blacks\u0027 house was vaguely familiar, a small wooden place with narrow windows, the dull red paintmaking it resemble a tiny barn. Jacob\u0027s head peered out of the window before I could even get out of thetruck. No doubt the familiar roar of the engine had tipped him off to my approach. Jacob had been verygrateful when Charlie bought Billy\u0027s truck for me, saving Jacob from having to drive it when he came ofage. I liked my truck very much, but Jacob seemed to consider the speed restrictions a shortcoming.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He met me halfway to the house.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Bella!\" His excited grin stretched wide across his face, the bright teeth standing in vivid contrast to thedeep russet color of his skin. I\u0027d never seen his hair out of its usual ponytail before. It fell like black satincurtains on either side of his broad face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob had grown into some of his potential in the last eight months. He\u0027d passed that point where the softmuscles of childhood hardened into the solid, lanky build of a teenager; the tendons and veins hadbecome prominent under the red-brown skin of his arms, his hands. His face was still sweet like Iremembered it, though it had hardened, too—the planes of his cheekbones sharper, his jaw squared off,all childish roundness gone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Hey, Jacob!\" I felt an unfamiliar surge of enthusiasm at his smile. I realized that I was pleased to see him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　This knowledge surprised me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I smiled back, and something clicked silently into place, like two corresponding puzzle pieces. I\u0027dforgotten how much I really liked Jacob Black.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He stopped a few feet away from me, and I stared up at him in surprise, leaning my head back thoughthe rain pelted my face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"You grew again!\" I accused in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He laughed, his smile widening impossibly. \"Six five,\" he announced with self-satisfaction. His voice wasdeeper, but it had the husky tone I remembered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Is it ever going to stop?\" I shook my head in disbelief. \"You\u0027re huge.\" \"Still a beanpole, though.\" He grimaced. \"Come inside! You\u0027re getting all wet.\"He led the way, twisting his hair in his big hands as he walked. He pulled a rubber band from his hippocket and wound it around the bundle.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Hey, Dad,\" he called as he ducked to get through the front door. \"Look who stopped by.\"Billy was in the tiny square living room, a book in his hands. He set the book in his lap and wheeledhimself forward when he saw me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Well, what do you know! It\u0027s good to see you, Bella.\"We shook hands. Mine was lost in his wide grasp.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"What brings you out here? Everything okay with Charlie?\"\"Yes, absolutely. I just wanted to see Jacob—I haven\u0027t seen him in forever.\"Jacob\u0027s eyes brightened at my words. He was smiling so big it looked like it would hurt his cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Can you stay for dinner?\" Billy was eager, too.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"No, I\u0027ve got to feed Charlie, you know.\"\"I\u0027ll call him now,\" Billy suggested. \"He\u0027s always invited.\"I laughed to hide my discomfort. \"It\u0027s not like you\u0027ll never see me again. I promise I\u0027ll be back againsoon—so much you\u0027ll get sick of me.\" After all, if Jacob could fix the bike, someone had to teach mehow to ride it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Billy chuckled in response. \"Okay, maybe next time.\"\"So, Bella, what do you want to do?\" Jacob asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Whatever. What were you doing before I interrupted?\" I was strangely comfortable here. It was familiar,but only distantly. There were no painful reminders of the recent past.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob hesitated. \"I was just heading out to work on my car, but we can do something else…\"\"No, that\u0027s perfect!\" I interrupted. \"I\u0027d love to see your car.\"\"Okay,\" he said, not convinced. \"It\u0027s out back, in the garage.\"Even better, I thought to myself. I waved at Billy. \"See you later.\"A thick stand of trees and shrubbery concealed his garage from the house. The garage was no more thana couple of big preformed sheds that had been bolted together with their interior walls knocked out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Under this shelter, raised on cinder blocks, was what looked to me like a completed automobile. Irecognized the symbol on the grille, at least.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"What kind of Volkswagen is that?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"It\u0027s an old Rabbit—1986, a classic.\"\"How\u0027s it going?\" \"Almost finished,\" he said cheerfully. And then his voice dropped into a lower key. \"My dad made goodon his promise last spring.\"\"Ah,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He seemed to understand my reluctance to open the subject. I tried not to remember last May at theprom. Jacob had been bribed by his father with money and car parts to deliver a message there. Billywanted me to stay a safe distance from the most important person in my life. It turned out that hisconcern was, in the end, unnecessary. I was all too safe now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But I was going to see what I could do to change that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Jacob, what do you know about motorcycles?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He shrugged. \"Some. My friend Embry has a dirt bike. We work on it together sometimes. Why?\"\"Well…\" I pursed my lips as I considered. I wasn\u0027t sure if he could keep his mouth shut, but I didn\u0027t havemany other options. \"I recently acquired a couple of bikes, and they\u0027re not in the greatest condition. Iwonder if you could get them running?\"\"Cool.\" He seemed truly pleased by the challenge. His face glowed. \"I\u0027ll give it a try.\"I held up one finger in warning. \"The thing is,\" I explained, \"Charlie doesn\u0027t approve of motorcycles.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Honestly, he\u0027d probably bust a vein in his forehead if he knew about this. So you can\u0027t tell Billy.\"\"Sure, sure.\" Jacob smiled. \"I understand.\"\"I\u0027ll pay you,\" I continued.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　This offended him. \"No. I want to help. You can\u0027t pay me.\"\"Well… how about a trade, then?\" I was making this up as I went, but it seemed reasonable enough. \"Ionly need one bike—and I\u0027ll need lessons, too. So how about this? I\u0027ll give you the other bike, and thenyou can teach me.\"\"Swee-eet.\" He made the word into two syllables.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Wait a sec—are you legal yet? When\u0027s your birthday?\"\"You missed it,\" he teased, narrowing his eyes in mock resentment. \"I\u0027m sixteen.\"\"Not that your age ever stopped you before,\" I muttered. \"Sorry about your birthday.\"\"Don\u0027t worry about it. I missed yours. What are you, forty?\"I sniffed. \"Close.\"\"We\u0027ll have a joint party to make up for it.\"\"Sounds like a date.\"His eyes sparkled at the word.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I needed to reign in the enthusiasm before I gave him the wrong idea—it was just that it had been a longtime since I\u0027d felt so light and buoyant. The rarity of the feeling made it more difficult to manage.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 \"Maybe when the bikes are finished—our present to ourselves,\" I added.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Deal. When will you bring them down?\"I bit my lip, embarrassed. \"They\u0027re in my truck now,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Great.\" He seemed to mean it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Will Billy see if we bring them around?\"He winked at me. \"We\u0027ll be sneaky.\"We eased around from the east, sticking to the trees when we were in view of the windows, affecting acasual-looking stroll, just in case. Jacob unloaded the bikes swiftly from the truck bed, wheeling themone by one into the shrubbery where I hid. It looked too easy for him—I\u0027d remembered the bikes beingmuch, much heavier than that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"These aren\u0027t half bad,\" Jacob appraised as we pushed them through the cover of the trees. \"This onehere will actually be worth something when I\u0027m done—it\u0027s an old Harley Sprint.\"\"That one\u0027s yours, then.\"\"Are you sure?\"\"Absolutely.\"\"These are going to take some cash, though,\" he said, frowning down at the blackened metal. \"We\u0027ll haveto save up for parts first.\"\"We nothing,\" I disagreed. \"If you\u0027re doing this for free, I\u0027ll pay for the parts.\"\"I don\u0027t know…\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I\u0027ve got some money saved. College fund, you know.\" College, schmollege, I thought to myself. Itwasn\u0027t like I\u0027d saved up enough to go anywhere special—and besides, I had no desire to leave Forksanyway. What difference would it make if I skimmed a little bit off the top?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob just nodded. This all made perfect sense to him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As we skulked back to the makeshift garage, I contemplated my luck. Only a teenage boy would agreeto this: deceiving both our parents while repairing dangerous vehicles using money meant for my collegeeducation. He didn\u0027t see anything wrong with that picture. Jacob was a gift from the gods.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/144/5924.html","bookId":339,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:32:59 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:32:59 AM"}
