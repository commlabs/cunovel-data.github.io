They were studying a large map of the countryside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scarred giant said, \"It\u0027s obvious that Miro is heading north toward Basque country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That could mean Burgos, Vitoria, Logrono, Pamplona, or San Sebastian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSan Sebastian, Acoca thought. But I have to catch him before he reaches there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear the voice on the phone: You\u0027re running out of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not afford to fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were driving through the rolling hills that heralded the approach to Burgos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaime was quiet behind the wheel. When he finally spoke, he said, \"Felix, when we get to San Sebastian, I want to make arrangements to get Rubio away from the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded. \"It will be a pleasure. It will drive them crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan said, \"What about Sister Lucia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you say that she had been captured too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaime said wryly, \"Yes, but your Sister Lucia turned out to be a criminal wanted by the police for murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe news shook Megan. She remembered how Lucia had taken charge and persuaded them to hide in the hills. She liked Sister Lucia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said stubbornly, \"As long as you\u0027re going to rescue Rubio, you should save them both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the devil kind of nun is this? Jaime wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was right. Smuggling Rubio and Lucia out from under the nose of the police would be wonderful propaganda and would make headlines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmparo had sunk into a sullen silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, in the distance on the road ahead of them were three army trucks filled with soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better get off this road,\" Jaime decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the next intersection he turned off the highway and headed east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Santo Dominga de la Calzada is up ahead. There\u0027s an old deserted castle there. We can spend the night in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long they could see its outline from the distance, high on a hill. Jaime took a side road, avoiding the town, and the castle loomed larger and larger as they approached it. A few hundred yards from it was a lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaime stopped the car. \"Everybody out, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were all out of the car, Jaime pointed the steering wheel down the hill toward the lake, jammed the accelerator down, released the hand brake, and jumped clear. They stood there watching as the car disappeared into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan was about to ask him how they were going to get to Logrono. She stopped herself. Foolish question. He will steal another car, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group turned to examine the abandoned castle. There was a huge stone wall circling it, and it had crumbling turrets on each corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the old days,\" Felix told Megan, \"princes used these castles as prisons for their enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jaime is an enemy of the state, and if he is caught, there will be no prison for him. Only death, Megan thought. He has no fear. She remembered his words: I have faith in what I\u0027m fighting for. I have faith in my men, and in my guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked up the stone steps that led to the front gate, which was made of iron. It had rusted away so badly that they were able to push it open and squeeze through into a courtyard paved in stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of the castle seemed enormous to Megan. There were narrow passageways and rooms everywhere, and facing the outside were gunports, from which the defenders of the castle could repel attackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStone steps led to a second floor, where there was another claustro, an inner patio. The stone steps narrowed as they walked up to a third floor, and then a fourth. The castle was deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, at least there are plenty of places to sleep here,\" Jaime said. \"Felix and I will go forage for food. Pick out your rooms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men started downstairs again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmparo turned to Megan. \"Come on, Sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked down the hall and the rooms all looked alike to Megan. They were empty stone cubicles, cold and austere, some larger than others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmparo picked out the largest. \"Jaime and I will sleep here.\" She looked at Megan and asked slyly, \"Would you like to sleep with Felix?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan looked at her and said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or perhaps you\u0027d rather sleep with Jaime.\" Amparo stepped closer to Megan. \"Don\u0027t get any ideas, Sister. He\u0027s much too much man for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to concern yourself. I\u0027m not interested.\" And even as she said it, Megan wondered whether Jaime Miro was much too much man for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jaime and Felix returned to the castle an hour later, Jaime was clutching two rabbits and Felix was carrying firewood. Felix bolted the front door behind them. Megan watched as the men made a fire in the large fireplace. Jaime skinned and cooked the rabbits on a spit over the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry we can\u0027t offer you ladies a real feast,\" Felix said, \"but we\u0027ll eat well in Logrono. Meanwhile - enjoy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had finished their meager meal, Jaime said, \"Let\u0027s get to sleep. I want to get an early start in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmparo said to Jaime, \"Come, querido. I have our bedroom picked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bueno. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan watched them go upstairs, hand in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix turned to Megan. \"Do you have your bedroom, Sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan and Felix walked up the stairs together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night,\" Megan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed Megan a sleeping bag. \"Good night, Sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan wanted to ask Felix about Jaime, but she hesitated. Jaime might think she was prying, and for some reason, Megan wanted very much for him to have a good opinion of her. That\u0027s really odd, Megan thought. He\u0027s a terrorist, a murderer, a bank robber, and heaven only knows what else, and I\u0027m worried about whether the man thinks well of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even as Megan thought it, she knew that there was another side to it. He\u0027s a freedom fighter. He robs banks to finance his cause. He risks his life for what he believes in. He\u0027s a brave man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Megan passed their bedroom, she heard Jaime and Amparo inside laughing. She walked into the small, bare room where she was to sleep and knelt on the cold stone floor. \"Dear God, forgive me for - \" Forgive me for what? What have I done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in her life, Megan was unable to pray. Was God up there listening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crawled into the sleeping bag Felix had given her, but sleep was as remote as the cold stars she could see through the narrow window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I doing here? Megan wondered. Her thoughts drifted back to the convent...the orphanage. And before the orphanage? Why was I left there? I don\u0027t really believe that my father was a brave soldier or a great bullfighter. But wouldn\u0027t it be wonderful to know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost dawn before Megan drifted off to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the prison in Aranda de Duero, Lucia Carmine was a celebrity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a big fish in our little pond,\" the guard told her. \"The Italian government is sending someone to escort you home. I\u0027d like to escort you to my house, puta bonita. What bad thing did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cut off a man\u0027s balls for calling me puta bonita. Tell me - how is my friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia said a silent prayer of gratitude. She looked around the stone walls of her grim, gray cell and thought: How the hell do I get out of here? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-32.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
