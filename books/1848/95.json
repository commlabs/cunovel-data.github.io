I\u0027ll do anything you ask of me… anything… but don\u0027t hurt them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExasperated, Royce moved her away from him and grasped her chin. \"Jennifer, the only wound that\u0027s going to be inflicted tonight is to my pride. It galls me beyond measure to have to raise my gate, lower the drawbridge, and let your father strut into my hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t care about his pride,\" Jenny argued wildly, \"when you breached Merrick\u0027s tower and took me from there. How do you think that made him feel. Is your own pride so great you can\u0027t put it aside, just for a few hours, just this once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe single word, spoken with such quiet conviction, finally snapped Jenny from her mindless panic. Drawing a long, steadying breath, she leaned her forehead against his chest and nodded. \"I know you won\u0027t harm my family. You gave me your word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said reassuringly, gathering her into his arms for a swift kiss. Turning to the door, he paused with his hand upon the handle. \"Stay in here, unless I send for you,\" he ordered implacably. \"I\u0027ve sent for the friar to bear witness that we\u0027re well and truly married, but I imagine the emissaries from our kings will want to see you to ascertain that you\u0027re safe and unharmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" she agreed and quickly added, \"Father will be in a dreadful mood, but William is gentle and seldom loses his temper. I\u0027d like to see him before they leave—to talk to him and send a message to Brenna. Will you let him come up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"If it. seems wise, I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasculine voices raised in anger thundered in the hall, carrying to the bedchamber, where Jenny paced, waiting, listening, praying. Her father\u0027s voice, blustering and furious, was joined by the angry voices of her brothers, as well as Lord Hastings, and Lord Dugal. Royce\u0027s deep voice, hard and authoritative, rose above the din, and then there was silence… eerie, foreboding silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing she could observe what was happening if she left the bedchamber and went out onto the gallery, Jenny walked to the door and then hesitated. Royce had given her his oath not to harm any of her family, and all he had asked of her in return was that she remain in here. It seemed wrong not to honor his wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnatching her hand away from the door, Jenny turned away from it, then she hesitated again. She could, however, honor his wish and still be better able to hear by simply opening the door a bit without leaving the bedchamber. Cautiously, she turned the handle, opening the door a scant two inches…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friar Gregory has verified that the couple is wed,\" Lord Hastings, the English emissary from King Henry\u0027s court was saying. \" \u0027Twould seem Claymore adhered to the letter of the agreement, if not precisely to the spirit of it, while you, Lord Merrick, by plotting to hide your daughter away from her rightful husband, broke faith with the agreement both in spirit and in fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scottish emissary mumbled something soothing and conciliatory, but Jennifer\u0027s father\u0027s voice rose in fury. \"You English swine! My daughter chose to enter a cloister, she pleaded with me to send her away. She was prepard to make the marriage, but \u0027twas her holy right to choose God as her lord if she wished. No king can deny her the right to pledge herself to a life of seclusion and devotion to God, and you know it! Bring her down here,\" he shouted. \"She\u0027ll tell you \u0027twas her own choice!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words slashed Jenny\u0027s heart like a jagged sword. Evidently, he really had intended to lock her away for the rest of her life, and without ever telling her what he meant to do; he\u0027d been willing to sacrifice her life for revenge against his enemy. When it came down to it, he had more hatred for a stranger than he had love for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring her down here! She\u0027ll tell you I speak the truth!\" her father thundered. \"I demand she be brought down! The Barbarian objects because he knows his wife loathes him and that she\u0027ll confirm what I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce\u0027s deep voice was filled with such calm conviction that Jenny felt tenderness blend with the pain of her father\u0027s betrayal inside of her. \"Jennifer has told me the truth, and the truth is that she never collaborated in your scheme. If you have any feeling for her at all, you will not force her to come down here and call you a liar to your face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the liar!\" Malcolm bellowed. \"Jennifer will prove it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I regret the need to cause your wife unhappiness,\" Lord Hastings interrupted, \"but both Lord Dugal and I agree the only way to get to the bottom of this is to hear what she herself has to say. No, your grace,\" he said instantly, \"under the circumstances, \u0027twould be best if Lord Dugal and I escort the lady down here—to… er… prevent the claim of coercion by either party. Kindly direct Lord Dugal and me to her chamber…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny closed the door and slumped against it, laying her cheek against the iron banding, feeling as if she was being torn asunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall was filled with tension and hostility as she walked forward between her two escorts. Men-at-arms from Merrick, Claymore, and those from King Henry and King James lined the walls. Near the fireplace, Jennifer\u0027s father and her brothers stood across from Royce, and all of them were watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your grace—\" Lord Hastings began, turning to Jennifer, but her father interrupted impatiently. \"My dear child,\" he said, \"Tell these idiots that \u0027twas your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewish to flee to the solace of a cloister, rather than endure life with this… this bastard. Tell them you asked me, begged me to let you do it, that you knew—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew nothing, \"Jenny cried, unable to endure the feigned look of honesty and love on his face. \"Nothing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny saw Royce start forward, saw the look of quiet reassurance in his gray eyes, but her father wasn\u0027t finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold!\" he roared, advancing on Jennifer with a mixture of fury and disbelief on his face. \"What do you mean, you knew nothing of this? The night I told you you were to wed this beast, you begged me to let you go back to Belkirk abbey.\" Jenny paled as her forgotten plea, spoken in terror and dismissed as impossible by her father, screamed through her mind… I\u0027ll go back to the abbey, or to my Aunt Elinor, or anywhere you say … \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-95.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM"}
