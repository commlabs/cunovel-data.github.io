LOSS AND GAIN.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Our victory in the Court of Queen\u0027s Bench was an unmitigated loss to Sir Henry Tyler and his backers, for it threw upon them the whole costs of the prosecution. It was also a loss to ourselves; for I have it on the best authority that, if we had been found guilty, Lord Coleridge would have made his sentence concurrent with Judge North\u0027s, and shifted us from the criminal to the civil side of the prison, where we should have enjoyed each other\u0027s society, worn our own clothes, eaten our own food, seen our friends frequently, received and answered letters, and spent our time in rational occupations. To the Freethought cause, however, our victory was a pure gain. As I had anticipated, the press gave our new trial a good deal of attention. The Daily News printed a leading article on the case, calling on the Home Secretary to remit the rest of our sentence. The Times published a long and admirable report of my defence, as well as of Lord Coleridge\u0027s summing-up, and predicted that the trial would be historical, \"chiefly because of the remarkable defence made by one of the defendants.\" A similar prediction appeared in the Manchester Weekly Times, according to which \"the defendant Foote argued his case with consummate skill.\" Across the Atlantic, the New York World said that \"Mr. Foote, in particular, delivered a speech which, for closeness of argument and vividness of presentation, has not often been equalled.\" Even the grave and reverend Westminster Review found \"after reading what the Lord Chief Justice himself characterises as Mr. Foote\u0027s very striking and able speech, that the editor of the Freethinker is very far from being the vulgar and uneducated disputant which the Spectator appears to have supposed him.\" Other Liberal papers, like the Pall Mall Gazette and the Referee, that had at first joined in the chorus of execration over the fallen \"blasphemer,\" now found that my sentence was \"monstrous.\" \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So true is it that nothing succeeds like success! I did not let these compliments turn my head. My speeches at the Old Bailey were little, if anything, inferior to the one I made in the Court of Queen\u0027s Bench. There was no change in me, but only in the platform I spoke from. The great fact to my mind was this, that given an impartial judge, and a fair trial, it was difficult to convict any Freethinker of \"blasphemy\" if he could only defend himself with some courage and address. This fact shone like a star of hope in the night of my suffering. As I said in one of my three letters from prison: \"For the first time juries have disagreed, and chances are already slightly against a verdict of Guilty. Now the jury is the hand by which the enemy grasps us, and when we have absolutely secured the twelfth man we shall have amputated the thumb.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On May 1 the following letter from Admiral Maxse appeared in the Daily News:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;

\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;I know something of Mr. Foote, and I am quite certain he would\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;not say anything to shock a refined interpretation of religion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;

Directly he heard of my infamous sentence he wrote me a brave letter, which the prison rules forbade my receiving, stating that he would join in any agitation for my release, or for the repeal of the wretched law under which I was suffering \"the utmost martyrdom which society can at present impose.\" I have always regarded Admiral Maxse as one of the purest and noblest of our public men, and I valued his sympathy even more than his assistance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Further correspondence appeared in the Daily News, and the Liberal papers called on Sir William Harcourt to intervene. Memorials for our release flowed in from all parts of the country. One of these deserves especial mention. The signatures were procured, at great expense of time and labor, by Dr. E. B. Aveling and an eminent psychologist who desired to avoid publicity. Among them I find the following names:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Admiral Maxse George Bullen C. Crompton, Q.C.

Brooke\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I doubt whether such a memorial, signed by so many illustrious men, was ever before presented to a Home Secretary for the release of any prisoners. But it made no impression on Sir William Harcourt, for the simple reason that the signatories were not politicians, but only men of genius. As the Weekly Dispatch said, \"Sir William Harcourt never does the right thing when he has a chance of going wrong.\" The Echo also \"regretted\" the Home Secretary\u0027s decision, while the Pall Mall Gazette, then under the editorship of Mr. John Morley, concluded its article on the subject by saying, \"The fact remains that Mr. Foote is suffering a scandalously excessive punishment, and that the Home Office must now share the general condemnation that has hitherto been confined to the judge.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On July 11 a mass meeting was held in St. James\u0027s Hall to protest against our continued imprisonment. Despite the summer weather, the huge building was crammed with people, every inch of standing room being occupied, and thousands turned away from the doors. Letters of sympathy were sent by Canon Shuttleworth, Admiral Maxse and Mr. P. A. Taylor M.P. Among the speakers were the Rev. W. Sharman, the Rev. S. D. Headlam, the Rev. E. M. Geldart, Mr. C. Bradlaugh M.P., Mrs. Annie Besant, Dr. E. B. Aveling, Mr. Joseph Symes, Mr. Moncure D. Conway and Mr. H. Burrows. The greatest enthusiasm prevailed, and the resolutions were carried with only two dissentients.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Still Sir William Harcourt made no sign. At last Mr. Peter Taylor, the honored member for Leicester, publicly interrogated the Home Secretary in the House of Commons.

Sir William Harcourt has told many lies in his time, but this was the most brazen of all. He knew we were not prosecuted for obscenity; he knew there was not a suggestion of indecency in our indictment; and he had before him the distinct language of the Lord Chief Justice of England, exonerating us from the slander. Yet he deliberately libelled us, in a place where his utterances are privileged, in order to conciliate the Tories and please the bigots. Some of the Radical papers protested against this wanton misrepresentation, but I am not aware that a single Christian journal censured the lie which was used to justify persecution.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Freethinkers have not forgotten Sir William Harcourt, nor have I. Some day we may be able to punish him for the insult. Meanwhile, I venture to think that if the member for Derby and the editor of the Freethinker were placed side by side, an unprejudiced stranger would have little difficulty in deciding which of the two was the more likely to be bestial.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Poor Mr. Ramsey, not knowing his man, innocently petitioned the Home Secretary from prison, pointing out that he was tried and imprisoned for blasphemy, asking to be released at once, and offering to supply Sir William Harcourt with fresh copies of our Christmas Number for a new trial for obscenity. Of course he received no reply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My counsel, Mr. Cluer, gallantly defended my reputation in the columns of the Daily News, and he was supported by one of the Jury, who wrote as follows:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\"SIR,—From the reference in your short leader on the subject,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;it appears that the Home Secretary, in answer to Mr. Taylor,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;declined to consent to the release of Messrs.

Sir William Harcourt declines to release them on the ground that they have published an obscene libel. It is not usual to keep Englishmen in gaol on the ground that they committed an offence of which they have not been convicted, and against which they have had no opportunity of defending themselves.\" But Sir William Harcourt thought otherwise, and kept us in prison, acting at once as prosecutor, witness, jury and judge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Gladstone was appealed to, but he \"regretted he could do nothing,\" presumably because we were only Englishmen and not Bulgarians. An answer to this piece of callous hypocrisy came from the London clubs. One resolution passed by the Combined Radical Clubs of Chelsea, representing thousands of working men, characterised our continued imprisonment as an indelible stigma on the Liberal Government.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3222/87851.html","bookId":704,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:52:36 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:52:36 PM"}
