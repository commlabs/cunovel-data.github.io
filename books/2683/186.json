About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to piece together,\" Palakon says, overly patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think that whoever sent her didn\u0027t want you making contact with Jamie Fields, and by extension Bobby Hughes, once you arrived in London,\" Crater says. \"We think she was provided as a distraction. As an alternative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Provided?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Provided? What in the f**k does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ward-\" Palakon starts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jamie told me she knows her,\" I say suddenly. \"That she knew her.

Or in what context she knew her?\" Palakon asks. \"Did Jamie Fields let you know what their connection was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...,\" I\u0027m murmuring. \"No...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you ask?\" Crater and Delta exclaim at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I say, dazed, murmuring. \"No... I\u0027m sorry... no...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind me Russell says, \"Palakon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes,\" Palakon says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the TV screen the camera keeps panning across the length of the deck and, whenever Marina glances at it, always back to Lorrie Wallace. But once it stays for several moments on Marina, who gazes at it almost as if the camera were daring her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you get this?\" I\u0027m asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not an original,\" Delta says. \"It\u0027s a copy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an answer?\" I ask, jaw clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter how we got it,\" Delta snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Wallaces took that,\" I say, staring at the screen. \"Turn it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Wallaces?\" I hear someone ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" I\u0027m nodding. \"The Wallaces. They were this couple from England. This English couple. I forget what they do. What they told me. I think she opens restaurants. Whatever. Turn it off, just turn it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you meet them?\" Palakon asks, pressing a button, causing the TV to flash black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. They were just on the ship. They introduced themselves to me. We had dinner.\" I\u0027m moaning, rubbing my hands over my face. \"They said they knew my father-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome kind of connection is automatically made and resonates among the three men sitting across from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit,\" Delta says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately Crater mutters, \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon keeps nodding involuntarily, his mouth opening slightly so he can take in more air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelta furiously writes down something on the folder resting in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,\" Crater keeps muttering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Japanese man lights a cigarette, his face illuminated briefly by the match.

They wait for me to continue, to elaborate, but since I can\u0027t, Palakon coaxes me by asking, \"But the hat disappeared from the QE2, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod slowly. \"But maybe...
