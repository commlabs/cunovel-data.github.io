{"id":68623,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eBel Arvardan, fresh from his interview with the press, on the occasion of his forthcoming expedition to Earth, felt at supreme peace with all the hundred million star systems that composed the all-embracing Galactic Empire. It was no longer a question of being known in this sector or that. Let his theories concerning Earth be proven and his reputation would be assured on every inhabited planet of the Milky Way, on every planet that Man had set foot through the hundreds of thousands of years of expansion through space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese potential heights of renown, these pure and rarefied intellectual peaks of science were coming to him early, yet not easily. He was scarcely thirty-five, but already his career had been packed with controversy. It had begun with an explosion that had rocked the halls of the University of Arcturus when he first graduated as Senior Archaeologist from that institution at the unprecedented age of twenty-three. The explosion-no less effective for being immaterial -consisted of the rejection for publication, on the part of the Journal of the Galactic Archaeological Society, of his Senior Dissertation. It was the first time in the history of the university that a Senior Dissertation had been rejected. It was equally the first time in the history of that staid professional journal that a rejection had been couched in such blunt terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo a non-archaeologist, the reason for such anger against an obscure and dry little pamphlet, entitled On the Antiquity of Artifacts in the Sirius Sector with Considerations of the Application Thereof to the Radiation Hypothesis of Human Origin, might seem mysterious. What was involved, however, was that from the first Arvardan adopted as his own the hypothesis advanced earlier by certain groups of mystics who were more concerned with metaphysics than with archaeology; i.e., that Humanity had originated upon some single planet and had radiated by degrees throughout the Galaxy. This was a favorite theory of the fantasy writers of the day, and the b��te noire of every respectable archaeologist of the Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Arvardan became a force to be reckoned with by even the most respectable, for within the decade he had become the recognized authority on the relics of the pre-Empire cultures still left in the eddies and quiet backwaters of the Galaxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, he had written a monograph on the mechanistic civilization of the Rigel Sector, where the development of robots created a separate culture that persisted for centuries, till the very perfection of the metal slaves reduced the human initiative to the point where the vigorous fleets of the War Lord. Moray, took easy control. Orthodox archaeology insisted on the evolution of Human types independently on various planets and used such atypical cultures, as that on Rigel, as examples of race differences that had not yet been ironed out through intermarriage. Arvardan destroyed such concepts effectively by showing that Rigellian robot culture was but a natural outgrowth of the economic and social forces of the times and of the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there were the barbarous worlds of Ophiuchus, which the orthodox had long upheld as samples of primitive Humanity not yet advanced to the stage of interstellar travel. Every textbook used those worlds as the best evidence of the Merger Theory; i.e., that Humanity was the natural climax of evolution on any world based upon a water-oxygen chemistry with proper intensities of temperature and gravitation; that each independent strain of Humanity could intermarry; that with the discovery of interstellar travel, such intermarriage took place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan, however, uncovered traces of the early civilization that had preceded the then thousand-year-old barbarism of Ophiuchus and proved that the earliest records of the planet showed traces of interstellar trade. The final touch came when he demonstrated beyond any doubt that Man had emigrated to the region in an already civilized state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was after that that the /. Gal. Arch. Soc. (to give the Journal its professional abbreviation) decided to print Arvardan\u0027s Senior Dissertation more than ten years after it had been presented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the pursuit of his pet theory led Arvardan to probably the least significant planet of the Empire-the planet called Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan landed at that one spot of Empire on all Earth, that patch among the desolate heights of the plateaus north of the Himalayas. There where radioactivity was not, and never had been, there gleamed a palace that was not of Terrestrial architecture. In essence it was a copy of the viceregal palaces that existed on more fortunate worlds. The soft lushness of the grounds was built for comfort. The forbidding rocks had been covered with topsoil, watered, immersed in an artificial atmosphere and climate-and converted into five square miles of lawns and flower gardens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cost in energy involved in this performance was terrific by Earthly calculations, but it had behind it the completely incredible resources of tens of millions of planets, continually growing in number. (It has been estimated that in the Year of the Galactic Era 827 an average of fifty new planets each day were achieving the dignity of provincial status, this condition requiring the attainment of a population of five hundred millions.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this spot of non-Earth lived the Procurator of Earth, and sometimes, in this artificial luxury, he could forget that he was a Procurator of a rathole world and remember that he was an aristocrat of great honor and ancient family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wife was perhaps less often deluded, particularly at such times as, topping a grassy knoll, she could see in the distance the sharp, decisive line separating the grounds from the fierce wilderness of Earth. It was then that not all the colored fountains (luminescent at night, with an effect of cold liquid fire), flowered walks, or idyllic groves could compensate for the knowledge of their exile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo perhaps Arvardan was welcomed even more than protocol might call for. To the Procurator, after all, Arvardan was a breath of Empire, of spaciousness, of boundlessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Arvardan for his part found much to admire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"This is done well-and with taste. It is amazing how a touch of the central culture permeates the most outlying districts of our Empire, Lord Ennius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnnius smiled. \"I\u0027m afraid the Procurator\u0027s court here on Earth is more pleasant to visit than to live in. It is but a shell that rings hollowly when touched. When you have considered myself and family, the staff, the Imperial garrison, both here and in the important planetary centers, together with an occasional visitor such as yourself, you have exhausted all the touch of the central culture that exists. It seems scarcely enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in the colonnade in the dying afternoon, with the sun glinting downward toward the mist-purpled jags of the horizon and the air so heavy with the scent of growing things that its motions were merely sighs of exertion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, of course, not quite suitable for even a Procurator to show too great a curiosity about the doings of a guest, but that does not take into account the inhumanity of day-to-day isolation from all the Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnnius said, \"Do you plan to stay for some time, Dr. Arvardan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As to that, Lord Ennius, I cannot surely say. I have come ahead of the rest of my expedition in order to acquaint myself with Earth\u0027s culture and to fulfill the necessary legal requirements. For instance, I must obtain the usual official permission from you to establish camps at the necessary sites, and soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh granted, granted! But when do you start digging? And whatever can you possibly expect to find on this miserable heap of rubble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope, if all goes well, to be able to set up camp in a few months. And as to this world-why, it\u0027s anything but a miserable heap. It is absolutely unique in the Galaxy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unique?\" said the Procurator stiffly. \"Not at all! It is a very ordinary world. It is more or less of a pigpen of a world, or a horrible hole of a world, or a cesspool of a world, or almost any other particularly derogative adjective you care to use. And yet, with all its refinement of nausea, it cannot even achieve uniqueness in villainy, but remains an ordinary, brutish peasant world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" said Arvardan, somewhat taken aback by the energy of the inconsistent statements thus thrown at him, \"the world is radioactive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what of that? Some thousands of planets in the Galaxy are radioactive, and some are considerably more so than Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this moment that the soft-gliding motion of the mobile cabinet attracted their attention. It came to a halt within easy hand reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnnius gestured toward it and said to the other, \"What would you prefer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not particular. A lime twist, perhaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That can be handled. The cabinet will have the ingredients...With or without Chensey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just about a tang of it,\" said Arvardan, and held up his forefinger and thumb, nearly touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have it in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the bowels of the cabinet (perhaps the most universally popular mechanical offspring of human ingenuity) a bartender went into action-a non-human bartender whose electronic soul mixed things not by jiggers but by atom counts, whose ratios were perfect every time, and who could not be matched by all the inspired artistry of anyone merely human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall glasses appeared from nowhere, it seemed, as they waited in the appropriate recesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan took the green one and, for a moment, felt the chill of it against his cheek. Then he placed the rim to his lips and tasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just right,\" he said. He placed the glass in the well-fitted holder in the arm of his chair and said, \"Thousands of radioactive planets, Procurator, just as you say, but only one of them is inhabited. This one, Procurator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well\"-Ennius smacked his lips over his own drink and seemed to lose some of his sharpness after contact with its velvet-\"perhaps it is unique in that way. It\u0027s an unenviable distinction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it is not just a question of statistical uniqueness.\" Arvardan spoke deliberately between occasional sips. \"It goes further; it has tremendous potentialities. Biologists have shown, or claim to have shown, that on planets in which the intensity of radioactivity in the atmosphere and in the seas is above a certain point life will not develop...Earth\u0027s radioactivity is above that point by a considerable margin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting. I didn\u0027t know that. I imagine that this would constitute definite proof that Earth life is fundamentally different from that of the rest of the Galaxy...That should suit you, since you\u0027re from Sirius.\" He seemed sardonically amused at this point and said in a confidential aside, \"Do you know that the biggest single difficulty involved in ruling this planet lies in coping with the intense anti-Terrestrialism that exists throughout the entire Sirius Sector? And the feeling is returned with interest on the part of these Earthmen. I\u0027m not saying, of course, that anti-Terrestrialism doesn\u0027t exist in more or less diluted form in many places in the Galaxy, but not like on Sirius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan\u0027s response was impatient and vehement. \"Lord Ennius, I reject the implication. I have as little intolerance in me as any man living. I believe in the oneness of humanity to my very scientific core, and that includes even Earth. And all life is fundamentally one, in that it is all based upon protein complexes in colloidal dispersion, which we call protoplasm. The effect of radioactivity that I just talked of does not apply simply to some forms of human life, or to some forms of any life. It applies to all life, since it is based upon the quantum mechanics of the protein molecules. It applies to you, to me, to Earthmen, to spiders, and to germs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, proteins, as I probably needn\u0027t tell you, are immensely complicated groupings of amino acids and certain other specialized compounds, arranged in intricate three-dimensional patterns that are as unstable as sunbeams on a cloudy day. It is this instability that is life, since it is forever changing its position in an effort to maintain its identity-in the manner of a long rod balanced on an acrobat\u0027s nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this marvelous chemical, this protein, must be first built up out of inorganic matter before life can exist. So, at the very beginning, by the influence of the sun\u0027s radiant energy upon those huge solutions we call oceans, organic molecules gradually increase in complexity from methane to formaldehyde and finally to sugars and starches in one direction, and from urea to amino acids and proteins in another direction. It\u0027s a matter of chance, of course, these combinations and disintegrations of atoms, and the process on one world may take millions of years while on another it may take only hundreds. Of course it is much more probable that it will take millions of years. In fact, it is most probable that it will end up never happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now physical organic chemists have worked out with great exactness all the reaction chain involved, particularly the energetics thereof; that is, the energy relationships involved in each atom shift. It is now known beyond the shadow of a doubt that several of the crucial steps in the building of life require the absence of radiant energy. If this strikes you as queer, Procurator, I can only say that photochemistry (the chemistry of reactions induced by radiant energy) is a well-developed branch of the science, and there are innumerable cases of very simple reactions which will go in one of two different directions depending upon whether it takes place in the presence or absence of quanta of light energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In ordinary worlds the sun is the only source of radiant energy, or, at least, by far the major source. In the shelter of clouds, or at night, the carbon and nitrogen compounds combine and recombine, in the fashions made possible by the absence of those little bits of energy hurled into the midst of them by the sun-like bowling bans into the midst of an infinite number of infinitesimal tenpins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But on radioactive worlds, sun or no sun, every drop of water-even in the deepest night, even five miles undersparkles and bursts with darting gamma rays, kicking up the carbon atoms-activating them, the chemists say-and forcing certain key reactions to proceed only in certain ways, ways that never result in life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan\u0027s drink was gone. He placed the empty glass on the waiting cabinet. It was withdrawn instantly into the special compartment where it was cleaned, sterilized, and made ready for the next drink\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another one?\" asked Ennius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask me after dinner,\" said Arvardan. \"I\u0027ve had quite enough for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnnius tapped a tapering fingernail upon the arm of his chair and said, \"you make the process sound quite fascinating, but if an is as you say, then what about the life on Earth? How did it develop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, you see, even you are beginning to wonder. But the answer, I think, is simple. Radioactivity, in excess of the minimum required to prevent life, is still not necessarily sufficient to destroy life already formed. It might modify it, but, except in comparatively huge excess, it will not destroy it...You see, the chemistry involved is different. In the first case, simple molecules must be prevented from building up, while in the second, already-formed complex molecules must be broken down. Not at all the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get the application of that at all,\" said Ennius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it obvious? Life on Earth originated before the planet became radioactive. My dear Procurator, it is the only possible explanation that does not involve denying either the fact of life on Earth or enough chemical theory to upset half the science.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnnius gazed at the other in amazed disbelief. \"But you can\u0027t mean that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because how can a world become radioactive? The life of the radioactive elements in the planet\u0027s crust are in the millions and billions of years. I\u0027ve learned that, at least, during my university career, even in a pre-law course. They must have existed indefinitely in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there is such a thing as artificial radioactivity, Lord Ennius-even on a huge scale. There are thousands of nuclear reactions of sufficient energy to create all sorts of radioactive isotopes. Why, if we were to suppose that human beings might use some applied nuclear reaction in industry, without proper controls, or even in war, if you can imagine anything like a war proceeding on a single planet, most of the topsoil could, conceivably, be converted into artificially radioactive materials. What do you say to that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun had expired in blood on the mountains, and Ennius\u0027s thin face was ruddy in the reflection of that process. The gentle evening wind stirred, and the drowsy murmur of the carefully selected varieties of insect life upon the palace grounds was more soothing than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnnius said, \"It sounds very artificial to me. For one thing, I can\u0027t conceive using nuclear reactions in war or letting them get out of control to this extent in any manner-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally, sir, you tend to underestimate nuclear reactions because you\u0027re living in the present, when they\u0027re so easily controlled. But what if someone-or some army-used such weapons before the defense had been worked out? For instance, it\u0027s like using fire bombs before anyone knew that water or sand would put out fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" said Ennius, \"you sound like Shekt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Shekt?\" Arvardan looked up quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An Earthman. One of the few decent ones-I mean, one that a gentleman can speak to. He\u0027s a physicist. He told me once that Earth might not always have been radioactive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah...Well, that\u0027s not unusual, since the theory is certainly not original with me. It\u0027s part of the Book of the Ancients, which contains the traditional, or mythical, history of prehistoric Earth. I\u0027m saying what it says, in a way, except that I\u0027m putting its rather elliptical phraseology into equivalent scientific statements.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Book of the Ancients?\" Ennius seemed surprised, and a little upset. \"Where did you get that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here and there. It wasn\u0027t easy, and I only obtained parts. Of course all this traditional information about non-radioactivity, even where completely unscientific, is important to my project...Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the book IS the revered text of a radical sect of Earthmen. It is forbidden for Outsiders to read it. I wouldn\u0027t broadcast the fact that you did, either, while you\u0027re here. Non-Earthmen, or Outsiders, as they call them, have been lynched for less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make it sound as if the Imperial police power here is defective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is in cases of sacrilege. A word to the wise, Dr. Arvardan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA melodious chime sounded a vibrant note that seemed to harmonize with the rustling whisper of the trees. It faded out slowly, lingering as though in love with its surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnnius rose. \"I believe it is time for dinner. Will you join me, sir, and enjoy such hospitality as this husk of Empire on Earth can afford?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn occasion for an elaborate dinner came infrequently enough. An excuse, even a slim one, was not to be missed. So the courses were many, the surroundings lavish, the men polished, and the women bewitching. And, it must be added, Dr. B. Arvardan of Baronn, Sirius, was lionized to quite an intoxicating extent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan took advantage of his dinner audience during the latter portion of the banquet to repeat much of what he had said to Ennius, but here his exposition met with markedly less success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA florid gentleman in colonel\u0027s uniform leaned toward him with that marked condescension of the military man for the scholar and said, \"If I interpret your expressions rightly, Dr. Arvardan, you are trying to tell us that these hounds of Earth represent an ancient race that may once have been the ancestors of all humanity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hesitate, Colonel, to make the flat assertion, but I think there is an interesting chance that it might be so. A year from now I confidently hope to be able to make a definite judgment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you find that they are, Doctor, which I strongly doubt,\" rejoined the colonel, \"you will astonish me beyond measure. I have been stationed on Earth now for four years, and my experience is not of the smallest. I find these Earthmen to be rogues and knaves, every one of them. They are definitely our inferiors intellectually. They lack that spark that has spread humanity throughout the Galaxy. They are lazy, superstitious, avaricious, and with no trace of nobility of soul. I defy you, or anyone, to show me an Earthman who can in any way be an equal of any true man-yourself or myself, for instance-and only then will I grant you that he may represent a race who once were our ancestors. But, until then, please excuse me from making any such assumption.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA portly man at the foot of the table said suddenly, \"They say the only good Earthman is a dead Earthman, and that even then they generally stink,\" and laughed immoderately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan frowned at the dish before him and said, without looking up, \"I have no desire to argue racial differences, especially since it is irrelevant in this case. It is the Earthman of prehistory that I speak of. His descendants of today have been long isolated, and have been subjected to a most unusual environment-yet I still would not dismiss them too casually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Ennius and said, \"My Lord, I believe you mentioned an Earthman before dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did? I don\u0027t recall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A physicist. Shekt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affret Shekt, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, yes. Have you heard of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I have. It\u0027s been bothering me all through dinner, ever since you mentioned him, but I think I\u0027ve placed him. He wouldn\u0027t be at the Institute of Nuclear Research at-Oh, what\u0027s the name of that damned place?\" He struck at his forehead with the heel of his palm once or twice. \" At Chica?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the right person. What about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only this. There was an article by him in the August issue of Physical Reviews. I noticed it because I was looking for anything that had to do with Earth, and articles by Earthmen in journals of Galactic circulation are very rare...In any case, the point I am trying to make is that the man claims to have developed something he calls a Synapsifier, which is supposed to improve the learning capacity of the mammalian nervous system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" said Ennius a bit too sharply. \"I haven\u0027t heard about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can find you the reference. It\u0027s quite an interesting article; though, of course, I can\u0027t pretend to understand the mathematics involved. What he has done, however, has been to treat some indigenous animal form on Earth-rats, I believe they call them-with the Synapsifier and then put them to solving a maze. You know what I mean: learning the proper pathway through a tiny labyrinth to some food supply. He used non-treated rats as controls and found that in every case the Synapsified rats solved the maze in less than one third the time...Do you see the significance, Colonel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe military man who had initiated the discussion said indifferently, \"No, Doctor, I do not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll explain, then, that I firmly believe that any scientist capable of doing such work. even an Earthman, is certainly my intellectual equal, at least, and, if you\u0027ll pardon my presumption, yours as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnnius interrupted. \"Pardon me, Dr. Arvardan. I would like to return to the Synapsifier. Has Shekt experimented with human beings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan laughed. \"I doubt it, Lord Ennius. Nine tenths of his Synapsified rats died during treatment.
