The long blade flickered, and then whistling sounds suddenly rang through the air! When the sharp whistling sound of the blade tearing through the air gradually faded, two extremely fine inclined cracks suddenly appeared on the old fashioned liquid crystal display television, the television separating into three pieces before slowly sliding down.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi Gaolei stood there, his face falling more and more, but he didn’t open his mouth and roar out again.

The row of buttons in front of his chest shot out one after another, the leather combat suit also opening up, revealing his robust pectoral muscles covered in thick chest hair.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi’s cuts not only hacked apart the television, they also undid Li Gaolei’s jacket.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi chuckled, carrying the blade with a reverse grip. She walked over to Li Gaolei and reached out her hand, stroking his chest, saying with a smile, “Just as strong as before! Alright, I should leave.

His body flashed, suddenly standing in front of Li, saying with a heavy voice, “With only four levels of ability, you can’t win against an entire Blue Scorpion squad by yourself!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi’s short maroon hair became a bit longer, now slightly obstructing her eyes when it hung down. She looked at Li Gaolei through her hair, the corners of her lips still carrying a carefree smile as she said, “If I can come back alive, then it’ll have two five level ones then, not inferior to you!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I’m going with you!” Li Gaolei said with a frown.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You want to steal evolutionary points from me? No way!” Li laughed. However, when she saw Li Gaolei’s tightly locked brows and firm expression, her smile gradually faded. She reached out her hand to touch his chest again. This time, her long and forceful fingers carefully caressed the thick chest hair, the muscles that carried explosive power, as well as the crazily beating heart inside of that chest.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi’s hand was slender and beautiful, only, the joints were a bit thick, and the palm and fingers rough with calluses, the traces left behind from holding blades and guns all year round. Even Li Gaolei lost count of just how many battles she experienced during these past few years and how many times she was seriously injured. Li’s constitution was a bit special, most scars disappearing on their own after some time, so no one remembered just how many times she was injured. However, Li had just reached twenty years of age this year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA strange emotion suddenly welled up from the bottom of Li Gaolei’s heart.

She slowly and firmly pushed aside Li Gaolei, walking out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi Gaolei shouted at Li’s rear figure, “Is there a need for this?!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi turned her head slightly, her short maroon hair rising like flames, smile full of radiance. “Don’t feel so much worry for me!

The only thing he could do right now was watch her depart into the distance.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOutside the public square were groups of veterans in threes and fours, most of them with one or two levels of abilities, elites that had followed them through too many vicious battles. Li’s appearance in the public square immediately drew all of their attention. That shining long blade in particular was truly hard to overlook.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Hey!
