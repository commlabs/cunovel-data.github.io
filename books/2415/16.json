The haunting images of death flickered before him … Dante’s inferno, the biohazard symbol, the plague doctor. Yet again, the face of the beautiful silver-haired woman pleaded with him across the bloodred river. Seek and find! Time is running out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna’s voice pulled him back. “Whatever this projector ultimately points to … or whatever you’re trying to find, it must be something extremely dangerous. The fact that people are trying to kill us …” Her voice cracked slightly, and she took a moment to regroup. “Think about it. They just shot at you in broad daylight … shot at me—an innocent bystander. Nobody seems to be looking to negotiate. Your own government turned on you … you called them for help, and they sent someone to kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stared vacantly at the ground. Whether the U.S. Consulate had shared Langdon’s location with the assassin, or whether the consulate itself had sent the assassin, was irrelevant. The upshot was the same. My own government is not on my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon looked into Sienna’s brown eyes and saw bravery there. What have I gotten her involved in? “I wish I knew what we were looking for. That would help put all of this into perspective.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna nodded. “Whatever it is, I think we need to find it. At least it would give us leverage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer logic was hard to refute. Still Langdon felt something nagging at him. If I fail, then all is death. All morning he’d been running up against macabre symbols of biohazards, plagues, and Dante’s hell. Admittedly, he had no clear proof of what he was looking for, but he would be naive not to consider at least the possibility that this situation involved a deadly disease or large-scale biological threat. But if this were true, why would his own government be trying to eliminate him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo they think I’m somehow involved in a potential attack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made no sense at all. There was something else going on here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon thought again of the silver-haired woman. “There’s also the woman from my visions. I feel I need to find her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then trust your feelings,” Sienna said. “In your condition, the best compass you have is your subconscious mind. It’s basic psychology—if your gut is telling you to trust that woman, then I think you should do exactly what she keeps telling you to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seek and find,” they said in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon exhaled, knowing his path was clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I can do is keep swimming down this tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith hardening resolve, he turned and began taking in his surroundings, trying to get his bearings. Which way out of the gardens?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were standing beneath the trees at the edge of a wide-open plaza where several paths intersected. In the distance to their left, Langdon spied an elliptical-shaped lagoon with a small island adorned with lemon trees and statuary. The Isolotto, he thought, recognizing the famous sculpture of Perseus on a half-submerged horse bounding through the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Pitti Palace is that way,” Langdon said, pointing east, away from the Isolotto, toward the garden’s main thoroughfare—the Viottolone, which ran east–west along the entire length of the grounds. The Viottolone was as wide as a two-lane road and lined by a row of slender, four-hundred-year-old cypress trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no cover,” Sienna said, eyeing the uncamouflaged avenue and motioning up at the circling drone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right,” Langdon said with a lopsided grin. “Which is why we’re taking the tunnel beside it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed again, this time to a dense hedgerow adjacent to the mouth of the Viottolone. The wall of dense greenery had a small arched opening cut into it. Beyond the opening, a slender footpath stretched out into the distance—a tunnel running parallel with the Viottolone. It was enclosed on either side by a phalanx of pruned holm oaks, which had been carefully trained since the 1600s to arch inward over the path, intertwining overhead and providing an awning of foliage. The pathway’s name, La Cerchiata—literally “circular” or “hooped”—derived from its canopy of curved trees resembling barrel stays or cerchi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna hurried over to the opening and peered into the shaded channel. Immediately she turned back to him with a smile. “Better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasting no time, she slipped through the opening and hurried off among the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had always considered La Cerchiata one of Florence’s most peaceful spots. Today, however, as he watched Sienna disappear down the darkened allée, he thought again of the Grecian free divers swimming into corral tunnels and praying they’d reach an exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon quickly said his own little prayer and hurried after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half mile behind them, outside the Art Institute, Agent Brüder strode through a bustle of police and students, his icy gaze parting the crowds before him. He made his way to the makeshift command post that his surveillance specialist had set up on the hood of his black van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From the aerial drone,” the specialist said, handing Brüder a tablet screen. “Taken a few minutes ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrüder examined the video stills, pausing on a blurry enlargement of two faces—a dark-haired man and a blond ponytailed woman—both huddled in the shadows and peering skyward through a canopy of trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Langdon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna Brooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrüder turned his attention to the map of the Boboli Gardens, which was spread out on the hood. They made a poor choice, he thought, eyeing the garden layout. While it was sprawling and intricate, with plenty of hiding places, the gardens also appeared to be surrounded on all sides by high walls. The Boboli Gardens were the closest thing to a natural killbox that Brüder had ever seen in the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’ll never get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Local authorities are sealing all exits,” the agent said. “And commencing a sweep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep me informed,” Brüder said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he raised his eyes to the van’s thick polycarbonate window, beyond which he could see the silver-haired woman seated in the back of the vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drugs they had given her had definitely dulled her senses—more than Brüder had imagined. Nonetheless, he could tell by the fearful look in her eyes that she still had a firm grasp on precisely what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe does not look happy, Brüder thought. Then again, why would she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spire of water shot twenty feet in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon watched it fall gently back to earth and knew they were getting close. They had reached the end of La Cerchiata’s leafy tunnel and dashed across an open lawn into a grove of cork trees. Now they were looking out at the Boboli’s most famous spouting fountain—Stoldo Lorenzi’s bronze of Neptune clutching his three-pronged trident. Irreverently known by locals as “The Fountain of the Fork,” this water feature was considered the central point of the gardens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna stopped at the edge of the grove and peered upward through the trees. “I don’t see the drone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon no longer heard it either, and yet the fountain was quite loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Must have needed to refuel,” Sienna said. “This is our chance. Which way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon led her to the left, and they began descending a steep incline. As they emerged from the trees, the Pitti Palace came into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice little house,” Sienna whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Typical Medici understatement,” he replied wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill almost a quarter mile away, the Pitti Palace’s stone facade dominated the landscape, stretching out to their left and right. Its exterior of bulging, rusticated stonework lent the building an air of unyielding authority that was further accentuated by a powerful repetition of shuttered windows and arch-topped apertures. Traditionally, formal palaces were situated on high ground so that anyone in the gardens had to look uphill at the building. The Pitti Palace, however, was situated in a low valley near the Arno River, meaning that people in the Boboli Gardens looked downhill at the palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis effect was only more dramatic. One architect had described the palace as appearing to have been built by nature herself … as if the massive stones in a landslide had tumbled down the long escarpment and landed in an elegant, barricade-like pile at the bottom. Despite its less defensible position in the low ground, the solid stone structure of the Pitti Palace was so imposing that Napoleon had once used it as a power base while in Florence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look,” Sienna said, pointing to the nearest doors of the palace. “Good news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had seen it, too. On this strange morning, the most welcome sight was not the palace itself, but the tourists streaming out of the building into the lower gardens. The palace was open, which meant that Langdon and Sienna would have no trouble slipping inside and passing through the building to escape the gardens. Once outside the palace, Langdon knew they would see the Arno River to their right, and beyond that, the spires of the old city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Sienna kept moving, half jogging now down the steep embankment. As they descended, they traversed the Boboli Amphitheater—the site of the very first opera performance in history—which lay nestled like a horseshoe on the side of a hill. Beyond that, they passed the obelisk of Ramses II and the unfortunate piece of “art” that was positioned at its base. The guidebooks referred to the piece as “a colossal stone basin from Rome’s Baths of Caracalla,” but Langdon always saw it for what it truly was—the world’s largest bathtub. They really need to put that thing somewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey finally reached the rear of the palace and slowed to a calm walk, mixing inconspicuously with the first tourists of the day. Moving against the tide, they descended a narrow tunnel into the cortile, an inner courtyard where visitors were seated enjoying a morning espresso in the palace’s makeshift café. The smell of fresh-ground coffee filled the air, and Langdon felt a sudden longing to sit down and enjoy a civilized breakfast. Today’s not the day, he thought as they pressed on, entering the wide stone passageway that led toward the palace’s main doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they neared the doorway, Langdon and Sienna collided with a growing bottleneck of stalled tourists who seemed to be assembling in the portico to observe something outside. Langdon peered through the crowd to the area in front of the palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pitti’s grand entrance was as blunt and unwelcoming as he recalled it. Rather than a manicured lawn and landscaping, the front yard was a vast expanse of pavement that stretched across an entire hillside, flowing down to the Via dei Guicciardini like a massive paved ski slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bottom of the hill, Langdon now saw the reason for the crowd of onlookers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown in Piazza dei Pitti, a half-dozen police cars had streamed in from all directions. A small army of officers were advancing up the hill, unholstering their weapons and fanning out to secure the front of the palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the police entered the Pitti Palace, Sienna and Langdon were already on the move, retracing their steps through the interior of the palace and away from the arriving police. They hurried through the cortile and past the café, where a buzz was spreading, tourists rubbernecking in an attempt to locate the source of the commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna was amazed the authorities had found them so quickly. The drone must have disappeared because it had already spotted us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Langdon found the same narrow tunnel through which they had descended from the gardens and without hesitation plunged back into the passageway and bounded up the stairs. The end of the staircase banked left along a high retaining wall. As they dashed along the wall, it grew shorter beside them, until finally they could see over it into the vast expanse of the Boboli Gardens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon instantly grabbed Sienna’s arm and yanked her backward, ducking out of sight behind the retaining wall. Sienna had seen it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hundred yards away, on the slope above the amphitheater, a phalanx of police descended, searching groves, interviewing tourists, coordinating with one another on handheld radios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re trapped!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna had never imagined, when she and Robert Langdon first met, that it would lead to this. This is more than I bargained for. When Sienna had left the hospital with Langdon, she thought they were fleeing a woman with spiked hair and a gun. Now they were running from an entire military team and the Italian authorities. Their chances of escape, she was now realizing, were almost zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there any other way out?” Sienna demanded, short of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so,” Langdon said. “This garden is a walled city, just like …” He paused suddenly, turning and looking east. “Just like … the Vatican.” A strange glint of hope flickered across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna had no idea what the Vatican had to do with their current predicament, but Langdon suddenly began nodding, gazing east along the back of the palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a long shot,” he said, hustling her along with him now. “But there might be a different way to get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo figures materialized suddenly before them, having rounded the corner of the retaining wall, nearly bumping into Sienna and Langdon. Both figures were wearing black, and for one frightening instant, Sienna thought they were the soldiers she had encountered at the apartment building. As they passed, though, she saw they were only tourists—Italian, she guessed, from all the stylish black leather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving an idea, Sienna caught one of the tourists’ arms and smiled up at him as warmly as possible. “Può dirci dov’è la Galleria del costume?” she asked in rapid Italian, requesting directions to the palace’s famed costume gallery. “Io e mio fratello siamo in ritardo per una visita privata.” My brother and I are late for a private tour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Certo!” The man grinned at them both, looking eager to help. “Proseguite dritto per il sentiero!” He turned and pointed west, along the retaining wall, directly away from whatever Langdon had been looking at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Molte grazie!” Sienna chirped with another smile as the two men headed off. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inferno-robert-langdon-4/page-16.html","bookId":2415,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:24 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:24 AM"}
