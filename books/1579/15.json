Think, too, of their beastlike ability to endure the sun\u0027s rays. This ability to withstand sunlight is a ge ne tic relic from the pre- cave era, when land- roaming animals lacked the intel igence to seek shelter in caves. They built up a resis tance to the sun, although said re sis tance inhibited the evolutionary development of the brain. A shame, that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words fl oat to me like seaweed in murky water. I am sitting near the back of the lecture hal , as distanced from people as possible. I had a quick change of clothes (while my escort banged away at my door), but I\u0027m worried about my odor. Nobody seems to have smel ed anything— everyone is stationary, no one twitching. I got through breakfast, early eve ning lectures, and a tour of the grounds, lunch, without anyone noticing. A large window to the left of the podium is thankful y open, a breeze blowing steadily in, dissipating any odor inside. So I hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Their facial expressions— so slippery with unrestrained and unfettered emotions— harken back to the pre- linguist, pre- language era, when expressions served as a kind of sign language. Next slide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA photo of the legs of a male heper, covered in hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone leans forward. Drool starts to line slowly downward from their fangs, like spiders descending to desktops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A vestigial ge ne tic artifact from an era predating the discovery of fi re. Without the capability to build fi re, hair was their only mechanism to ward off the winter cold. Elite scholars have postulated that this evidence of body hair predates even the stone era, when primitives would have been able to fashion rudimentary weapons to hunt and then use fur for clothes. I have written a book on this topic, the fi rst in my fi eld to postulate this now wel - supported theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext slide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA photo of a heper eating a fruit, red skinned with yel ow substance inside. I see heads fl inch back in revulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, yes. Quite inexplicable, this trait, to say nothing of it ghast-liness. It bespeaks their lack of predatory skil s, their inability to really kil anything larger than vermin. So they must hunt those things that do not fl ee: the things of the earth, vegetables and fruits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis trait in time became in extremis to the extent that their bodies eventual y required fruit and vegetables. Deprive them of vegetables and fruit, and their bodies begin to break down. Reddish spots appear on their bodies, sores attack their lips, then gums, leading eventual y to the loss of teeth. They become immobilized, fal into a depressed, vegetative state. Next slide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA photo of the group of hepers under the Dome. They are sitting around a campfi re, their mouths open, heads cocked to the side, eyes closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing has mystifi ed and beguiled scholars as much as the hepers\u0027 ability to warble their voices with words, and with such remarkable consistency. Studies undertaken at the Institute have found that hepers are able to duplicate these ululations— what they cal ‘singing\u0027— with astonishing accuracy. In fact, a song can be replicated minutes, days, months, even years after it is fi rst sung with near identical sonic frequencies. There are a plethora of theories out there; none are satisfactory save one, which I presented at the Annual Conference on Heper Studies last year. In short, hepers developed this ‘singing\u0027 ability under the mistaken belief that it helped the growth of vegetables and fruits. That is why we see them ‘sing\u0027 most commonly when tending to the farmland or plucking fruit off trees. Some scholars posit that hepers may also believe ‘singing\u0027 helps to sustain the burning of a fi re and to cleanse the body better. This is evinced in their tendency to warble their voices when assembled around a fi re or when bathing at the pond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in my seat, hiding my inner amusement. Everything the Director says about hepers has the ring of truth and a learned authority about it, but I suspect it\u0027s nothing more than speculative nonsense. I suppose it\u0027s easy to so widely miss the mark when it comes to hepers, to quickly slide from honest scientifi c inquiry to unsubstantiated theories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all , if the roles were reversed and it was people who became extinct, people theories would likely be rife with exaggerations and distortions: instead of sleeping in sleep- holds, they\u0027d sleep in coffi ns; creatures of the night, they\u0027d be so invisible to the eye that even in front of mirrors, they\u0027d lack a refl ection; pale and emaciated, they were weak and benign beings who could coexist peaceful y alongside hepers, somehow restraining themselves from ripping hepers to ribbons and sucking down their blood; they\u0027d al invariably be incredibly good- looking with perfect hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027d probably be some outright confabulations as wel : their ability to swim with dizzying speed under water; and ludicrous and laughable notions about people- heper romances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo rows in front of me, Phys Ed\u0027s head suddenly twitches violently backward. A short line of saliva fl ies off his fangs and swings upward, splatting across his face diagonal y.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon me,” he murmurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Director stares at him, then proceeds. “Another aberration is their rather grotesque tendency to leak minuscule beads of salty water when they get hot or are under stress. Under these extreme conditions, they also emit large amounts of odor, especial y from the underarm region, which itself, especial y in male adults, contains a nest of body hair. It is common for them—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhys Ed\u0027s head snaps back again. “Sorry, sorry,” he says, “didn\u0027t mean to interrupt. But can no one else smel it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeper odor?” He turns around, and for one awful moment, his eyes settle on mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little. Just a little,” I offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Director\u0027s eyes turn to me. A chil spreads down my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eControlled breathing; keep eyelids halfway down; don\u0027t dart my eyes back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s really thick, it\u0027s getting into my nose, into my head, it\u0027s hard to concentrate.” Phys Ed points to an open window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mind if we close the window? I can barely concentrate—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbs, sitting two seats away from him, suddenly jerks her head back, snaps it forward again. “Just now. I smel ed it, too. Heper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty strong odor. It must be wafting in from outside through the open windows. What is it, heper mating season?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Director heads over to the open window. His face is placid, unreadable, but he\u0027s clearly thinking deeply. “I smel something as wel . The breeze is bringing it in?” His voice rises indecisively at the end. “Here, let me close the window, see if that helps. The hepers must be real y sweating it during the day. Wonder what they\u0027re up to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lecture continues, but barely anyone is listening anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone is curious, sniffi ng the air. Far from cutting off the heper odor, closing the window has only intensifi ed the odor. It\u0027s me; the smel is emanating from me. How long before the others realize this? Their fi dgeting and agitated head shakes grow more frequent and violent by the minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not helping matters— or myself— much: I\u0027ve got to keep up the act, and my own head shakes and neck snaps are an exertion that in turn releases more odor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley June suddenly speaks up. “Maybe they\u0027ve been sneaking in here during the day. Into this building. That\u0027s why their odor is everywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe look to the podium to see what the Director will say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s gone. Uncannily. And in his place is Fril y Dress, who, as usual, has materialized out of nowhere. “Impossible,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe says, her voice shril er than usual. “There\u0027s no way a heper would come in here, into the hornets\u0027 nest. It\u0027s certain death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the odor,” Ashley June says, her mouth watering. “It\u0027s so strong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly her head snaps back, viciously. Slowly she turns around, her head lowering. She gazes at all of us, at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if one of the hepers snuck in here last night? What if one of the hepers is still hiding in this building?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, we are fl ying out the doors, the escorts right next to us, at fi rst trying to coax us back into the lecture hal , but then, as we spin around corners and leap down fl oors (“The odor\u0027s getting stronger!” shouts Crimson Lips next to me), the escorts join in the frenzy, feed into it. Gnashing teeth, saliva trailing us, hands shaking in the air, nails grating against the wal s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s hard to separate myself from the group. That\u0027s my plan: to peel away, steal back to the library, and hope no one thinks much of my absence. But every time I turn a corner to get away, they\u0027re right there with me. It\u0027s my odor. And with all this running around, it\u0027s only getting worse. I was hoping they\u0027d all sprint past me, giving me the opportunity to fl y down the stairs and out the door before they can double back. But they stay right with me. It\u0027s terrifying, to be so close to their teeth and claws. They will not be unaware for much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat causes the group to leave me is more by accident than design. I black out— probably for no more than a second or two. One moment I\u0027m running, the next I\u0027m fl at on the ground, the group sweeping past me and disappearing around a corner. The lack of water. It\u0027s parched my throat, dried my muscles, ossifi ed my brain now. I\u0027m past my breaking point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I come to— it\u0027s really more a grayout than a blackout — I know I have to move. The group will double back when they lose the scent; they\u0027l fol ow the trail right back to me, lying weakened and prone on the fl oor, sweat on my forehead, the odor running off me in rivers. Move, I tel myself, move. But it\u0027s tough even to prop myself up. I feel as dry as attic dust, yet as heavy as a waterlogged sack of fl our.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is silence in the hal ways, then the sound of footsteps growing louder. They\u0027re realizing. They\u0027re coming back now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear jump- starts my body. I rol over, leap to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoors. I need to put as many doors between me and them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027l slow them down, cut off my scent even a bit. Every little bit counts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push doors out of my way; seconds later, I hear those same double doors slammed open, like shotguns popping. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-15.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
