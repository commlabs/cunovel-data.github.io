You have now truly evolved into a powerful and wise vampire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered my face with my hands as the horror of my possible fate overwhelmed me. I knew in my heart that all they said was true. Vlad would drain every lost drop from my flesh and entomb me as punishment. When he finally allowed me to rise, I would never be truly free again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius gently touched my shoulder and I went into his arms. He enfolded me lovingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled upon all in the room as the enormity of our future battle against Vlad Dracula filled us all with dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecember 2, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dosza Palace, Buda\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snowfall has not lessened, but has increased in its intensity. We shall soon be snowbound. Csilla has taken a turn for the worse as Vlad torments her in her sleep. I sometimes almost feel pity for her. Then I remember how coldly she sent my family to their deaths and it ebbs away. Adem has posted a guard at her door to watch over her. Another guard has been watching Katya, but she seems quite content to offer her veins to Laura. She flirts even more outrageously with Laura than she ever has with me. I am a little concerned that Laura is susceptible to Katya’s manipulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only life were not so terribly complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, I am terrified of what Vlad may do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think we should leave the bed tonight?” Ignatius asked soon after we awakened\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I refuse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuried under the covers in Ignatius’s arms, I didn’t want to slide out of bed and face the evening routine. I was content in the comfort of his embrace and did not wish to break it. Despite the threat of Vlad’s vengeance, I was happy with Ignatius. He is eerily adept at knowing exactly what to do or say to make me smile and put aside my fears. His fingers slid down over my bare back, a delicious touch that aroused me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should feed tonight,” he reminded me. “We did not feed yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were busy yesterday.” I brushed my hand over his manhood and made him laugh. “You do remember that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course! It is difficult to forget when you do that.” Tugging me onto his chest, he shoved the covers back over my head so he could see me. Smiling, he pressed kisses to my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gentle knock on the bedroom door distracted us. “Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shall I draw a bath?” Magda’s said, sounding amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I suppose, you horrible servant,” I called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the door, I heard her laughing. “I will return shortly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStraddling Ignatius’s waist, I sat up, the covers pooling around my thighs. Pulling my hair over one shoulder, I pouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius lightly rubbed the sides of my legs as he bestowed a sweet smile upon me. “No fretting, Glynis. We will rise, feed, and have a lovely evening. I would like to visit with Laura and learn more about her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s boring.” I was sulking, but I could not help it. He had spoiled me with his lovemaking. All the tension and fears of the last months were banished for a short while and I had enjoyed the feeling of contentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, now, Glynis. Enough of that,” he chastised, though his tone was light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it so wrong for me to want to stay here in this bed with you forever?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I share the sentiment, yet we both know that is an impossibility.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cast a dark look toward the heavily covered window. “It’s still snowing, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe so.” Ignatius sat up, holding me close to his chest. He cradled me against him and compelled me to look at him with the touch of his fingers on my cheek. “Glynis, despite our difficult situation remember that I am here for you. I love you and nothing could have kept me away for long. Though I never lied to my Mistress, I did have to persuade her to allow me to come here to watch over you. She’s afraid, too, of what Vlad may be plotting in his absence. All I do, I do for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping my arms around his neck, I pressed my lips to his temple. His hands ran up my back to nestle in my hair. “I know, my love. I just wish for a simple life with you and Laura.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do love her, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Desperately. She reminds me so much of May at times, but has my spark. I do admit to misreading her a bit. I had no idea she was a lover of other women and that was the reason she was so adamantly opposed to being married. I thought she was like me - a rebel against the suffocating rules of society.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is in her own way, my love. She just had one more reason to fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNestled against his chest, I felt my sour mood began to dissipate. There is an aura about Ignatius that comforts me. Perhaps it is because he is so wise for having lived for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old you?” I asked, suddenly realizing I had no idea how long he had walked the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Close to a thousand years old,” he admitted. “Horrified to be with such an old man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is rather shocking. I don’t know. Our age difference is quite extreme.” I playfully pretended to mull the situation over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling, he kissed my throat. “I may be old, but with age comes the wisdom that only time can grant. And that wealth of knowledge tells me that I have never loved anyone like I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is my fabulous fiery hair and personality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps. All I know is that when we first spoke, I was captivated. As I observed you from afar I became even more intrigued. And when we finally met, I was smitten. I do believe that the more I learn about you, the more I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a wicked smile, I kissed him, pressing him back down onto the bed. When Magda returned to prepare my bath, we ignored her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was several more hours before we ventured downstairs. Laura was sitting in the library reading a book near the fire. Katya sat near her sloppily mending a petticoat under Magda’s watchful eye. It was obvious from my maidservant’s frustrated expression that Katya was not very adept with the needle and thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was beginning to wonder if we would ever see you again,” Laura said, her eyes sparkling with delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius leaned against the back of her chair and peered down at her work. “Very pretty. Your stitches are quite neat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should see Glynis’s work.” Laura giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at her. I rush at times and my stitching tends to be uneven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatya grumbled under her breath as she shoved the needle through the fabric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has Csilla been about?” I had yet to feed and I supposed I should seek her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She had some soup sent up to her room, but has not come down tonight. I believe the weather is adversely affecting her health,” Magda responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go feed. I will make do with one of the guards,” Ignatius said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can take from me!” Katya tossed her sewing aside and stood up excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit,” Magda ordered, shoving the girl down by her shoulders. “Work on your mending. If we are forced to tolerate you, you can at least attempt to be useful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I am!” Katya touched her throat and smirked in Laura’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura tittered and bowed over her embroidery, a deep flush washing over her face. I wondered if much had developed between the two young women in my absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving the warmth of the library, I walked swiftly through the cold corridors to Csilla’s room. I found Brice and a maid leaving as I arrived. The maid carried a full bowl of soup upon a silver tray. She bowed her head and rushed past me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she awake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does it matter, Countess?” Brice’s voice was edged with a bitterness I found disquieting. “Why are you taking so long to kill her? Did you not promise that one day you would release us from her cruelty? Yet, you allow her to live. Are you any different than her after all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked, I stared at him. “I am doing what I should to protect all of us. Actions committed in haste often do not have positive results. Trust me, that is a lesson I am continually being forced to learn over and over again. I am sometimes far too quick to action, but in this case, I must take my time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even though she murdered Laura?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrice withdrew a small bottle from his pocket. “I discovered this in the kitchen. The baroness asked the cook to add it to the tea we were brewing for Laura when she was ill. The poor woman thought it was medicine. But it’s not. It’s belladonna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for the bottle, but he quickly hid it away in his pocket. “If you will not kill her, Countess, I will.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-62.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
