He didn\u0027t threaten, but he let me infer that I might not be welcomed back. He\u0027s called twice since I got here, mentioned that Matthew Pena has been in touch with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you tell Ron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t returned his calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was so unlike Maia, I didn\u0027t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her fingers around her knees, took a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget all that,\" she said. \"What I really came to tell you— Dwight Hayes called me this morning. The Techsan sale seems to be weighing on his conscience. He said you\u0027d spoken with him last night, encouraged him to call me.\" She hesitated, steeling herself. \"I guess I should thank you for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to stop thinking about Maia\u0027s job—the junior partnership she\u0027d worked so many years to get. \"Dwight give you anything good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was still pretty cagey, but he said in a couple of days we could expect AccuShield to announce they\u0027d fixed Techsan\u0027s software problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple of days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwight said they\u0027d wait just long enough to make the announcement seem plausible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then they\u0027ve known what the problem was all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia moistened her lips. \"Another little secret Dwight let slip— Pena has made a very sweet little deal with his client, AccuShield. Apparently they\u0027re a lot more impressed by Techsan\u0027s security product than they let on. If Pena manages to turn Techsan around, get the betatesting back on track, get the investors lined up, AccuShield has promised to let him spin off the company as a separate IPO.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money, Tres. Lots of it. AccuShield would keep seventy percent of the stock. Pena gets thirty percent. And Dwight thought the IPO—with the proper backing—could be huge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huge like family size or economy pack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Total valuation? Think billions, with a B.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands went numb on the steering wheel. \"A company Pena paid four million for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett\u0027s company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia nodded. \"I\u0027d say this is the careermaker deal for Mr. Pena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled into the parking lot at Waterloo Records, stopped the truck. The neon cows were dancing above the Amy\u0027s Ice Cream sign. Even in the daytime, in the middle of June, Christmas lights blinked in the palm trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI replayed every word I\u0027d said to Garrett the night before, about how he should sell his company. Now, despite the ranch, despite my best rationalizing, I felt like those words should be tattooed on my back with a hot needle. Billions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if Ruby had known the real value of what she was signing away. I wondered if she\u0027d made some inside deal with Pena. Or maybe that was just wishful thinking. It was easier to get mad at Ruby than at myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwight won\u0027t go on record with this,\" I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if he did,\" Maia said, \"it\u0027s nothing we could take to the police. Dwight had nothing to say about Jimmy Doebler\u0027s murder. Or Adrienne Selak\u0027s drowning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Maia about my morning phone call with Lopez, about the call Jimmy had made to homicide two months ago. I told her about the family research Jimmy had been starting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia stared out the windshield. \"The fact Lopez knew Jimmy, had talked to him recently, might be enough to taint his investigation. If I had to, I could use it. That and the fact he coerced you and Garrett into making initial statements without a lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coerced?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. You remember. You said Jimmy was asking about his mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to tell her about Clara Doebler\u0027s suicide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she interrupted. \"You think the family history is important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tone told me it wasn\u0027t just a processofelimination question. She was testing, putting out a line. I wondered how she knew about Clara\u0027s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His cousin W.B. runs the family company,\" I said. \"He wouldn\u0027t tell me anything, but I got the feeling there might be something about Jimmy\u0027s death—something that makes the family nervous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia watched the neon cows. \"Garrett and Jimmy had a long history—a lot of bad blood between them. Lopez will use that for motive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to be sure Lopez doesn\u0027t have a point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like the silence between us—a heavy feeling, like the beginning of a landslide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like the fact that neither of us felt confident enough to leap to Garrett\u0027s defence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jimmy has an aunt in town,\" I said. \"On the phone, she seemed a little more pliable than W.B. We could go see her, try running the family angle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia studied the palm trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We,\" she said, like she was testing the word, seeing how much weight it would hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited through a full rotation of the Sixth Street light, but Maia said nothing more. I figured I\u0027d gotten as much of a yes as I could hope for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the truck in drive and headed north again, toward Hyde Park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye DoeblerIngram\u0027s house was a small folk Victorian on an unmarked residential half block, tucked behind a vegetarian restaurant and a lesbian gift shop. I drove past, Uturned, and parked across the street at the base of one of the city\u0027s moonlight towers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front porch was outlined with lacy white trim. The screen door was peach, the porch swing green. Her sidegabled roof had recently been sheeted in galvanized steel. Her yard was a quarteracre garden—every square foot cultivated with herbs and wildflowers, pathways made from broken flagstones. A good deal of money had gone into making the house look quaint and rustic. It didn\u0027t look like the kind of place where the resident was accustomed to being rocked by tragedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia opened the passenger\u0027s side door, bringing in the scents of the neighbourhood—cut grass and garden herbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tu es pres?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like old times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a hint of her smile gave me more pleasure than I wanted to admit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia led the way. The white cotton straps of her dress made an X across her shoulder blades. Her hair had grown longer than I\u0027d realized. Gathered in a white scrunchietie, her glossy chocolate brown ponytail didn\u0027t look so much girlish as formidable—like the mane of a T\u0027ang warrior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garden was hazy with the smells of catmint, thyme, and sage. We climbed the front steps, ducked under a trellis of grapevines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady of the house opened her screen door before we reached it. \"May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a slight woman in her sixties—stick arms, a pleasantly wrinkled face surrounded by enormous permed hair the bright colour of new pennies. Her jeans and blouse were covered with a gardener\u0027s apron, but she wore full makeup and silver jewellery. She looked like a friendly earth gnome who\u0027d just been to the beauty parlour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia said, \"Mrs. DoeblerIngram?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just Ms. Ingram,\" the woman replied gently. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held a spade, a clod of mud stuck to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"We spoke on the phone. I\u0027m Tres Navarre. This is Maia Lee, a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye Ingram\u0027s eyes got smaller, more wary. \"I don\u0027t . . . you mean about Jimmy\u0027s death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" I said. \"There\u0027ve been some developments since we spoke, Ms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngram. We thought you\u0027d want to be prepared if the police contact you. May we come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wavered, but refusal wasn\u0027t really an option, the way I\u0027d phrased it. She let us in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house had the same wildly cultivated look as the front garden, clumps of floralpattern sofas, sprigs of end tables blooming with houseplants, tall pedestals topped with artwork, even one of Jimmy\u0027s large ceramic pieces. The smell of freshbaked cinnamon bread wafted from the kitchen. Somewhere in the back rooms, Dylan\u0027s Blood on the Tracks was playing. Faye Ingram may have looked nothing like her nephew, but being in her house, I could believe they were related.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet something struck me as out of character—something that told of fear. There was a blinking sensor by the door, discreet wires running up the sides of the windows, a keypad next to the light switch. Laidback Ms. Ingram had one of the finest security systems money could buy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led us through a hallway, out into the backyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was filtering through the branches of an enormous oak tree. On the sidewalk, a circle of five sun tea jars glowed like some weird, translucent Stonehenge. Lining the fence were tomato and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epepper cages, mansized sunflowers slouched in their last weeks of life—leaves curled brown and seed faces blasted from heat and the work of birds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in patio chairs under the oak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Ms. Ingram said uneasily. \"You have something to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wanted to ask about Clara\u0027s suicide,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I was expecting a strong reaction, I didn\u0027t get it. Ms. Ingram\u0027s smile stayed polite, colourless, wavering no more than her hairdo. \"I\u0027m sorry. I don\u0027t understand what this has to do with Jimmy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the weeks before he got murdered,\" I said, \"Jimmy was researching his mother\u0027s past. I know he called you and W.B. and several other relatives. He also called the police, asking for the files on Clara\u0027s death. I know Clara\u0027s relationship with the Doebler clan was . . . rocky. It may have nothing to do with Jimmy\u0027s death. It just strikes me—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Ingram\u0027s eyes were watery, unfocused, courteous. I suddenly felt guilty, as if I were forcing something unpleasant into a fragile container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It unsettles us,\" Maia said. \"The way Clara died, the place. Jimmy dying in the same spot, the same way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye Ingram laced her fingers together, set them like a little igloo on the mint green patio table. \"The police tell me they are close to an arrest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are,\" I agreed. \"And once they have a convincing possibility, they won\u0027t look elsewhere unless they have their arms twisted. The rest of the Doebler family isn\u0027t likely to twist, are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother—he is the one they will arrest. Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And would it surprise you greatly if I refused to help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Ingram read my eyes, then looked toward her garden—the giant, ruined heads of sunflowers. Ms. Ingram nodded, as if she\u0027d made a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me a moment,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose, almost trancelike, and wandered inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia and I looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head doubtfully, by no means sure Faye Ingram would be coming back without the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the house, a Bob Dylan track played through. Faye Ingram reappeared. She carried a brown leather binder the size of an Oxford English Dictionary volume. Two sweaty glasses of tea sat on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My manners need polishing,\" she apologized. \"Except for the herb society, I don\u0027t entertain many guests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe thanked her for the tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Ingram\u0027s smile started to reform as she ran her fingers over the old brown binder, smearing the rings of condensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally realized why her face seemed familiar. She looked like the picture Jimmy had kept on his mantel—her sister Clara. The resemblance wasn\u0027t much—a faraway look in the eyes, frailness in the smile, features too delicate to maintain much emotion. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-21.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
