She seemed actress-ish— kind of pretty, a little surly, and as if she hadn\u0027t eaten enough to fill herself up in at least three years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027s not here,\" she said, as if the matter was completely out of her hands. Not since Pontius Pilate had someone so completely passed the buck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what are we going to do about it?\" Lance asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flashed a patronizing grin and gestured to the overflowing room. \"You could sit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance glanced back and shook his head. \"Not good enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could call,\" she said and gestured at the ringing phone covered with blinking lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think you should answer one of those?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s important, they call back,\" she said with a flip of the magazine\u0027s pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough.\" He got off the desk, sunk to a knee, pulled her bony hand into his, and said, \"Tell me where he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" he pleaded. \"It\u0027ll save me a lot of time and you a lot of hassle. Come on, just a little hint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, looked around at the other actors in the waiting room, then leaned close and whispered in Lance\u0027s ear: \"Lunch. Stella\u0027s. You didn\u0027t hear it from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance kissed her cheek. When the phone rang again, he answered for her: \"Poindexter-Stone, please hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia liked Stella\u0027s on Seventy-fifth because they knew her there. Not in the \"Hey, you were on TV so I should kiss up to you\" sense. They knew her in the same way her father was known at her hometown coffee shop in Oklahoma. No big deal in Fall River, but Julia believed that sort of thing should not go unrewarded on the Upper West Side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a word, Giovanni, the maître d\u0027, was surreal. He never forgot a name or a drink; he remembered birthdays because, once, on that date, your friend had slipped you a card and paid for lunch. He asked if you\u0027d enjoyed the sea bass on your previous visit, and if you felt up to trying the salmon today. He noticed when you cut your hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was smart and attentive, with a sexy little accent and easy access to excellent food, so if Julia hadn\u0027t been so happy being a writer, she might have tried to help the single women of the world in a different way. She might have tried to clone Giovanni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Miss James!\" He met her at the threshold, took her hands in his, and kissed both her cheeks. \"You come back to Stella\u0027s! It\u0027s been too long. I see the reservation in the book and I pray it be you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Giovanni. It is wonderful to see you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see in the book that we are two for lunch today. Is that so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Julia said as he helped her remove her coat and scarf. \"Is it, by chance\"—he cut her a sly look—\"a man? Someone special?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia mentally rolled her eyes as she remembered that Giovanni was one of about three people in the world who still tried to set her up. \"Yes, Giovanni, he\u0027s my agent, and we have a very special professional relationship.\" She didn\u0027t go on to say that Harvey was sixty-four with two great passions—food and a wife of forty-one years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Giovanni said, not trying to disguise his disappointment. \"At least it will not break my heart to see such a beautiful woman dining alone. Your table is ready. Come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led her through the small dining room to a prime table, motioned to the water and bread boy, then excused himself, reminding Julia of why he was the perfect man: He\u0027d known exactly when to disappear, but not before offering H20 and carbohydrates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree tables away, two men were finishing their meals. One man stooped low to the table and spoke while his companion ate in slow, even bites. \"I think you could use another pair of hands,\" the talker said. \"You\u0027ve got more clients than you can handle. I\u0027ve got more clients than I need—and none of them any good. You\u0027ve got good people and I\u0027ve got good contacts. What do you say? Want to hang out a shingle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man motioned to his eggplant. \"I\u0027m in the middle of a meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know. You need some bread. Here, let\u0027s get you some bread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost every table was occupied in the noon-hour rush as waiters in long, white aprons scurried around, carrying baskets of bread and plates of pasta. The rich, decadent aroma filled the small dining room and seeped onto the street outside, where Lance Collins stood formulating a plan, watching his agent on the far side of the room. He saw Richard Stone turn and scour the room for someone or something. He might as well be looking for me, Lance thought as he mustered his courage and started inside. But he\u0027d hardly passed the threshold when themaître d\u0027 stepped in his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I help you?\" Giovanni asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks,\" Lance said. \"I see the person I\u0027m looking for.\" He moved to step around the little man, but Giovanni slid quickly into Lance\u0027s path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Giovanni smiled, still studying Lance but seemingly with a new objective in mind. \"You are Miss James\u0027s agent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Lance said, stepping forward only to be cut off once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a reservation?\" The tone hardened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I told you. I\u0027m meeting—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiovanni stopped smiling. \"Miss James is meeting an agent. Mrs. DiAngelo is meeting a daughter. You are no agent, and you are no daughter. You must leave Stella\u0027s.\" He had a hand on Lance\u0027s arm and was steering him toward the door, and Lance felt opportunity slipping through his fingers. With one last look at Richard Stone, he grasped for inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Representative!\" Lance yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiovanni\u0027s grasp on his arm loosened, so Lance carried on, \"I don\u0027t like the term agent\" he said, as if he hated to be a stickler for such things. \"I prefer representative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, Giovanni studied Lance, and then he brought both hands to the side of his face. \"You are a friend of Miss James?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah,\" Lance said. \"A close personal friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA giddy grin flashed across the man\u0027s face, and he took off through the tables. As Lance followed, he began to worry what he was going to say or do when they reached this woman called Miss James. From across the restaurant, he saw a woman sitting alone at a table, studying a notebook. Lance found himself staring at the graceful curve of her neck and the way her red hair swept across her shoulder. He was instantly glad to be getting an introduction. Then he remembered that they were already close personal friends. He put his hand on Giovanni\u0027s shoulder and stopped him. He pulled a rose from a vase on a nearby table and spoke low in Giovanni\u0027s ear: \"I can take it from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiovanni turned to Lance and said, \"Oh, it is a beautiful day!\" When he turned and went back to the entrance, Lance realized he was standing alone in the dining room holding a damp, stolen rose and looking at the kind of woman a normal man would probably only approach if he was drunk or on a dare. Behind her, he saw Richard Stone at his table in the back. He could just walk past her, Lance decided, but a glance behind him warned that the maître d’ was watching his every move. Maybe men made a habit of coming there and trying to pick up women who were out of their league? Maybe he was just the latest in long line of suitors to go down in flames, and the little man at the door didn\u0027t want to miss the show. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the back of the restaurant, a waiter cleared Richard Stone\u0027s plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then or never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance shook the excess water from the stem of the pilfered flower and slipped into the chair across from the woman called Miss James. \"Excuse me,\" he said, and the woman looked up. \"I don\u0027t mean to impose, but do you see that man over there?\" He motioned to the two men in the back of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said, drawing out the word as if considering the possibility that she might be on Candid Camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I really need to talk to him, and the only way the guy at the door would let me in here was if I said I was meeting you. I lied. I\u0027m sorry. You\u0027re probably thinking that I\u0027m a terrible person, and you\u0027re probably right. But if I could just sit here long enough to keep your boyfriend at the door from getting suspicious, then I\u0027ll go talk to that man and you\u0027ll never have to see me again. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia surveyed him. \"I\u0027m quite fond of Giovanni, my \u0027boyfriend at the door.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s fond of you, too.\" Lance sat up taller. He gave her a toothy grin, but she didn\u0027t budge—not even a smile. He eased to the edge of his chair. \"Anyhow, I\u0027m sorry to bother you. You\u0027ve been great. Really, very nice. Enjoy your lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and moved slowly, with cautious, backward steps, toward the men. When he saw the rose still in his hands, he tossed it casually to Julia, watched her catch it, and then turned to speak to Richard Stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Richard?\" Lance asked, feigning surprise. \"Well, this is a stroke of luck, running into you like this!\" He eased casually into a chair at the table and glanced at Richard\u0027s companion. \"Hey, how ya doing?\" he asked before turning his attention back to his agent. \"So, I\u0027ve been thinking about the types of auditions I\u0027ve been going out on—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard put a hand out, stopping Lance. \"Do I know you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance looked at Richard, and then at the other man, then choked out a nervous laugh. \"This guy,\" he said to Richard\u0027s companion while he pointed to his agent. \"Seriously, Richard, I\u0027ve been—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously. I don\u0027t believe I have ever laid eyes on you before in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance sat, shocked and confused, as he tried to process this one-sentence slam on him and everything he\u0027d ever wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was his career, or lack thereof, summed up in a single sentence by a man with marinara sauce on his tie. \"I’m Lance Collins. You\u0027re my agent,\" he said feebly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard laughed and said to his companion, \"I\u0027m his agent. I\u0027m supposed to get him Hamlet, and I don\u0027t even know who the hell he is.\" He turned to Lance. \"Call my office. Make an appointment. I\u0027m eating my lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Lance didn\u0027t leave. At that moment, he wasn\u0027t even sure his legs still worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, kid,\" Richard said. \"It\u0027s not me. It\u0027s you. Everybody\u0027s got talent. And you\u0027re a good-looking kid, but you can buy looks. Name recognition—now that\u0027s the honey. You can\u0027t put a price on that. You go get yourself famous, and then we\u0027ll talk about the kind of roles you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance knew there was a cliché about carts and horses, but he couldn\u0027t remember how it went. Luckily, Richard\u0027s companion chose that moment to wipe his mouth and ask, \"Were you just sitting with Julia James?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance looked back at the woman who sat alone, scribbling in a notebook, and said, \"Yeah. I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard emitted a little squeal. \"Hey, kid, why didn\u0027t you say so? That\u0027s great I mean, that\u0027s off-the-charts fantastic. How long you been seeing her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Lance looked from Richard to the woman and back again. \"You\u0027ve got the wrong—\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cheating-at-solitaire-cheating-at-solitaire-1/page-3.html","bookId":2751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM"}
