Raych, in particular, was crushed against the seat before him and was finding it difficult to breathe till Dorss hand on his shoulder pulled him back slightly.\n\u003cbr\u003e Sergeant Thalus, impressive and erect, left the jet and moved to the rear, where he opened the door of the passenger compartment and helped the three out, one by one.\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon was last. He half-turned as he passed the sergeant, saying, \"It was a pleasant trip, Sergeant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e A slow smile spread over the sergeants large face and lifted his mustachioed upper lip. He touched the visor of his cap in what was half a salute and said, \"Thank you again, Doctor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e They were then ushered into the backseat of a ground-car of lavish design and the sergeant himself pushed into the front seat and drove the vehicle with a surprisingly light touch.\n\u003cbr\u003e They passed through wide roadways, flanked by tall, well-designed buildings, all glistening in broad daylight. As elsewhere on Trantor, they heard the distant drone of an Expressway. The walkways were crowded with what were, for the most part, well-dressed people. The surroundings were remarkably--almost excessively--clean.\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldons sense of security sank further. Dorss misgivings concerning their destination now seemed justified after all. He leaned toward her and said, \"Do you think we are back in the Imperial Sector?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e She said, \"No, the buildings are more rocooo in the Imperial Sector and theres less Imperial parkishness to this sector--if you know what I mean.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then where are we, Dors?\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well have to ask, Im afraid, Hari.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e It was not a long trip and soon they rolled into a car-bay that flanked an imposing four-story structure. A frieze of imaginary animals ran along the top, decorated with strips of warm pink stone. It was an impressive facade with a rather pleasing design.\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon said, \"That certainly looks rocooo enough.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors shrugged uncertainly.\n\u003cbr\u003e Raych whistled and said in a failing attempt to sound unimpressed, \"Hey, look at that fancy place.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Sergeant Thalus gestured to Seldon clearly indicating that he was to follow. Seldon hung back and, also relying on the universal language of gesture, held out both arms, clearly including Dors and Raych. The sergeant hesitated in a slightly hangdog fashion at the impressive pink doorway. His mustache almost seemed to droop.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then he said gruffly, \"All three of you, then. My word of honor holds.--Still, others may not feel obligated by my own obligation, you know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon nodded. \"I hold you responsible for your own deeds only, Sergeant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e The sergeant was clearly moved and, for a moment, his face lightened as though he was considering the possibility of shaking Seldons hand or expressing heartfelt his approval in some other way. He decided against it, however, and stepped onto the bottom step of the flight that led to the door. The stairs immediately began a stately upward movement.\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon and Dors stepped after him at once and kept their balance without much trouble. Raych, who was momentarily staggered in surprise, jumped onto the moving stairs after a short run, shoved both hands into his pockets, and whistled carelessly.\n\u003cbr\u003e The door opened and two women stepped out, one on either side in symmetrical fashion. They were young and attractive. Their dresses, belted tightly about the waist and reaching nearly to their ankles, fell in crisp pleats and rustled when they walked. Both had brown hair that was coiled in thick plaits on either side of their heads. (Seldon found it attractive, but wondered how long it took them each morning to arrange it just so. He had not been aware of so elaborate a coiffure on the women they had passed in the streets.) The two women stared at the newcomers with obvious contempt. Seldon was not surprised. After the days events, he and Dors looked almost as disreputable as Raych.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yet the women managed to bow decorously and then made a half-turn and gestured inward in perfect unison and with symmetry carefully maintained. (Did they rehearse these things?) It was clear that the three were to enter. They stepped through an elaborate room, cluttered with furniture and decorative items whose use Seldon did not readily understand. The floor was light-colored, springy, and glowed with luminescence. Seldon noted with some embarrassment that their footwear left dusty marks upon it.\n\u003cbr\u003e And then an inner door was flung open and yet another woman emerged. She was distinctly older than the first two (who sank slowly as she came in, crossing their legs symmetrically as they did so in a way that made Seldon marvel that they could keep their balance; it undoubtedly took a deal of practice). Seldon wondered if he too was expected to display some ritualized form of respect, but since he hadnt the faintest notion of what this might consist of, he merely bowed his head slightly. Dors remained standing erect and, it seemed to Seldon, did so with disdain. Raych was staring open-mouthed in all directions and looked as though he didnt even see the woman who had just entered. She was plump--not fat, but comfortably padded. She wore her hair precisely as the young ladies did and her dress was in the same style, but much more richly ornamented--too much so to suit Seldons aesthetic notions. She was clearly middle-aged and there was a hint of gray in her hair, but the dimples in her cheeks gave her the appearance of having rather more than a dash of youth. Her light brown eyes were merry and on the whole she looked more motherly than old.\n\u003cbr\u003e She said, \"How are you? All of you.\" (She showed no surprise at the presence of Dors and Raych, but included them easily in her greeting.) \"Ive been waiting for you for some time and almost had you on Upperside at Streeling. You are Dr. Hari Seldon, whom Ive been looking forward to meeting. You, I think, must be Dr. Dors Venabili, for you had been reported to be in his company. This young man I fear I do not know, but I am pleased to see him. But we must not spend our time talking, for Im sure you would like to rest first.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"And bathe, Madam,\" said Dors rather forcefully, \"Each of us could use a thorough shower.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, certainly,\" said the woman, \"and a change in clothing. Especially the young man.\" She looked down at Raych without any of the look of contempt and disapproval that the two young women had shown. She said, \"What is your name, young man?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Raych,\" said Raych in a rather choked and embarrassed voice. He then added experimentally, \"Missus.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"What an odd coincidence,\" said the woman, her eyes sparkling. \"An omen, perhaps. My own name is Rashelle. Isnt that odd?--But come. We shall take care of you all. Then there will be plenty of time to have dinner and to talk.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wait, Madam,\" said Dors. \"May I ask where we are?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wye, dear. And please call me Rashelle, as you come to feel more friendly. I am always at ease with informality.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors stiffened. \"Are you surprised that we ask? Isnt it natural that we should want to know where we are?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Rashelle laughed in a pleasant, tinkling manner. \"Really, Dr. Venabili, something must be done about the name of this place. I was not asking a question but making a statement. You asked where you were and I did not ask you why. I told you, Wye. You are in the Wye Sector.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"In Wye?\" said Seldon forcibly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes indeed, Dr. Seldon. Weve wanted you from the day you addressed the Decennial Convention and we are so glad to have you now.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46483.html","bookId":12,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:20:34 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:20:34 AM"}
