They were smiling, both of them, and Raindrop Forty-Three, the graver one, held up a gray kirtle for Dorss inspection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is very attractive,\" said Dors, smiling widely and nodding her head with a certain sincerity. \"I like the clever embroidery here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is nothing,\" twittered Raindrop Forty-Five. \"It is one of my old things and it wont fit very well, for you are taller than I am. But it will do for a while and we will take you out to the very best kirtlery to get a few that will fit you and your tastes perfectly. You will see.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Raindrop Forty-Three, smiling a little nervously but saying nothing and keeping her eyes fixed on the ground, handed a white kirtle to Dors. It was folded neatly. Dors did not attempt to unfold it, but passed it on to Seldon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"From the color I should say its yours, Hari.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Presumably,\" said Seldon, \"but give it back. She did not give it to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Hari,\" mouthed Dors, shaking her head slightly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Seldon firmly. \"She did not give it to me. Give it back to her and Ill wait for her to give it to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors hesitated, then made a half-hearted attempt to pass the kirtle back to Raindrop Forty-Three.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Sister put her hands behind her back and moved away, all life seeming to drain from her face. Raindrop Forty-Five stole a glance at Seldon, a very quick one, then took a quick step toward Raindrop Forty-Three and put her arms about her.\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors said, \"Come, Hari, Im sure that Sisters are not permitted to talk to men who are not related to them. Whats the use of making her miserable? She cant help it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I dont believe it,\" said Seldon harshly. \"If there is such a rule, it applies only to Brothers. I doubt very much that shes ever met a tribesman before.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors said to Raindrop Forty-Three in a soft voice, \"Have you ever met a tribesman before, Sister, or a tribeswoman?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e A long hesitation and then a slow negative shake of the head.\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon threw out his arms. \"Well, there you are. If there is a rule of silence, it applies only to the Brothers. Would they have sent these young women--these Sisters--to deal with us if there was any rule against speaking to tribesmen?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It might be, Hari, that they were meant to speak only to me and I to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nonsense. I dont believe it and I wont believe it. I am not merely a tribesman, I am an honored guest in Mycogen, asked to be treated as such by Chetter Hummin and escorted here by Sunmaster Fourteen himself. I will not be treated as though I do not exist. I will be in communication with Sunmaster Fourteen and I will complain bitterly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Raindrop Forty-Five began to sob and Raindrop Forty-Three, retaining her comparative impassivity, nevertheless flushed faintly. Dors made as though to appeal to Seldon once again, but he stopped her with a brief and angry outward thrust of his right arm and then stared gloweringly at Raindrop Forty-Three.\n\u003cbr\u003e And finally she spoke and did not twitter. Rather, her voice trembled hoarsely, as though she had to force it to sound in the direction of a male being and was doing so against all her instincts and desires. \"You must not complain of us, tribesman. That would be unjust. You force me to break the custom of our people. What do you want of me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon smiled disarmingly at once and held out his hand. \"The garment you brought me. The kirtle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Silently, she stretched out her arm and deposited the kirtle in his hand. He bowed slightly and said in a soft warm voice, \"Thank you, Sister.\" He then cast a very brief look in Dorss direction, as though to say: You see? But Dors looked away angrily.\n\u003cbr\u003e The kirtle was featureless, Seldon saw as he unfolded it (embroidery and decorativeness were for women, apparently), but it came with a tasseled belt that probably had some particular way of being worn. No doubt he could work it out.\n\u003cbr\u003e He said, \"Ill step into the bathroom and put this thing on. It wont take but a minute, I suppose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e He stepped into the small chamber and found the door would not close behind him because Dors was forcing her way in as well. Only when the two of them were in the bathroom together did the door close.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"What were you doing?\" Dors hissed angrily. \"You were an absolute brute, Hari. Why did you treat the poor woman that way?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon said impatiently, \"I had to make her talk to me. Im counting on her for information. You know that. Im sorry I had to be cruel, but how else could I have broken down her inhibitions?\" And he motioned her out.\n\u003cbr\u003e When he emerged, he found Dors in her kirtle too. Dors, despite the bald head the skincap gave her and the inherent dowdiness of the kirtle, managed to look quite attractive. The stitching on the robe somehow suggested a figure without revealing it in the least. Her belt was wider than his own and was a slightly different shade of gray from her kirtle. Whats more, it was held in front by two glittering blue stone snaps. (Women did manage to beautify themselves even under the greatest difficulty, Seldon thought.)\n\u003cbr\u003e Looking over at Hari, Dors said, \"You look quite the Mycogenian now. The two of us are fit to be taken to the stores by the Sisters.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said Seldon, \"but afterward I want Raindrop Forty-Three to take me on a tour of the microfarms.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Raindrop Forty-Threes eyes widened and she took a rapid step backward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Id like to see them,\" said Seldon calmly.\n\u003cbr\u003e Raindrop Forty-Three looked quickly at Dors. \"Tribeswoman--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon said, \"Perhaps you know nothing of the farms, Sister.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e That seemed to touch a nerve. She lifted her chin haughtily as she still carefully addressed Dors. \"I have worked on the microfarms. All Brothers and Sisters do at some point in their lives.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well then, take me on the tour,\" said Seldon, \"and lets not go through the argument again. I am not a Brother to whom you are forbidden to speak and with whom you may have no dealings. I am a tribesman and an honored guest. I wear this skincap and this kirtle so as not to attract undue attention, but I am a scholar and while I am here I must learn. I cannot sit in this room and stare at the wall. I want to see the one thing you have that the rest of the Galaxy does not have ... your microfarms. I should think youd be proud to show them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"We are proud,\" said Raindrop Forty-Three, finally facing Seldon as she spoke, \"and I will show you and dont think you will learn any of our secrets if that is what you are after. I will show you the microfarms tomorrow morning. It will take time to arrange a tour.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon said, \"I will wait till tomorrow morning. But do you promise? Do I have your word of honor?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Raindrop Forty-Three said with clear contempt, \"I am a Sister and I will do as I say. I will keep my word, even to a tribesman.\" Her voice grew icy at the last words, while her eyes widened and seemed to glitter.\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon wondered what was passing through her mind and felt uneasy.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46318.html","bookId":12,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:16:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:16:45 AM"}
