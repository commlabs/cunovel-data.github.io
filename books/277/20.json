Of course, though it was a large town, it was not large enough to warrant the show in staying so long, but for the large number of visitors who were attracted from neighboring towns. Both by rail and by carriages of all sorts, from farmers\u0027 wagons to top buggies and carryalls, hundreds of people flocked to see the wonders it contained. Many a young heart was stirred with ambition to pursue the noble profession of circus performers, considering that the circus clown was as illustrious a personage, not perhaps as the President of the United States, but at least as a member of the Cabinet, or a Congressman. The time would come of course when these admiring youngsters would learn that the halo which invested the circus performer was unreal, but, for154 the time being, any one connected with the circus was a great, illustrious and envied personage. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One day Robert Rudd and Charlie Davis were standing outside the tent, near the lemonade stand, when a boy of sixteen or seventeen, clad in rustic attire and \"with hayseed in his hair,\" approached them, and, though evidently somewhat awed by the idea that he was standing in the presence of two circus performers, ventured to ask:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you two belong to the circus?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" answered Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You bet we do,\" said Charlie, vivaciously. \"The circus would have to shut up shop but for us.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert smiled, but the visitor didn\u0027t. He was too much in earnest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I seen you ridin\u0027 last evenin\u0027,\" he said, next.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you were at the performance?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; I told dad I wanted to go, and he let me have the money I earned weedin\u0027 corn, tho\u0027 he said I better keep it to buy somethin\u0027 useful.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you enjoyed the evening,\" said Robert, courteously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was splendid! I don\u0027t see how you fellows can ride so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 155\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s all in the training.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How long have you been a circus actor?\" asked the young rustic.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Five or six years; I began when I was very small.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I began as soon as I could walk,\" said Charlie, who liked to romance a little when he had an opportunity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t say so?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Fact!\" asserted Charlie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you ride on a hoss then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I rode on a Newfoundland dog. When I got older I tried a pony. Now Rob and I are the champion boy-riders of Europe and America.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Speak for yourself, Charlie,\" said Robert, smiling. \"I don\u0027t make any such claims.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, well, don\u0027t be discouraged. You\u0027ll ride as well as I do some time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You flatter me,\" said Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I say, do you think there\u0027s any chance for me to learn the business?\" asked the country boy, lowering his voice, in an anxious tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What line do you want to take up?\" asked Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 156\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is there any line?\" asked the boy, not understanding.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I mean, do you want to be a rider, a clown, an acrobat, or what?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d like to ride like you two.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am afraid you are rather large to begin,\" said Robert, surveying the boy\u0027s large hands and feet, and his height, at least three inches greater than his own.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Am I too big?\" asked the boy, disappointed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, you\u0027re not,\" said Charlie. \"Why, I could teach you myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish you would. I\u0027d like goin\u0027 round with a circus better than working for dad on the farm. Do you fellow\u0027s get paid big wages?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course we do,\" answered Charlie. \"I get fifty dollars a week, board and travelling expenses.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Fifty dollars a week!\" gasped the country boy, expanding his eyes in astonishment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, you see we\u0027re first-class performers.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I couldn\u0027t get but a dollar and a half a week and board workin\u0027 on a farm,\" answered the country boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s your name?\" asked Charlie, abruptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Jotham Sprague.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 157\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That wouldn\u0027t do for the stage; you\u0027d have to take a better name.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d take any name; fact is, I don\u0027t like Jotham myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It isn\u0027t romantic enough,\" said Charlie. \"The manager wouldn\u0027t have anybody of that name. It sounds too countrified.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What sort of a name would do?\" asked the boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Lorenzo Leon would do pretty well.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s splendid!\" said Jotham, admiringly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You see, it would look well on the bills. The famous bareback rider. Lorenzo Leon, who has just been imported from his native Italy at large expense, will perform some of his wonderful feats in the ring.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d like that first rate,\" said Jotham, \"only I ain\u0027t from Italy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No matter; no one will know that. Now, if you want to come in and take a lesson I\u0027ll give you one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How much will you charge?\" asked Jotham, eager but cautious.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I won\u0027t charge you anything. I\u0027ll do it out of friendship. Come in, Rob.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 158\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, Charlie, not just now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert suspected that Charlie meditated a practical joke, and did not care to take part in it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They entered the tent—it was in the middle of the forenoon—and Charlie went to his friend the clown, and whispered a few words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So the young gentleman wants to take a lesson in riding, does he?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" answered Jotham, eagerly, \"if you have no objection.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We\u0027ll do it for you as a favor,\" said the clown. \"What\u0027s your name, young man?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jotham was about to answer correctly, when Charlie broke in—\"His name is Lorenzo Leon, from Italy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The clown grinned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A very fine name!\" he answered. \"Bring out the Andalusian steed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n An attendant led out the trick mule, which, meekly enough, walked round the ring.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Can you ride that?\" asked the clown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes, I can ride a bigger hoss than that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mount, then, and away!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Charlie held the mule, which stood very quiet and demure, while the boy was getting on. But159 no sooner was the boy on his back than he lifted his ears and dashed round the ring in such a lively way, making sudden turns and curves, that Jotham was soon clinging to him as pale as a sheet, with his arms closely clasped about the mule\u0027s neck, in momentary expectation of being thrown off. At this most critical point the clown shouted, \"Now get up and stand on his back!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Instead of doing this Jotham roared, \"Stop him; take me off,\" in an extremity of terror.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At a signal the mule threw up his hind legs and the rider measured his length, more frightened than hurt, on the sawdust.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he picked himself up Charlie came up to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have another lesson, Lorenzo!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I guess I\u0027ll go back to farmin\u0027,\" answered Jotham, picking himself up and finding to his relief that none of his limbs were broken.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, nonsense! Try it again!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I guess not; I never would make a rider,\" and the boy left the tent completely cured of his wish to be a rider. He had received a rough but a wholesome lesson.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 160\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the evening the performance began at the usual time. There was no change in the bill, and everything was expected to go on as usual.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In due time Robert came out for his equestrian act. In the course of it he had to jump through a hoop and over a banner. While he was doing this, suddenly a stone, as large as a base ball, hurled from the spectators\u0027 seats, struck the horse, and he swerved. The result was that Robert, instead of lighting on his back, fell to the ground in such a way that he turned his ankle, while the horse dashed by.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was picked up, his face pale with the pain in his ankle, and was helped from the ring by some of the attendants.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Shame! Shame! Lynch him!\" rose from fifty indignant spectators. \"Where\u0027s the man that threw the stone?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But no one knew, except one. In one of the rear seats sat Carden, the discharged canvas man, smiling with malignant triumph at the mischief he had done.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I said I\u0027d be even with him,\" he muttered. \"I hope he\u0027s badly hurt.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Among the spectators were Sidney Grey and161 his father, Dr. Grey, a skilful physician. Both hurried to the ring.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you much hurt, Robert?\" asked Sidney, anxiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am in considerable pain, but I don\u0027t think I am seriously hurt,\" said Robert, attempting to smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will take the boy to my house,\" said Dr. Grey to the manager. \"I am a physician, and I will see that he receives every attention.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, doctor, I accept your offer gratefully,\" said Mr. Coleman. \"I am attached to the boy, and I will bear all his expenses.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There will be none, while he is at my house,\" said the doctor. \"My son has taken a liking to young Rudd, and he will be a welcome guest.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the performance was over, Carden left the tent stealthily. He had work to do that night. He bent his steps towards the house of Mr. Tarbox.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83307.html","bookId":277,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:35 AM"}
