She hesitated, ran back up to her room and opened the little dresser next to her bed, retrieving her service Glock and sliding it beneath her jacket. Then she ran down the stairs again to the front door. She looked through the ship’s portal to see who was calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man standing outside appeared to be about forty; he was of medium height with sandy-brown hair and was wearing a blue suit with a white shirt and a tie that had been loosened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCop, she thought instantly. Plainclothes cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was instinct, but she couldn’t be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes? The tavern’s closed,” she called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ms. Anderson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry to bother you, but I have a few questions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Badge?” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe produced his credentials. His badge looked real, as did the ID he flashed with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby opened the front door. The cop seemed uncomfortable. “Detective Peters, Ms. Anderson. I just remembered seeing in the papers that you were closed today for your grandfather’s funeral.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “Can I help you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here about this girl,” he said, showing her a picture. “Her name is—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Helen Long,” Abby said. “Yes, I know her. She works for a friend of my grandfather’s, Dirk Johansen. He does pirate ship tours and she plays a pirate wench.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s missing,” Peters said. “Her roommate called it in this morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby frowned. “Dirk was here all day. He didn’t mention that she was missing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He might not know yet,” Peters told her. “Helen Long was off today, and she was off yesterday. She had lunch here with friends. Do you remember seeing her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby nodded. Like so many people, Helen had made a point of approaching her to express her condolences. She hadn’t really known Gus that well. She’d only worked for Dirk for about a month. Helen had grown up in Atlanta but come to Savannah to be an extra in a pirate movie, since the exterior shots were filmed in the city. She’d been waiting to see if she’d gotten a part in another movie about to be filmed down in New Iberia, and she’d been honest with Dirk about her intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did see her. She had lunch here, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember seeing her leave?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Wait, no—she was with some girlfriends and they left first. She stayed at the bar awhile longer. I don’t know when she left. I went back upstairs after I talked to her,” Abby explained. “But my staff and a few customers might be able to tell you more. Dirk was here himself at the time, sitting with Bootsie—Bob Lanigan—and Aldous Brentwood. My bartender, Jerry Sullivan, was on, as was the day manager, Macy Sterling. I’m sure they’d be more helpful.” Abby paused, wondering about something. “Helen’s been missing since she was seen at lunch yesterday? I thought you had to wait until an adult was gone for more than twenty-four hours before you filed a report.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Usually,” Peters agreed. “But...we’ve had a few people go missing and then turn up dead. Like I said, her roommate called it in when she woke up this morning. Helen never came home last night. And she hasn’t shown up today. So—” he cleared his throat “—we’re starting early with this one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see. I’m glad,” Abby told him. “She’s a sweet girl, Detective. I wish I could help you. And you should speak with my staff and my customers. They may know more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do that tomorrow, thank you. And if you can think of anyone else who might’ve seen her, please get in touch.” He passed her a card, which she tucked into her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, then, good night,” Peters said. He looked as if he wanted to say more. “I’m sorry,” he said again, “but this was the last place her girlfriends saw her, so...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you want to search these premises, you’re more than welcome to do so,” she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll try to speak with your people first,” Peters said. “Someone might’ve seen her leave—and they might’ve seen who she left with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope so. I have a list of numbers. You can call them now, if you wish. It’s really not that late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby hurried back behind the bar and found the list Sullivan kept there of their regulars. He was a good bartender and liked to memorize their drinks. Then she moved over to the host stand to find the sheet with staff contact information, as well. Peters waited politely at the door. She gave him the pages and he thanked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby locked the door again and stood there for a moment. Where the hell was Blue?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot making an appearance that night, it seemed. Wearily she went back upstairs, sorted out the papers that had flown everywhere and sat back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt horrible. She knew Helen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, those who’d disappeared had taken a few days to be discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe there was still hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared down at the paper that was back in her hands, written in Gus’s broad scrawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe murders. Am I right? Call Abby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, as she reflected, she nearly jumped sky-high again when the office phone on the desk began to ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, papers flew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Abby!” It was Dirk Johansen. She knew why he had to be calling....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Dirk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my God! My actress—my pirate wench—Helen. She’s missing,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, Dirk. I’m so sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A detective was just here. Apparently, she was last seen having lunch at the tavern.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was thick. “Yeah, that’s the last time I saw her, too. I told the cops that,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you see her leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. She was teasing about the pirate days with Aldous, Bootsie and me...and Sullivan. Then she looked at her watch and said she had an appointment. She didn’t say who with. She just went running out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did she have a boyfriend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, she was actually doing some online dating. She said she’d met at least six guys and found one, maybe, worth a relationship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure that’ll help the police.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think she might’ve taken off on some romantic spree?” Dirk asked hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure, maybe,” Abby lied. “Dirk, what’s going to be important is that you think of any bit of information that might give the authorities some leads to follow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, right...her roommate must have her computer. That should help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I bet it will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn awkward silence followed. Then Abby said, “Dirk, I’m going to get some sleep. In the morning—” She hesitated, thinking about Gordon. The hell with him. He’d have to play it her way. “In the morning, I’ll be your personal agent. We’ll find her. How about that?” The local police might not be impressed with her, but Dirk might want her help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, um, well, actually, that was what I was going to ask you,” Dirk said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To help you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you to be my wench.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have a wench for tomorrow. Helen shared the job with Chrissy Sutton, and Chrissy is in Atlanta, visiting her mom. She won’t be back until late tomorrow night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. She thought she might be wanted for her investigative skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk wanted a wench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my God. She’s missing. I’m terrified for her. But...I still have to keep it going, keep others working.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe it wasn’t a bad idea. She could talk with shipmates who knew Helen; she could hang out at the dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure, Dirk. I’ll be your wench.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate to ask you after...after Gus and all, but...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be there, Dirk. What time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ship leaves for the first run at ten. We’re back at one. Second run at three. Last one leaves right at sunset. I’ll need you to show up at about nine for costuming and a few instructions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, Dirk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bless you, Abby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to reply but he’d already hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby let her head fall on the table. Gus... She’d been sick about Gus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut two young women and a man had also died. Now Helen was gone....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really needed help. And what she’d gotten was Malachi Gordon. Maybe he did have a few talents with the dead. But whoever had taken Helen had to be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery much alive—and very busy in the beautiful city of Savannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk’s Black Swan was a beautiful ship. She was a schooner with one large square-rigged mainmast; her figurehead was that of a mermaid crowned with pearls. Topside was the great helm on the forecastle and behind it was a stage of about twenty by thirty feet, surrounded by seating at the inner hull. There were barrels around, advertising rum or gunpowder, and Dirk’s parrot, Achilles, sat on a little perch in the center of the stage. Toward the aft, down a few steps, was a snack shop that also offered gifts and souvenirs, and passengers could step atop the sterncastle, above the captain’s quarters, to catch a great view of the riverfront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi Gordon had called Abby bright and early—at 7:00 a.m.—to make sure she’d be ready for their planned excursion of the city and the river. She began to tell him about Helen’s disappearance but he already knew. When she explained that not only was she helping out an old friend but she’d get a chance to be on the pirate ship and the docks, he wasn’t angry. Nor was he disappointed. He just said he’d catch up with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDressed in pirate gear, custom-made by a costumer to resemble the real thing rather than a contemporary Halloween fashion, Abby stood with Dirk’s two main performers, Jack Winston and Blake Stewart. “Don’t worry about anything, Abby,” Jack said. “Dirk really runs the show. Our characters serve grog—to the adults—and soda to the kids. It’s fun, honestly. Blake and I get into a fight over you, we split up some treasure and we have a few songs. All you do is respond and react.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-alive-krewe-of-hunters-10/page-11.html","bookId":2284,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:48:37 PM"}
