{"id":12401,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"Jack sat staring at the letter he had just read, deeply stirred by feelings new to him. Youth generally is profoundly unaware of the hearts of the aged. The feeling is that the old have had their day, have cooled off and hardened, and practically ceased to exist. It came with a shock of surprise to Jack to learn that an old man might be misunderstood, bitter, hungry for affection—just the same as a young one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Poor old fellow!\" he murmured. \"He thought of me a lot! He was good to me. And I never knew. If I had known him I might have made his last days easier. I might have prevented what happened.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hard on these softer feelings rose a slow tide of anger. \"Oh, the devils! To think up such a fiend\u0027s game! And then to get away with it! It\u0027s too much for an honest man to stand! I wish I could pay them off! ... I will pay them off. I have power now. That shall be my job. If I live I\u0027ll square this account!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He registered his vow with an involuntary glance upward at his mother\u0027s portrait. It seemed to him that the wistful face softened on him in approval.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The impulse to action brought Jack to his feet. Peeping through the curtains he saw that darkness had fallen outside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good Lord!\" he thought astonished. \"How long have I been here!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His watch informed him that it was eight o\u0027clock. He picked up the lamp, and with a last look around the strange room turned to leave. He had a feeling that that place marked a turning point in his life. He would never again be quite the light-hearted boy that had entered it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had forgotten the dog. The little beast seeing his purpose, and terrified of being left alone again, threw himself against Jack\u0027s legs in a desperate appeal to be taken along.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack stooped to caress him. \"Poor old fellow!\" he said. \"I wonder how long it is since you saw the light of the sun. I can\u0027t take you now, honest I can\u0027t. But you be patient. I\u0027ll be back to-morrow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the tiny animal thrust himself into Jack\u0027s embrace and would not be denied. Jack finally picked him up and thrust him in his coat pocket. He settled down quite contentedly, only his nozzle and his bright eyes showing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well I guess you must be accustomed to this mode of travel,\" said Jack. \"I\u0027m going to call you Jumbo because that\u0027s not your name.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Carefully locking all the doors behind him, he left the lamp in the hotel sitting-room, and made his way out by the private entrance. His impulse was to seek his own hall bedroom, the nearest thing to home that he knew, and there alone, amidst familiar surroundings, to try to bring some order out of his whirling thoughts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack\u0027s boarding house was in the West Forties near Eighth avenue, in the center of that vast colony of boarders. His way from the Madagascar lay up Broadway for three short blocks, then westward for a long one. He passed through the throng hurrying theaterward without seeing anybody; he forgot that he had had no dinner; he forgot that his pocket was full of money and was tempted by none of the alluring show-windows.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The burden of his thoughts was: \"It\u0027s a big job! A big job! I can\u0027t afford to make any mistake at the start!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In front of a corner newsstand he was brought up all standing by a glimpse of the staring headlines of the night editions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HEIR TO THE GYDE MILLIONS\n\u003cbr\u003e FOUND IN A HALL BEDROOM\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A POOR BOY IS ENRICHED BEYOND THE DREAMS OF\n\u003cbr\u003e AVARICE\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Old Romance in the Dead Millionaire\u0027s Life Revealed\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack bought several papers, and standing in a doorway out of the press of the crowd, experienced the first wonderful thrill of finding himself famous. There is nothing else quite like it. How you became famous is a secondary matter. To find yourself on the first page is enough: to see the shape of your name in print. Many a good head has been turned for life by it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the papers offered sensational versions of Jack\u0027s story, more or less accurate. It had apparently been given out at Delamare\u0027s office in the first place, and so far they had it pretty straight. But they went on to embroider it. The more reckless sheets even printed interviews which caused Jack to grind his teeth, they made him out such a fool. One paper printed an alleged photograph, but it was a safely fuzzy photograph that might have been taken for almost anybody. They had discovered the address of his boarding-house, but in his absence his landlady, Mrs. Regan, had refused to be drawn out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good old girl!\" thought Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The soberer sheets promised an interview in later editions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027re looking for me now!\" thought Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Being human, Jack could not but feel a pleasurable thrill, but his head was not quite turned. He glanced at the hurrying passers-by whimsically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They wouldn\u0027t rush by so fast if they knew this was he,\" he thought. But he had no intention of calling their attention to the fact. Silas Gyde\u0027s reference to the danger of too much publicity was present in his mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned into his own street keeping a wary eye ahead. Mrs. Regan\u0027s boarding house was three-quarters of the way down the block, one of a long row of dwellings with little grass plots in front and iron railings. Sure enough by the light of a street lamp Jack made out the figures of a group of men at her gate. As he came closer he saw that several of them carried cameras with flash light attachments.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His first impulse was to flee, but recollecting that they could not possibly know yet what he looked like, he walked boldly up to the group, and asked the New Yorker\u0027s stock question of a street crowd:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Somepin the matter here?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One replied: \"This where Jack Norman lives. We\u0027re waitin\u0027 for him to come home.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was already so famous no further explanation was deemed necessary.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Gee!\" said Jack with a glance at the shabby fa?ade. \"I guess he\u0027ll soon be moving.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A laugh greeted this witty sally.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh boy!\" groaned one youth. \"Think of having a hundred millions handed you, just like that. It\u0027s too much!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A photographer said: \"Well, I\u0027m gonna ast him for one million. He\u0027d never miss it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What like fellow is he?\" asked Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Same aged guy as us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Worked for twelve per until this morning. Say his old boss was sore as a pup when he heard what he come in for.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They say he\u0027s a bad actor all right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure, a whale! They say he\u0027s already burned up Broadway from Herald Square to the Circle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re wrong, fellow! I heard his roll\u0027s as adhesive as rubber tape. Same as the old man\u0027s before him. Wouldn\u0027t even pry off a nickel to give the poor boy who told him the news.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say, when a guy once gets in the papers, scandal begins!\" said Jack disgustedly. Seeing Mrs. Regan at her parlor window, and fearful that she might give him away, he walked on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From a drug-store on Eighth avenue he telephoned back to Mrs. Regan, asking her to come to him there. \"Don\u0027t let anything on to those guys at the gate,\" he warned her. \"I want to keep out of sight for a few days.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She came into the store in a breathless state of fluster. She was a good-hearted Irishwoman of considerable energy of character and a racy style of speech. But at present she was considerably overcome.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Mr. Norman! Oh, Mr. Norman!\" she gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Easy with my name!\" warned Jack. \"I\u0027m going to be Mr. Robinson for awhile now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is it true what they say in the papers?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"More or less.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh law! To think of anything like this happening in my house! And the third floor rear hall at that! But that\u0027s always the way ain\u0027t it, like a story like? The telephone\u0027s been going like a Big Ben ever since twelve o\u0027clock, asking for you. And you such a pleasant ordinary young fellow—not to say ordinary-like, but not stuck up at all, just like one of us!\" She paused for breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Easy, Mrs. Regan,\" whispered Jack. \"That clerk\u0027s got ears like a water pitcher.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll be careful. What did you want of me, Mr. Nor—Robinson?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"First, I want you to know my friend Jumbo,\" said Jack, handing him over. \"Let him have my eats while I\u0027m away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Laws! Ain\u0027t he cute!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll telephone in every little while for news. Please pack up my things for me. I\u0027ll tell you later where to send them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re going to leave!\" cried Mrs. Regan. \"But of course it\u0027s natural,\" she added quickly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you make any mistake,\" said Jack. \"I\u0027m not going to forget any of the friends who knew me when I was poor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I done my best for you! But with prices the way they is——!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know. Now I want you to promise not to give out a thing about me, no descriptions of me, no information of any kind. I know it will be hard to resist those taking young reporters, but I ask it as a favor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Mr. N—Robinson! Go on! At my age!— It\u0027s little they\u0027ll get out of me, I can tell you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I knew I could bank on you. I\u0027ll tell you all about it some day. I\u0027ve got to beat it now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good-by. Oh—wait! I almost forgot. I\u0027m that excited! A messenger boy left a note for you at the door this evening. I brought it along.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack took the note and left. Mrs. Regan, a little disappointed at not being taken further into his confidence, turned in the other direction. When she was out of sight, Jack stopped under a street lamp and examined what she had given him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a cheap, flimsy envelope much soiled. The address was scrawled in an illiterate hand. He opened it, and this was what he read:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jack Norman:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We don\u0027t call you dear sir, because this ain\u0027t no friendly letter. We know all about you. We\u0027re the gang what croaked old Silas Gyde, and we\u0027re going to get you next, see? You needn\u0027t think you\u0027re going to be let to blow in his tainted money. You millionaires are a dirty disgrace, and we\u0027re going to rid the country of you. You can\u0027t hide away from us. We are everywhere. Gun, knife, bomb or dope: it\u0027s all the same to us. And if you show this to the police you\u0027ll only get yours quicker.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The Red Gang.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack\u0027s young face turned grim. \"So it\u0027s begun!\" he thought. \"Well, I\u0027m just as glad they didn\u0027t keep me in suspense. I\u0027m ready to start. We\u0027ll see who\u0027s got the best set of wits!\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61341.html","bookId":443,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:40:37 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:40:37 AM"}
