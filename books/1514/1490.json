It looked to be about thirty years in age, appearing extremely young, with his lustrous face and scholarly look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she saw this person who had suddenly appeared, Ling Qingzhu’s long and shapely eyebrows slightly knitted together as she said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe, such a violent woman, smashing my bones and stone coffin to bits and still asking who I am.” Upon hearing these words, the scholarly man could not help but slightly smirk as he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hearing this, Lin Dong’s and Ling Qingzhu’s expressions abruptly changed: “You are the master of the tomb?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe, no need to be nervous, I have indeed truly died. This is only remnant Yuan spirit, plus, I was sealed within the stone coffin, If you did not destroy the stone coffin, I would never have appeared.” The scholarly man chuckled as he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shameless one, to think that an elder would actually use such despicable means!” Ling Qingzhu bit her teeth, as the rage within her clear eyes gushed forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Matters between man and woman are originally in accordance to the Yin and Yang of heaven and earth, how can you call it shameless. As long as a couple are harmonious and compliment each other, would that not be better?” The scholarly man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense, I will settle this problem myself!” Ling Qingzhu replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your method is not a good thing to this youngster.” The scholarly man replied in a indifferent tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will definitely repay him, no need for you to meddle!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot do that, I’ve set up this hurdle not to cause harm to others, but for the beauty of becoming an adult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange smile surfaced on the scholarly man’s face. His gaze swept over Lin Dong’s and Ling Qingzhu’s bodies, as he slightly smiled and said: “Young chap, you are truly fortunate, even I have never seen such an absolute beauty before, you must treat her well in future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn odd look filled Lin Dong’s face, this guy...did he have a problem with his head?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you plan on doing?” Upon hearing his words, Lin Qingzhu’s expression turned frosty, and her voice also became even more icy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The beauty of becoming an adult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scholarly man slightly chuckled, soon after, his hand pointed in the air, as the Nirvana Heart that was absorbed into Ling Qingzhu’s body thoroughly exploded. An extremely pure Yin energy was like a tide as it gushed forth. In a flash, it completely froze the Yuan Power in Ling Qingzhu’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Yuan Power in Ling Qingzhu’s body was frozen, a feeling of weakness immediately appeared. Meanwhile, a bright light also erupted from the green lotus below her feet, desperately trying to dispel the pure Yin energy in Ling Qingzhu’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensing the changes in her body, an alarmed look finally surfaced in Ling Qingzhu’s limpid eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? Possessing such a treasure, looks like your background is not weak. However, to a dead man like me, it means nothing.” Upon seeing that the green lotus had actually resisted the spread of the pure Yin energy, the scholarly man was also a little astonished. Soon after, he laughed as his finger once again pointed out in the air. A ray of light shot out and straightaway wrapped around the green lotus, completely separating it from Ling Qingzhu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buzz buzz!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green lotus frantically struggled as it shot out rays of light. However, it was still unable to escape the scholarly man’s seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the green lotus was sealed, the green ropes of light that tied up Lin Dong also completely dissipated. Once he had escaped from his bindings, he rapidly retreated without hesitation. He did not expect that, in the end, even an already dead Nirvana practitioner would show himself. It was best not to linger too long in such a scarey place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe, little one, I’m giving you something good, why are you running.” Upon seeing Lin Dong back away, the scholarly man merely let out a laugh in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heh heh, this young one understands the elder’s good intentions, however, I truly do not want this thing.” Lin Dong let out a hollow laugh. After taking a look at Ling Qingzhu, who had been suppressed such that she could not even lift a finger, he was able to guess what this scholarly man was up to. Perhaps, doing it with such a beauty was every man’s dream, but, after that...the troubles that followed would not be small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one can reject the things I want to give.” The scholarly man smiled as he shook his head. His finger pointed out as Lin Dong’s body froze, before once again floating towards the struggling Ling Qingzhu against his control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I’m still missing something to start this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he gazed at Ling Qingzhu, who was glaring at Lin Dong as they faced each other, the scholarly man rubbed his chin. With a flick of his finger, two pink lights swept forth, before finally tunnelling into Lin Dong’s and Ling Qingzhu’s bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the pink light entered his body, Lin Dong felt his body instantly start to heat up. A nefarious fire appeared in his lower abdomen and quickly spread across his entire body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Lin Dong’s body was burning, Lin Qingzhu’s exposed snow-white skin also started to turn especially red. Her originally limpid eyes were also struggling as they were gradually filled with an erotic mist. Her body was practically filled with the pure Yin energy, and in front of her, Lin Dong’s body emitted pure Yang energy. This kind of feeling was as if an extremely cold person saw a warm stove, and could not help but leap towards it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shameless one!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs her rationality gradually faded, Ling Qingzhu’s marvelous figure continued to tremble, but, she still gritted her teeth as her voice softly sounded out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everything happens for a reason. If you did not destroy the stone coffin, I would not appear. However, since I have already appeared, you will naturally have to follow my rules…” The scholarly man had a smile on his face as he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elder, this is no fun, I think it’s better to let me go.” Lin Dong persistently endured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scholarly man had his hands behind his back and a small smile on his face, but he did not say anything in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God damnit, this is too much! Small marten! Small marten!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon seeing this, Lin Dong could do nothing but cry out in his mind. However, the small marten which usually appeared had completely disappeared at this time. No matter how Lin Dong cried, it did not say even half a word in response. This angered Lin Dong so much that he almost saw stars. This guy was too unreliable, such a let down at this critical moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, while Lin Dong was doing his best to resist the burning nefarious flame in his body, a slim lotus-root like arm suddenly touched his neck. A soft and tender body that did not seem to have any bones was like a water snake as it stuck itself into Lin Dong’s embrace, while a fragrance gushed into up his nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fragrance and the softness in his arms was like a fuse that had been ignited, causing Lin Dong’s eyes to momentarily turn red. He bitterly endured as his mind grew increasingly weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lin Dong, if you dare to touch me, when I regain my senses, I will definitely take your life!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beauty lay powerless in Lin Dong’s embrace. The eyes of the originally unattainable goddess was now like silk, as she transformed into an enchanting demoness who could steal one’s soul. She faintly panted as she leaned against Lin Dong, but a soft voice still sounded out from under her veil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon seeing that this woman still dared to utter such fierce words even at this moment, Lin Dong was first taken aback, but soon after, he became furious. Once he recalled that woman had previously ignored whether he lived and died in order to forcefully seize his Yang energy, he became so angry that he could not forgive her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will make sure you see how I touch you today!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis raged burned, as his eyes turned scarlet red. His rationality had been directly destroyed by Ling Qingzhu’s words. With a roar, his tossed aside the fear in his heart and reached out his hand, tearing away the veil on Ling Qingzhu’s face with a single swipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe veil slowly fell, and the shockingly gorgeous face below was finally revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he already knew that she would be extremely beautiful under the veil, in that moment, Lin Dong still lost his breath, so much so that even his already faded rationality, once again temporarily surfaced because of this incomparably alarming beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A glance can cause a city to be ruined, and a second glance the entire kingdom. Such an exceptional beauty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the scholarly man softly praised out in this moment. Soon after, he slightly smiled as his hand gently raised. Rays of light swept forth, before transforming into a thick ball of light, which directly wrapped around Lin Dong and Ling Qingzhu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little one, the fact that you’ve obtained the Ancient Heavenly Scales Halberd, makes me feel that our meeting was fated. Since you’ve paid your respects to me, let me send you another gift.” The ball of light condensed, and the scholarly man once again chuckled. A beam of light shot out from the tip of his finger before entering the ball of light and into Lin Dong’s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe, I can still enjoy the beauty of becoming an adult even after death, truly marvelous indeed…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter finishing his words, the scholarly man finally nodded his head in satisfaction. Letting out a hearty laughter to the skies, his body slowly burst open and transformed into numerous specks of light which scattered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the scholarly man disappeared, the stone hall became completely quiet. Only the massive ball of light was left as it floated in mid air. Faintly, palpitating thoughts of love quietly emitted from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two fuzzy figures tightly joined together in the ball of light, like Yin and Yang, and the mixture of water and milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence in the stone hall lasted for quite some time, before finally being broken by a soft ‘ka cha’ sound. On the ball of light, lines of cracks swiftly formed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cracks quickly spread, and in a few short moments, it exploded with a loud bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the ball of light transformed into specks of light which filled the sky, two figures also quickly swept out from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man’s strong and healthy figure landed on the ground, completely dressing himself while still in mid-air. Once he landed, he did not hesitate in the slightest as the tip of his foot pushed off the ground and directly transformed into a blurred figure, which rushed towards the huge copper door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Flame, quickly leave!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong was evidently extremely loyal. At this time, he did not forget to warn Little Flame, which was lying on the ground while waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hearing his voice, Little Flame also swiftly leaped forward, before quickly fleeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDozens of meters were crossed in the blank of an eye. However, just as Lin Dong was about to escape through the huge copper door, an ice-cold aura of death was like a demoness, as it appeared before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swish!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beautiful figure appeared and likewise did not say anything, as her lily-white hand raised. A green light filled with a formidable and cold murderous aura swiftly shot out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-178\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-180\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-179","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:56 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:56 AM"}
