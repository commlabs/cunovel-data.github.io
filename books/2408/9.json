It\u0027s back in the soft-data section of Wright\u0027s file. You know about the Murdock killing?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`It happened in New York five years ago. Wright was married to a girl named Sarah Layne, and when it broke up, she started seeing a man named Murdock. A Texas oil man. Big spender, big ladies\u0027 man.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well, Murdock got an anonymous tip that he would be killed. Got it about seven in the morning. He believed it, so he called his chauffeur and had him go over the car carefully. The chauffeur found a bomb, and notified Murdock. Murdock went down to the garage to see the bomb and had his chauffeur remove it. The chauffeur carried it away. And Murdock, who was an oilman and interested in explosives, leaned into the engine compartment to examine how the bomb had been wired in. And thirty seconds after the first bomb was removed, a second one exploded. Murdock was killed instantly.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Nice.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wright was questioned but never charged. There was nothing to point to him. That\u0027s the story. But whoever did it knew a lot about Murdock.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You think that\u0027s the way Wright operates?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I know it is.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis was silent for a moment. `Why are we going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto the police station?\u0027 -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`To find out how much Wright knows about me,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spinning drum produced the transmitted image with almost painful slowness. It made a loud, distracting, clanking sound. Nevertheless, when the first sheet came off the drum Graves grabbed it up eagerly and read with intense concentration -ignoring the clanking, the room, the cops all around, Lewis, everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first sheet was printed out in block letters, as Wright\u0027s file had been:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING: JOHN NORMAN GRAVES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(STATE INT: DOM)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eREASON FOR TEST: FIVE YEAR SURVEY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAUTHORIZATION FOR TEST: D/STATE 784-334-404\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: QUERY SUITABILITY FOR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDOMESTIC WORK\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTEST SCORES AND RESULTS:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.

ON THE ONE HAND, SUBJECT USES COLOUR AS A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHAT HE SEES IN THE FORM. THIS SUGGESTS EMOTIONAL VOLATILITY AND IMPULSIVENESS. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE IS RESPECTFUL OF THE FORMS OF THE COLOUR, SUGGESTING CAUTION AND PERHAPS OVER COMPLIANCE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB. DYNAMIC CONTENT: THERE IS A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON THEMES OF MASCULINE AGGRESSION. WAR, ANIMALS FIGHTING, WEAPONS, AND BLOOD RECUR OFTEN. A SENSE OF COMPETITION AND STRUGGLE IS USUALLY PRESENT.

TEST BEHAVIOUR: SUBJECT CLEARLY REGARDS THIS TESTING SITUATION AS ONE IN WHICH HE MUST PROVE HIMSELF. IN LINE WITH HIS COMPETITIVE IMPULSES, HE DEFINITELY PLAYS OFF THE TESTER IN A RATHER UNUSUAL MANNER. HE DOES NOT TRY TO PLEASE THE TESTER OR WIN HIS APPROVAL. NOR DOES HE EVIDENCE HESITANCY OR UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HIS CHOSEN ANSWERS. INSTEAD, HE UTILIZES THE TESTER AS A SOURCE OF INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEST ITSELF. HE ATTEMPTS TO MANIPULATE THE TESTER. ONE HAS THE SENSE THAT HE BRINGS ALL POSSIBLE RESOURCES TO ANY TEST SITUATION - AND HE REGARDS THE TESTER AS ONE AVAILABLE RESOURCE. THIS IS NOT STRICTLY FAIR, OF COURSE. BUT THERE IS A CERTAIN AMORAL QUALITY ABOUT THE SUBJECT IN COMPETITIVE SITUATIONS. ONE FEELS HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO WIN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2.

He handed it to Graves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN COMPETITIVE SITUATIONS THESE MORALITIES ARE ABANDONED, AND IF THERE IS A CONFLICT - SUCH AS TWO MEN COMPETING FOR THE FAVOURS OF ONE WOMAN - THE SUBJECT WILL CHEERFULLY PROPOSE CHEATING IN ORDER TO WIN THE DAY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePSYCHOGENETICALLY IT IS CLEAR THE SUBJECT IS COMPETING WITH HIS FATHER IN A CLASSIC OEDIPAL SITUATION. STORIES ABOUT THE FATHER EMPHASIZE THE DEMANDING, UNCOMPROMISING, AND COMPETITIVE QUALITY OF THE FATHER-FIGURE AND THE DIFFICULTY OF WINNING APPROVAL. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE SUBJECT LIVES IN A WORLD PEOPLED BY HIS FATHER, AGAINST WHOM HE MUST CONSTANTLY STRIVE AND COMPETE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFAILURE IS ABHORRENT TO THE SUBJECT. HE USUALLY DOES NOT ALLOW THAT IT MIGHT OCCUR. PHYSICALLY HE EQUATES FAILURE WITH CASTRATION. THE FEAR OF FAILURE IS SO GREAT THAT THE SUBJECT MAY BE IMPULSIVE.

THIS IS CONFIRMED BY PAST IQ TESTS, WHICH HAVE SCORED THE SUBJECT IN THE 130-140 RANGE.

SUMMARY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Is there another sheet?\u0027 Graves asked. `It\u0027s coming, it\u0027s coming,\u0027 Lewis said. He smiled `You\u0027re really devouring this, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 `I think it\u0027s important.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Don\u0027t you know it all already? It\u0027s about you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No,\u0027 Graves said. `It\u0027s what somebody else thinks of me. There\u0027s a difference.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis shrugged. The third and final sheet came from the printer. Graves read it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN SUMMARY WE CAN SAY THAT JOHN GRAVES IS A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT, IMAGINATIVE, AND CONVENTIONALLY MORAL MAN WITH AN ASTOUNDINGLY STRONG COMPETITIVE DRIVE. HIS NEED TO COMPETE IS ALMOST HIS MOST OUTSTANDING TRAIT. IT SEEMS TO OVERWHELM EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF HIS PERSONALITY. IT IS HIGHLY DEVELOPED, AND RUTHLESS IN THE EXTREME. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT HE IS A GOOD BETTOR, GAMBLER, POKER AND CHESS PLAYER - TO NAME HOBBIES HE PROFESSES TO LIKE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIF THERE ARE ANY DEFECTS OR HIDDEN FLAWS IN HIS BEHAVIOUR, THEY ARE HIS IMPULSIVENESS AND HIS DESIRE TO FINISH A TEST SITUATION RAPIDLY. HE FREQUENTLY PERFORMS BELOW HIS MAXIMUM LEVEL BECAUSE OF A DESIRE FOR SPEED. HE OFTEN FEELS THAT A PROBLEM IS SOLVED WHEN IT IS ONLY HALF FINISHED, OR TWO-THIRDS FINISHED. THIS SITUATION MUST BE GUARDED AGAINST BY HAVING A LESS BRILLIANT BUT MORE THOROUGH PERSON CHECKING HIS WORK AT INTERVALS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves stared at the last page. `Is that all?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis nodded at the photoprinter, which had turned itself off, the roller no longer spinning. `Looks like it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I\u0027ll be damned,\u0027 Graves said. He folded the sheets carefully, put them in his pocket, and left the police station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio crackled. `701, this is 702. We are following the limo east on Route Five.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves picked up the microphone. `Who\u0027s in the limo?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Only the subject, 701. And the chauffeur.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Nobody else?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No, 701.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`When did they leave the apartment?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`About five minutes ago.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`All right, 702. Out.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves looked at Lewis. `Where now?\u0027 Lewis asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Route Five, east,\u0027 Graves said. `And step on it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe White Grumman Gulf Stream jet landed gracefully and taxied to a stop near a small hangar. The side door went down and two men climbed off. Several workmen in coveralls boarded the plane. After a moment they began unloading two large cardboard boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding near the end of the runway of the small private field in El Cajon, Graves squinted through binoculars. The heat made everything shimmer; San Diego was hot, but El Cajon, twelve miles inland, was much hotter. `Can you make it out?\u0027 Graves asked.,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him Lewis leaned against the-roof of the sedan to steady his arms as he held the binoculars. He pulled his elbows up quickly. `Ouch,\u0027 he said. He held the binoculars freehand. `I don\u0027t know what they are,\u0027 he said. `But I know what they look like. They look like mattress boxes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves lowered his glasses. `That\u0027s what they look like to me. Where did this flight originate?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Salt Lake. A private airfield.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Mattresses from Utah? Did the plane make intermediate stops?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis shook his head. `I don\u0027t know. But it certainly wouldn\u0027t have to stop: it\u0027s got a cruising range of just under four thousand miles.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile they watched, they heard the tinny sound of the car radio saying, `The President is due to arrive at any moment. The delegates are tense with anticipation. No one yet knows what he intends -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves reached in and clicked it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the workmen carried the two mattresssized boxes into a green hangar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`He rented that hangar last week,\u0027 Lewis said. `Moved a lot of equipment in.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What kind of equipment?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Nobody\u0027s had a look yet.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves bit his lip. That was an opportunity they\u0027d missed. Several days ago somebody should have been in that hangar at midnight, taking pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Do you want to move in on him now?\u0027 Lewis asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves shook his head. `He\u0027s got five or six workmen there. There\u0027s two of us, and two in 702. None of us have guns.\u0027 He sighed. `Besides, what if they really are mattresses?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`They can\u0027t be.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves didn\u0027t think it possible either. But he wasn\u0027t willing to take a chance. He found himself worrying about Wright\u0027s new apartment in San Diego. Perhaps this was all a diversion, a feint to get him away from the apartment while something important was done there. He had no confidence in the men sitting across the street, observing and filming. Like every organization in the world, the State Department hired mundane men to carry out mundane jobs. Stationary surveillance was the most mundane. If the men weren\u0027t dull when they started, they soon became that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`We\u0027ll wait,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mattresses were taken into the hangar, and the limousine was driven inside. The doors were closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Time?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Twelve forty-one,\u0027 Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute passed, and then something remarkable happened. The men came out of the hangar and walked over to the aeroplane. They stood alongside it, ostensibly checking it over but actually doing nothing at all; just waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWright was not among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I don\u0027t get it,\u0027 Graves said. `Where\u0027s Wright?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`He must still be inside.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir sedan was parked more than 200 yards from the hangar. But the wind was blowing in their direction, and they heard a faint mechanical sound. A kind of thumping or chugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis. opened the trunk and took out a directional microphone. It looked like a miniature radar antenna - a dish two feet in diameter, with a central barrel protruding. He put on earphones and tuned in the microphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What are you getting?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis shifted the direction of the mike slightly. It was quite sensitive, but had to be aimed precisely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Wind.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Can you get that not -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave Graves the earphones. Graves listened. With the microphone aimed directly, the mechanical sound was clear. It consisted of a low hum with an intermittent pulsing thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Sounds like a pump to me,\u0027 he said. He listened to the sound for several seconds more. `What do you make of it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`A pump,\u0027 Lewis said, glancing at his watch. `It\u0027s been going five minutes now.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves turned from the hangar to the aeroplane and the men who were clustered around it. They had broken up into small groups of two and three, talking quietly, occasionally glancing at the hangar. George, the chauffeur, was among them. Several of the workmen asked George questions. George kept shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves set down his binoculars. Why would you clear everybody out of the hangar? He could think of only one reason: Wright didn\u0027t want them to see what was going on. But as he thought about it, he saw a second reason: that Wright was engaged in something very dangerous and wanted the others a safe distance away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDangerous how? Radiation? Explosives? What?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Ten minutes now,\u0027 Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves scratched his head. He lit a cigarette and stared at the others by the aeroplane. It didn\u0027t make sense, he thought. Whatever Wright intended, it didn\u0027t make sense. If he didn\u0027t want the workmen around, he could easily have timed it so that they would be out to lunch. Instead he\u0027d aroused their curiosity. They\u0027d talk about this episode for days, maybe weeks afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently Wright didn\u0027t care about that. Why not? And then as he watched, the workmen began walking back to the hangar. He had seen no signal, but they all moved at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis took off the earphones. `Fifteen minuses,\u0027 he said. `The pump\u0027s stopped.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves checked his watch. It was a few minutes before 1 PM. He was beginning to feel tired. It had been a long day already, starting with the call from Phelps at 4 Am and the trip to Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tit another cigarette and watched the hangar. And then things began to happen very fast. The limousine drove out and off towards the entrance to the airfield. And a second vehicle emerged from the hangar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moving van. It followed the limousine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves got onto the intercom. `702, this is 701. You got them?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Got them, 701.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Stay with them. If they split up, follow the limousine; forget the van.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Right, 701. Are you with us?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No,\u0027 Graves said. `We\u0027re staying here.\u0027 He clicked off the microphone and said to Lewis, `I want to look inside that hangar.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOUR 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEL CAJON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1 PM PDT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took them three minutes to get to the hangar, and by that time it was deserted except for an elderly man who was cleaning up with a long broom. There were one or two workmen out by the jet, but they paid no attention as Graves and Lewis went into the hangar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man waved and leaned on his broom. `You looking for Mr Johnson?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yes,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Just missed him,\u0027 the old man said. `Left a couple minutes ago.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Damn,\u0027 Graves said. `You know where he went?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No idea,\u0027 the old man said. `He\u0027s a strange one.
