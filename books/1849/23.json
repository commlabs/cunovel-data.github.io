Our foreheads touch—every pant, every breath mixing and mingling. Her h*ps move with mine, like the flow of the ocean. Back and forth. In frenzied unison. Together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes lock. “God, Drew…don’t stop…please, don’t ever stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m drowning in her. I can barely draw a breath. But somehow I grind out, “I won’t. I’ll never stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel it when she comes. Every scorching wet inch of her tightens blissfully around me. And it’s so good…so savagely intense I want to f**king weep from the pleasure. I bury my face in her neck, inhaling her, devouring her. And then I’m coming with her—within her. Bathing her insides with each carnal thrust. Sweet electricity races through me as one word falls from my lips over and over again:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kate…Kate…Kate…Kate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s miraculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several moments, our bodies still. The only sounds in the room are our rapid breaths and pounding heartbeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Kate whispers, “Drew? Are you all right?” I lift my head and find her beautiful eyes looking at me with concern. Her hand cups my cheek gently. “You’re shaking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you ever tried to take a picture of something really far away? And you look through the lens and the whole scene is a blurry blob? So you mess with the focus; you zoom in and out. And then the camera whirls and seconds later—boom—instant clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything snaps into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture is as clear as crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what it’s like for me—right now—looking at Kate. Suddenly, it’s all so obvious. So frigging clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m in love with her. Totally. Helplessly. Pathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate owns me. Body and soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s all I think about. She’s everything I never thought I wanted. She’s not just perfect—she’s perfect for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d do anything for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want her near me, with me. All the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not just the sex. It’s not just her gorgeous body or her brilliant mind. It’s not just that she makes me think or how eager she is to challenge me. It’s more than any of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s all of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve broken every goddamn rule I’ve ever set for myself to be with her. And it wasn’t just to f**k her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was to have her. To keep her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did I not see it before? How come I didn’t know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey?” She kisses me softly on the lips. “Where’d you go? I lost you for a minute. Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…” I swallow harshly. “Kate, I…” I take a deep breath. “I…I’m fine.” I smile and kiss her back. “I think you just wore me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs. “Wow. Never thought that would happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah—tell me about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI KNOW WHAT YOU’RE THINKING: What the fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I realized that I’m in love with Kate, and she’s obviously infatuated with me—how does she end up back with Billy Why-Don’t-You-Just-Die-Already Warren?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcellent question. We’re almost there. But first: a science lesson. What do you know about frogs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. I said frogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you know that if you put a frog in boiling water, he’ll jump out? But, if you put one in cold water and heat it slowly, he’ll stay in. And boil to death. He won’t even try to get out. He won’t even know he’s dying. Until it’s too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen are a lot like frogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I freaked out by my little epiphany? Of course I was. It was huge. Life-changing. No more strange p**sy. No more stories for the guys. No more Saturday nights. But none of that mattered anymore. Honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was too late. I was already boiling—for Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat whole night I watched her sleep. And made plans…for us. The things we’d do together, the places we’d go—tomorrow and next weekend and next year. I practiced what I would say, how I would tell her my feelings. I imagined her reaction and how she would confess she felt the same way. It was like a movie, some horrible chick flick that I would never go see. The dashing playboy meets the take-no-prisoners girl of his dreams, and she snags his heart forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have known then that it was too good to be true. The best things usually are: Santa Claus, the male G-spot, heaven—the list is endless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re walking down Fifth Avenue. Instead of wasting precious time driving across town to Kate’s apartment, we stopped at Saks on the way to work, where I bought Kate a new navy Chanel suit. Can’t have her doing the Walk of Shame into the office, now can I? When she was trying on clothes for me, I swear, I felt just like Richard f**king Gere in Pretty Woman. Kate even bought me a tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she insisted on stopping by the lingerie department to replace the panties I’d so erotically destroyed. I put up a good fight over that one, but I lost. You ladies ought to know—going commando? That’s sexier than leather and lace and whips and chains all put together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stop by Starbucks and grab some much-needed caffeine. As we walk back outside, I pull Kate close. I cup her cheek and kiss her. She tastes like coffee—light and sweet. She pushes my hair back out of my eyes and smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll never get tired of looking at her. Or kissing her. Pussy whipped, thy name is Drew. Yeah I know. It’s okay. I don’t mind. ’Cause if this is the Dark Side? Sign me up. Seriously. Don’t be surprised if I start skipping down the street singing, “Zip-a-Dee-f**king-Doo-Dah.” I’m that happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate and I turn the corner. Holding hands and smiling at each other like two idiots who popped one too many antidepressants. Nauseating, isn’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to stop here for just a minute. You should look at us. How we are right here, right now—hand in hand. You should remember this moment. I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were…perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we get to our building. I open the door for Kate and walk in behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the first thing I see are daisies. Large white daisies with cheerful yellow centers. Some in vases on the security desk, others in bunches tied with ribbon. Some are scattered singly all over the floor, random petals here and there. In the middle of the lobby is a circle of even more daisies. In the center of that circle, is Billy Warren. And he’s got his guitar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. Me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that doesn’t quite cover it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck me with a chainsaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah—that’s about right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou ever see a singing a**hole? Here’s your chance:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so blind I didn’t know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow much it would hurt to let you go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to heal us, want to mend\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome back, come back to me again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I didn’t hate him so much—and the jackal who spawned him—I’d have to admit he’s not half bad. I watch Kate closely. Every emotion that crosses her face, each feeling that dances in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know when you have a stomach virus? And you lay around all day with a bucket at your side because you feel like you’re going to puke at any second? But then there’s that moment—when you know it’s coming. You break out in that cold, full-body sweat. Your head pounds, and you feel your throat expand to make room for the bile that’s charging up from your stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s me. Right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually put my coffee down and look around for the nearest garbage can just to be sure I’ll make it there in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I need to say I’m sorry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all the pain I caused\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease give your heart back to me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll keep it safe for eternity\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe belong together\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve always known it’s true\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will never be another\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy soul cries out for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny other time, any other girl, I would bury Warren. Without even trying. He can’t hold a candle to me. I’m a goddamn Porsche; he’s a frigging pickup truck that can’t pass inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this is Kate. They have a history, a decade’s worth. And that, kiddies, makes him some major-league competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark of night, it’s your name I call\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t believe I almost lost it all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more chance, one breath, one try\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more reasons to say goodbye\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to pick Kate up, caveman style, and carry her out of here. I want to lock her in my apartment where he can’t see her. Can’t touch her. Can’t touch us. The whole time I stare at her, but she doesn’t turn to look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot one f**king time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I need to say I’m sorry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all the pain I caused\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease give your heart back to me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll keep it safe for eternity\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe belong together\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve always known it’s true\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will never be another\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy soul cries out for you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy didn’t I learn to play an instrument? When I was nine, my mother wanted me to play the trumpet. After two lessons, the tutor quit ’cause I let the dog piss on his mouthpiece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy the hell didn’t I listen to my mother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are my beginning, you’ll be my end\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than lovers, more than friends\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want you, I want you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe can’t have her. Go ahead and want all day long, douchebag. Sing from the motherf**king rooftops. Play until your fingers fall off. It’s too little, too late. She’s already mine. Kate isn’t the type to have sex with just anyone. And she f**ked me all weekend like the world was ending. That has to count for something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoesn’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I need to say I’m sorry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all the pain I caused\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease give your heart back to me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll keep it safe for eternity\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor eternity\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou and me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small crowd that’s gathered in the lobby applauds. Dickhead puts his guitar down and walks up to Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he touches her, I will break his f**king hand. I swear to God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t acknowledge me at all. He’s focused only on Kate. “I’ve been calling you since Friday night…and I stopped by the apartment a few times this weekend, but you were out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s right. She wasn’t home. She was busy. Now ask her what she was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho she was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know this is work…but do you think we could go somewhere? To talk? Maybe your office?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay no, say no, say no, say no, say no, say no, say no, say no…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she starts to walk away, I grab Kate’s arm. “I need to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes question me. “I’ll just be a—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s something I have to tell you. Now. It’s important.” I know I sound desperate, but I really don’t give a damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hand over mine, the one still clasping her arm. She’s calm—condescending, like she’s talking to a child. “All right, Drew. Let me talk to Billy first and I’ll meet you in your office, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to stomp my foot like a two-year-old. No. It’s so not f**king okay. She needs to know where I stand. I have to stake my claim. Throw my hat in the ring. Get my car in the goddamn race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I drop my hand anyway. “Fine. You two have a nice chat.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tangled-tangled-1/page-23.html","bookId":1849,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:17 PM"}
