Covering nearly twelve million square miles, Africa is almost as large as North America and Europe combined. It is nearly twice the size of South America. As we mistake its dimensions, we also mistake its essential nature: the Dark Continent is mostly hot desert and open grassy plains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Africa is called the Dark Continent for one reason only: the vast equatorial rain forests of its central region. This is the drainage basin of the Congo River, and one-tenth of the continent is given over to it - a million and a half square miles of silent, damp, dark forest, a single uniform geographical feature nearly half the size of the continental United States. This primeval forest has stood, unchanged and unchallenged, for more than sixty million years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven today, only half a million people inhabit the Congo Basin, and they are mostly clustered in villages along the banks of the slow muddy rivers that flow through the jungle. The great expanse of the forest remains inviolate, and to this day thousands of square miles are still unexplored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is true particularly of the northeastern corner of the Congo Basin, where the rain forest meets the Virunga volcanoes, at the edge of the Great Rift Valley. Lacking established trade routes or compelling features of interest, Virunga was never seen by Western eyes until less than a hundred years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe race to make \"the most important discovery of the 1980s\" in the Congo took place during six weeks of 1979. This book recounts the thirteen days of the last American expedition to the Congo, in June, 1979 - barely a hundred years after Henry Morton Stanley first explored the Congo in 1874 - 77. A comparison of the two expeditions reveals much about the changing - and unchanging - nature of African exploration in the intervening century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley is usually remembered as the newsman who found Livingstone in 1871, but his real importance lay in later exploits. Moorehead calls him \"a new kind of man in Africa. . . a businessman-explorer.. . . Stanley was not in Africa to reform the people nor to build an empire, and he was not impelled by any real interest in such matters as anthropology, botany or geology. To put it bluntly, he was out to make a name for himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Stanley set out again from Zanzibar in 1874, he was again handsomely financed by newspapers. And when he emerged from the jungle at the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtlantic Ocean 999 days later, having suffered incredible hardships and the loss of more than two-thirds of his original party, both he and his newspapers had one of the great stories of the century: Stanley had traveled the entire length of the Congo River.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut two years later, Stanley was back in Africa under very different circumstances. He traveled under an assumed name; he made diversionary excursions to throw spies off his trail; the few people who knew he was in Africa could only guess that he had in mind \"some grand commercial scheme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Stanley was financed by Leopold II of Belgium, who intended to acquire personally a large piece of Africa. \"It is not a question of Belgian colonies,\" Leopold wrote Stanley. \"It is a question of creating a new State, as big as possible. . . . The King, as a private person, wishes to possess properties in Africa. Belgium wants neither a colony nor territories. Mr. Stanley must therefore buy lands or get them conceded to him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis incredible plan was carried out. By 1885, one American said that Leopold \"possesses the Congo just as Rockefeller possesses Standard Oil.\" The comparison was apt in more ways than one, for African exploration had become dominated by business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has remained so to this day. Stanley would have approved the 1979 American expedition, which was conducted in secrecy, with an emphasis on speed. But the differences would have astonished him. When Stanley passed near Virunga in 1875, it had taken him almost a year to get there; the Americans got their expedition on-site in just over a week. And Stanley, who traveled with a small army of four hundred, would have been amazed at an expedition of only twelve - and one of them an ape. The territories through which the Americans moved a century later were autonomous political states; the Congo was now Zaire, and the Congo River the Zaire River. In fact, by 1979 the word \"Congo\" technically referred only to the drainage basin of the Zaire River, although Congo was still used in geological circles as a matter of familiarity, and for its romantic connotations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite these differences, the expeditions had remarkably similar outcomes. Like Stanley, the Americans lost two-thirds of their party, and emerged from the jungle as desperately as Stanley\u0027s men a century before. And like Stanley, they returned with incredible tales of cannibals and pygmies, ruined jungle civilizations, and fabulous lost treasures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would like to thank R. B.
