In the samsara 100,000 years ago, a True Divinity powerhouse chose an extremely weak period of the God Lamenting Wall and then temporarily ripped open a hole. The price of that was a massive amount of their blood essence as well as their life source. Moreover, for the next several tens of thousands of years, their cultivation would drop to that of an ordinary Empyrean.
