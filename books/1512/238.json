Going to burn them all?\" Xuan was looking at a document.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng said. \"Yes, all of them. F*cking, there\u0027s already sniper rifles. We would be facing a modernized army if we don\u0027t kill them. I am curious what Imhotep is up to though.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan replied without raising his head. \"70% chance he\u0027s already inside the pyramid. 20% chance he\u0027s watching us from nearby. 10% chance he went to Hamunaptra. Which one do you think is more beneficial for us?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng answered without thinking. \"Of course inside the pyramid. So we can take care of him on the way. Otherwise he might show up during the fight. What are you looking at?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan raised his head. \"Information about Egyptian mythologies I got from Evelyn. I am looking for ones that might be true. If this is an actual world, this shouldn\u0027t be the only treasure. Perhaps other treasures have similar quest items that can increase our strength.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng immediately said. \"And the result?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give up on all of them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He adjusted his glasses and took a drink from a glass. \"The cost to reward ratio is too low because we don\u0027t know if these mythologies are true. Second, there are expenses such as time, bullets, and expendable items. Third, they belong to plots that we are not familiar with. We don\u0027t know where the dangers will come from or how to use the quest items. Unless we have over 50% chance of success, I won\u0027t consider these mythologies.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng wanted to laugh but held it to himself. \"Then why are you so focused on the document? Aren\u0027t they useless to you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I had Evelyn wrote them in both hieroglyphs and English. I am getting the structure of hieroglyphs and how to go about translating them. We need to let ourselves accept new knowledge under any situation.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng nodded. \"Right, right. I understand. So how are we going to burn the forest? Aren\u0027t you worried about the wind?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan grabbed a map looking paper. It was hand drawn. \"I flew around while you were inside the forest and drew its terrain. It may not look like it but this forest is a triangle. We need to use incendiary bombs at these four places. Spread the bombs out the among 100 square feet in each place and detonate them with your grenades. It will be the most effective. We will be able to burn down the whole forest regardless of wind direction, unless God cause some accident.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It sounds easy but what kind of accident? I have a bad feeling about it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Uh, killing too many pygmies and God evolves them into something else, like King Kong.\" Xuan suddenly laughed lightly. \"So, this is a gamble. We are dead if we lose the bet. Because there might be other ways to enter the pyramid that don\u0027t require killing all the pygmies. There\u0027s a 30% chance we will die from God interfering.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng didn\u0027t thought much about King Kong but then he imagined a pygmy piloting a Gundam, especially his favorite Providence and shook his head. \"Anyway, just try our best. Uh, you know how to laugh?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan laughed and said. \"Yes. Pull muscles upward. However, crying is more difficult. Even though I can do the expression, its difficult to stimulate tears. If there\u0027s available device, crying is also possible.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng tapped his shoulder then walked out of the tent. \"Don\u0027t worry. You will reach the fourth stage. Comrade.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Comrade?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They finished setting up the incendiary bombs by evening with the help of the movie characters. Zheng used a simple detonation device Xuan created then detonated them. They looked down from the dirigible and saw the forest began burning at four locations. Black smoke rose up to the sky then the fire moved into the inner forest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is the basic situation. Judging by the size of this forest, it will take three to four days for the fire to reach the pyramid. Then three to four more days for the forest to cool down. Which means we need to wait eight days. How much time do you have left?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng said. \"Fifteen days. If we count eight days including today, we will have eight days left. It should be enough time to enter the pyramid and kill the Scorpion King.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then the probability of my plan should be a bit higher. The reason God gave you sixty days might be to give you time to burn the forest and wait for it to cool.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ardeth sighed beside them. \"It\u0027s unfortunate for this forest. If we could preserve it, then the whole Egyptâ€¦\" He shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng tapped his shoulder and said. \"Let it go. Even if we don\u0027t burn the forest, your tribe wouldn\u0027t be able to take care of the pygmies. Furthermore, the forest might disappear without the magic power from Anubis after we defeat the Scorpion King. It\u0027s not something that belong to us, so it\u0027s better to not think too much.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ardeth could only sigh as he shook his head. A man that grew up in the desert had a desire for the green desert that others couldn\u0027t imagine. If he didn\u0027t understand this forest could never belong to them, he would have stopped Zheng.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fire burned for several days, leaving black and white ashes behind. One might step into a fire when you step into the ashes. There were still bits of fire burning underneath. So they had to keep waiting. Zheng and Xuan never heard any notification from God, so they were not getting the points from killing the pygmies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They didn\u0027t rest during the days of waiting. Zheng kept training his Explosion technique and combat techniques non stop, while Xuan was reading mythology related documents in hieroglyphs. Evelyn complained that she were working on deadlines.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eight days passed. Zheng entered the forest alone. After advancing for a few kilometers without any danger, everyone decided to head to the inner forest. There were still some fires further in so the place had a layer of smoke. They couldn\u0027t find the pyramid in the mean time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Keep heading to the center of the forest. The pyramid should be there.\" Zheng made the decision and walked a few hundred meters in front of everyone else.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They found burned bodies of animals on the way. As they came nearer to the center of the forest, the number of animal bodies decreased as pygmy bodies took over. The pygmies died in clusters. Beside their bodies were deformed firearms ranging from pistols to sniper rifles to RPG. The crucial part was there were just too many pygmies. They saw tens of thousands on the way already. The pygmies would be no different from an army if they were all armed. Guerrilla forces fighting at their home terrain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They felt unease looking at the numbers, especially Zheng. If they tried to kill these pygmies off a little at a time like he thought, there was really a possibility of the pygmies piloting Gundams. Then burning the forest wouldn\u0027t be able to take care of them. Fortunately, that didn\u0027t happen and they came so far safely because of Xuan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A pyramid that looked like it was built of gold came into view. \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both;\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-11-chapter-9-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-11-chapter-10-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-11-chapter-9-02","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
