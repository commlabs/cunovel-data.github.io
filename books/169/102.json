{"id":4922,"no":102,"title":"PART III DORS VENABILI","content":"VENABILI, DORS- The life of Hari Seldon is well encrusted with legend and uncertainty, so that little hope remains of ever obtaining a biography that can be thoroughly factual. Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of his life deals with his consort, Dors Venabili. There is no information whatever concerning Dors Venabili, except for her birth on the world of Cinna, prior to her arrival at Streeling University to become a member of the history faculty. Shortly after that, she met Seldon and remained his consort for twenty-eight years. If anything, her life is more interlarded with legend than Seldon\u0027s is. There are quite unbelievable tales of her strength and speed and she was widely spoken of, or perhaps whispered of, as \"The Tiger Woman.\" Still more puzzling than her coming, however, is her going, for after a certain time, we hear of her no more and there is no indication as to what happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Her role as a historian is evidenced by her works on-\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46717.html","bookId":169,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:45:00 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:45:00 AM"}
