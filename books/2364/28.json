Philip stepped off the plane, and the image of Lochinvar instantly sprang to Lara\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God, but he\u0027s handsome! She ran into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve missed you,\" she said, hugging him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve missed you, too, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his thumb and forefinger half an inch apart. \"This much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You beast,\" she said. \"Where\u0027s your luggage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hour later they were back at the apartment. Marian Bell opened the door for them. \"Welcome back, Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Marian.\" He looked around. \"I feel as though I\u0027ve been away for a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two years,\" Lara said. She started to add, \"Don\u0027t ever leave me again,\" and bit her lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I do anything for you, Mrs. Adler?\" Marian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027re fine. You can run along now. I\u0027ll dictate some letters in the morning. I won\u0027t be going into the office today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well. Good-bye.\" Marian left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet girl,\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, isn\u0027t she?\" Lara moved into Philip\u0027s arms. \"Now show me how much you missed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara stayed away from the office for the next three days. She wanted to be with Philip, to talk to him, touch him, assure herself that he was real. They had breakfast in the morning, and while Lara dictated to Marian, Philip was at the piano practicing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt lunch on the third day Lara told Philip about the casino opening. \"I wish you could have been there, darling. It was fantastic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry I missed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s out playing the piano somewhere. \"Well, you\u0027ll have your chance next month. The mayor is giving me the keys to the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip said unhappily, \"Darling, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to have to miss that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara froze. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ellerbee\u0027s booked me for another tour. I leave for Germany in three weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t!\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The contracts have already been signed. There\u0027s nothing I can do about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just got back. How can you go away again so soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an important tour, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And our marriage isn\u0027t important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to go,\" Lara said angrily. \"I want a husband, not a part-time...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian Bell came into the room carrying some letters. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to interrupt. I have these letters ready for you to sign.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Lara said stiffly. \"I\u0027ll call you when I need you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched Marian retreat to her office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you have to give concerts,\" Lara said, \"but you don\u0027t have to give them this often. It\u0027s not as though you were some kind of traveling salesman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it isn\u0027t, is it?\" His tone was cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you stay here for the ceremony and then go on your tour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara, I know that it\u0027s important to you, but you must understand that my concert tours are important to me. I\u0027m very proud of you and what you\u0027re doing, but I want you to be proud of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" Lara said. \"Forgive me, Philip, I just...\" She was trying hard not to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, darling.\" He took her in his arms. \"We\u0027ll work it out. When I come back, we\u0027ll take a long vacation together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vacation\u0027s impossible, Lara thought. There are too many projects in the works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going this time, Philip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be going to Germany, Norway, Denmark, England, and then back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara took a deep breath. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you could come with me, Lara. It\u0027s very lonely out there without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of the laughing lady. \"Is it?\" She shook herself out of her mood and managed to smile. \"I\u0027ll tell you what. Why don\u0027t you take the jet? It will make it more comfortable for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you\u0027re...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely. I\u0027ll manage without it until you\u0027re back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no one in the world like you,\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara rubbed a finger slowly along his cheek. \"Remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip\u0027s tour was a huge success. In Berlin the audiences went wild and the reviews were ecstatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward the greenrooms were always crowded with eager fans, most of them female:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve traveled three hundred miles to hear you play...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a little castle not far from here, and I was wondering...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve prepared a midnight supper just for the two of us...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of them were rich and beautiful, and most of them were very willing. But Philip was in love. He called Lara after the concert in Denmark. \"I miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss you, too, Philip. How did the concert go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no one walked out while I was playing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara laughed. \"That\u0027s a good sign. I\u0027m right in the middle of a meeting now, darling. I\u0027ll call you at your hotel in an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip said, \"I won\u0027t be going right to the hotel, Lara. The manager of the concert hall is giving a dinner party for me and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Really? Does he have a beautiful daughter?\" She regretted it the moment the words were out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. I have to go now. I\u0027ll talk to you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up and turned to the men in the office. Keller was watching her. \"Is everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Lara said lightly. She found it difficult to concentrate on the meeting. She visualized Philip at the party, beautiful women handing him their hotel keys. She was consumed with jealousy, and she hated herself for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mayor\u0027s ceremony honoring Lara was a standing-room-only event. The press was out in force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could we get a shot of you and your husband together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lara was forced to say, \"He wanted so much to be here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Martin was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gone again, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He really wanted to be here, Paul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit! This is a big honor for you. He should be at your side. What the hell kind of husband is he? Someone should have a talk with him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night she lay in bed alone, unable to sleep. Philip was ten thousand miles away. The conversation with Paul Martin ran through Lara\u0027s mind. \"What the hell kind of husband is he? Someone should have a talk with him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Philip returned from Europe, he seemed happy to be home. He brought Lara an armload of gifts. There was an exquisite porcelain figurine from Denmark, lovely dolls from Germany, silk blouses, and a gold purse from England. In the purse was a diamond bracelet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s lovely,\" Lara said. \"Thank you, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning Lara said to Marian Bell, \"I\u0027m going to work at home all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara sat in her office dictating to Marian, and from the drawing room she could hear the sounds of Philip at the piano. Our life is so perfect like this, Lara thought. Why does Philip want to spoil it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam Ellerbee telephoned Philip. \"Congratulations,\" he said. \"I hear the tour went wonderfully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It did. The Europeans are great audiences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a call from the management at Carnegie Hall. They have an unexpected opening a week from Friday, on the seventeenth. They would like to book you for a recital. Are you interested?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ll work out the arrangements. By the way,\" Ellerbee said, \"are you thinking of cutting back on your concerts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip was taken aback. \"Cutting back? No. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a talk with Lara, and she indicated that you might want to just tour the United States. Perhaps it would be best if you talked to her and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip said, \"I will. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip replaced the receiver and walked into Lara\u0027s office. She was dictating to Marian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you excuse us?\" Philip asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarian smiled. \"Certainly.\" She left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip turned to Lara. \"I just had a call from William Ellerbee. Did you talk to him about my cutting down on foreign tours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might have mentioned something like that, Philip. I thought it might be better for both of us if...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, don\u0027t do that again,\" Philip said. \"You know how much I love you. But apart from our lives together, you have a career and I have a career. Let\u0027s make a rule. I won\u0027t interfere in yours, and you won\u0027t interfere in mine. Is that fair enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, it is,\" Lara said. \"I\u0027m sorry, Philip. It\u0027s just that I miss you so much when you\u0027re away.\" She went into his arms. \"Forgive me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s forgiven and forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller came to the penthouse to bring Lara contracts to sign. \"How\u0027s everything going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beautifully,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wandering minstrel is home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So music is your life now, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The musician is my life. You have no idea how wonderful he is, Howard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you coming into the office? We need you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come in a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller nodded. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey began to examine the papers he had brought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning Terry Hill telephoned. \"Lara, 1 just received a call from the Gaming Commission in Reno,\" the attorney said. \"There\u0027s going to be a hearing on your casino license.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Lara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There have been some allegations that the bidding was rigged. They want you to go there and testify on the seventeenth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How serious is this?\" Lara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawyer hesitated. \"Are you aware of any irregularities in the bidding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you have nothing to worry about. I\u0027ll fly to Reno with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens if I don\u0027t go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll subpoena you. It would look better if you went on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara telephoned Paul Martin\u0027s private number at the office. He picked up the phone immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Paul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t used this number in a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027m calling about Reno...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a real problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"No. The losers are upset that you beat them to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure it\u0027s all right, Paul?\" She hesitated. \"We did discuss the other bids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, it\u0027s done all the time. Anyway, they have no way of proving that. Don\u0027t worry about a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe replaced the receiver and sat there, worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt lunch Philip said, \"By the way, they offered me a concert at Carnegie Hall. I\u0027m going to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful.\" Lara smiled. \"I\u0027ll buy a new dress. When is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The seventeenth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara\u0027s smile faded. \"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I won\u0027t be able to be there, darling. I have to be in Reno. I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip put his hands over hers. \"Our timing seems to be off, doesn\u0027t it? Oh, well. Don\u0027t worry. There will be plenty more recitals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was in her office at Cameron Center. Howard Keller had called her at home that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027d better get down here,\" he had said. \"We have a few problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there in an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in the middle of a meeting. \"A couple of deals have gone sour,\" Keller told her. \"The insurance company that was moving into our building in Houston has gone bankrupt. They were our only tenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find someone else,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not going to be that simple. The Tax Reform Act is hurting us. Hell, it\u0027s hurting everybody. Congress has wiped out corporate tax shelters and eliminated most deductions. I think we\u0027re heading for a goddamned recession. The savings and loan companies we\u0027re dealing with are in trouble. Drexel Burnham Lambert may go out of business. Junk bonds are turning into land mines. We\u0027re having problems with half a dozen of our buildings. Two of them are only half finished. Without financing, those costs are going to be eating us up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara sat there, thinking. \"We can handle it. Sell whatever properties we have to to keep up our mortgage payments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bright side of it,\" Keller said, \"is that we have a cash flow from Reno that\u0027s bringing us in close to fifty million a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Friday the seventeenth Lara left for Reno. Philip rode with her to the airport. Terry Hill was waiting at the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will you be back?\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably tomorrow. This shouldn\u0027t take long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll miss you,\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll miss you, too, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there watching the plane taking off. I am going to miss her, Philip thought. She\u0027s the most fantastic woman in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the offices of the Nevada Gaming Commission, Lara was facing the same group of men she had met with during the application for a casino license. This time, however, they were not as friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was sworn in, and a court reporter took down her testimony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chairman said, \"Miss Cameron, some rather disturbing allegations have been made concerning the licensing of your casino.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of allegations?\" Terry Hill demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll come to those in due course.\" The chairman turned his attention back to Lara. \"We understood that this was your first experience in acquiring a gambling casino.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. I told you that at the first hearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you arrive at the bid you put in? I mean...how did you come to that precise figure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry Hill interrupted. \"I\u0027d like to know the reason for the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a moment, Mr. Hill. Will you permit your client to answer the question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry Hill looked at Lara and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara said, \"I had my comptroller and accountants give me an estimate on how much we could afford to bid, and we figured in a small profit we could add to that, and that became my bid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chairman scanned the paper in front of him. \"Your bid was five million dollars more than the next highest bid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t aware of that at the time you made your bid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Cameron, are you acquainted with Paul Martin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry Hill interrupted. \"I don\u0027t see the relevance of this line of questioning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll come to that in a moment. Meanwhile, I\u0027d like Miss Cameron to answer the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no objection,\" Lara said. \"Yes.

Miss Cameron, when was the last time you saw or talked to Paul Martin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara hesitated. \"I\u0027m not sure, exactly. To be perfectly candid, since I got married, I\u0027ve seen very little of Mr. Martin.
