He hadn’t said anything, but he’d become more focused on the road, his fingers tightening on the wheel, despite the fact there was no traffic. Though he still had his arm around her, it was like she was leaning against a board. If there was one thing she recognized, it was a male shifting into defensive mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know her better than I do,” she said lightly. “It’s just a thought. Would you like to listen to some music?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, sure.” His shoulders eased a fraction. Straightening, she moved back to her side of the truck to fiddle with dials, scrolling through his satellite radio options until she found a station that played a good mix of contemporary, alternative and oldies. Slipping her feet out of her canvas sneakers, she drew them up on the seat. She linked her fingers over them and glanced out the window at the passing scenery. The silence drew out, but she decided to let him be the one to break it, since the wheels of his mind were obviously creating a cacophony in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, let me have it,” he said at last. “I know you’re thinking something I’d rather not hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s really none of my business, is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re kidding, right?” At her blank look, he gave a half laugh. There was a trace of irritation in it, but something else as well. “Janet, I haven’t had a relationship since I left the SEALs. Hell, I’ve barely had sex with anything other than myself since then. I’m taking you camping. I’m introducing you to the wives of guys I’ve served with. I’m letting you into my life because I want you to be a part of it, and not just as a passing thing. Maybe I’m scaring the shit out of you, saying something like this when we’ve been together less than a couple weeks, but in my mind it’s been a lot longer. I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t scare me, Max Ackerman.” She was glad to see the rueful tug of his lips in response. Reaching across the seat, he closed his hand on hers, a firm grip. Then he released her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. If we’re going to have our first fight, let’s make it a memorable one. Spit it out, woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “I mentioned Amanda to Rachel. Not just her condition, which I don’t know a great deal about, but also about the role you play in her life. I didn’t do it to betray your trust. I spoke to her in confidence, as a medical professional, since she has access to a lot of doctors at the hospital where she does PT.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “I don’t worry about that with you, Janet. I know you’re discreet, and I also know Rachel. She’s top quality in that department.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, she is.” Janet paused. “She was told it’s very common for the primary caregiver to convince themselves that no one else can do what they’re doing, for fear that the person they love will not get every bit of the care they deserve. Yes, Amanda reacts badly if she doesn’t see you every few days, but then again, other than you, it sounds like she doesn’t see anyone else from the outside. Gayle mentioned the way the SEALs support one another. I noticed how you and Dale have a very similar demeanor, and I’ll bet other SEALs carry that same feel to them. You’re like an intense extended family. Wherever Amanda is in her head, I wonder if she would pick up on that intuitively.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her lips together, not seeing any change in his expression, but he was at least listening. “I don’t expect you’d ever want to stay away from her longer than a week or two, but having the flexibility to do so would let you have a vacation, give yourself a breather. And you’d be an even better caregiver for her as a result.” She reached out now, touched his arm, briefly drawing the gray eyes to hers. “You’re wonderful with her, but it tears your heart out, Max. I can see it. You’ve put yourself on a short tether, perhaps too short. It’s also kept your focus on her situation, and the cause of it, in a way that may not be healthy. You’ve put your life on hold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last two sentences snapped them back into sticky territory. His shoulders and mouth tightened. “No,” he said. “That focus is going to stay front and center until it’s settled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because it’s the one thing you can change about what happened? You can punish those who did it? Your mother won’t be less gone, your sister—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dead,” he ground out. “She’s not gone, Janet. Not like she fucking went to Atlantic City or on a trip to see relatives. She’s dead, beaten to death by three guys because she wouldn’t move out of the way and let them rape her daughter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And your single-minded determination to kill all of them may make you just as dead when all is said and done.” Janet refused to back down. “Where does that leave Amanda then? Where does it leave me? You’ve invited me into your life. ‘Hey, look at me, I’m this amazing guy who might be everything you’d ever want’. But because you have this fucking code of honor, I might get to identify your corpse before I ever pick out curtains with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d proceeded calmly, rationally, but his anger unleashed the same in her, a barb festering from the conversation with Gayle, Dale’s visit in Max’s kitchen, what she herself was feeling about the man himself. He’d been so straightforward. I’m letting you into my life because I want you to be a part of it. Most men shied away from that, or if they said it, they hadn’t really thought it through, a passion-of-the-moment kind of thing. She’d been unbalanced by it, the fact she knew he meant it, had likely considered it from every angle. But the real shock was knowing how much she wanted the same thing. He hadn’t been with a woman, more than a one-night stand, for several years. She hadn’t had a relationship since getting away from Jorge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the deal with me,” he responded, fire in his eyes, a hard set to his jaw. “I laid it out there for you. I can’t change it, and I didn’t take you for the kind of woman who would run from something like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop the truck.” The ice in her voice was pure Mistress, pure ball-busting admin of Matt Kensington. Max gave her a look. She knew he wasn’t any more afraid of her than she was of him, but he did respect her. Whatever he heard in her tone had him pulling off the highway, on to a side road that made a straight shot into the endless flatlands, going all the way to the horizon and disappearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing open her door, she slid to the ground. She collected her purse, her water bottle and an opened bag of crunchy Cheetos that she’d carefully rolled closed to keep them fresh. He’d bought it for her at a gas station on the way to Gayle’s. She started to walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could sense him watching her, probably trying to figure out what the hell she was doing. She had no idea herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeparated from the side road by a split rail fence, the land to her left looked like a field that might be tilled for some purpose at another time of year, or was being left fallow for this season. The early morning sun wasn’t hot, but it wouldn’t have mattered. She needed to walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d gone perhaps a half mile before she thought to stop, look back at the truck. She expected to see him leaning against it, or still behind the wheel, keeping tabs on her progress, prepared to come pick her up when she was ready. Instead, he was about twenty paces behind her. So caught in her whirl of thoughts, she hadn’t heard him. He wasn’t letting her get out of his immediate range in this unfamiliar area. He was watching after her, even as he gave her space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, she was so in love with the fucking idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt her look, he lifted a shoulder. “You like keeping men on a short tether. I was just obliging.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him. Something eased in her stomach, and she shook her head. “Ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bitch.” But the tone of his voice made it a warm caress. He tilted his head toward the split rail fence. “I think this is someone’s long-ass driveway. Which means we’re trespassing. Want to sit on the fence until they call the cops?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. But I don’t want to be on the fence with you. Metaphorically.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got that. I get a lot of things with you. It’s like being around Dale and the others. I almost knew the things you were going to say before you said them, but they weren’t things I wanted to hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got that,” she responded in kind, and now it was his turn to smile. When he held out his hand, she closed the gap between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her by the waist to sit on one of the rails, he leaned on the post next to it. “I’ll stay on the ground. I’m pretty sure my heavy ass would break it, and then they really would call the cops.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, you need to work on that one hundred percent muscle mass. It’s getting out of hand. I think it’s crept into your brain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched her face. “I have thought about it,” he said quietly. “My whole life revolves around what Amanda needs, Janet, and that’s the way it should be. But this was a man who raped a teenager and beat a woman to death, and he’s still out there. What kind of man am I, if I don’t do my damnedest to make sure he doesn’t do it to anyone else’s mother or sister?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dale said he and the others would help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe one of them didn’t have so much to lose—a sister relying on him, or a woman in love with him. She didn’t say it, knowing how unlikely and unfair that was, but the twitch in his jaw told her he probably understood where her mind was going on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I’m doing is against the law, Janet. I’m not pulling any of them into that beyond intel, no matter how much they say they don’t care about the risks. This blood debt is mine to pay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand on his, holding his gaze. “You invited me into your life, Max. Do you understand what that will do to me, if something happens to you? The only relationship I’ve had outside the club sessions is a drug dealer who kidnapped me when I was in my teens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time she’d told him so baldly. It wasn’t just during the time he’d known her that she hadn’t had a real date. His gray eyes digested it, showing the brief surprise, then a more emotional reaction. His jaw tightened, even as his hand closed over hers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/willing-sacrifice-knights-of-the-board-room-6/page-56.html","bookId":1905,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:28 PM"}
