I actually got hit on last night. Even in my orange sweats and tear-stained t-shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth drops one. \"Wait. Some horny frat boy smelled the desperation on you and went for it? I refuse to believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"So mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blows me an air kiss. \"It\u0027s why you love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I say, laughing. \"That\u0027s not why.\" I type in the confirmation code Rush emailed me yesterday. Since I\u0027m always going to him, he insists on paying for my flights. I feel weird about it, even tried arguing with him about it, but it\u0027s no use. When Rush Merrick wants something, he gets it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver moves through my body at the thought, and everything below my waist gets all tight and hot. Oh yeah, I miss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Lisa says, snapping her fingers near the touch screen. \"Confirm your flight so I can get out of here, girlie. I gots some serious plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe draws out that last word which is usually code for \u0027I\u0027m not thrilled about this, but I\u0027m doing it anyway,\u0027 and after OKing my flight and setting the thing to print my boarding pass, I turn to look at her. \"Guy from last night or somebody new?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorts. \"I wish it was the guy from last night.\" Her eyes lose a little of their mischievous blue glow. \"It\u0027s someone my family set me up with. Real Santa Barbara blue blood, buttoned up, junior partner in my dad\u0027s law firm kind of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Lis. I know how much you hate buttons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine.\" She shakes her head, trying to play off like it\u0027s no big deal when we both know the control her family has over her and her future makes her insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one date,\" I say, adding a casual shrug for good measure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" She takes a deep breath and gives me a forced smile. \"Okay. Go see your beautiful tattooed man, fuck his brains out, tell him you love him a hundred times then come back and finish your last week with a clear head, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensing my hesitation, her perfectly manicured brows draw together. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Graduation is next weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, I\u0027m just thinking, what then, you know? Where do we go? Do we stay in California? Do I stay in California? Do I find a job here? Or...do I go to Vegas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa blinks, slightly confused. \"Oh. Well, Vegas I guess. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chews her lip, maybe deciding what she should say. \"What\u0027s Rush say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush...he\u0027s said nothing. He hasn\u0027t even mentioned it. \"We haven\u0027t talked about it. I don\u0027t even know if he\u0027s coming to graduation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So ask him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI study the floor of the airport for a second. \"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Addy, the guy loves you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" I grab my boarding pass and try to kill the conversion by looking anywhere but at Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t go for it. \"Okay. What are you thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes can\u0027t help themselves. They connect with hers again. \"What if he\u0027s having second thoughts? What if he\u0027s not that into me anymore? What if what happened between us five weeks ago was just leftover sparks that needed to be released?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stares at me like I\u0027m nuts. \"Jeez, no wonder you failed your final.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right?\" I return with a pathetic laugh. \"I need to back off a little, don\u0027t I? Stop putting so much pressure on us? Play it cool before I lose him to my madness. I don\u0027t want that to happen again. Besides you, he\u0027s the only family I got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Lisa can answer, the customer service rep comes over to check my ticket. \"Any bags?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold up my carry-on. \"Just this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enjoy your flight,\" the woman says coolly before walking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First Class again,\" Lisa says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance over at her. She\u0027s stolen my boarding pass and is looking over it with her x-ray vision. \"Every time. The boy\u0027s got skills, that\u0027s for sure.\" She hands it back to me. \"Listen, girlie, I don\u0027t blame you for holding on tight and getting freaked out when you think he\u0027s not. After how you grew up, it\u0027s understandable. Probably to Rush, too. But may I suggest, instead of playing, maybe you should just be honest with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI release a heavy breath. \"So show him my crazy? You said it yourself, psycho bitch isn\u0027t sexy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here.\" Lisa gives me a hug. \"I love you, mama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod against her shoulder. \"You know, Lis, I can totally take a cab-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls back and gives me her fiercest mock glare. \"Don\u0027t make a beeyotch cut you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a beeyotch. You\u0027re a whore.\" I smile broadly. \"I better go. Text me about your date, \u0027k?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fierce expression fades a touch, but she rallies and tosses me a kiss and a quick wave before heading for the door. I guess we both have our issues to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and make a beeline for security. In a few hours, I\u0027m going to see Rush. And in turn, he\u0027s going to see me. But the calm-cool-collected-and-completely-unconcerned-about-the-future me. Not the crazy chick who feels like her world is falling apart when she\u0027s not around him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-2/page-3.html","bookId":1916,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:23 PM"}
