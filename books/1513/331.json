They formed a spell formation, and the blue light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Failure of simulating icy radiation. Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor’s life force is gradually weakening.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A.I. Chip intoned with no emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!* All of a sudden, the crystals emitting blue light exploded, and the rays from the spell formation dimmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it still a failure?” Leylin sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor that he had taken captive. Ever since he had brought it from the icy caves, it had been constantly weakening. This was even happening while it was in its frozen state, or else it would have long since died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin had no other ideas. After multiple failures while trying to simulate the special radiation from the icy world, he had already given up on this idea and was preparing to make use of this Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor as much as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s impossible to extract an ancient bloodline from it, and I’ve already recorded all the information I’ve obtained from its blood. So…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin shifted his gaze to the back of the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor. The rune of a distorted woman’s face seemed to be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the memories in its bloodline, Leylin knew that this type of Icy Jade Scorpion originated from the Scorpion Man that had the might of a Morning Star Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment Scorpion Man had been drawn into the spatial crack, a drop of the female giant’s blood landed on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom then on, the Scorpion Man’s bloodline was tainted by the blood of a higher ranking being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe descendants of the Scorpion Man all had this rune on their backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrictly speaking, the rune on the back of the Icy Jade Scorpion was just a projection of the power of the female giant’s bloodline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, just a projection and the wail it let out was enough to almost catch Leylin in an illusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the bloodlines of these higher ranked creatures all possessed incredible might even if there was just an aura of it left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A.I. Chip, how’s the analysis on this fear-inducing rune?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Analysis complete. Obtained freezing and healing runes that are incomplete at 45%. Able to make a cross reference with 31% of the information with the wailing banshee] The A.I. Chip intoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” Leylin was surprised. “Looks like the innate ability of the Icy Jade Scorpion to freeze and heal itself was affected by and formed from the blood of the female giant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly had a thought that would exploit the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor to the fullest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I combine that information about the technique to mend my sea of consciousness with the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor’s innate skill, burning through its bloodline and stimulating the abilities of the runes on its back to form a bloodline imprint that can be used once…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s eyes shone blue as he calculated, “In that case, I can also use this freezing ability once, and its effects will even be amplified. The power of the bloodline inside would be enough to mend the damage to my sea of consciousness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing solidified spiritual force could do this as well, but it took far too long. In addition to this, Leylin wanted to regain his strength as a rank 2 Warlock as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Freezing” was a unique innate talent of the Icy Jade Scorpions. While heavily injured, they could protect themselves in a thick layer of ice. Not only was it an ultimate defence, it could also help heal injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Leylin wanted to use this ability on himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A.I. Chip, what is the feasibility of this idea?” Leylin immediately asked in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge amounts of information and graphics flashed, and the A.I. Chip gave an answer. [Feasibility is at 87%. Host body first needs to undergo changes in order to be able to tolerate icy radiation.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As expected, it’s possible!” Leylin’s eyes exhibited his joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe innate freezing ability of the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor, as well as the slight projection of the power from an ancient bloodline, was definitely able to repair the sea of consciousness of a rank 2 Warlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the optimal method to make use of the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, Leylin already had a lot of materials from the Icy Jade Scorpions. Besides, how could materials from another world be more important than his own strength?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“En! In that case, I should start making some preparations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin glanced at the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor in the ice mountain. Covered in a block of ice, this Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor looked more fantastical, the green on its body looked almost alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the weakening of its life force and breath showed that it did not have long to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A.I. Chip, prepare the Bloodline Ignition Potion. It’s essential to make some preparations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s eyes glinted coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo completely make use of the freezing innate ability of the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor, it was necessary to burn up all its blood completely and stimulate the fear-inducing rune on its back. Then, one needed to model it into a freezing bloodline rune, which involved a very complicated process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, all these preparations needed to start from somewhere. This was to ensure that this Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor could live through this, and secondly that Leylin himself could adapt to the harsh cold while in the frozen state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days later, in the laboratory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin, may I enter?” Celine’s voice could be heard from outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve already undone the alarm spell formation. Come in.” She promptly heard Leylin’s answer and did not hesitate as she pushed the door to enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This…” The moment she entered, Celine instinctively wrapped her clothes tightly around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the laboratory, large amounts of mist was everywhere. There was even a thick layer of frost on the surrounding walls and some instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Leylin was naked in a giant glass tank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was soaking in a blue icy liquid that seemed to be seeping into his body bit by bit, turning him a little blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeline had long since gotten used to Leylin’s naked body, and she naturally approached him without flushing red. She judged the trough and was puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found this icy aura very familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t this the unique radiation of the icy caves?” All of a sudden, Celine thought of its origins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, this is just an imitation. It isn’t even 50% of the original, and can’t keep an Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin breathed in deeply, and the icy blue colour in the tank faded, turning from a dark blue to a lighter one, to the point that it was slightly translucent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver ten seconds passed, and the icy liquid in the trough had turned translucent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin stood up and walked out at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeline had prepared a towel and began to dry the droplets of water on his body like a caring wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you plan to do to the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor?” Celine enquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re both going to go to the joint conference of the guilds in the east capital. When that happens, only Grandpa Cedric will be here, and it can’t deal with an Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor with the strength of a peak rank 1 Magus!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it by then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin was overjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the tempering of his body with the icy radiation over these few days, he had gradually gotten used to such a chilly temperature. With a few more remodelling attempts, he would be able to make use of the freezing innate ability of the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor without any residual effects on himself to treat his injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he would not mention this to Celine. She was an intelligent woman who knew what could and couldn’t be asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you need clothes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dressing Leylin, Celine rested her head on Leylin’s shoulder, her nimble little tongue licking at Leylin’s earlobes and silently hinting at something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin laughed and pressed her down...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warm breeze blew, causing one to have the urge to take a nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the subterranean world, the humans of Twilight Zone could not divide the year into four seasons. They had only two ways of detecting the current season. One was based on the activity of the planet’s crust, and dividing the year into the cold and warm season. Another way was through specific crops, and dividing it into the planting and harvesting seasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a warm breeze was the most obvious indication that it was the warm season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin sat on the back of a horse carriage with Celine by his side. An aromatic, crisp smell travelled over from Celine’s hair, causing Leylin to feel slightly restless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people driving the carriage were the two level 3 acolytes, Obo and Ilya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin all of Nature’s Alliance, these two were the ones who were somewhat able to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe animals used to pull the carriage were obviously not horses, but an animal found underground—Wildebeests!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese animals were a lot larger than normal horses. They also had bony armour, and what was most obvious was the single horn on its head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese animals were more patient than horses, they could also withstand some amount of radiation, and were the first choice for light Magi of the Twilight Zone when they went out on expeditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, they was only useful for ordinary acolytes and Magi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for even more powerful Magi, they were naturally able to tame even more ferocious, mystical creatures, or even top-grade pets while they went on their journeys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a small guild like Nature’s Alliance, using a Wildebeests showed how hard pressed they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, they had no choice. After Celine took over, Nature’s Alliance had not been in a good state and had been pressured in many areas. Based on the intel she received, there was a large possibility that the Nature’s Alliance would be demoted from its rating in the joint conference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this situation, Celine had no choice but to look for external help. She could only turn to Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Leylin had been said to be a famed professor in name only, Celine had been tactful and given most of the authority in Nature’s Alliance to him. Leylin wouldn’t turn down such a large gift as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also needed help from the other organisations for his upcoming plans. He had wanted to help Nature’s Alliance expand and assist them based on the agreement they had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was also not a bad idea to take over this organisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin thought to himself as he eyed Celine, who looked calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-330\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-332\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-331","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
