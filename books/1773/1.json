Torture is roaring through my right arm and making it difficult for me to focus. I have to squeeze my eyes shut, grit my teeth, and force myself to pay attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chaos is unbearable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral people are shouting and too many of them are touching me, and I want their hands surgically removed. They keep shouting “Sir!” as if they’re still waiting for me to give them orders, as if they have no idea what to do without my instruction. The realization exhausts me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, can you hear me?” Another cry. But this time, a voice I don’t detest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, please, can you hear me—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been shot, Delalieu,” I manage to say. I open my eyes. Look into his watery ones. “I haven’t gone deaf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once the noise disappears. The soldiers shut up. Delalieu looks at me. Worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take me back,” I tell him, shifting, just a little. The world tilts and steadies all at once. “Alert the medics and have my bed prepared for our arrival. In the meantime, elevate my arm and continue applying direct pressure to the wound. The bullet has broken or fractured something, and this will require surgery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelalieu says nothing for just a moment too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to see you’re all right, sir.” His voice is a nervous, shaky thing. “Good to see you’re all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was an order, Lieutenant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” he says quickly, head bowed. “Certainly, sir. How should I direct the soldiers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Find her,” I tell him. It’s getting harder for me to speak. I take a small breath and run a shaky hand across my forehead. I’m sweating in an excessive way that isn’t lost on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.” He moves to help me up, but I grab his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One last thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kent,” I say, my voice uneven now. “Make sure they keep him alive for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelalieu looks up, his eyes wide. “Private Adam Kent, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” I hold his gaze. “I want to deal with him myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelalieu is standing at the foot of my bed, clipboard in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis is my second visit this morning. The first was from my medics, who confirmed that the surgery went well. They said that as long as I stay in bed this week, the new drugs they’ve given me should accelerate my healing process. They also said that I should be fit to resume daily activities fairly soon, but I’ll be required to wear a sling for at least a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told them it was an interesting theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My slacks, Delalieu.” I’m sitting up, trying to steady my head against the nausea of these new drugs. My right arm is essentially useless to me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up. Delalieu is staring at me, unblinking, Adam’s apple bobbing in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stifle a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” I use my left arm to steady myself against the mattress and force myself upright. It takes every ounce of energy I have left, and I’m clinging to the bed frame. I wave away Delalieu’s effort to help; I close my eyes against the pain and dizziness. “Tell me what’s happened,” I say to him. “There’s no point in prolonging bad news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice breaks twice when he says, “Private Adam Kent has escaped, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes flash a bright, dizzying white behind my eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and attempt to run my good hand through my hair. It’s thick and dry and caked with what must be dirt mixed with my own blood. I’m tempted to punch my remaining fist through the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I take a moment to collect myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m suddenly too aware of everything in the air around me, the scents and small noises and footsteps outside my door. I hate these rough cotton pants they’ve put me in. I hate that I’m not wearing socks. I want to shower. I want to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to put a bullet through Adam Kent’s spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leads,” I demand. I move toward my bathroom and wince against the cold air as it hits my skin; I’m still without a shirt. Trying to remain calm. “Tell me you have not brought me this information without leads.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind is a warehouse of carefully organized human emotions. I can almost see my brain as it functions, filing thoughts and images away. I lock away the things that do not serve me. I focus only on what needs to be done: the basic components of survival and the myriad things I must manage throughout the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” Delalieu says. The fear in his voice stings me a little; I dismiss it. “Yes, sir,” he says, “we do think we know where he might’ve gone—and we have reason to believe that Private Kent and the—and the girl—well, with Private Kishimoto having run off as well—we have reason to believe that they are all together, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drawers in my mind are rattling to break open. Memories. Theories. Whispers and sensations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shove them off a cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you do.” I shake my head. Regret it. Close my eyes against the sudden unsteadiness. “Do not give me information I’ve already deduced for myself,” I manage to say. “I want something concrete. Give me a solid lead, Lieutenant, or leave me until you have one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A car,” he says quickly. “A car was reported stolen, sir, and we were able to track it to an unidentified location, but then it disappeared off the map. It’s as if it ceased to exist, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up. Give him my full attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We followed the tracks it left in our radar,” he says, speaking more calmly now, “and they led us to a stretch of isolated, barren land. But we’ve scoured the area and found nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is something, at least.” I rub the back of my neck, fighting the weakness I feel deep in my bones. “I will meet you in the L Room in one hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But sir,” he says, eyes trained on my arm, “you’ll need assistance—there’s a process—you’ll require a convalescent aide—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are dismissed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, “Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI manage to bathe without losing consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more of a sponge bath, but I feel better nonetheless. I have an extremely low threshold for disorder; it offends my very being. I shower regularly. I eat six small meals a day. I dedicate two hours of each day to training and physical exercise. And I detest being barefoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I find myself standing naked, hungry, tired, and barefoot in my closet. This is not ideal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy closet is separated into various sections. Shirts, ties, slacks, blazers, and boots. Socks, gloves, scarves, and coats. Everything is arranged according to color, then shades within each color. Every article of clothing it contains is meticulously chosen and custom made to fit the exact measurements of my body. I don’t feel like myself until I’m fully dressed; it’s part of who I am and how I begin my day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I haven’t the faintest idea how I’m supposed to dress myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand shakes as I reach for the little blue bottle I was given this morning. I place two of the square-shaped pills on my tongue and allow them to dissolve. I’m not sure what they do; I only know they help replenish the blood I’ve lost. So I lean against the wall until my head clears and I feel stronger on my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, such an ordinary task. It wasn’t an obstacle I was anticipating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put socks on first; a simple pleasure that requires more effort than shooting a man. Briefly, I wonder what the medics must’ve done with my clothes. The clothes, I tell myself, only the clothes; I’m focusing only on the clothes from that day. Nothing else. No other details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoots. Socks. Slacks. Sweater. My military jacket with its many buttons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe many buttons she ripped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a small reminder, but it’s enough to spear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to fight it off but it lingers, and the more I try to ignore the memory, it multiplies into a monster that can no longer be contained. I don’t even realize I’ve fallen against the wall until I feel the cold climbing up my skin; I’m breathing too hard and squeezing my eyes shut against the sudden wash of mortification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew she was terrified, horrified, even, but I never thought those feelings were directed toward me. I’d seen her evolve as we spent time together; she seemed more comfortable as the weeks passed. Happier. At ease. I allowed myself to believe she’d seen a future for us; that she wanted to be with me and simply thought it impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d never suspected that her newfound happiness was a consequence of Kent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my good hand down the length of my face; cover my mouth. The things I said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tight breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way I touched her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw tenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it were nothing but sexual attraction I’m sure I would not suffer such unbearable humiliation. But I wanted so much more than her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once I implore my mind to imagine nothing but walls. Walls. White walls. Blocks of concrete. Empty rooms. Open space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI build walls until they begin to crumble, and then I force another set to take their place. I build and build and remain unmoving until my mind is clear, uncontaminated, containing nothing but a small white room. A single light hanging from the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClean. Pristine. Undisturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink back the flood of disaster pressing against the small world I’ve built; I swallow hard against the fear creeping up my throat. I push the walls back, making more space in the room until I can finally breathe. Until I’m able to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I wish I could step outside of myself for a while. I want to leave this worn body behind, but my chains are too many, my weights too heavy. This life is all that’s left of me. And I know I won’t be able to meet myself in the mirror for the rest of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m suddenly disgusted with myself. I have to get out of this room as soon as possible, or my own thoughts will wage war against me. I make a hasty decision and for the first time, pay little attention to what I’m wearing. I tug on a fresh pair of pants and go without a shirt. I slip my good arm into the sleeve of a blazer and allow the other shoulder to drape over the sling carrying my injured arm. I look ridiculous, exposed like this, but I’ll find a solution tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, I have to get out of this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelalieu is the only person here who does not hate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still spends the majority of his time in my presence cowering in fear, but somehow he has no interest in overthrowing my position. I can feel it, though I don’t understand it. He’s likely the only person in this building who’s pleased that I’m not dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold up a hand to keep away the soldiers who rush forward as I open my door. It takes an intense amount of concentration to keep my fingers from shaking as I wipe the slight sheen of perspiration off my forehead, but I will not allow myself a moment of weakness. These men do not fear for my safety; they only want a closer look at the spectacle I’ve become. They want a first look at the cracks in my sanity. But I have no wish to be wondered at. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/destroy-me-shatter-me-1-5/page-1.html","bookId":1773,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:18 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:18 AM"}
