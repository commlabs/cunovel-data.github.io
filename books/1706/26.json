The wind was blowing more snow now. It was becoming harder to see. The world was flatter and grayer, with almost no sense of depth. If this weather continued, they would soon not be able to see the ground well enough to avoid the crevasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they would have to stop where they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You\u0027re beautiful when you\u0027re angry, you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started walking, looking down at the ground, trying to see the tread marks. \"Come on, Peter.\" Perhaps the tracks would return soon to the road. If they did, the road would be easier to follow in a storm. And safer for walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m falling in love, Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to tell you.

The wind howled. Sarah\u0027s parka was pressed flat against her body. It became harder and harder to move forward. But she pressed on. She did not know how much longer she continued in that way before she raised a hand, and stopped. Evans must not have been able to see her, because he walked into her back, grunted, and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to put their heads together and shout to hear each other above the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to stop!\" she yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, because she didn\u0027t know what else to do, she sat down on the ground and pulled her legs up and lowered her head to her knees, and tried not to cry. The wind grew louder and louder. Now it was shrieking. The air was thick with flying snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans sat down beside her. \"We\u0027re going to fucking die,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 37\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHEAR ZONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:02 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started shivering, little tremulous bursts at first, and then almost continuously. She felt as if she were having a seizure. From skiing, she knew what that meant. Her core temperature had dropped dangerously, and the shivering was an automatic physiological attempt to warm her body up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer teeth chattered. It was hard to speak. But her mind was still working, still looking for a way out. \"Isn\u0027t there a way to build a snow house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans said something. The wind whipped his words away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know how?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late, anyway, she thought. She was losing control of her body. She could hardly even keep her arms wrapped around her knees, the shaking was so bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was starting to feel sleepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked over at Evans. He was lying on his side on the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nudged him to get up. She kicked him. He didn\u0027t move. She wanted to yell at him but she couldn\u0027t, because her teeth were chattering so badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah fought to retain consciousness, but the desire to sleep was becoming overpowering. She struggled to keep her eyes open and, to her astonishment, began to see swift scenes from her lifeher childhood, her mother, her kindergarten class, ballet lessons, the high school prom amp; Her whole life was passing before her. Just like the books said happened, right before you died. And when she looked up, she saw a light in the distance, just like they said happened. A light at the end of a long, dark tunnel amp; She couldn\u0027t fight it any longer. She lay down. She couldn\u0027t feel the ground anyway. She was lost in her own, private world of pain and exhaustion. And the light before her was growing brighter and brighter, and now there were two other lights, blinking yellow and green amp; Yellow and green?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought the sleepiness. She tried to push herself upright again, but she couldn\u0027t. Her muscles were too weak, her arms blocks of frozen ice. She couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYellow and green lights, growing larger. And a white light in the center. Very white, like halogen. She was starting to see details through the swirling snow. There was a silver dome, and wheels, and large glowing letters. The letters said NASA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe coughed. The thing emerged from the snow. It was some kind of small vehicleabout three feet high, no larger than those Sunday lawn-mowers that people drove around on. It had big wheels and a flattened dome, and it was beeping as it came directly toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it was going to drive right over her. She realized it without concern. She could do nothing to prevent it. She lay on the ground, dazed, indifferent. The wheels grew larger and larger. The last thing she remembered was a mechanical voice saying, \"Hello. Hello. Please move out of the way. Thank you very much for your cooperation. Hello. Hello. Please move out of the way amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 38\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWEDDELL STATION\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:22 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness.

It sounded like \"Coffee grounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rubbing continued, brisk and harsh and excruciating. And a sound like sandpaperscratching, rough, terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething struck her in the face, on the mouth. She licked her lips. It was snow. Freezing snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cousins set?\" a voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nod eely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a foreign language, Chinese or something. Sarah heard several voices now. She tried to open her eyes but could not. Her eyes were held shut by something heavy over her face, like a mask, or She tried to reach up, but couldn\u0027t. All her limbs were held down. And the rubbing continued, rubbing, rubbing amp; She groaned. She tried to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thin song now whore nod?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don thin song.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kee pub yar wok.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rubbed her, whoever they were, while she lay immobilized in darkness, and gradually more sensation returned to her limbs and to her face. She was not glad for it. The pain grew worse and worse. She felt as if she were burned everywhere on her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices seemed to float around her, disembodied. There were more of them now. Four, fiveshe was not sure anymore. All women, it sounded like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now they were doing something else, she realized. Violating her. Sticking something in her body. Dull and cold. Not painful. Cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices floated, slithered all around her. At her head, at her feet. Touching her roughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a dream. Or death. Maybe she was dead, she thought. She felt oddly detached about it. The pain made her detached. And then she heard a woman\u0027s voice in her ear, very close to her ear, and very distinct. The voice said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah, are you awake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am going to take the icepack off your face, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. The weight, the mask was lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open your eyes. Slowly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did. She was in a dimly lit room with white walls. A monitor to one side, a tangle of green lines. It was like a hospital room. A woman looked down at her with concern. The woman wore a white nurse\u0027s uniform and a down vest. The room was cold. Sarah could see her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Don\u0027t try to speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re dehydrated.

A sort of hissing sound came from her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t speak,\" the woman said. \"It\u0027s too soon. Is your pain bad? Yes? I\u0027ll give you something for it.\" She raised a syringe. \"Your friend saved your life, you know. He managed to get to his feet, and open the radio-phone on the NASA robot. That\u0027s how we knew where to find you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in the next room. We think he\u0027ll be all right, too.

He put on his clothes slowly, taking stock of himself. He was all right, he decided, though his ribs hurt when he breathed. He had a big bruise on the left side of his chest, another big bruise on his thigh, and an ugly purple welt on his shoulder. A line of stitches on his scalp. His whole body was stiff and aching. It was excruciating to put on his socks and shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was all right. In fact, better than thathe felt new somehow, almost reborn. Out there on the ice, he had been certain he was going to die. How he found the strength to get to his feet, he did not know. He had felt Sarah kicking him, but he did not respond to her. Then he\u0027d heard the beeping sound. And when he looked up, he saw the letters \"NASA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d realized vaguely that it was some kind of vehicle. So there must be a driver. The front tires had stopped just inches from his body. He managed to get to his knees, and haul himself up over the tires, grabbing onto the struts. He hadn\u0027t understood why the driver hadn\u0027t climbed out and helped him. Finally, he managed to get to his knees in the howling wind. He realized that the vehicle was low and bulbous, barely four feet off the ground. It was too small for any human operatorit was some kind of robot. He scraped snow away from the dome-like shell. The lettering read, \"NASA Remote Vehicle Meteorite Survey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vehicle was talking, repeating a taped voice over and over. Evans couldn\u0027t understand what it was saying because of the wind. He brushed away the snow, thinking there must be some method of communication, some antenna, some Then his fingers had touched a panel with a finger hole. He pulled it open. Inside he saw a telephonea regular telephone handset, bright red. He held it to his frozen mask. He could not hear anything from it, but he said, \"Hello? Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe collapsed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the nurses told him what he had done was enough to send a signal to the NASA station at Patriot Hills. NASA had notified Weddell, who sent out a search party, and found them in ten minutes. They were both still alive, barely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been more than twenty-four hours ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken the medical team twelve hours to bring their body temperatures back to normal, because, the nurse said, it had to be done slowly. They told Evans he was going to be fine, but he might lose a couple of his toes. They would have to wait and see. It would be a few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis feet were bandaged with some kind of protective splints around the toes. He couldn\u0027t fit into his regular shoes, but they had found him an oversized pair of sneakers. They looked like they belonged to a basketball player. On Evans, they made huge clown feet. But he could wear them, and there wasn\u0027t much pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTentatively, he stood. He was tremulous, but he was all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse came back. \"Hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Just, you know, everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll get worse,\" she said. She gave him a small bottle of pills. \"Take one of these every four hours if you need it. And you\u0027ll probably need it to sleep, for the next few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Sarah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah will be another half hour or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Kenner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s in the computer room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which way is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Maybe you better lean on my shoulder amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" he said. \"Just tell me the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed, and he started walking. But he was more unsteady than he realized. His muscles weren\u0027t working right; he felt shaky all over. He started to fall. The nurse quickly ducked, sliding her shoulder under his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell you what,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll just show you the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time he did not object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner sat in the computer room with the bearded station chief, MacGregor, and Sanjong Thapa.

He didn\u0027t come back to the Station today. Neither did Brewster. We think they may have gone to McMurdo and hopped the morning transport out.

You need an ID tag to open the exterior doors here, so we always know who\u0027s where. Neither Kane nor Brewster opened any doors in the last twelve hours.

You see, a lot of the research grants don\u0027t permit you to leave during the period of your research, but people have birthdays and family events back on the mainland.
