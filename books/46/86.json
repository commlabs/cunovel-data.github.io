A taxi pulls up in front of the Century Building at 25 Central Park West, and at the same moment a man in uniform emerges from the building holding an umbrella to escort the woman passenger to safety. Anyone watching the scene would hardly guess that the doorman is 75 years old. But his age is not the only remarkable thing about George Singer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During his 46 years at the Century — longer than any other employee or tenant — George has seen the entire history of the city reflected in the people who have come and gone through the entrance. He has gotten to know world-famous celebrities who have lived in the building, and has met countless others who came to visit — from prizefighters to presidents. He has watched the enormous changes of fashion, custom and law. And from the start of the Great Depression to the beginning of the Koch administration, George has remained the same calm, good-natured observer, seeing all but criticizing no one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve been here since this was a hole in the ground,\" he says matter-of factly, puffing on a cigar in the outer lobby of the building, keeping one eye on the door. \"It all started in 1930, when they tore down the old Century Theatre to put up a luxury apartment building. I got a job as a plumber\u0027s helper, lugging big pipes across the ground. After it was finished in 1931, I went to the superintendent and told him I helped build the Century and asked for a job. I simply had to get work, because it was during the Depression and I had my wife and two kids. … I started as an elevator man and I worked up to the front door within a year.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In 1929 George had been earning $125 a week in a hat factory; in 1931 his wages were $75 a month for a 72-hour work week. \"Our suits had to be pressed, our hair combed, shoes shined. We had to wear a white bow tie, white gloves. … If you looked cross-eyed at a tenant and he reported you to the office you were fired in those days.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During the 1930s, only about one-fourth of the apartments were rented. Among the residents was a Mrs. Gershwin; her sons George, Ira and Arthur made frequent visits. By the early 1940s the Century Building had become one of the most exclusive addresses in New York. Heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey, Ethel Merman, Nannette Fabray, Mike Todd and theatre magnate Lee Schubert moved in during those years, along with many celebrities whose names are less familiar today — singer Belle Baker, sports announcers Ted Husing and Graham McNamee, and world champion welterweight boxer Barney Ross.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e George recalls \"sparring around\" with Dempsey in the lobby at night. \"He had a great sense of humor. When he came in late and found the elevator boy asleep he\u0027d give him a hot foot.\" Ethel Merman, he remembers, \"had three or four husbands. In between her husbands she used to go out with different men. She used to smooch with them in the lobby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In those days we took in Louis Lepke, with his wife and family,\" says George with a smile. \"He always had three or four bodyguards with him. When he was here, he behaved himself.\" At other times, of course, Lepke was not so well behaved. He headed a group known as \"Murder Incorporated,\" popularized the term \"hit man,\" and was sent to the electric chair for his crimes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e More recent tenants include Robert Goulet, singer/Playboy playmate Joey\n\u003cbr\u003e Heatherton, and Ted Sorenson, a former presidential advisor who in the\n\u003cbr\u003e past year has been visited at the Century by both Jimmy Carter and Walter\n\u003cbr\u003e Mondale. Did George get a chance to shake the president\u0027s hand? \"Yes.\n\u003cbr\u003e What\u0027s the big deal?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e George Singer and Estelle, his wife of 53 years, live in Trump Village near Coney Island. They have seven grandchildren and one great grandchild. George could easily afford to retire — in fact, he is sometimes jokingly referred to as \"the richest man in the building\" — but he chooses to keep working. \"Why not work till 75 or 80 if you\u0027re able?\" he says. \"I think it\u0027s good for a person. Mr. Chanin, who owns this building: he\u0027s in his 80s and he goes to work most every day.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e George continues to do the night shift as he always has — \"I\u0027d rather work nights. There\u0027s more money at nights. And you don\u0027t have the bosses around. … At night people are more in a free spirit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How does George explain his continued success and good health? Does he have a secret he would like to pass on? \"I smoke two cigars a day,\" he answers immediately, with a gleam in his eye. \"That keeps the cold germs away. I never catch cold. It\u0027s the best medicine in the world.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Is George looking forward to Christmas?
