They’ve got some interesting mages, including an old style warlock from the Jakata people who were the first people on Malaz Island after the Stormriders retreated. He can see through the eyes of all sorts of creatures and that must have been helpful since the coast. There’s also a Dal Honese bush shamari and a Dal Honese Grass Dancer. And a Nathii swamp necromancer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Beak,’ said Keneb, ‘do these squads include Fiddler? Gesler and Stormy?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fiddler’s the one with the fiddle who played so sadly in Malaz City? The one with the Deck games in his head? Yes sir, he’s there. Gesler and Stormy, they’re the Falari ones, but with skins of gold and muscles and all that, the ones who were reforged in the fires of Tellann. Telas, Kurald Liosan, the fires, the ones dragons fly through to gain immunities and other proofs against magic and worse. Yes, they’re there, too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee how they stared at him in wonder! Oh, just like the dream!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he knew, all too well, how all this was going to turn out and even that couldn’t make him anything but proud. He squinted up at the darkness overhead. ‘It’ll be dawn in a bell or so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeneb turned to Faradan Sort. ‘Captain, take Beak with you and head into the village. I’d like to see these squads presented-barring whatever pickets they’ve set out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Fist. Plan on dressing ‘em down, sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeneb’s brows lifted. ‘Not at all, Faradan. No. I might end up kissing every damned one of them, though.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo once more Beak walked alongside Captain Faradan Sort, and that felt good and proper now, as if he’d always belonged with her, always being useful when that was what she needed. False dawn was just beginning and the air smelled wonderfully fresh-at least until they came to the pits where the Edur bodies had been dumped. That didn’t smell good at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gods below,’ the captain muttered as they skirted one of the shallow pits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeak nodded. ‘Moranth munitions do that. Just… parts of people, and everything chewed up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not in this pit,’ she said, pointing as they passed another mass grave. ‘These ones were cut down. Swords, quarrels…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, Captain, we’re good at that, too, aren’t we? But that’s not why the Edur left-there was almost a thousand of them gathered here, planning on one more push. But then orders came to withdraw and so they did. They’re now a league behind us, joining up with still more Edur.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The hammer,’ Faradan Sort said, ‘and somewhere ahead, the anvil’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused to search his face in the gloom. ‘And the Adjunct and the fleet? Beak?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t know, sir. If you’re wondering if they’ll get to us in time to relieve us, then no. Not a chance. We’re going to have to hold out, Captain, for so long it’s impossible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowled at that. ‘And if we just squat here? Right in this village?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They’ll start pushing. There’ll be four or five thousand Edur by then. That many can push us, sir, whether we want them to or not. Besides, didn’t the Fist say he wanted to engage and hold down as many of the enemy as possible? To keep them from going anywhere else, like back behind the city walls which would mean the Adjunct’s got to deal with another siege and nobody wants that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at him for a moment longer, then set out again. Beak fell in step behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom just behind a black heap of tailings at the edge of the village a voice called out, ‘Nice seeing you again, Captain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaradan Sort went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeak saw Corporal Tarr rise from behind the tailings, slinging his crossbow back over a shoulder then dusting himself off before approaching on an intercept course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fist wants to knock before coming in, does he?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain halted in front of the stolid corporal. ‘We’ve been fast-marching for a while now,’ she said. ‘We’re damned tired, but if we’re going to march into this village, we’re not going to drag our boots. So the Fist called a short halt. That’s all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarr scratched at his beard, making the various depending bones and such rustle and click. ‘Fair enough,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am so relieved that you approve, Corporal. Now, the Fist wants the squads here all out in the main street.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We can do that,’ Tarr replied, grinning. ‘Been fighting for a while now and we’re damned tired, Captain. So the sergeants got most of us resting up in the, uh, the tavern. But when the Fist sees us, well, we’ll be looking smart as can be, I’m sure.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-382.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
