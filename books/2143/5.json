{"id":96006,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, Dullsville High\u0027s hallways were decorated with posters for the upcoming prom. VIVA LAS VALENTINES signs with red, pink, and white hearts filled the walls and classroom doorways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved textbooks into my locker as Becky began to tack up passport-sized arcade booth pictures of her and Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We took these Saturday night at the movie theater. Aren\u0027t they cool?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the four poses--one with Matt\u0027s arm around Becky, one with them blinking, one where he was kissing her on the cheek, and the last with a Teen magazine smile--all of them reflecting a couple in love. I gazed at my locker--tacked with magazine clippings of Trent Reznor, Marilyn Manson, Ville Valo...and vacant of the one guy who meant the most to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured by now you\u0027d have a shrine to Alexander,\" Becky commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, too,\" I admitted. That was before I knew he was a vampire, I wanted to say. \"He\u0027s actually quite shy around the camera.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way. He\u0027s so handsome, he could be a model.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my best friend, whose normally cherubic fresh face glowed more than ever. Always quiet and mousy, she was gaining confidence now that she\u0027d been dating Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d always blabbed my secrets to Becky. I was bursting to tell her the truth about Alexander--why I didn\u0027t have a picture shrine, why Alexander didn\u0027t attend Dullsville High, and why he was seen only at night. Carrying this secret around was a heavier burden than a backpack full of textbooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky was so happy with her boyfriend--taking pictures together, renting movies, watching him play soccer. I\u0027d always craved more--to fly, to live in the darkness, to be eternally bonded to my soul mate. But at that moment, I realized I wanted to be like any girl who was lucky enough to be in love and hang her boyfriend\u0027s picture in her locker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have your prom dress?\" Becky asked, bringing me back to reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe it. We have dates to prom!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going?\" she asked, confused. \"It\u0027s just that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t asked Alexander yet?\" she guessed. \"It\u0027s next weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I asked him,\" I stumbled. \"He said he wouldn\u0027t miss it for the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled with relief. \"Yesterday, my mother and I picked out a dress and put it on hold. We\u0027re picking it up after school. Want to come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to, but I have to meet Alexander and my brother. It\u0027s a long story...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s okay,\" she said, trying to cover up her disappointment. \"Perhaps another time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can\u0027t wait to see your dress. I know you\u0027ll look fabulous in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe beamed like I\u0027d told her she won a beauty pageant. \"What does your dress look like,\" she asked, \"besides black?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dress? Oh, yeah. I guess I\u0027ll have to get one,\" I said, just as first bell rang. \"But where in Dullsville am I going to find a dress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander and I arrived at Henry\u0027s house to find his backyard vacant of any preteens, vampire or otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry, let\u0027s check the treehouse before my brother and Henry show up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked past the pool, lounge chairs, and gazebo, which were illuminated by the backyard house lights, and crept into the shadows where the treehouse was. I hung on to Alexander\u0027s silver bullet belt and followed him through the darkness. I remained at the foot of the tree as Alexander combed the grass and brush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait here,\" he said, reaching for the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my arms like a toddler. \"You mean you\u0027re going to leave me here alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander shook his head. \"Good point. Stay close and be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe extended his hand and guided me as I took my first step up the ladder in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander followed closely behind me. When we reached the deck, I headed for the treehouse door, only to find as many locks on it as a New York apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe there\u0027s a chimney I can climb down,\" I said, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander attempted to jimmy the door. I tried to peek inside the windows, but the curtains were drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll just take me a second,\" he said confidently. \"Then I\u0027ll open the door for you from inside,\" Alexander suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly we heard the sound of the nerd-mates coming from Henry\u0027s poolside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to wait now,\" Alexander instructed. He leaned on the treehouse railing, staring out into the backyard, while I mustered up enough courage to bring up the one thing I\u0027d repressed since he\u0027d picked me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have much time. The nerd-mates\u0027 voices were getting closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to ask you something...,\" I began. \"Yes?\" He gazed at me with his melting chocolate eyes, his silky black hair flopping in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. I had no problem searching for ghosts or picnicking in a graveyard, but when it came to laying out my heart, my bravado ceased. And even though Alexander and I\u0027d been dating for a few months, I felt I had more to lose than if I\u0027d just met him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s something I know you\u0027ll think is totally lame. Especially after we already went to the Snow Ball and that was a disaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say that. I got to dance with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only good memory of that night was Alexander and me clubbing it up in Dullsville\u0027s gymnasium--plastic icicles and snowflakes hanging from the ceiling, fake powdery snow covering the floor, while artificial snow softly sprinkled down from the rafters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you want to ask me?\" he continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027ll go with me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spit it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...to prom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander paused, his brow furrowed. Then he brushed his flopping hair away from his face. His silence was punctuated by chirping crickets. It seemed like they were waiting for his answer as much as I was. \"But you\u0027re only a sophomore,\" he stated, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d fantasized about him responding yes, I\u0027d imagined him saying no. I didn\u0027t envision this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone in high school can attend,\" I told him. \"Lucky me. Instead of not being asked for two years, I can not be asked for four.\" \"No one invited you?\" he asked, shocked, then clearly relieved. \"Good, because if some dude stole you away,\" he said with a grin, \"I\u0027d have way more bite than Jagger and Valentine combined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"You don\u0027t want to go, just say it!\" I turned away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander gently pulled me back toward him. \"I thought I\u0027d said yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t.\" I frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raven, I wouldn\u0027t miss it for the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart melted. \"That\u0027s what I told Becky you\u0027d say!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached my arms out and gave him a huge hug. He picked me up, swung me around, and gave me a long kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gross!\" Billy Boy exclaimed, appearing on the treehouse deck. \"What are you two doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander released me from our embrace. I straightened out my shirt, flipped my hair back off my shoulder, and wiped my black lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen Valentine?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he should be here by now,\" Billy Boy replied. \"I don\u0027t mean to be rude, but this is not a love fest. New rules...This treehouse is for guys only. No girls allowed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry, can you unlock the locks?\" I asked, ignoring my brother\u0027s remarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you can make out?\" my brother sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, creep. I want to show Alexander the stellar view.\" \"Man, everyone is interested in your treehouse,\" Billy said, crossing his arms. \"Maybe you should sell tickets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" Henry said. \"Of course I\u0027ll let you in, but it\u0027ll cost you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cost me?\" I scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get ten percent,\" Billy Boy chimed in. \"After all, it was my idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five bucks,\" Henry said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five dollars! You\u0027ll pay me five dollars for not kicking your-- ,\" I said, lunging toward the nerd-mates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" Alexander interrupted, grabbing my arm with one hand and reaching in his back pocket with the other. He pulled out his wallet and handed Henry a ten-dollar bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry inspected the money as if he were looking for drying ink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s real,\" I said. \"Give us the keys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry pulled out his cell phone and intensely pressed a seven- digit number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander and I glanced at each other curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe heard a ringing coming from the doorknob. The locks popped and the door creaked partially open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry stood proudly gazing at his handmade gadgetry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started for the door, but the nerd-mates followed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys wait here,\" I ordered. \"You didn\u0027t buy tickets, we did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Henry\u0027s treehouse.\" Alexander reached into his wallet and pulled out a five. \"This should cover a private tour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry quickly put the money into his chinos pocket. \"No kissing, disrobing, or touching anything besides the telescope,\" he ordered. \"I just assembled it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be standing outside the door,\" Billy Boy warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tiptoed inside, Alexander following closely behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe folding tables were still lined with beakers and petri dishes. Henry\u0027s telescope was standing next to the front window. The black curtain, separating the treehouse into two rooms, was closed. The first time I\u0027d pulled the curtain back, I\u0027d found Jagger\u0027s stickered coffin and Luna\u0027s pink one. Those had been removed when Alexander and I inspected it a few days after the Graveyard Gala. This time, I wasn\u0027t sure what I would find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and yanked back the curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found an empty room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was he searching for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must be something lurking inside the treehouse that we didn\u0027t discover when we\u0027d come to see that Jagger and Luna had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess Valentine\u0027s not staying here,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he plans to,\" Alexander suspected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the corner, a small closet door was slightly ajar. I reached inside and found a cardboard box hidden in the shadows. Perhaps it was the candelabra, pewter goblet, or Luna\u0027s gothic makeup. Or more likely jars of molds and spores to be examined under Henry\u0027s microscope. I peered inside and noticed rolled-up parchment paper. I unwound the rubber band and quickly unrolled them. It was a stack of graveyard etchings, like the ones Jagger collected from graveyards he\u0027d been to and used as grim artwork to decorate the treehouse, the abandoned mill, and his apartment at the Coffin Club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jagger must have left these behind,\" I concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time\u0027s up!\" I heard my brother call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t even have time to read the etchings. I rolled them back up, rewound the rubber band, and stuck the papers underneath my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled back the curtain and found Henry and Billy Boy glaring at us like Alexander and I were in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Henry asked in an accusatory tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s what?\" I asked, faking shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stuck under your shirt,\" Henry accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, I pulled the rolls out. \"You mean this? Just a scrap of paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are my maps of constellations!\" He extended his hand. I had no choice but to give him back his papers, even though they weren\u0027t maps. Henry pulled back the curtain and placed the rolled-up etchings in a small closet and locked the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, we all heard a group of dogs barking off in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly a chill was in the air. Alexander seemed distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped out onto the treehouse deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed the telescope toward the front window and peered through. The image of Henry\u0027s street was blurry, but I could just make out a white-haired boy staring straight at me. I gasped and quickly pulled the image into focus. The boy, a miniature version of Jagger in a white T-shirt and oversized black shorts, was speeding away down the street on a coffin-shaped skateboard. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4/page-5.html","bookId":2143,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM"}
