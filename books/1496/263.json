After blinking a few times, he couldn’t help but imagine what it would be like to shock the entire Blood Stream Sect with the wave of a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he imagined another scene in which, after raising his hand, the Blood Stream Sect went crazy trying to kill him....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, imposter Nightcrypt could see everything that Bai Xiaochun was seeing, and couldn’t help but tremble and let out an incredulous shriek. “Blood... Blood Devil!! Heavens! I can’t believe... that you’ve become the Blood Devil!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood Devil was a legend in the Blood Stream Sect. Supposedly, he would either lead the Blood Stream Sect to glory, or completely destroy it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as imposter Nightcrypt’s voice rang out in Bai Xiaochun’s mind, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and his expression turned very serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quiet down!” he said, patting his bag of holding and looking around, heart pulsing with both excitement and anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My original purpose was to become the grand elder.... Then I became a blood master, a development I could handle. Who could have imagined that I would become the Blood Devil...?” Although he couldn’t help but feel wonderful, he was also scowling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, some people in the sect would happily welcome the Blood Devil, whereas others... wouldn’t permit him to exist, and would do anything to kill him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I definitely can’t let anyone in the Blood Stream Sect know what’s happened.... Ai. Being too outstanding is really annoying sometimes.” Sighing, he stuck his chin up and waved his sleeve, looking very much like a lonely hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With the snap of a finger, I, Bai Xiaochun, reduced the Blood Stream Sect to ashes....” He sighed, thinking about how he had accomplished something in the Blood Stream Sect... that he would never have been able to accomplish in the Spirit Stream Sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he thought back to everything he had done here, he sighed even more. Then he remembered that beneath Xuemei’s mask was Du Lingfei’s face, and a profound gleam appeared in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xuemei... Du Lingfei!” Taking a deep breath, he took a step forward and drew upon the legacy within him. Instantly, a vortex appeared in front of him, which he stepped into and vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he rematerialized, he was outside of the Blood Ancestor’s body, hovering in midair above the Blood Stream Sect, within the convergence of the blood qi that resembled his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerous people were wrapped up in their speculations about what was happening, and as soon as they caught sight of him, cries of surprise rang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s come out!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He stayed inside the Blood Ancestor’s body for much longer than any of the other blood masters. Could it be that he found some other sort of good fortune?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm. Nightcrypt definitely seems a lot more powerful than he was before....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSong Que grumbled bitterly. Xu Xiaoshan sighed. Master God-Diviner stood there trembling. Numerous gazes were all focused on Bai Xiaochun. Everyone was wrapped up in their own thoughts. However, the cultivators from Middle Peak were shaking, and the pressure that radiated out from Bai Xiaochun caused them to involuntarily bow their heads and then drop down to kowtow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire Blood Stream Sect was shaken. Bai Xiaochun hovered in midair, looking down at all the disciples and their reactions. He enjoyed being the center of attention, and on any other occasion would have assumed the pose of a member of the Senior generation. But at the moment, he was somewhat distracted. In fact, his attention was soon drawn to Ancestor Peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, he could sense Xuemei’s aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether it was because of becoming a blood master, or the Blood Devil, Bai Xiaochun was pleased to some extent, but not as much as he might have been, and the reason for that was Du Lingfei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, Du Lingfei is Xuemei....” he murmured to himself. “And Xuemei is Patriarch Limitless’s only daughter, with a very high position in the Blood Stream Sect....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Bai Xiaochun could never have predicted that Xuemei would be Du Lingfei, now that he thought about it, it did make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another moment of thought, his eyes flashed, and he transformed into a beam of light that shot toward Ancestor Peak. As he neared, numerous streams of divine sense appeared to examine him, but none blocked his path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the slightest hesitation, he stepped onto the mountain and then began to follow Xuemei\u0027s aura to her immortal\u0027s cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was surrounded by a grove of plum trees, and was closed tight. Apparently, Xuemei didn’t want to see anyone at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun stood at the border of the plum tree grove, looking at the large door. He wanted to see Xuemei, and ask her a question!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the moment that Du Lingfei had disappeared, all the way until Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong had identified her as the spy in the sect, that question had been burning in Bai Xiaochun’s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to know whether the things that had occurred back in the Spirit Stream Sect, especially the connection that had appeared between them when they were being chased by the Luochen Clan... were real or not!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xuemei, come out and see me!!” he said loudly, his voice echoing among the plum trees. The people on Ancestor Peak who were watching him all heard what he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the immortal\u0027s cave, Xuemei also heard. However, even after waiting for some time, Bai Xiaochun got no response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Du Xuemei, come out and see me!!” he said again. This time, he spoke even more loudly. By this point, all of the patriarchs on Ancestor Peak were watching the scene, as were the prime elders, and the blood rippers in their secluded meditation facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren’t sure exactly what had occurred between Xuemei and Nightcrypt, but they could well imagine what sorts of things might have happened in the struggle between her and Song Junwan, a struggle that ended with Nightcrypt becoming the blood master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed. Several hours later, there was still no response from within Xuemei’s immortal\u0027s cave. Bai Xiaochun stood outside of the plum tree grove, surrounded by silence, his expression gradually turning grimmer and grimmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head bitterly, he gave one last look at the immortal\u0027s cave within the grove of plum trees, then slowly turned and left. If she didn\u0027t want to see him, then he didn’t want to stand around uselessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could leave Ancestor Peak, though, a beam of light flew down to meet him. A figure soon became visible, and it was none other than Song Junwan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun stopped in place and looked up at her. When their gazes met, he could see the mixed emotions in her eyes. Although she had thrown her command medallion to him, and had also said she would support him if he stopped Xuemei and became blood master himself, it was still impossible for her to cover up the complex emotions that she felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I....” he began nervously. However, before he could say anything else, Song Junwan clasped hands and bowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Song Junwan offers greetings, Blood Master. Please tarry a moment, the Song Clan patriarch wishes to see you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun stood there thoughtfully for a moment, then buried the matter of Du Lingfei deep in his heart; he didn\u0027t feel like thinking about it any longer. Instead, he considered the situation at hand. Even though he had technically become the blood master, if the sect itself didn’t approve of the situation, anything could happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My goal here is to get the relic of eternal indestructibility....” he thought. “I can’t stop Du Lingfei if she wishes to reveal my identity. If she doesn’t, though, then I have to pass the next test, which means seeing the Song Clan patriarch!” His thoughts were in chaos, but he managed to pull himself together and nod in response to Song Junwan. Then the two of them headed toward the Song Clan patriarch’s immortal\u0027s cave on Ancestor Peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSong Junwan maintained her silence along the way, and Bai Xiaochun wasn’t really sure what to say. When they reached the entrance to the immortal\u0027s cave, Song Junwan stopped and looked over at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t regret what I promised,” she said. “I\u0027ve already explained everything to the patriarch. In my heart, you are the blood master. As for how the patriarch views the matter, I’ve done everything I can to convince him to agree with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun nodded. Then, taking a deep breath, he gritted his teeth and walked into the immortal\u0027s cave. As he passed her, Song Junwan hesitated for a moment, and then added one more thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There have been times in the past when outsiders acquired the position of blood master. You... can take a hard stance with him.” With that, she turned and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun watched her leave, then continued on into the immortal\u0027s cave. Before long, he was in the cave’s main hall. The first thing he saw was the Song Clan Patriarch, sitting cross-legged on a stone dais!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patriarch seemed to emanate a feeling of profound age, and was surrounded by intangible fluctuations. As soon as Bai Xiaochun neared, he felt incredible pressure weighing down on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure from the patriarch’s cultivation base caused Bai Xiaochun to stop in his tracks, trembling. It felt as though countless mountains were crushing down onto him, and forced him to push back with all the might his cultivation base could muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, the pressure suddenly vanished, causing Bai Xiaochun’s cultivation base power to suddenly run wild inside of him. The heavenly demon appeared behind him, and his mid Foundation Establishment cultivation base erupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, the Song Clan patriarch opened his eyes, and his shining gaze came to settle on Bai Xiaochun, seemingly piercing into the deepest layers of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, Bai Xiaochun had his heaven-defying mask. Despite the fact that he had lost control of his cultivation base, the mask still concealed his true level. The Song Clan patriarch looked him up and down, and apparently didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire process only lasted for a few breaths’ worth of time, but to Bai Xiaochun, it seemed much longer than that. Sweat was rolling down his face by the time the Song Clan patriarch retracted his piercing gaze. At that point, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, clasped hands and bowed deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nightcrypt offers greetings, Patriarch.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-260\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-262\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-261","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
