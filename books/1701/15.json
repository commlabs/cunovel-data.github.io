Was there someone there, waiting, who would receive the tiny released twin? Would it grow up Elsewhere, not knowing, ever, that in this community lived a being who looked exactly the same?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment he felt a tiny, fluttering hope that he knew was quite foolish. He hoped that it would be Larissa, waiting. Larissa, the old woman he had bathed. He remembered her sparkling eyes, her soft voice, her low chuckle. Fiona had told him recently that Larissa had been released at a wonderful ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he knew that the Old were not given children to raise. Larissa\u0027s life Elsewhere would be quiet and serene as befit the Old; she would not welcome the responsibility of nurturing a newchild who needed feeding and care, and would likely cry at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother? Father?\" he said, the idea coming to him unexpectedly, \"why don\u0027t we put Gabriel\u0027s crib in my room tonight? I know how to feed and comfort him, and it would let you and Father get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather looked doubtful. \"You sleep so soundly, Jonas. What if his restlessness didn\u0027t wake you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lily who answered that. \"If no one goes to tend Gabriel,\" she pointed out, \"he gets very loud. He\u0027d wake all of us, if Jonas slept through it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather laughed. \"You\u0027re right, Lily-billy. All right, Jonas, let\u0027s try it, just for tonight. I\u0027ll take the night off and we\u0027ll let Mother get some sleep, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel slept soundly for the earliest part of the night. Jonas, in his bed, lay awake for a while; from time to time he raised himself on one elbow, looking over at the crib. The newchild was on his stomach, his arms relaxed beside his head, his eyes closed, and his breathing regular and undisturbed. Finally Jonas slept too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as the middle hours of the night approached, the noise of Gabe\u0027s restlessness woke Jonas. The newchild was turning under his cover, flailing his arms, and beginning to whimper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas rose and went to him. Gently he patted Gabriel\u0027s back. Sometimes that was all it took to lull him back to sleep. But the newchild still squirmed fretfully under his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill patting rhythmically, Jonas began to remember the wonderful sail that The Giver had given him not long before: a bright, breezy day on a clear turquoise lake, and above him the white sail of the boat billowing as he moved along in the brisk wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not aware of giving the memory; but suddenly he realized that it was becoming dimmer, that it was sliding through his hand into the being of the newchild. Gabriel became quiet. Startled, Jonas pulled back what was left of the memory with a burst of will. He removed his hand from the little back and stood quietly beside the crib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo himself, he called the memory of the sail forward again. It was still there, but the sky was less blue, the gentle motion of the boat slower, the water of the lake more murky and clouded. He kept it for a while, soothing his own nervousness at what had occurred, then let it go and returned to his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, toward dawn, the newchild woke and cried out. Again Jonas went to him. This time he quite deliberately placed his hand firmly on Gabriel\u0027s back, and released the rest of the calming day on the lake. Again Gabriel slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now Jonas lay awake, thinking. He no longer had any more than a wisp of the memory, and he felt a small lack where it had been. He could ask The Giver for another sail, he knew. A sail perhaps on ocean, next time, for Jonas had a memory of ocean, now, and knew what it was; he knew that there were sailboats there, too, in memories yet to be acquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered, though, if he should confess to The Giver that he had given a memory away. He was not yet qualified to be a Giver himself; nor had Gabriel been selected to be a Receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he had this power frightened him. He decided not to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas entered the Annex room and realized immediately that it was a day when he would be sent away. The Giver was rigid in his chair, his face in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come back tomorrow, sir,\" he said quickly. Then he hesitated. \"Unless maybe there\u0027s something I can do to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Giver looked up at him, his face contorted with suffering. \"Please,\" he gasped, \"take some of the pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas helped him to his chair at the side of the bed. Then he quickly removed his tunic and lay face down. \"Put your hands on me,\" he directed, aware that in such anguish The Giver might need reminding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hands came, and the pain came with them and through them. Jonas braced himself and entered the memory which was torturing The Giver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in a confused, noisy, foul-smelling place. It was daylight, early morning, and the air was thick with smoke that hung, yellow and brown, above the ground. Around him, everywhere, far across the expanse of what seemed to be a field, lay groaning men. A wild-eyed horse, its bridle torn and dangling, trotted frantically through the mounds of men, tossing its head, whinnying in panic. It stumbled, finally, then fell, and did not rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas heard a voice next to him. \"Water,\" the voice said in a parched, croaking whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his head toward the voice and looked into the half-closed eyes of a boy who seemed not much older than himself. Dirt streaked the boy\u0027s face and his matted blond hair. He lay sprawled, his gray uniform glistening with wet, fresh blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colors of the carnage were grotesquely bright: the crimson wetness on the rough and dusty fabric, the ripped shreds of grass, startlingly green, in the boy\u0027s yellow hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy stared at him. \"Water,\" he begged again. When he spoke, a new spurt of blood drenched the coarse cloth across his chest and sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Jonas\u0027s arms was immobilized with pain, and he could see through his own torn sleeve something that looked like ragged flesh and splintery bone. He tried his remaining arm and felt it move. Slowly he reached to his side, felt the metal container there, and removed its cap, stopping the small motion of his hand now and then to wait for the surging pain to ease. Finally, when the container was open, he extended his arm slowly across the blood-soaked earth, inch by inch, and held it to the lips of the boy. Water trickled into the imploring mouth and down the grimy chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy sighed. His head fell back, his lower jaw dropping as if he had been surprised by something. A dull blankness slid slowly across his eyes. He was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the noise continued all around: the cries of the wounded men, the cries begging for water and for Mother and for death. Horses lying on the ground shrieked, raised their heads, and stabbed randomly toward the sky with their hooves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the distance, Jonas could hear the thud of cannons. Overwhelmed by pain, he lay there in the fearsome stench for hours, listened to the men and animals die, and learned what warfare meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, when he knew that he could bear it no longer and would welcome death himself, he opened his eyes and was once again on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Giver looked away, as if he could not bear to see what he had done to Jonas. \"Forgive me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas did not want to go back. He didn\u0027t want the memories, didn\u0027t want the honor, didn\u0027t want the wisdom, didn\u0027t want the pain. He wanted his childhood again, his scraped knees and ball games. He sat in his dwelling alone, watching through the window, seeing children at play, citizens bicycling home from uneventful days at work, ordinary lives free of anguish because he had been selected, as others before him had, to bear their burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the choice was not his. He returned each day to the Annex room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Giver was gentle with him for many days following the terrible shared memory of war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are so many good memories,\" The Giver reminded Jonas. And it was true. By now Jonas had experienced countless bits of happiness, things he had never known of before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had seen a birthday party, with one child singled out and celebrated on his day, so that now he understood the joy of being an individual, special and unique and proud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had visited museums and seen paintings filled with all the colors he could now recognize and name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one ecstatic memory he had ridden a gleaming brown horse across a field that smelled of damp grass, and had dismounted beside a small stream from which both he and the horse drank cold, clear water. Now he understood about animals; and in the moment that the horse turned from the stream and nudged Jonas\u0027s shoulder affectionately with its head, he perceived the bonds between animal and human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had walked through woods, and sat at night beside a campfire. Although he had through the memories learned about the pain of loss and loneliness, now he gained, too, an understanding of solitude and its joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your favorite?\" Jonas asked The Giver. \"You don\u0027t have to give it away yet,\" he added quickly. \"Just tell me about it, so I can look forward to it, because I\u0027ll have to receive it when your job is done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Giver smiled. \"Lie down,\" he said. \"I\u0027m happy to give it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas felt the joy of it as soon as the memory began. Sometimes it took a while for him to get his bearings, to find his place. But this time he fit right in and felt the happiness that pervaded the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in a room filled with people, and it was warm, with firelight glowing on a hearth. He could see through a window that outside it was night, and snowing. There were colored lights: red and green and yellow, twinkling from a tree which was, oddly, inside the room. On a table, lighted candles stood in a polished golden holder and cast a soft, flickering glow. He could smell things cooking, and he heard soft laughter. A golden-haired dog lay sleeping on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the floor there were packages wrapped in brightly colored paper and tied with gleaming ribbons. As Jonas watched, a small child began to pick up the packages and pass them around the room: to other children, to adults who were obviously parents, and to an older, quiet couple, man and woman, who sat smiling together on a couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Jonas watched, the people began one by one to untie the ribbons on the packages, to unwrap the bright papers, open the boxes and reveal toys and clothing and books. There were cries of delight. They hugged one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small child went and sat on the lap of the old woman, and she rocked him and rubbed her cheek against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas opened his eyes and lay contentedly on the bed, still luxuriating in the warm and comforting memory. It had all been there, all the things he had learned to treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you perceive?\" The Giver asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Warmth,\" Jonas replied, \"and happiness. And—let me think. Family. That it was a celebration of some sort, a holiday. And something else—I can\u0027t quite get the word for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will come to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who were the old people? Why were they there?\" It had puzzled Jonas, seeing them in the room. The Old of the community did not ever leave their special place, the House of the Old, where they were so well cared for and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were called Grandparents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grand parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandparents. It meant parents-of-the-parents, long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back and back and back?\" Jonas began to laugh. \"So actually, there could be parents-of-the-parents-of-the-parents-of-the parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Giver laughed, too. \"That\u0027s right. It\u0027s a little like looking at yourself looking in a mirror looking at yourself looking in a mirror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas frowned. \"But my parents must have had parents! I never thought about it before. Who are my parents-of-the-parents? Where are they?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-15.html","bookId":1701,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM"}
