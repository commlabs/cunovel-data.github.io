By the dying light of the fire, she pulled on a freshly laundered skirt over her nightclothes, and a thick robe. She slipped out of her room, taking care to shut the door without making a noise. Her room was surrounded by her brothers’ quarters; if they knew she was up, they would fuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise wrapped the robe tighter and made her way to the kitchens. Even at this late—or early—hour, a cook or two was sure to be up marinating meat or punching dough for breakfast. If she couldn’t sleep, Elise would rather be in the cheerful, warm kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise was almost there when a familiar voice stopped her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elise?” Rune said. He was dusty; his hair was mussed, and he had a fresh cut on his cheek. He was carrying a crossbow and quiver, but at the moment he looked concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rune, welcome home. You’re back sooner than expected,” Elise said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I finished my dealings with the goblins during the morning and decided to push to come home rather than camp another night. What is wrong?” Rune asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing. I couldn’t sleep,” Elise said, smiling to cover her partial truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRune set the crossbow and quiver down so he could shed his traveling cloak. “That doesn’t seem like you,” he said, brushing off the black “hero” clothes he wore beneath the cape. Covered as they were, they were mostly spared from dust and debris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise shrugged. “I thought a snack might help,” Elise said, glancing in the direction of the kitchens, although the thought of food made her green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRune studied her in uncomfortable silence. “Elise,” he finally said. “You did the right thing. There was no other option; Clotilde had to be killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise winced, as though the words were a physical blow. “How did you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have had to kill before as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does the memory ever go away?” Elise asked, staring at the hemline of her robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not entirely, no. It fades, but you will always remember. It’s a good thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise looked up, confused. “What? How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It reminds you how precious life is, and it teaches you to be merciful,” Rune said, bridging the gap between them. “But Elise, while the memory will stay with you, you cannot let your guilt condemn you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I killed her,” Elise shivered. “Clotilde was a person, and I killed her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRune eased his arms around Elise and pulled her flush against his chest. She hid her face in his shoulder, letting hot tears spill down her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was. Clotilde was human like you and I, but she made bad choices. She embraced darkness, and looked to make others suffer for her ambitions. The only way to stop her rampage was to kill her; it was the consequence of her actions. I am sorry you were forced to pay the price for even a part of her sins. Your actions were just, and you must accept and realize that, or she will win even in her death,” Rune said, smoothing Elise’s hair away from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise said nothing, but took comfort in Rune’s strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come,” Rune said after several moments, stepping back from Elise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are we going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To Mother’s Salon,” Rune said, leading the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe royal quarters of Castle Brandis were not by any means opulent. Besides their bedrooms, the royal family had few private rooms. One of the rare exceptions was a sitting room that was once upon a time used almost exclusively by Queen Ingrid for entertaining guests. It was now used mostly for family meetings as it was one of the few places that was not on office that could seat the family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRune grabbed a torch from the wall and entered the salon, pausing to start a fire in the fireplace and to light several candles. When the room was adequately lit, Rune returned the torch to the hallway. “Sit,” he said, indicating to a plush settee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Elise sat, Rune eased in next to her, curling an arm around her shoulders. “So, you’re having nightmares?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not unusual. I’ve had the occasional nightmare since we returned,” Rune said, rubbing his eyes with his free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You, in the fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise shivered and rested her head on Rune’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My heart stopped when I turned human and realized you were among the flames,” Rune said, squeezing her shoulder. “I don’t think I’ve ever been so terrified.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, either,” Elise admitted, adjusting her head so it was pressed against Rune’s chest rather than his shoulder. “I didn’t know if the shirts worked and the curse was really broken, or if you all were still swans. Thank you for saving me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRune dropped a kiss on Elise’s head, making her blush to the roots of her hair. “As long as I live, I will do everything in my power to rescue you—whether it be from mad kings or the mundane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am wild for you, Elise.” Rune brushed Elise’s shoulder with his fingertips. “I love you. This may not be the right time to mention it, and Steffen would gut me if he knew, but I don’t know when I will get another chance to tell you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wild-swans-timeless-fairy-tales-2/page-88.html","bookId":1807,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM"}
