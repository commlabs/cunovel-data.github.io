He had been urging me to kill the thing only ten minutes ago—how was he able to manage a phone call when I could barely move? What was he hiding from me? Why was the actor back? Hadn’t we tearfully reconciled only hours ago?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was staring at Robby when suddenly Officer Boyle appeared in my line of vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was leaning into Robby and asking him something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby immediately looked over at me and then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby stood up and clicked off the cell as Officer Boyle kept talking to him, their conversation dotted occasionally by Robby’s nods and the glances he kept giving me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarta had arrived, and Sarah asked me to put her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was unaware I had been holding her all this time until I handed her to Marta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarta was arguing that there was no need to file a police report since it would ultimately end up in the press. But her attitude was the same as mine: if everyone was okay, let’s just get the kids to the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo of the officers walked out of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePredictably, they’d found nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, doors were scratched. Yes, force had been applied to each. Yes, two doors were unhinged. But no windows were broken or open and all the doors leading into the house were locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever I had seen must have gotten into the house earlier that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the consensus view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked Officer O’Nan, “Did you check under the bed in the master bedroom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO’Nan turned to an Officer Clarke and asked him if he had looked under the bed in the master bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Clarke walked up to us and said, “Yes, we did, sir. There was nothing there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So the thing’s still in the house? Is that what you’re telling me?” I was not supposed to say this—I just couldn’t help myself at that point. The question came out in a croak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir . . . I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wasn’t there a doll—a bird—under the bed in the master bedroom?” I had turned away from Marta and Sarah, and lowered my voice when I asked this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would this doll be under your bed, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So it’s still in the house?” I asked myself, murmuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, what is still in the house?” O’Nan asked me this with a clenched patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClarke stared at me as if I was wasting his time. But what is he going to do? I thought angrily. What were any of them going to do? I was married to Jayne Dennis. I was a famous writer. They had to put up with this. They had to do whatever I felt was required of them. Marta was identifying herself. They regarded her seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a scene began arranging itself on the front lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If there are no broken windows and all the doors are locked, then that thing is still inside.” I was answering my own questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Ellis, we found nothing in the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother officer appeared and asked, with barely disguised skepticism, “Mr. Ellis, could you give us a description of this intruder?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. Later, the writer reminded me of what I said. He had the transcripts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were sleeping and . . . a noise woke my son up . . . it was . . . I don’t know what it was . . . it was maybe a couple of feet tall and . . . it had a blond coat of hair and . . . it was growling at us—actually, no, it was making hissing noises . . . and it chased us . . . it chased us through the house . . . it broke the doors . . . it wanted something . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone commented on the fact that I was out of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that one of the officers walked out of the house with Victor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer was holding the dog by its collar as he led the animal to the group assembled on the lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor was panting and had a glassy expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knowing and conspiratorial silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognized it and something flared up within me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wheeled around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlashlights scanned the tired dog, who kept squinting up at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor sat down on the lawn. He noted our stares and was oblivious to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it seemed as if I was the only human he was directing his attention at. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-108.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
