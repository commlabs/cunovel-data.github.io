NYPD detectives Graves and Michna are here,\" the gal at the front desk said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Cary, wondering if the detectives had found out who\u0027d attacked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave the go-ahead for them to come up and hurried back to the dining table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary looked at me with raised brows, curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the detectives,\" I explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they have news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad\u0027s focus immediately

shoving his phone into his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered who\u0027d been calling him all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva Tramell,\" the female detective said, stepping deeper

and curly, her face clean of makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore slacks over dark flats, a poplin shirt, and a lightweight jacket that didn\u0027t hide the badge and gun clipped to her

into the living room, but only Ireland and I ended up taking a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else remained on their feet, with my dad pushing Cary\u0027s wheelchair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice place you\u0027ve got here,\" Michna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Cary, wondering what the

not understanding why we were making small talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just need to ask you a couple of questions,\" Michna said, pulling a notepad out of the interior pocket of his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t want to hold you up any longer than we have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves nodded, her eyes still on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you tell us if you\u0027re familiar with a man named Nathan Barker, Miss Tramell?\" The room spun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary cursed and pushed unsteadily to his feet, taking the few steps to reach the seat beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught up my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Tramell?\" Graves took a seat on the other end of the sectional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s her former stepbrother,\" Cary snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this about?\" \"When\u0027s the last time you saw Barker?\" Michna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a courtroom .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to swallow, but my mouth was dry as sawdust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight years ago,\" I said hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know he was here in New York?\" Oh God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s this going?\" my dad asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked helplessly at Cary, then at Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad didn\u0027t know about Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want

glanced my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t be asking that question,\" he answered, \"if you didn\u0027t already know the answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA violent shiver moved through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Gideon wouldn\u0027t look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain was trying to process

thought I might pass out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves was watching me like a hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you just tell us where you were yesterday, Miss Tramell?\" \"Where I was?\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yesterday?\" \"Don\u0027t answer that,\" my dad ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This interview isn\u0027t going any further until we know what this is about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichna nodded, as if he\u0027d expected the interruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan Barker was found dead this
