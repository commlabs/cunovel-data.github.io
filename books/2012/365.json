The Teblor commander speaks of the power of Akhrast Korvalain – this sorcery of the voice – and we are uncertain if we will face that power today. Nor do we know how to oppose it if it should come.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shit!’ bellowed Gillimada. ‘I have spoken!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrub shook his head. ‘At the battle of the Moons … that was Sinn. Most of it. She just used me. As if I was a knife in her left hand. I don’t know what I can do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We shall deal with that threat when it comes,’ announced Brys Beddict. ‘For now, I would welcome suggestions on the engagement. Queen Abrastal, what are your thoughts?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bolkando woman scowled. She unstrapped and drew off her helm, revealing a shaved head. ‘I think we should ignore the Perish – long may they sit in their holes, or’ – and she shot a glance at Krughava – ‘spin their standards round, should the Mortal Sword reassert her authority. Either way, we leave the centre alone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys was nodding. ‘I was thinking much the same. I have no taste for spilling Perish blood, and in truth the Assail commander has done us a favour by so isolating them. This said, we must weight our right flank – the moment we see the enemy splitting to form up and fast-march towards the Spire, we need to contest that move, with as much ferocity as we can manage. Accordingly, I would the Teblor form the centre of that intercept.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The rest will need only a handful to hold us off the trenches,’ Spax muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So we engage with but a handful,’ Brys retorted, ‘and peel off rank on rank as fast as we are able to.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That will have to do,’ said Abrastal. ‘No offence, Prince, but I will place the Evertine Legion on the right of centre.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘None taken, Highness. You are correct in assessing your legion as our elites. Once we start that wheeling of reserves, the enemy might well advance pressure on your side, to break through and cut off our motion eastward.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I would do the same,’ Abrastal replied. ‘We shall be ready for that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very well.’ Brys looked round. ‘That’s it, then? So be it. All of you, in the tasks awaiting you, fare well.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrughava said, ‘Prince, I will ride with you to the ridge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the group dispersed, Grub allowed his Ve’Gath to fall in behind Krughava’s. He looked up at the sky. The Jade Strangers blazed directly overhead, the point of each talon as bright as the sun itself. The sky was too crowded, and, in a flash, he suddenly knew that it would get much more crowded before this day was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What the fuck is this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Careful,’ muttered Stormy. ‘Your language is offending our Destriant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowling under his breath, Gesler pulled his feet from the scale stirrups and clambered to stand balanced on the Ve’Gath’s back. ‘A Hood-damned army all right, but I see no camp, and they’re looking … rough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gods below, Ges, sit back down before you fall and break your scrawny neck.’ Stormy turned to Kalyth. ‘Halt ’em all, lass, except for Sag’Churok – we’ll take the K’ell Hunter with us and check this out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the vast K’Chain Che’Malle army ceased its advance, Gesler gestured and led Stormy and Sag’Churok forward at what passed for a canter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mysterious army stood motionless on a treed hill at the edge of an abandoned village. Squinting, Gesler looked for the usual flash of armour and weapons, but there was none of that. ‘Maybe not an army at all,’ he muttered as Stormy rode up alongside him. ‘Maybe refugees.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your eyes are getting bad, Ges.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Old man, you’ve gone blind as Hood’s own arsehole. Those are T’lan Imass!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAw, shit . ‘Who invited those hoary bastards?’ He shot Stormy a glare. ‘Was it you, O Carrier of Flint Fucking Swords?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know nothing about ’em, Gesler, I swear it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Right. Playing friendly on ships and now look! You never could just stay out of other people’s business, Stormy. A soul stuck in the sky – oh! Let me fix that!’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-365.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
