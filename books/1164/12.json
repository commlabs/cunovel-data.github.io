A SUMMONS.","content":"\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; “One stern tyrannic thought that made \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;All other thoughts its slave.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All round the Mediterranean Sea there dwell people who understand the art of doing nothing. They do it unblushingly, peaceably, and of a set purpose. Moreover, their forefathers must have been addicted to a similar philosophy; for there is no Mediterranean town or village without its promenade or lounging-place, where the trees have grown quite large, and the shade is quite deep, and the wooden or stone seats are shiny with use. Here those whom the French call “worth-nothings” congregate peacefully and happily, to look at the sea and contemplate life from that reflective and calm standpoint which is only to be enjoyed by the man who has nothing to lose. To begin at Valentia, one will find these human weeds almost Oriental in their apathy. Farther north, at Barcelona, they are given to fitful lapses into activity before the heat of the day. At Marseilles they are almost energetic, and are even known to take the trouble of asking the passer for alms. But eastward, beyond Toulon, they understand their business better, and do not even trouble to talk among themselves. The French worth-nothing is, in a word, worth less than any of his brothers—much less than the Italian, who is quite easily roused to a display of temper and a rusty knife—and more nearly approaches the supreme calm of the Moor, who, across the Mediterranean, will sit all day and stare at nothing with any man in the world. And between these dreamy coasts there lie half a dozen islands which, strange to say, are islands of unrest. In Majorca every man works from morn till eve. In Minorca they do the same, and quarrel after nightfall. In Iviza they quarrel all day. In Corsica they do nothing, restlessly; while Sardinia, as all the world knows, is a hotbed of active discontent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At Ajaccio there are half a dozen idlers on the Place Bonaparte, who sit under the trees against the wall; but they never sit there long, and do not know their business. At St. Florent, in the north of the island, which has a western aspect—the best for idling—there are but two real, unadulterated knights of industry, who sit on the low wall of that which is called the New Quay, and conscientiously do nothing from morning till night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course I know him,” one was saying to the other. “Do I not remember his father, and are not all the de Vasselots cut with the same knife? I tell you there was a moon, and I saw him get off his horse, just here at the very door of Rutali\u0027s stable, and unstrap his sack, which he carried himself, and set off towards Olmeta.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The speaker lapsed into silence, and Colonel Gilbert, who had lunched, and was now sitting at the open window of the little inn, which has neither sign nor license, leant farther forward. For the word “Olmeta” never failed to bring a light of energy and enterprise into his quiet eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The inn has its entrance in the main street of St. Florent, and only the back windows look out upon the quay and across the bay. It was at one of these windows that Colonel Gilbert was enjoying a cigarette and a cup of coffee, and the loafers on the quay were unaware of his presence there. And for the sixth time at least, the story of Lory de Vasselot\u0027s arrival at St. Florent and departure for Olmeta was told and patiently heard. Has not one of the great students of human nature said that the canaille of all nations are much alike? And the dull or idle of intellect assuredly resemble each other in the patience with which they will listen to or tell the same story over and over again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The colonel heard the tale, listlessly gazing across the bay with dreamy eyes, and only gave the talker his full attention when more ancient history was touched upon.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” said the idler; “and I remember his father when he was just at that age—as like this one as one sheep is like another. Nor have I forgotten the story which few remember now.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He pressed down the tobacco into his wooden pipe—for they are pipe-smokers in a cigarette latitude—and waited cunningly for curiosity to grow. His companion showed no sign, though the colonel set his empty coffee-cup noiselessly aside and leant his elbow on the window-sill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The speaker jerked his thumb in the direction of Olmeta over his left shoulder far up on the mountainside.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That story was buried with Perucca,” he said, after a long pause. “Perhaps the Abbé Susini knows it. Who can tell what a priest knows? There were two Peruccas once—fine, big men—and neither married. The other—Andrei Perucca—who has been in hell these thirty years, made sheep\u0027s eyes, they told me, at de Vasselot\u0027s young wife. She was French, and willing enough, no doubt. She was dull, down there in that great chateau; and when a woman is dull she must either go to church or to the devil. She cannot content herself with tobacco or the drink, like a man. De Vasselot heard of it. He was a quiet man, and he waited. One day he began to carry a gun, like you and me—a bad example, eh? Then Andrei Perucca was seen to carry a gun also. And, of course, in time they met—up there on the road from Pruneta to Murato. The clouds were down, and the gregale was blowing cold and showery. It is when the gregale blows that the clouds seem to whisper as they crowd through the narrow places up among the peaks, and there was no other sound while these two men crept round each other among the rocks, like two cats upon a roof. De Vasselot was quicker and smaller, and as agile as a goat, and Andrei Perucca lost him altogether. He was a fool. He went to look for him. As if any one in his senses would go to look for a Corsican in the rocks! That is how the gendarmes get killed. At length Andrei Perucca raised his head over a big stone, and looked right into the muzzle of de Vasselot\u0027s gun. The next minute there was no head upon Perucca\u0027s shoulders.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The narrator paused, and relighted his pipe with a foul-smelling sulphur match.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” he said reflectively; “they are fine men, the de Vasselots.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He tapped himself on the chest with the stem of his pipe, and made a gesture towards the mountains and the sky, as if calling upon the gods to hear him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am all for the de Vasselots—I,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Colonel Gilbert leant out of the window, and quietly took stock of this valuable adherent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At that time,” continued the speaker, “we had at Bastia a young prefect who took himself seriously. He was going to reform the world. They decided to arrest the Count de Vasselot, though they had not a scrap of evidence, and the clan was strong in those days, stronger than the Peruccas are to-day. But they never caught him. They disappeared bag and baggage—went to Paris, I understand; and they say the count died there, or was perhaps killed by the Peruccas, who grew strong under Mattei, so that in a few years it would have been impossible for a de Vasselot to show his face in this country. Then Mattei Perucca died, and was hardly in his grave before this man came. I tell you, I saw him myself, a de Vasselot, with his father\u0027s quick way of turning his head, of sitting in the saddle lightly like a Spaniard or a Corsican. That was in the spring, and it is now July—three months ago. And he has never been seen or heard of since. But he is here, I tell you; he is here in the island. As likely as not he is in the old chateau down there in the valley. No honest man has set his foot across the threshold since the de Vasselots left it thirty years ago—only Jean is there, who has the evil eye. But there are plenty of Perucca\u0027s people up at Olmeta who would risk Jean\u0027s eye, and break down the doors of the chateau at a word from the Casa Perucca. But the girl there who is the head of the clan will not say the word. She does not understand that she is powerful if she would only go to work in the right way, and help her people. Instead of that, she quarrels with them over such small matters as the right of grazing or of cutting wood. She will make the place too hot for her—” He broke off suddenly. “What is that?” he said, turning on the wall, which was polished smooth by constant friction.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He turned to the north and listened, looking in the direction of Cap Corse, from whence the Bastia road comes winding down the mountain slopes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hear nothing,” said his companion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then you are deaf. It is the diligence half an hour before its time, and the driver of it is shouting as he comes—shouting to the people on the road. It seems that there is news—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Colonel Gilbert heard no more, for he had seized his sword, and was already halfway down the stone stairs. It appeared that he expected news, and when the diligence drew up in the narrow street, he was there awaiting it, amid a buzzing crowd, which had inexplicably assembled in the twinkling of an eye. Yes; there was assuredly news, for the diligence came in at a gallop though there was no one on it but the driver. He shouted incoherently, and waved his whip above his head. Then, quite suddenly, perceiving Colonel Gilbert, he snapped his lips together, threw aside the reins, and leapt to the ground.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mon colonel,” he said, “a word with you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they went apart into a doorway. Three words sufficed to tell all that the diligence driver knew, and a minute later the colonel hurried towards the stable of the inn, where his horse stood ready. He rode away at a sharp trot, not towards Bastia, but down the valley of Vasselot. Although it was evident that he was pressed for time, the colonel did not hurry his horse, but rather relieved it when he could by dismounting, at every sharp ascent, and riding where possible in the deep shade of the chestnut trees. He turned aside from the main road that climbs laboriously to Oletta and Olmeta, and followed the river-path. In order to gain time he presently left the path, and made a short cut across the open land, glancing up at the Casa Perucca as he did so. For he was trespassing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was riding leisurely enough when his horse stumbled, and, in recovering itself, clumsily kicked a great stone with such force that he shattered it to a hundred pieces, and then stood on three legs, awkwardly swinging his hoof in a way that horses have when the bone has been jarred. In a moment the colonel dismounted, and felt the injured leg carefully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My friend,” he said kindly, “you are a fool. What are you doing? Name of a dog”—he paused, and collecting the pieces of broken quartz, threw them away into the brush—“name of a dog, what are you doing?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With an odd laugh Colonel Gilbert climbed into the saddle again, and although he looked carefully up at the Casa Perucca, he failed to see Mademoiselle Brun\u0027s grey face amid the grey shadows of an olive tree. The horse limped at first, but presently forgot his grievance against the big stone that had lain in his path. The colonel laughed to himself in a singular way more than once at the seemingly trivial accident, and on regaining the path, turned in his saddle to look again at the spot where it had occurred.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On nearing the chateau he urged his horse to a better pace, and reached the great door at a sharp trot. He rang the bell without dismounting, and leisurely quitted the saddle. But the summons was not immediately answered. He jerked at the chain again, and rattled on the door with the handle of his riding whip. At length the bolts were withdrawn, and the heavy door opened sufficiently to admit a glance of that evil eye which the peasants did not care to face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before speaking the colonel made a step forward, so that his foot must necessarily prevent the closing of the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The Count de Vasselot,” said he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Take away your foot,” replied Jean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The colonel noted with a good-natured surprise the position of his stout riding-boot, and withdrew it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The Count de Vasselot,” he repeated. “You need not trouble, my friend, to tell any lies or to look at me with your evil eye. I know the count is here, for I saw him in Paris just before he came, and I spoke to him at this very door a few weeks ago. He knows me, and I think you know me too, my friend. Tell your master I have news from France. He will see me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jean unceremoniously closed the door, and the colonel, who was moving away towards his horse, turned sharply on his heel when he heard the bolts being surreptitiously pushed back again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah!” he said, and he stood outside the door with his hand at his moustache, reflectively following Jean\u0027s movements, “they are singularly careful to keep me out, these people.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had not long to wait, however, for presently Lory came, stepping quickly over the high threshold and closing the door behind him. But Gilbert was taller than de Vasselot, and could see over his head. He looked right through the house into the little garden on the terrace, and saw someone there who was not Jean. And the light of surprise was still in his eyes as he shook hands with Lory de Vasselot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You have news for me?” inquired de Vasselot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “News for every Frenchman.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes. The emperor has declared war against Germany.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “War!” echoed Lory, with a sudden laugh.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; and your regiment is the first on the list.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know, I know!” cried de Vasselot, his eyes alight with excitement. “But this is good news that you tell me. How can I thank you for coming? I must get home—I mean to France—at once. But this is great news!” He seized the colonel\u0027s hand and shook it. “Great news, mon colonel—great news!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good news for you, for you are going. But I shall be left behind as usual. Yes; it is good news for you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And for France,” cried Lory, with both hands outspread, as if to indicate the glory that was awaiting them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For France,” said the colonel, gravely, “it cannot fail to be bad. But we must not think of that now.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We shall never think of it,” answered Lory. “This is Monday; there is a boat for Marseilles to-night. I leave Bastia to-night, colonel.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And I must get back there,” said the colonel, holding out his hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He rode thoughtfully back by the shortest route through the Lancone Defile, and, as he approached Bastia, from the heights behind the town he saw the steamer that would convey Lory to France coming northward from Bonifacio.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” he said; “he will leave Bastia to-night; and assuredly the good God, or the devil, helps me at every turn of this affair.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2874/79522.html","bookId":1164,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:36:58 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:36:58 AM"}
