Some of them would, he thought, make a bright addition to the fun columns of The Rooke\u0027s House Rag, but it was necessary first to get the author\u0027s permission to print them. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While crossing the yard with Roger he caught sight of Robin Arkness, and gripped that mercurial youngster by the arm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Say, kid, you\u0027re a dandy riddle-maker.

The riddles had been so much talked about, and he had been so closely questioned concerning them, that the sudden fame thrust upon him had become embarrassing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Still, he had enjoyed the sensation for a time, and an idea struck him now which thrilled him suddenly with excitement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why,\" said Robin to himself, \"shouldn\u0027t the Merry Men have a jolly old magazine all to themselves?

I\u0027ll then fasten the sheets together and pass the \u0027Mag\u0027 from boy to boy in the Form. No reader will be allowed to keep it longer than a day.

It was called \"King of the Road\", and concerned a highwayman whose adventures had those of Dick Turpin beaten to a frazzle. This gentleman, proudly calling himself \"Helter-skelter Hal\", chivied a coachful of fat politicians over a cliff, made a king stand on his head in a snowdrift, held up three stage-coaches simultaneously with two pistols, rescued a maiden in distress by hauling her through a carriage-window and riding with her across a tree that bridged a raging torrent, and then attacked single-handed, and put to flight, a score or more armed footpads who were robbing the Governor of the Bank of England.

The first jar came when Little John, trustiest of Robin\u0027s comrades, brought in his contribution. This was a full-page drawing of a football match, supposed to be the final tie for the County Schools\u0027 Cup. Little John had written this title beneath it, and he had put goal-posts at each end of the field. But for these descriptive touches it might just as well have pictured a bull-fight, or a cannibal dance round a missionary in a stew-pot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I say, old chap, this is a bit fierce,\" Robin commented, rather blankly. \"A wee bit out of perspective, isn\u0027t it?

They were having a glorious feed in a wonderful garden, the only flaw wherein was that daffodils, roses, hollyhocks and chrysanthemums were all blooming simultaneously. Another minor detail was that some of the butterflies seemed as big as crows, altogether dwarfing the flowers. It was, indeed, a scene of tropical splendour!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Bravo!\" cried Robin, heaving a sigh of relief. \"This\u0027ll do O.K.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The earlier contributors, with the exception of Allan a Dale, shot a jealous glance at the Miller, grudging him Robin\u0027s praise.

Charles the First, Anne Boleyn, Sir Walter Raleigh, Lady Jane Greyâ€”heads flying about like tennis balls. As for the hangings, they\u0027re positively gruesome.

It was a far finer spread than ever he had given them before, and he was the soul of good temper throughout.
