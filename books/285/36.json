No one in the village, outside of Luke\u0027s family, missed him more than Linton. Though Luke was two years and a half older, they had always been intimate friends. Linton\u0027s family occupied a higher social position, but there was nothing snobbish about Linton, as there was about Randolph, and it made no difference to him that Luke lived in a small and humble cottage, and, till recently, had been obliged to wear old and shabby clothes. In this democratic spirit, Linton was encouraged by his parents, who, while appreciating the refinement which is apt to be connected with liberal means, were too sensible to undervalue sterling merit and good character.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Linton was right.

I am a long way from home; I can tell you that much. When I get home, I shall be able to tell you all.
