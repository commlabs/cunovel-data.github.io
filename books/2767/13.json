I don\u0027t want to cause more. \"Colin . . . ,\" I say, squeezing his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his arm around me in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the top of the ninth inning, when it\u0027s past ten, I say, \"I\u0027m sorry, but Colin has to drive me home now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Wallace and Mr. Lundstrom shake Colin\u0027s hand, then I pull him out of the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brit, do you know how hard it is to get an internship at HL\u0026amp;W?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At this point, I don\u0027t care. Colin, I needed to be home by ten thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll be home at eleven. Tell your mom we got stuck in traffic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin doesn\u0027t know what my mom is like when she\u0027s in one of her moods. Thankfully I\u0027ve been able to avoid bringing him around the house often and if he comes over, it\u0027s just for a few minutes or less. He has no clue what it\u0027s like when my mom goes off on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pull into my driveway not at eleven, but closer to eleven thirty. Colin is still pumped about the possible internship at HL\u0026amp;W while listening to the after-game recap on WGN radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gotta go,\" I tell him, leaning over for a quick kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here a few minutes,\" he says against my lips. \"We haven\u0027t fooled around in, like, forever. I miss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. But it\u0027s late.\" I give him a look of apology. \"We\u0027ll have more nights together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hopefully sooner rather than later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk into my house, prepared to be yelled at. Sure enough, my mom is standing in the foyer with her arms crossed. \"You\u0027re late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think, that I make up arbitrary rules?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, I really am sorry. We went to a Cubs game instead of a movie, and the traffic was terrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cubs game? All the way in the city? You could have been mugged!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were fine, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you know it all, Brit, but you don\u0027t. For all I know you could\u0027ve been lying dead in a city alley and all along I thought you were at a movie. Check your purse to see if any money or your ID is missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my purse and check the contents of my wallet, only to appease her. I hold up my ID and cash. \"It\u0027s all here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Consider yourself lucky. This time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m always careful when I go to the city, Mom. Besides, Colin was with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need excuses, Brit. Did you not think it would be nice to call and tell me about the change in plans and that you were going to be late?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo have her yell at me over the phone, and then again when I got home? No way. But I can\u0027t tell her that. \"I didn\u0027t think about it,\" is all I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you ever think about this family? It\u0027s not all about you, Brittany.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that, Mom. I promise next time I\u0027ll call. I\u0027m tired. Can I just go to bed now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dismisses me with a wave of her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday morning I wake up to my mom\u0027s screaming. Throwing the covers back, I rush out of bed and run down the stairs to see what the commotion is all about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelley is in her wheelchair, which is pushed up to the kitchen table. Food is all over her mouth and splattered on her shirt and pants. She looks like a little kid instead of a twenty-year-old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shelley, if you do it again you\u0027re going to your room!\" my mom yells, then places a bowl of her blended food on the table in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelley swipes it on the ground. My mom gasps, then narrows her eyes at Shelley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll deal with it,\" I say, rushing to my sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom has never hit my sister. But my mom\u0027s frustration is in overdrive, which stings just the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t baby her, Brittany,\" Mom says. \"If she doesn\u0027t eat, she\u0027ll be tube fed. Would you like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate when she does this. She\u0027ll talk about the worst possible scenario and not work on fixing what\u0027s wrong. When my sister looks at me, I see the same frustration in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom points her finger at Shelley, then at the food on the floor. \"That\u0027s why I haven\u0027t taken you to a restaurant in months,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, stop,\" I say. \"You don\u0027t need to escalate the situation. She\u0027s already upset. Why make it worse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension starts building, beginning inside my veins and spreading to my fingertips and toes. It bubbles up and bursts with such force I can\u0027t keep it inside any longer. \"This isn\u0027t about you! Why does it always go back to how everything affects you?\" I scream. \"Mom, can\u0027t you see she\u0027s hurting? Instead of yelling at her, why don\u0027t you spend the time figuring out what\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout thinking, I take a washcloth and kneel beside Shelley. I start wiping her pants clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brittany, don\u0027t!\" my mom yells out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t listen. I should have, though, because before I can move away Shelley\u0027s hands go in my hair and she starts pulling. Hard. With all the commotion, I forgot my sister\u0027s new thing is pulling hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow!\" I say. \"Shelley, please stop!\" I\u0027m trying to reach around and push down on her knuckles like her doctor told us to do to make her release her grasp, but it\u0027s no use. I\u0027m in the wrong position, crouched at Shelley\u0027s feet with my body twisted. My mom is swearing, droplets of food are flying, and my scalp feels raw already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelley isn\u0027t loosening her hold, even though my mom is trying to pull her hands away from my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knuckles, Mom!\" I yell, reminding her what Dr. Meir suggested. Holy crap, how much hair has she pulled out? It feels like an entire section of my head is bald.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my reminder, my mom must have pressed hard enough on her knuckles because my hair is released. Either that, or Shelley pulled out whatever chunks she\u0027d grabbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling onto the floor, I immediately put a hand to the back of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelley is smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom is frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd tears come to my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking her to Dr. Meir, right now,\" my mom says, shaking her head at me so I\u0027m aware she\u0027s blaming me for the situation spiraling out of control. \"This has gone on long enough. Brittany, take your father\u0027s car and go to O\u0027Hare to pick him up. His flight comes in at eleven. It\u0027s the least you can do to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 16 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been waiting at the library for an hour. Okay, so it\u0027s been an hour and a half. Before ten, I sat outside on the cement benches. At ten I came inside and stood looking at the display case, pretending to be interested in upcoming library events. I didn\u0027t want to look overly eager to see Brittany. At ten forty-five I sat on the couches in the teen section, reading my chem book. Okay, so my eyes skimmed the pages even if no words registered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it\u0027s eleven. Where is she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could just go hang with my friends. Hell, I should go hang with my friends. But I have a stupid urge to know why Brittany blew me off. I tell myself it\u0027s an ego thing, but in the back of my mind I\u0027m worried about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d hinted, during her freakout in front of the nurse\u0027s office, that her mom isn\u0027t a candidate for a Mother of the Year award. Doesn\u0027t Brittany realize that she\u0027s eighteen now and can leave home if she wanted? If it\u0027s that bad, why stay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause her parents are rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I left home, my new life wouldn\u0027t be so different from my old one. With a girl who lives on the north side, a life lacking designer towels and a maid to pick up after you is probably worse than death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve had enough of standing here waiting for Brittany. I\u0027m going to her house, to confront her on why she ditched me. Without thinking it through, I get on my motorcycle and head to the north side. I know where she lives ... in the big honkin\u0027 white house with pillars flanking the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI park my bike in her driveway and ring her doorbell. I clear my throat so I don\u0027t choke on my words. Mierda, what am I gonna say to her? And why am I feeling all insecure, like I need to impress her because she\u0027ll judge me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody answers. I ring again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere\u0027s a servant or butler to answer the door when you need one? Just as I\u0027m about to give up and slap myself with a big dose of what-the-fuck-do-I-think-I\u0027m-doing, the door opens. Standing before me is an older version of Brittany. Obviously her mom. When she takes one look at me, her disappointing sneer is obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help you?\" she asks with an attitude. I sense either she expects me to be part of the gardening crew or someone going door-to-door harassing people. \"We have a \u0027no soliciting policy\u0027 in this neighborhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m, uh, not here to solicit anythin\u0027. My name\u0027s Alex. I just wanted to know if Brittany was, uh, at home?\" Oh, great. Now I\u0027m mumbling uh\u0027s every two seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Her steely answer matches her steely glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where she went?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Ellis closes the door halfway, probably hoping I won\u0027t peek inside and see her valuables and be tempted to steal them. \"I don\u0027t give out information on the whereabouts of my daughter. Now if you\u0027ll excuse me,\" she says, then closes the door in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m left standing in front of the door like a complete pendejo. For all I know, Brittany was behind the door instructing her mom to get rid of me. I wouldn\u0027t put it past her to play games with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate games I can\u0027t win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk back to my bike with my tail between my legs, wondering if I should feel like a kicked dog or an angry pit bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 17 Brittany\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are the first words my mom asks me after I arrive back home from the airport with my dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a guy from school I\u0027m partnered with for chemistry,\" I answer slowly. Wait one minute. \"How do you know about Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was here after you left for the airport. I sent him away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if my brain is synapsing, reality hits me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot to meet Alex this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt sets in as I think about him waiting for me at the library. I was the one who didn\u0027t trust him to show, but I\u0027m the one who flaked. He must be furious. Ugh, I\u0027m feeling sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want him near the house,\" she says. \"The neighbors will start talking about you.\" Just like they talk about your sister, I know she\u0027s thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day I hope to live in a place where I don\u0027t have to worry about neighbors gossiping. \"Fine,\" I tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you change partners?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mom. I did. Mrs. Peterson refuses to reassign partners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you didn\u0027t try hard enough. I\u0027ll call the school on Monday and make them--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whip my attention to her, ignoring the stinging, throbbing pain in the back of my head from where my sister ripped out the chunk of hair. \"Mom, I\u0027ll handle it. I don\u0027t need you calling the school and making me feel like a two-year-old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did that boy Alex teach you how to talk to your mother without respect? All of a sudden you can open a mouth to me because you\u0027re partnered with that boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish my dad was here to intervene. But he went directly to his study to check his e-mails right after coming home. I wish he\u0027d act as a referee instead of sitting on the sidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because if you start hanging out with trash like that, people will consider you trash. That\u0027s not how your father and I have brought you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no. Here comes the lecture. I\u0027d rather eat live fish, scales and all, than hear this right now. I know the meaning behind her words. Shelley\u0027s not perfect, so I have to be. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-13.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
