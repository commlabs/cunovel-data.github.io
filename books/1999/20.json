She puts her pretty little mouth around them, sucking them, and then I move them to her clit and start working her up more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must be as turned on as I am, because it’s less than a minute later when I feel her start to tighten around my dick. Then she’s crying out in a string of Spanish, and I’m a fucking goner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI come inside her, hot and hard, spurting everything I have, while she tightens around my dick, squeezing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she’s done, she falls forward, head on my chest, but keeps her back arched up, keeping her stomach from touching my tattoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, she moves off me, and my dick slips out, falling heavy against my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, I needed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTru reaches over and turns the lamp off, and then snuggles up to my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my arms around her, pulling her closer. I stroke her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing a kiss to my chest, she says, “I can’t believe you had ‘Tru Love’ tattooed on your stomach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could be worse,” I say. “Tom got ‘Rub the Lamp’ tattooed just above his dick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sputters out a laugh, tilting her head to look up at me. “You’re kidding?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. I just wish I was there tomorrow morning to see his reaction when he wakes up and sees it sober.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Denny? What did he get?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wimped out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So how come you got a sensible one done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because unlike Tom, I can handle my drink, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rests her head back down on my shoulder, fingers tracing close to the tattoo, and whispers, “I love it, Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than you’ll ever fucking know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTRU…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTea or coffee?” I yell to Jake as he showers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coffee,” he calls back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb out of bed, giving morning LA a quick glance through the windows. Another beautiful day. Along with the shopping, I’ve discovered an additional perk to living in LA—the sun is pretty much always shining, even in November.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head into the kitchen, scoop some coffee into the coffeemaker, fill it with water, and turn it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab a chocolate biscuit out of the jar and lean against the counter, nibbling it while I wait for the coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the pile of pizza boxes on the counter near the sink that I had asked Jake to take out to the bin after the guys left last night. He’s such a lazy bum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had Tom, Denny, and Stuart over for dinner. Well, saying we had dinner may be glamming it up a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ordered pizza and ate in the living room while the guys watched football. As expected, I was ignored for the TV, and I ended up bringing my laptop through and sitting at the table, Skyping with Simone, until Denny butted in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s flying to London to see her. I wish I were going. I’ve been thinking of asking Jake when he can next take some time off work so I can visit my folks and London and see Vicky and Simone. I know things are busy for him at the moment. He’s spending a lot of time in the studio recording new stuff, which is great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is their first time recording an album without Jonny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake seems to be doing okay with it. If he’s not, then he’s hiding it really well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up the boxes and take them through the utility and out the side door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warm California air embraces me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might bring my laptop outside and work on the patio today. My column is due in three days, and I haven’t come up with anything yet. Last-minute, that’s me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finish breaking the boxes down and push them in the bin, then head back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coffee is just finishing when I get back. I get two cups out of the cupboard and reach for the milk in the fridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealising I haven’t bought any recently, I check the date on it: 3 November.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check the calendar pinned to the wall: 2 November. Still good for today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unscrew the cap and I’m just about to pour the milk, when it dawns on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting the milk down, I step back and look at the calendar again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday is the second. Next to the second, marked on the third, is “start pill.” That’s my reminder to start my contraceptive pill after my break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe break in which I have my period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe period that hasn’t started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step back from the calendar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest starts to tighten. My head starts to buzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it’ll be fine. I’ve just been under a lot of pressure lately, feeling stressed with one thing and another. That’s what it is. That’s why I haven’t started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back to the counter, I attempt to pour milk into one of the cups, but my hand is shaking so badly I have to put it back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tremors are running all the way down my body. My heart is beating so wildly, I can hear the pulse beating in my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rest my hands on the counter and close my eyes, taking a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never been late before. Never. The pill keeps me regular as clockwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t be pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake doesn’t want kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if hearing my silent call, he walks into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I take that coffee to go, baby? Zane just called; he needs my help with something at the label.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” Forcing my body to work, I reach up for a thermo cup and fill it with coffee and milk, desperately trying to keep the tremor in my hand from showing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I see Jake, perched on a stool, reading something on his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch him for long moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t be pregnant. This can’t be happening. Things are going so well between us. If I’m pregnant, it will break us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can’t have a baby when only one of you wants it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances up at me, catching me staring. A sexy smile spreads on his face. “You enjoying the view?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing a smile, I walk toward him. “As always.” I put the cup down before him on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe catches hold of my retreating hand and pulls me into his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuzzling my neck, he says, “I love the smell of me on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had sex first thing this morning. We always have sex. And I’m pregnant. Maybe. Possibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need a shower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.” He chuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I didn’t mean it like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what you meant,” he says, lifting his head to stare into my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly feel exposed. What if he can see it in my eyes. Closing them, I lean in and kiss his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to lose him when he finds out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t panic until you know for certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake’s hands start wandering, and I can feel his kiss deepening, his erection growing through his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching his hand on my ass, breaking the kiss, I say, “I thought you needed to get to the label.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you more,” he growls, lips attacking my neck, hand going straight to my breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t have sex right now. Anything but sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You had me half an hour ago, and isn’t Zane waiting for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pauses and looks me in the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never dissuade Jake from sex. Never. He’ll know there’s something wrong with me. But right now I can’t find the will to care about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I wearing you out?” he asks, softly, stroking his fingers along my jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m fine.” I smile. “I like you wearing me out. I’m just trying to be the level-headed one out of the two of us, and you’ve got to get to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move away from him under the pretence of getting my coffee. The truth is I can’t even stomach the thought of drinking it. My stomach is roiling with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold the cup in my hands, resting it against my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake gets to his feet, picking up his to-go cup. “Don’t forget, we’ve got dinner with Smith and Carly tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. That’s the last thing I want to do tonight. Not with what I have on my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” I smile. “Looking forward to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you’ll get on well with Carly. Be good for you to make some girlfriends here, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” I say, smiling again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese smiles feel so insincere, I’m pretty sure my face is going to crack under the strain of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been talking to Tom and Denny these last few days,” Jake says, coming around the counter, “about asking Smith to become a permanent member of TMS.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” I say, totally taken by surprise. I never thought Jake would consider it. I’m so happy he has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He won’t replace Jonny, of course. But Tom and Den are on board with it. He’s a great guy who fits in well with us, and I hate to lose him to another band.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is someone trying to poach him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that I know of, but he’s making a name for himself in the music world now, so it’s only a matter of time. What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants my opinion. I love that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking to him, putting my arms around his waist, I say, “I think it’s a brilliant idea. Smith will be over the moon when you ask him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrushing my hair back, he tucks it behind my ear. “You don’t think I’m being disloyal to Jonny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the downturn of his lips, and it makes my chest hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “No, I don’t. I don’t think Jonny would either. You’re doing what’s best for the band. TMS meant everything to Jonny. He would want you guys to carry on, and do what you felt was right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closes his eyes briefly and presses a kiss to my forehead. “I guess I’ll speak to him today,” he says against my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we’ll be celebrating tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he says yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll say yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting his fingers under my chin, tilting my head back, he presses a firm kiss to my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be home at seven, so make sure you are well on your way to being ready. I know how long it takes you to get dressed for a night out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI muster up the energy to give him a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. Making for the door, he looks over his shoulder at me. “Later. Love you, beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Love you too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant he’s gone, I sag back against the counter, gripping it for support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I going to do if I’m pregnant? A termination isn’t even an option for me. But Jake won’t want the baby. He’ll say he does for me. Or maybe he won’t. Maybe when reality hits, he’ll realise just how much he doesn’t want a baby and he’ll leave me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to know if I am pregnant. Today. Now. I can’t keep running the maybes around in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so overtaken with nervous energy and the need to know, I don’t even bother to shower. I pull on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my sunglasses and one of Jake’s baseball caps and put them on. I look a complete twat, but I don’t want to get recognised buying a pregnancy test, so the twat look it is. Unfortunately, being Jake’s wife-to-be gets me recognised a lot lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my phone and handbag, the keys for Jake’s other car, the Vanquish, and I head for the garage. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wethering-the-storm-the-storm-2/page-20.html","bookId":1999,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:55 PM"}
