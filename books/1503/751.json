But Palace Master, have you thought about it? Why did this Zhou Weiqing try to hide his power so much? Moreover, none of us were able to detect it. Why is that, and what was the technique used back then? Even a Heavenly God expert’s aura was suppressed by him.

You are the Xuantian Palace Lord and can’t act so rashly. Carefully reconsider, our action is necessary due to the overall situation. Moreover, we are only keeping Shangguan Bing’er under house arrest. This is only something the people sitting here know about. \u0026nbsp;There’s no way Zhou Weiqing can know.

We old men all remember that Zhou Weiqing has saved our lives and we are not the type to show ingratitude to a friend. However, we must think of the palace before all else. \u0026nbsp;We have lost six elders, a terrible loss.

Even though the more powerful dragon was killed, there was still another one alive.
