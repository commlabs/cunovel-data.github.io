Now we can forget the happy voices and the smiles and laughs we\u0027ve put on just for their sake. Now Liz and I can sit down together and try and get our heads around what\u0027s going on here. There\u0027s no point involving the children in any of this. What good would it do? If we can\u0027t work it out, what chance have they got? Better that they remain ignorant and happy. Ed\u0027s starting to suspect something\u0027s wrong but the little two are blissfully unaware. I wish I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve been sat watching the headlines go round on a loop for about twenty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This is different tonight,\u0027 she says. \u0027It\u0027s changed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s changed?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The news. They\u0027ve stopped telling us what\u0027s happened. You keep watching and you\u0027ll see what I mean. All they\u0027re doing now is trying to tell us how to deal with things.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right. There\u0027s been a definite shift in the focus of the TV news channel we\u0027re watching tonight and I hadn\u0027t picked up on it until Liz pointed it out. Until now there\u0027s been a steady stream of reports about individual attacks and major incidents but all of that has now stopped. Now all that\u0027s been broadcast is little more than a series of instructions. They\u0027re not telling us anything we haven\u0027t already heard - stay away from people you don\u0027t know, stay at home if possible, watch out for erratic and irrational behaviour and alert the authorities if trouble breaks out, that sort of thing. It\u0027s all straightforward, common-sense stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Probably not worth wasting time reporting on everything that\u0027s happening,\u0027 she says. \u0027One fight in the street\u0027s pretty much the same as the next.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know,\u0027 I agree. \u0027There\u0027s still something else missing though, isn\u0027t there?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Like what?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If you listen to what they\u0027re saying, they\u0027re still telling us that everything\u0027s under control and the problem\u0027s contained but...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But what?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But no-one\u0027s coming up with any explanations. No-one\u0027s even making any attempt to explain what\u0027s happening. That tells me they\u0027re either keeping something from us or...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No-one\u0027s managed to work it out yet,\u0027 she interrupts before I\u0027ve had chance to finish my sentence. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-18.html","bookId":2555,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM"}
