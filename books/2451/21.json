I ask the others, as we run, if they have an idea of the layout of the complex, if they\u0027ve seen more of it than I have. They all reply negatively. Mark has been to a lab that the rest of us haven\u0027t visited, but it wasn\u0027t far from zom HQ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always assumed we were underground,\" Tiberius says, \"because of the lack of daylight. But that\u0027s not necessarily the case. We might simply be in the middle of a huge building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Peder says. \"I once heard a soldier grumbling about being stuck down here. Reilly told him to shut up - I don\u0027t think they were supposed to mention anything about where we are - but it was too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I guess we need to head for the top,\" I grunt. \"Let\u0027s look for stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe push open every door that we pass and peer through every window. In the dark glass of one pane I catch sight of my reflection and pause. There\u0027s a small red z on my right cheek. I frown, wondering how it got there. Then I recall the clown stroking my face. Shivering, I wipe the mark from my flesh and hurry on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here!\" Cathy shouts. She\u0027s looking through a round panel of glass in a door. I press up beside her and spot a flight of stairs. I shake the door but it\u0027s locked. There\u0027s a control panel beside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time to test our toys,\" I grin tightly. \"Gokhan, you first. They usually press their fingers to the sensor before scanning their eye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGokhan holds Dr. Cerveris\u0027s fingers up to the panel. There\u0027s a small beeping noise. I open my hand and reveal the eye. I roll it in my palm until it\u0027s pointing the right way, then rest it in front of the retinal scanner. I have no confidence that it will work now that it\u0027s been ripped from its socket, but to my delight there\u0027s a second beep and the door slides open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eye, eye!\" Tiberius snickers, slipping past me and jogging up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s only a single flight of steps. Seconds later we\u0027re on a higher floor, identical to the one below, so we go looking for an exit or the next set of stairs. There are zombies loose on this level too, but they don\u0027t interfere with us. They shoot us dark looks and sniff the air hungrily when they catch our scent, but when they realize we\u0027re not walking snack boxes, they leave us be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe find another set of stairs and climb, this time up three levels. Once again we search for a way out. But after a couple of minutes Mark looks through an open door and does a double take. \"What the hell...?\" he mutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worm!\" Cathy barks. \"This is no time for - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh!\" he snaps, and the look on his face tells us this is serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, we crowd around Mark and gape, slack jawed, at the hellish drama unfurling within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a massive room, the largest I\u0027ve seen in the complex. Judging by the TV sets hanging from the walls, I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s a relaxation area, a much grander version of zom HQ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite a lot of the staff are here, shoved up against one of the walls. They\u0027re surrounded by snapping, howling zombies. But the living dead are only occasionally attacking. They\u0027re being held in check by a team of people in hoodies. The zombie masters have wrinkled flesh, an ugly mass of purple patches and pustulant, peeling skin. They have pale yellow eyes, and if their hoodies slipped I know we\u0027d see crops of unhealthy gray hair. I also know that they have no fingernails and their tongues are scabby and shriveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re the mutants I saw in my school, and before that on a visit to the Imperial War Museum. They were controlling zombies the last time I saw them, and they\u0027re in command now too, directing the reviveds with blasts of the whistles that hang on strings from the neck of each mutant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the mutants and zombies is the clown, Mr. Dowling. He towers above the rest of them, which is strange, as I didn\u0027t think he was unusually tall when I saw him in my cell. Glancing down, I see that he\u0027s on stilts, balanced elegantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Dowling is waving his hands above his head, swaying gently, beaming insanely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" one of the mutants croaks at the weeping, moaning humans huddled against the wall. \"Sing or we\u0027ll set the doggies on you again. Sing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other mutants take up the refrain and start to bellow, \"Sing! Sing! Sing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Dowling giggles shrilly and twirls his arms like an orchestra conductor. The soldiers, scientists and nurses begin to chant together, having obviously been told what to sing before we hit the scene. They\u0027re out of tune, and not all in sync, but the song is unmistakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jingle bells, jingle bells,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJingle all the way,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh what fun it is to ride\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a one-horse open sleigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mutants screech with delight and clap enthusiastically. Mr. Dowling sighs happily and cups his hands to his heart, then wipes a finger across his cheeks as if to remove tears of joy. A couple of zombies dart forward and drag humans from the crowd. They carve their skulls open and tuck in. The survivors sing another creepy chorus of \"Jingle Bells\" at the rough prompting of the mutants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the doomed humans are singing, Mr. Dowling points at a woman and beckons her forward. She shakes her head, terrified, tears coursing down her cheeks. The clown frowns, then draws a finger across his throat. One of the mutants blows his whistle and a zombie drags the woman out and tears into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Dowling smiles and points to another woman. This one hurries forward, not even waiting for him to beckon. When she\u0027s in front of him, his smile widens and he bends over and opens his lips. I expect a stream of spiders to come spilling out, but this time he reaches into his mouth and pulls out a scorpion. It\u0027s alive and twisting wildly in his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clown puts a finger to the woman\u0027s lips and taps them. With a gulp, she opens her mouth. He sticks his tongue out, then nods at her to do the same. With a delirious giggle, he lays the scorpion on her tongue, then nods for her to close her mouth. With fresh tears, she obeys his command, then falls away a moment later, coughing and choking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mutants cackle and kick the woman. The zombies hiss and a few more dart into the fray and emerge clutching struggling, screaming humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Mr. Dowling\u0027s head turns and he trains his gaze on us. No... not on us... on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no doubt in my mind that he\u0027s looking at me specifically. His eyes burn into mine and his lips twitch as if he\u0027s just spotted a dear friend. When the mutants see us, they squeal and dart towards us, dragging zombies with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Dowling makes a high whining noise and they stop instantly. As they retreat, he extends a hand towards me, turns it upside down, then slowly crooks his middle finger, beckoning me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even in your sodding dreams!\" I scream, then whirl and race away, not caring if the others follow, not worrying about the direction I\u0027m taking, knowing only that I have to get far away from the clown as quickly as possible, before he takes me into his embrace and turns me into something even worse than one of the walking, undead damned. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-21.html","bookId":2451,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:37 PM"}
