They must, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” I say. “The people who run the scopes have reported that the buildings down there are all sorts of colors. They must like to decorate the way that we do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePen seems satisfied with this. She blows on the tip of her pen stone and draws the princess falling from the clock tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTentatively, I peer into my brother’s bunk room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice has gone to the helm to try to help with the efforts, and Lex is sitting alone on the mattress, his fingers tracing the raised letters on a roll of paper from his transcriber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips stop moving when he hears me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you through being angry with me?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you through making foolish decisions that could get you killed?” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re in a metal bird that’s set to be hurtling toward the ground soon.” There’s a laugh in my voice. “What could be more foolish than that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes a small tear in the page to mark his place, and then he rolls the paper and sets it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry if I scared you when I snuck off, Lex, truly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunts, but the raised corner of his mouth is more of a smile than he gives me on good days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve brought you something,” I say. I sit next to him and begin tying the scrap of white cloth around his wrist. “I’m wearing one, too,” I say as I finish the knot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe runs his fingers over the frayed edges of the fabric. “For Mom and Dad, then,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraditionally, family members and exceptionally close friends would cut a strip of fabric from the deceased’s clothing and wear it in remembrance. “I know we’re supposed to make these after the ashes have been thrown to the tributary,” I say, “but we aren’t going to have that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you use?” Lex asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The shirtsleeve from my uniform.” Another piece of my life I’m grieving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLex is still for a while, and I begin to wonder if I’ve done the wrong thing in tying the fabric around his wrist. Maybe I’ve forced my grief on him, and he doesn’t want to share it with me. He does seem adamant about moving on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he puts his arm around my shoulders and squeezes me close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of us have words for this loss. We expected to say good-bye to our parents the way our world dictates, years from now when we were prepared. But our world turned out not to be what was promised to us. There will be no ashes thrown to the tributary. There will be no festival of stars with our paper desires burning in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur parents are gone now. Our home, where we teased each other and squabbled as we grew, is out of reach. It is only Lex and me, escaping the city that wants us dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the fabric that’s around my wrist. “I never properly thanked you for saving me after I was poisoned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No thanks necessary,” he says. “Just repay me by staying alive, if it isn’t too much to ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m about to tell him that he has a deal, but I don’t get the chance. The bird jolts sharply in one direction, then the other, and I careen into the wall with Lex still holding on to my shoulder. The lantern is swinging dangerously overhead. The next jolt extinguishes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do my best to stay close to the wall. “What’s happening?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could be anything,” Lex says. He doesn’t sound at all worried, and I’m not sure whether he truly believes we’ll be all right, or he’s just content to die here if the alternative would be capture by the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morgan!” Basil is shouting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay wherever you are,” I call back. “It isn’t safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the doorway of the bunk room, there’s nothing but darkness and the sound of gears whining and hissing. All of the lanterns have blown out. Small metal plinking sounds make me fear the worst: that the bolts are coming undone and we’re being crushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI prop my leg against the adjacent wall for traction, grateful these bunk rooms are so tiny. Why, with all of the planning that went into this bird, did no one fashion something for us to hold on to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercifully, the bird eventually goes still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLex stirs in the darkness. “Are you hurt?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say. “But the lanterns blew out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t light them yet,” Lex says. “It might not be safe. We’re still moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s right. I can feel a pull. “We’re still spinning a bit, aren’t we?” I say. “And sinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We must be in the swallows,” Lex says. “The bird hasn’t been crushed by the weight of the churning dirt yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re trying to make me feel better, I’d much prefer you stop,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the calm has gone on a while longer, I relight the lantern. I hear murmurs down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Basil?” I call. “Pen? Alice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dim glow forms in the bunk room across the hall. Alice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sphere of light flickers up the stairwell as Basil and Pen find us. “I should go see if the professor needs help with the gears,” Basil says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful,” I say, raising my cheek to accept his kiss as he passes me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my head in time to see Alice’s worried expression before she smiles at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePen’s hands are shaking as she smoothes her map against the wall and studies it. “I suppose I was wrong,” she says. Her voice is tight. “We’ve reached the swallows sooner than I thought.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s almost over,” Amy says. I raise the lantern to better see her. Despite the weariness left over from her ordeal, her face is alight. “We’ll be in the sky in moments.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nobody knows how deep the swallows run,” Pen says. “It might just give us a boost before we hit more solid ground. It might still be a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t,” Amy says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know that. No one knows that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI note the hysteria in her voice. “Pen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chews on her trembling knuckle. There are tears in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone alive?” Judas calls from the bird’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Barely,” Pen says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on up if you all want to see something you’ll never forget,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor as long as we may have left to live, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone on the bird gathers at the helm with the professor: my brother and Alice, Pen, Basil, Judas, Amy, and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePen is still shaking, though it’s nearly imperceptible, and with all the excitement no one else seems to notice. She has always had the cool head, and to see her coming undone makes me somewhat nauseous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the window at the helm, I can see the dirt churning furiously. There’s a story I read years ago; in it, a castle stood beside something called a waterfall. I wasn’t quite able to picture it then, but now I can see that the water must have been like this—restless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this ‘something’ we’ll never forget?” I ask, holding up my lantern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve reached the bottom of the swallows,” the professor says, not turning away from his controls. He rubs at his chin, and I can hear the scrape of his white stubble. “We’ve hit some solid ground. I suspect we’re a hundred or so paces from the sky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t quite believe the words, and yet something within me must, because my palms are sweaty and there’s a chill at the back of my neck. Whether we’re to soar across the sky or sink through it like a rock, it’s only a matter of moments. I’m working my way through varying degrees of panic, and I want to yell for us to stop. I want to undo this journey and return home, even if it’s to an empty apartment. But I know that is only the fear and the grief talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Pen has gone white beside me. “I don’t want to go,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no turning back now,” the professor says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to touch her shoulder, but she pushes away, takes a step for the doorway. Even her curls are trembling. “Let me out of this thing. I don’t care what they do to me. I’ll go to trial for what I did to the prince. I could live the rest of my life as an irrational, I don’t care, so long as I can stay in the sky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set down the lantern and reach for her again, and this time I make fists around her hands. “Pen, listen—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t leave. And my mother, I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring my forehead close to hers. “Pen, if we got out of this thing here, it wouldn’t be possible to dig our way back up to the surface. We would be buried in an instant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meant to console her, but my words cause me to feel trapped. No matter; Pen has always been my strength and this is my time to return the favor. “Here,” I say, and dab at her runny nose with my sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thomas,” she says miserably. “He won’t even know what’s happened to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s nothing I can say to make this better. I’m not surprised that she’s letting it show how much she cares for him, after a lifetime of hiding it; there’s something about imminent death that makes all the threads weave into a picture like one of my mother’s samplers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we must be brave, remember?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, watching her tears fall onto her betrothal band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next violent jolt has Basil at my side. He surprises me by putting an arm around Pen as well as me. He’s never been very familiar with her, but now we have our fear in common. We are all part of this floating city we’ll never see again. This city I love so much that I fear I’ll cease to exist once I’m off it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI steady the lantern between my feet to keep it from sliding. We stay huddled together as the bird struggles to burrow the rest of the way to the sky. We count the seconds until our little world is lost to us for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have any visions about this?” Judas asks Amy over the incessant noise of the levers and the bird struggling its way through the last of the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A dream,” Amy says. “And you don’t want to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t take stock in that,” I whisper to Pen, whose sobs have lost their sound. I do wish she’d be calm. I can’t bear to see her in such pain. I would hijack the helm and claw this bird up to the surface to take her home if I could. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-ruin-the-internment-chronicles-1/page-42.html","bookId":1764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:38 AM"}
