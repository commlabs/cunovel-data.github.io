I listened to the sounds of silence echo through the shaft. I looked down at the place where Macey and I had left our disguises earlier that night—at the place where no wigs, no glasses, no trace of the girls we\u0027d been earlier that night remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s here,\" Liz said. \"She can\u0027t be…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me.\" Mr. Solomon\u0027s voice was steady as he sat on the coffee table in front of the leather couch in my mother\u0027s office. I didn\u0027t look around the room. I didn\u0027t listen as my mother spoke on one phone and my aunt on another. I didn\u0027t watch Liz and Bex as they sat in the window seat, answering questions from Buckingham and Mr. Smith. It was the quietest chaos I\u0027d ever seen or heard, so I just sat there, trying to keep my tired mind from drifting too far down that empty passageway, chasing after Macey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne floor below us, girls were gathering for Saturday morning breakfast; up in the suites, half the junior class was probably sleeping in. The news about Macey hadn\u0027t spread yet, but it would…and I knew it was up to the people in my mother\u0027s office to make sure it didn\u0027t spread too far; so maybe that\u0027s why Joe Solomon looked at me as if we were the only two people in the room—the school. His world wasn\u0027t falling apart. He was going to hold it together—I could hold it together. I just had to…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me everything, Ms. Morgan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last time I saw her was last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At eight forty-seven p.m. last night we were in town…at the football game,\" I admitted, expecting him to shout or at least look confused, but Joe Solomon isn\u0027t one of the best covert operatives in the world for nothing, so he just nodded and told me to go on. \"And we saw Zach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was my overactive imagination, but I could have sworn that that made Mr. Solomon blink. I thought about the way he and Zach had rendezvoused in the train tunnel in Philadelphia. A dozen questions sprung to mind, but as badly as I wanted answers, I wanted Macey back more. So I said, \"Do you want it verbatim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to appreciate the offer but shook his head. \"Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach and I were talking about the Circle of Cavan—I figured it out, you know. From the ring and the sword?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I knew you would. Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macey overheard us. She didn\u0027t know she was related to Gilly. She wanted to know if that was why she was admitted here. She didn\u0027t know about any of it until then, and so she…ran. It was loud and crowded and I lost her.\" I couldn\u0027t look at him. \"I\u0027m supposed to be a pavement artist, and I lost her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what she does, Ms. Morgan.\" Mr. Solomon\u0027s eyes found mine, but there was a change in him somehow. \"Running,\" he added. \"Of course, technically, her pattern is to do something to get kicked out, but that\u0027s not an option now, so she\u0027s taken matters into her own hands. Do you know what I\u0027m saying, Ms. Morgan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sadly, I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes people run… to see if you\u0027ll come after them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve seen Joe Solomon every school day for more than a year, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever really know him. There are times when he\u0027s one of the strongest people I\u0027ve ever known, and then there are moments—like that one—when I think he might be broken, deep down, in a place that will never mend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then just like that, he became my teacher again. \"Is anything missing from your room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped for a second, closed my eyes, and visualized the space. \"Her passport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No clothes? No money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has fourteen different credit cards and knows all the numbers by heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Solomon looked as if he wanted to smile, as if he wanted to laugh. \"She also has the most famous face in the country right now, Ms. Morgan,\" he told me, not a hint of worry in his voice. \"I think we can track her down.\" But then he read my expression, and the smile slid from his lips. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said slowly, \"remember how we had that disguise class?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t time for yelling. It wasn\u0027t the place for mother-daughter lessons in regret. As our teachers huddled around us, I gave them details of the items Macey had taken with her. When I finished, my mother shook her head and started for the phone. Unfortunately, Aunt Abby wasn\u0027t as easily distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what I did,\" I said before my aunt could utter a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" There was something deeper in her eyes. She wasn\u0027t just Aunt Abby then; she was more than Macey\u0027s protector; for a split second she was the woman on the train, but then—just as quickly—that woman was gone. \"You went into town alone and…and now, come Tuesday, we are going to have to produce Macey McHenry, and if we can\u0027t, every agent in the Secret Service and half the FBI is going to descend upon this mansion, Cameron, and I don\u0027t know if even your mother can keep them out. They\u0027re going to pull back carpets and knock down doors until they track Macey\u0027s every step, and in the process, they might take my head for good measure. And meanwhile, she\u0027s—\" Abby placed a hand on her hip, and for the first time, I saw a holster. Like smoke and fire, I knew that somewhere there was a gun. \"She\u0027s out there. She\u0027s goodness only knows—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New York!\" Buckingham shouted and banged down a phone. \"A young woman matching Macey\u0027s description purchased a bus ticket to New York last night. And someone using one of Macey\u0027s mother\u0027s business accounts reserved a private jet to Switzerland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby looked at me. \"Her family has a house there,\" I said. \"It fits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom turned to Buckingham. \"We have alumni in Switzerland?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" was Buckingham\u0027s reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have them sit on her until we can get a grab team in place.\" Professor Buckingham turned to go, but Mom called after her. \"And Patricia, tell them she\u0027s a hard target. Tell them she\u0027s one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have given anything for Macey to have heard that. Maybe then she would have believed me. Maybe then she wouldn\u0027t have run away. Maybe then things would have been very different. But Macey didn\u0027t hear, and that was the problem. She was half a world away. On her own. And one look at my mother\u0027s worried eyes told me that we probably weren\u0027t the only ones looking for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Abby bolted for the door, Bex, Liz, and I rushed after\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do we leave?\" Bex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We aren\u0027t going anywhere,\" Abby snapped. Through the windows I could see that a chopper was already spinning its blades, waiting for her. She rushed toward the staircase, but then stopped short. \"She\u0027ll be okay, you know.\" For a second, Abby was her old self as she cocked a hip. \"Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, scientifically speaking, that all days have twenty-four hours. One thousand four hundred and forty minutes. Eighty- six thousand, four hundred seconds. But even Liz admitted that the days that followed seemed longer, as we stared out every window we passed, expecting the gates to swing open, to see Aunt Abby and Macey coming down the lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the gates stayed closed. The lane stayed empty. And Macey stayed gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Monday night, a feeling was resurfacing inside of me like a virus that had been dormant for years, as I thought about when my parents would go away for days or weeks on end; before the days when I knew my father wasn\u0027t coming back at all. Walking downstairs for supper, I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that I\u0027m really great at disappearing, but Macey might have been a whole different kind of gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops, sorry,\" someone said, just as I looked up to see Tina Walters running up the stairs. The sign above the Grand Hall told me we were going to be conversing that night in Portuguese; the aromas that filled the foyer told me we were having lasagna. But something in the way Tina looked at me told me that none of the junior class was feeling very hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay, Cam?\" she asked, and I nodded, but for some reason I couldn\u0027t move out of her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tina, have you …\" I started, then paused because I honestly couldn\u0027t quite believe what I was about to ask. \"Have your sources heard anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted her to tell me that Macey was okay. I would have settled for a crazy story about a girl matching Macey\u0027s description who had been staking out an ex-KGB hitman in Bucharest. I needed anything but the sight of Tina shaking her head and saying, \"Not a word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled sympathetically. \"But no news can be good news, right?\" she asked. \"Everyone\u0027s looking for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I looked up into the Hall of History, all I could do was stare at the sword that still stood gleaming inside its case, a sharp blade cutting through time, and whisper, \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m an expert on hiding. Not to brag, but it\u0027s true, and as I sat staring at my plate that night, something about Macey\u0027s disappearance didn\u0027t make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both disguises,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Bex asked, leaning closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both disguises were gone when we went back—the one she wore and the one I wore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Bex grinned at me. \"You thinking what I\u0027m thinking?\" she asked, and in a flash we were running up the stairs, Liz trailing along behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hall of History was dim. My mother\u0027s office door was closed, but I didn\u0027t slow down until Madame Dabney appeared out of nowhere, firmly blocking my path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see my mom,\" I blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Cammie dear, I\u0027m afraid your mother isn\u0027t here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I need to see her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t doubt that, but given recent circumstances, the headmistress has gone to see Senator and Mrs. McHenry to explain why their daughter might be…delayed … in attending the campaign\u0027s watch party tomorrow night. That is, if we get her back from Switzerland in time at all,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Dabney added just as Bex and I lurched forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Macey\u0027s not in Switzerland!\" we blurted at the exact same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Dabney stopped. She turned. \"Why do you say this? What do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well…\" Bex and Liz and I glanced at each other. \"It\u0027s just that she took both disguises. And you\u0027ve been looking for her in Switzerland for three days. I think the reason no one has found her is because she isn\u0027t there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cameron, dear, I understand your concern, but a girl fitting Macey\u0027s description took a private plane to Switzerland—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But—\" I started, but Madame Dabney didn\u0027t let me finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her passport was booked through. She\u0027s there, ladies.\" Madame Dabney patted my arm. \"She\u0027s there. And I don\u0027t want you to worry. We\u0027ll find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking upstairs to our suite, I couldn\u0027t help but think that either Macey deserved to be called a Gallagher Girl or she didn\u0027t; that she was either good enough or she wasn\u0027t. We couldn\u0027t have it both ways, no matter what our faculty seemed to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed the door behind us and looked at Bex. \"If you\u0027re Macey, what do you do?\" I asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-25.html","bookId":2748,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM"}
